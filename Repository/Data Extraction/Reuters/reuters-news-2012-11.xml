			Portola, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer Sign Clinical Collaboration 
      Agreement to Study ELIQUIS&#174; and Portola&#8217;s 
      Universal Factor Xa Inhibitor Antidote PRT4445
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bristol-Myers 
      Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) and Pfizer 
      Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced a clinical collaboration agreement 
      to conduct a proof-of-concept study of PRT4445 and the investigational 
      oral Factor Xa inhibitor ELIQUIS&#174; (apixaban). PRT4445 is a 
      universal Factor Xa inhibitor antidote in clinical development designed 
      to reverse the anticoagulant activity of any Factor Xa inhibitor. No 
      agents are approved to reverse the activity of Factor Xa inhibitors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The collaboration will be in effect during the clinical proof-of-concept 
      study, which is anticipated to start by the end of this year. The study 
      is designed to demonstrate the safety of PRT4445 and its ability to 
      reverse the anticoagulation activity of ELIQUIS and other Factor Xa 
      inhibitors, including betrixaban, Portola&#8217;s Phase 3 oral Factor Xa 
      inhibitor. Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer will make an undisclosed cash 
      payment to Portola upon initiation of the proof-of-concept study with 
      ELIQUIS and will provide development and regulatory guidance for the 
      study. Portola retains 100 percent global development and 
      commercialization rights for PRT4445.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Oral Factor Xa inhibitors address an important unmet need for patients 
      requiring anticoagulant therapy, but as with all anticoagulants, there 
      is a need for an antidote to help manage the concerns physicians have 
      around infrequent but serious bleeding events.&#8221; said William Lis, chief 
      executive officer of Portola. &#8220;This clinical collaboration brings 
      together world-class expertise in the field of thrombosis from 
      Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer and Portola with the goal of accelerating 
      the development of PRT4445 as an antidote to ELIQUIS, while allowing 
      Portola to retain all rights to develop and commercialize the compound 
      in the future.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Patient safety and improved patient outcomes have guided our clinical 
      development program for ELIQUIS, including our efforts to identify a 
      reversal agent for urgent clinical situations,&#8221; said Brian Daniels, 
      senior vice president, Global Development and Medical Affairs, 
      Bristol-Myers Squibb. &#8220;With our partner Pfizer, we look forward to 
      working with Portola to advance the scientific understanding of the role 
      of PRT4445 as a potential antidote for ELIQUIS.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Major bleeding events occur infrequently in patients taking Factor Xa 
      inhibitors (1-4% per year in clinical studies) and standard measures are 
      employed to manage these events. Development of an agent specifically 
      designed to reverse the activity of Factor Xa inhibitors may provide an 
      antidote for patients who, in rare instances, experience an uncontrolled 
      major bleeding event or require emergency surgery.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About PRT4445
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PRT4445 is a novel recombinant protein being developed to address 
      serious, uncontrolled bleeding by reversing the anticoagulant activity 
      of Factor Xa inhibitors and low molecular weight heparins in Factor Xa 
      inhibitor-treated patients experiencing uncontrolled major bleeding or 
      requiring emergency surgery. PRT4445 is a modified version of human 
      Factor Xa designed to sequester direct inhibitors (apixaban, betrixaban, 
      rivaroxaban), thereby allowing native Factor Xa to restore hemostasis. 
      In addition, PRT4445 can reduce the Xa inhibition properties of 
      anti-thrombin dependent inhibitors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Portola has presented nonclinical data on PRT4445 at multiple major 
      scientific conferences and has shown reductions in bleeding in animal 
      models with enoxaparin, fondaparinux and rivaroxaban. Additional in vivo 
      and in vitro data have shown that PRT4445 has the potential to act as a 
      universal antidote for the class of direct Factor Xa inhibitors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About ELIQUIS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ELIQUIS is the approved trade name for apixaban in Europe and the 
      proposed trade name in the U.S. ELIQUIS is not approved for the 
      prevention of stroke or systemic embolism in patients with atrial 
      fibrillation in any country. In May 2011, Bristol-Myers Squibb and 
      Pfizer announced the first regulatory approval for ELIQUIS in the 27 
      countries of the European Union plus Iceland and Norway for the 
      prevention of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in adult patients who 
      have undergone elective hip or knee replacement surgery.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer continue to progress the ELIQUIS 
      application for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation based on the 
      ARISTOTLE and AVERROES studies. On September 21, 2012, Bristol-Myers 
      Squibb and Pfizer Inc. announced that the Committee for Medicinal 
      Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) 
      adopted a positive opinion recommending that ELIQUIS be granted approval 
      for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients 
      with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and with one or more risk factors 
      for stroke. On September 26, 2012, The U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
      (FDA) acknowledged receipt of the ELIQUIS (apixaban) New Drug 
      Application (NDA) resubmission to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic 
      embolism in adult patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. The FDA 
      has deemed the resubmission a complete response to its June 22, 2012 
      Complete Response Letter (CRL) that requested additional information on 
      data management and verification from the ARISTOTLE trial. The FDA 
      Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date is March 17, 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ELIQUIS is also being investigated in Phase 3 trials for the treatment 
      of VTE.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Days after launching Windows 8, Microsoft Corp is mounting a strong campaign to win over the software developers it needs to kick-start its new operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lack of apps is Microsoft's Achilles heel as it attempts to catch Apple Inc and Google Inc in the rush toward mobile computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 8, the new Surface tablet and a range of Windows-based phones - all unveiled in the past week - are designed to close that gap, but the world's largest software company still needs to convince developers to recreate the thriving 'ecosystem' that made PCs so successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Please go out and write lots of applications," Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer pleaded with 2,000 developers on Tuesday, kicking off an annual, four-day meeting at its campus near Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event, called 'Build,' is the equivalent of Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference and Google's I/O event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft gave each paying attendee one of its Surface tablets and 100 gigabytes of free space on its SkyDrive online storage service. On top of that, handset partner Nokia threw in a free Lumia 920 smartphone running Windows Phone 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unprecedentedly generous give-away signals the intent of what Microsoft openly calls "evangelism." Most developers at the meeting, who paid up to $2,000 to attend, are already converted to the Windows religion. But this year there is a feeling that Microsoft can re-establish itself as a relevant platform for developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The sessions are overflowing. Everybody wants to learn," said Greg Lutz, product manager at development tools company ComponentOne, who is attending the conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Surface is really exciting. It's been interesting to see people that would normally be critics of Microsoft surprised to see how good it is," said Lutz, whose company makes features that developers can use in apps, such as calendars or charts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft recognizes it needs apps to flesh out its new online Windows Store and make Windows 8 machines more attractive to users, said Russ Whitman, chief strategy officer at Ratio Interactive, a design agency that helps companies create apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The catalog (of apps) is where they are weak, there's no doubt," he said. "But if Microsoft stays focused on quality not quantity, they can win."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEVELOPER DOUBTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Windows 8 launched on Friday, some major content providers had prominent apps in the Windows store, such as Netflix Inc, the New York Times and Rovio's Angry Birds Space. But big names such as Facebook and Twitter were missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter moved to rectify that on Tuesday, announcing that a native Windows app would be rolled out "in the months ahead." Dropbox, a fast-growing cloud storage service, also announced it would soon have a Windows app, as did online payment firm PayPal and sports network ESPN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Facebook, which now has more than 1 billion users, has not yet made public any plans for a Windows app, despite the fact Microsoft is a minor shareholder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Microsoft still has to overcome indifference from many developers who do not see demand from users or simply do not have the resources to build Windows apps alongside iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Windows 8 is getting good reviews and the tile user interface is a great fit with our geo-visual content," said Jason Karas, CEO at website Trover, where users can share photos of interesting discoveries. "It's on the roadmap for Trover, but we are still a very lean team, so we're hesitant to support a third platform until we have all the innovations we want to see in iPhone and Android in place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has yet to persuade other influential online services, for example car-rental firm Zipcar or real estate information firm Zillow, to develop for Windows 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get more developers on board, Microsoft is spending this week demonstrating how it is making it easier to develop apps for Windows and get them into the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key part of that is a new set of tools tying in its Azure cloud service, which allows Windows apps to easily harness data stored in remote servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some of the new changes are pretty incredible and are going to make developing, especially some of the mobile apps, much easier," said Mike Cousins, a software developer following the conference by webcast from Calgary, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It just makes it super-easy to integrate mobile clients into your application," said Cousins, who is developing Shuttr, a site for photographers to display and sell their work. "It's been reduced from probably a week's work to minutes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;400 MILLION NEW MACHINES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's best argument to developers is the sheer size of the Windows user base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft sold 4 million upgrades to Windows 8 in its first four days, a mere fraction of the 670 million or so machines running Windows 7. Ballmer said there would be 400 million new devices running Windows next year, including PCs, tablets and phones, and the company would be marketing heavily to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is an attractive audience for developers, and Whitman at Ratio Interactive said he saw many new faces at Microsoft's event this week who previously were more interested in web-based apps and other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a new generation of developers that can build on Windows 8 that have been building using JavaScript and HTML," he said. "Seeing some of those developers show up and talk about building apps using other languages is pretty cool. It's a whole different group than Microsoft has traditionally been able to court."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Wall Street analyst said developers may even be tempted to switch back to Microsoft after working with Apple's iOS platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There does seem to be some excitement about the new operating system and many of the new devices that are coming to market," said Jason Maynard, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. "We have heard some developers talk about 're-Microsofting' and moving from their Macs for app development."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cousins said that once developers see the user base for Windows 8 grow, the momentum will start to have an effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All the new PCs people buy will be Windows 8, and people will start demanding Windows 8 apps from companies, and then they will start making them," he said. "I think we'll see a wave of apps coming out pretty soon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Bill Rigby; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Ballmer sells Windows, Windows Phone as app vehicles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Reaction mostly positive, doubters remain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Days after launching Windows 8,

quantity, they can win."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEVELOPER DOUBTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Windows 8 launched on Friday, some major content
providers had prominent apps in the Windows store, such as
Netflix Inc, the New York Times and Rovio's
Angry Birds Space. But big names such as Facebook and
Twitter were missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter moved to rectify that on Tuesday, announcing that a
native Windows app would be rolled out "in the months ahead."
Dropbox, a fast-growing cloud storage service, also announced it
would soon have a Windows app, as did online payment firm 
PayPal and sports network ESPN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Facebook, which now has more than 1 billion users, has
not yet made public any plans for a Windows app, despite the
fact Microsoft is a minor shareholder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Microsoft still has to overcome indifference from many
developers who do not see demand from users or simply do not
have the resources to build Windows apps alongside iOS and
Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Windows 8 is getting good reviews and the tile user
interface is a great fit with our geo-visual content," said
Jason Karas, CEO at website Trover, where users can share photos
of interesting discoveries. "It's on the roadmap for Trover, but
we are still a very lean team, so we're hesitant to support a
third platform until we have all the innovations we want to see
in iPhone and Android in place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has yet to persuade other influential online
services, for example car-rental firm Zipcar or real
estate information firm Zillow, to develop for Windows 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get more developers on board, Microsoft is spending this
week demonstrating how it is making it easier to develop apps
for Windows and get them into the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key part of that is a new set of tools tying in its Azure
cloud service, which allows Windows apps to easily harness data
stored in remote servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some of the new changes are pretty incredible and are going
to make developing, especially some of the mobile apps, much
easier," said Mike Cousins, a software developer following the
conference by webcast from Calgary, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It just makes it super-easy to integrate mobile clients
into your application," said Cousins, who is developing Shuttr,
a site for photographers to display and sell their work. "It's
been reduced from probably a week's work to minutes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;400 MILLION NEW MACHINES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's best argument to developers is the sheer size of
the Windows user base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft sold 4 million upgrades to Windows 8 in its first
four days, a mere fraction of the 670 million or so machines
running Windows 7. Ballmer said there would be 400 million new
devices running Windows next year, including PCs, tablets and
phones, and the company would be marketing heavily to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is an attractive audience for developers, and Whitman
at Ratio Interactive said he saw many new faces at Microsoft's
event this week who previously were more interested in web-based
apps and other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a new generation of developers that can build on
Windows 8 that have been building using JavaScript and HTML," he
said. "Seeing some of those developers show up and talk about
building apps using other languages is pretty cool. It's a whole
different group than Microsoft has traditionally been able to
court."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Wall Street analyst said developers may even be tempted
to switch back to Microsoft after working with Apple's iOS
platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There does seem to be some excitement about the new
operating system and many of the new devices that are coming to
market," said Jason Maynard, an analyst at Wells Fargo
Securities. "We have heard some developers talk about
're-Microsofting' and moving from their Macs for app
development."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cousins said that once developers see the user base for
Windows 8 grow, the momentum will start to have an effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All the new PCs people buy will be Windows 8, and people
will start demanding Windows 8 apps from companies, and then
they will start making them," he said. "I think we'll see a wave
of apps coming out pretty soon."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc on Thursday posted quarterly revenue well below Wall Street expectations, as sales of the pharmaceutical company's Prevnar pediatric vaccine disappointed and emerging market revenue dropped sharply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sharper-than-expected decline for Lipitor, the cholesterol fighter that began facing cheaper generics late last year, also hit revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's global sales slid 16 percent to $13.98 billion, well below Wall Street expectations of $14.64 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 53 cents per share, matching the average analyst forecast, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer in recent years has failed to produce many big-selling new drugs. But company shares have risen 13.5 percent in the last year, outperforming 11.5 percent gains for the drug sector, largely on optimism for its new treatments for cancer, blood clots, arthritis and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors also have applauded sharp cost cuts, including to its research budget, and the recent decision to sell its baby formula business to Nestle SA for almost $12 billion. That deal is slated to close in the first half of 2013. The company has a history of buying back shares, which has kept investors onboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer on Thursday authorized an extra $10 billion in share repurchases, given the planned sale of the nutritionals business. The company has repurchased $5.9 billion of common stock so far this year of an  earlier $10 billion authorization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if Pfizer's recipe of new medicines, cost cuts and share buybacks was sustainable, Barclays analyst Tony Butler replied: "I'm not so sure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said his main concern is whether Pfizer can introduce enough lucrative products to restore revenue growth, amid Lipitor's plunging sales and looming generic competition or declining royalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you don't make enough widgets, you can't be successful in the long term," Butler said, adding that cost cuts have been a more proven prowess at Pfizer than development of drugs with big sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lung cancer drug Xalkori and kidney cancer treatment Inlyta, new drugs that had impressive results in clinical trials, posted disappointing quarterly sales of $38 million and $30 million, respectively, said Butler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But company Chief Executive Ian Read said the pair of cancer drugs has potential, while other medicines -- including an experimental blood clot preventer called Eliquis -- would prove themselves over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You don't fix the innovative core of a pharmaceuticals business in two years," he said in an interview. He noted that operations of the New York-based drugmaker have not been significantly affected by Hurricane Sandy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. drugmaker earned $3.21 billion, or 43 cents per share, in the third quarter. That compared with $3.74 billion, or 48 cents per share, in the year-earlier period, when the company recorded a $1.3 billion gain on the sale of its Capsugel business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Like many others in the third quarter, Pfizer was weak at the revenue line, missing (forecasts) by 5 percent," Jefferies &amp; Co analyst Jeffrey Holford said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from emerging markets - countries whose fast-expanding economies are a mainstay for Pfizer growth - fell 2 percent to $2.39 billion as the stronger dollar cut into the value of sales. By contrast, emerging market sales had jumped 8 percent in the prior quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Pfizer has hitched its future largely to sales in developing markets such as China, India, Eastern Europe and South America, sales are highly variable there because of fluctuating interest rates and a range of regional factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio said the company expects annual emerging market sales to grow in the "high-single-digit" percentage range in the next few years, fueled by overall growth in healthcare spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of Prevnar 13 fell 14 percent to $868 million, while sales of its older Prevnar 7 vaccine dropped 17 percent to $81 million. The widely used vaccines, obtained through Pfizer's merger in 2009 with Wyeth, are now Pfizer's second-biggest-selling franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevnar, used to prevent infection with pneumococcal bacteria that can cause pneumonia, ear infections and other problems, logged especially sharp declines in the United States and developed Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;D'Amelio said that was because children last year were given a one-time extra vaccination to afford them the same protection as Prevnar 13, which protects against 13 strains of pneumococcal bacteria. The older Prevnar protects against 7 strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That was a one-time opportunity," D'Amelio said. Pfizer also cited "minimal" demand by adults for Prevnar 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipitor sales plunged 71 percent to $749 million. It had been the world's biggest drug until its U.S. patent lapsed in late November, opening the floodgates to cheaper generics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of animal health products fell 2 percent to $1.0 billion while sales of consumer health care brands rose 2 percent to $780 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it now expects 2012 earnings of $2.14 to $2.17 per share, from its prior view of $2.12 to $2.22 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn, Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nov 1 (Reuters) - Procter &amp; Gamble Co said on
Thursday that 31-year company veteran Jorge Uribe will soon
become its first global productivity and organization
transformation officer, as the world's largest maker of
household products works on improving its structure and cutting
costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uribe, who starts in his new role on Dec. 1, will report
directly to Chairman and Chief Executive Bob McDonald and will
also be part of a new productivity council of senior managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P said in late October that it would add the new role and
council as it puts a fresh focus on productivity, but at that
time it did not say who would be involved. The maker of Tide
detergent and Pampers diapers is already cutting $10 billion of
costs and focusing on key markets, products and countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its goals have been under intense scrutiny - as has McDonald
- since activist investor William Ackman bought shares this
summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uribe, who joined P in 1981 as a marketing assistant, is
currently P's group president of Latin America and global
club, cash &amp; carry channel. He will be succeeded in that post by
Tarek Farahat, the vice president and general manager of P
Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The productivity council will include Uribe, McDonald, Vice
Chairman of Global Business Units Dimitri Panayotopoulos, Vice
Chairman of Global Operations Werner Geissler, Chief Financial
Officer Jon Moeller, Chief Human Resources Officer Mark Biegger
and Global Brand Building Officer Marc Pritchard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, reported a quarterly profit on Thursday that topped expectations, as higher margins from its refining arm countered a 7.5 percent decline in oil and gas output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and other global oil producers are buying oil and gas assets in North America as they struggle to raise production in a sector where vast energy resources are tightly controlled by countries like Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Exxon agreed to buy Celtic Exploration Ltd for $2.64 billion. That deal will give Exxon access to some of the most promising shale oil and gas region in Western Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in September, Exxon said it planned to buy 196,000 acres in the Bakken shales in North Dakota and Montana in a $1.6 billion deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The (earnings) beat definitely came from the refining side of the business," said Brian Youngberg, energy company analyst at Edward Jones in Saint Louis. "The production decline was more than expected. It has been a recurring challenge for Exxon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refining margins have improved as companies benefit from processing cheaper grades of crude oil from Canada as well as shale basins like the Eagle Ford in south Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings from Exxon's global refining business more than doubled to $3.2 billion. The company's exploration and production business had a profit of $5.97 billion, down 29 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural gas prices in the United States fell about 30 percent from a year-ago in the quarter as huge supplies weighed. Brent crude prices in the quarter were also declined, pinched by worry about global demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those lower prices cut into Exxon's profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Irving, Texas company said its third-quarter earnings had fallen to $9.57 billion, or $2.09 per share, from $10.33 billion, or $2.13 per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.95 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's revenue fell 8 percent to $115.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil and gas output declined 7.5 percent to 3.96 million barrels oil equivalent per day, Exxon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts at Houston-based energy investment bank Simmons &amp; Co had expected Exxon to report a production decline of 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it had bought back 58 million shares of its own stock for $5.1 billion in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Exxon were up 10 cents at $91.27 in mid-morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Inserts dropped word "percent" in first paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting Ernest Scheyder in New York; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn, Gerald E.

		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE: JPM) announced today that following the 
      devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy, the company will offer extensive 
      relief across the firm to its customers and the local communities 
      impacted.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;While all natural disasters are heartbreaking, as a New York-based 
      bank, this one literally hits home,&#8221; said Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan 
      Chase. &#8220;We have more than 30,000 employees and 10 million customers who 
      have been affected by this storm. We are prepared to offer unprecedented 
      help from all areas of our firm through charitable relief, loans, fee 
      waivers, and other commitments. We plan to be one of the key engines 
      toward this recovery.&#8221;

		&lt;p&gt;
      The firm&#8217;s pledged relief will include:

            $1 million in matched funds for employee donations to the American 
            Red Cross, WorldVision and the United Way, also for immediate 
            relief efforts;
          
					
            Up to $2 million in donations to local agencies for recovery 
            efforts including counseling, temporary housing, cash assistance 
            and access to social services.
          
				
			
			
        Up to $5 billion in incremental capital for lending to small and 
        mid-size businesses directly affected by the storm to help them 
        rebuild. We will offer favorable terms on these loans, including 
        discounted fees and rates. These loans will be on top of the funding 
        we already do for small businesses.
      
			
        Offering funding to states, municipalities and transportation 
        authorities for their rebuilding needs.
      
		
		
			
        Allowing customers an opportunity to donate to the American Red Cross 
        with Ultimate Reward points.
      
		
		
			
        Waiving all mortgage-related fees and offering 90 days forbearance of 
        mortgage payments for customers seeking assistance in the impacted 
        areas, and temporarily suspending all foreclosure sales in the FEMA 
        designated zones.
      
		
		
			
        With the inability of some customers to reach a bank, we are 
        increasing the QuickPay deposit limits by five times in the affected 
        states &#8211; up to $10,000 a day (up from $2,000 a day), and up to $25,000

      &#8220;We are calling our clients across the firm,&#8221; said Matt Zames, co-Chief 
      Operating Officer of JPMorgan Chase. &#8220;These are unprecedented times for 
      New York, New Jersey and the other affected states and everyone&#8217;s 
      challenges are unique. We are saying the same thing to everyone, &#8216;How 
      can we help?&#8217; These programs are the beginning for us. We will be a

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;By David Moskowitz&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Shares of Pain Therapeutics (NASDAQ:PTIE) are off 25% as partner Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) noted Thursday on its earnings call that Remoxy, PTIE's lead product, is a "challenging" asset and that new studies are required to support resubmission of the drug in the U.S. Recall that many had expected Pfizer to resubmit the NDA for Remoxy in the near-term based on encouraging results from recently completed biostudies and an expected meeting with the FDA in 2H12. It is unclear whether PFE recently met with the FDA, but the large-cap pharmaceutical company is now saying that it will run 3 additional studies that are expected to complete in March 2013. At that time, Pfizer plans to meet with the FDA to discuss the results and whether they are adequate to address the concerns noted in the Complete Response Letter (CRL) issued by the agency in 2011. These words were not comforting and certainly dim prospects for good news for PTIE in the near term. Most troubling was PFE's statement that it will make a "go/no-go" decision on the drug next year, indicating that Remoxy's fate is still very much up in the air. A key driver of concern around this statement is based on the recently completed studies, which many thought were positive; the new question is&#160;why&#160;Pfizer feels that it is necessary to run more trials. Notably, PFE is also developing its own tamper resistant oxycodone product candidate, ALO-02, and while committed to abuse-resistant opioids, PFE could favor this formulation over Remoxy given much better economics. Expect the shares to trade down as investors seek to deploy investment capital elsewhere. This also applies to shares of Durect Corp. (NASDAQ:DRRX), given that a major portion of its value is tied to Remoxy as well. Note that PTIE has about $2.00 per share in cash, so this level should provide a backstop for the stock, but also indicates that downside off of Thursday's initial reaction could get worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI, China, Nov. 1, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Microsoft Corporation (Nasdaq:MSFT) ("Microsoft"), 21Vianet Group, Inc. (Nasdaq:VNET) ("21Vianet") and the Shanghai Municipal Government, announced today that they have signed a strategic partnership agreement to expand Microsoft's premier commercial cloud services&#8212;Office 365 and Windows Azure&#8212;into China. Mr. Baojun Ai, Member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, deputy mayor of Shanghai; Mr. Ralph Haupter, Corporate Vice President, Chairman and CEO of Microsoft Greater China Region, and Mr. Josh Chen, Chairman and CEO of 21Vianet attended the signing ceremony to celebrate the milestone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Mr. Josh Chen, Chairman and CEO of 21Vianet stated: "We are proud to partner with a world technology leader and become the Chinese provider for Office 365 and Windows Azure services in China. We believe that this commercial cloud platform will bring Chinese enterprises unprecedented operational efficiency and flexibility. By leveraging Microsoft's strong brand reputation and over 15 years of cloud experience, as well as 21Vianet's data center expertise, we aim to build one of China's premier cloud computing platforms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	In China, this new partnership will meet the requirements of customers by delivering Office 365 in two ways:&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Services operated by 21Vianet in China. &#160;21Vianet will operate and offer Office 365 and Windows Azure services in China. In addition, Microsoft has signed a memorandum with the municipality of Shanghai, where 21Vianet is locating a major datacenter for these services. This option will provide a consistent Office 365 experience while meeting the demands of customers who prefer to use online services provided by a local company that stores their data within China. These services will be subject to Chinese laws.
			
				Services operated by Microsoft. For Chinese customers who prefer to use services managed and delivered by Microsoft itself, Microsoft will provide Office 365 from Microsoft datacenters in Singapore and Hong Kong. These services will be subject to the laws of Singapore or Hong Kong.
		&lt;p&gt;
	There is strong demand for secure, reliable and scalable public cloud services in China -- a recent Forrester Research report on cloud computing (Forrester Research, Sizing The Cloud Markets In Asia Pacific, Feb. 3, 2012) found that Chinese organizations are beginning to mobilize around the cloud. "The public cloud market in China will grow from $297 million in 2011 to $3.8 billion in 2020. The three segments of the virtual private cloud market will grow from $44 million in 2011 to $1.6 billion in 2020. The unparalleled economic growth in China will certainly help spur strong cloud market growth in China across most cloud segments through 2020." Microsoft and 21Vianet are excited to bring our commercial cloud services to market in China and serve the productivity needs of local businesses.&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

			Microsoft Making it Better with Bluetooth&#174; Technology v4.0
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Windows 8 Offers Native Support for Bluetooth Smart and Smart Ready 
      Devices
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft&#8217;s Windows 8 announcement introduces native support for 
      Bluetooth v4.0. Bluetooth v4.0 enabled products running the Windows 8 
      operating system, such as the new Surface tablet, will be Bluetooth 
      Smart Ready products, enabling them to connect to familiar Bluetooth 
      devices, like wireless speakers, and to the next generation of ultra 
      power-efficient Bluetooth Smart products now coming to market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Last weeks&#8217; Microsoft announcement is an acknowledgement of the massive 
      Bluetooth ecosystem and strong consumer demand for secure, convenient 
      wireless connectivity the technology provides,&#8221; said Suke Jawanda, 
      Bluetooth SIG CMO. &#8220;With Bluetooth v4.0 incorporated into the Windows 
      operating system, hardware and software developers will have increased 
      opportunities to provide new devices, applications, and services for 
      their customers. Securely feeding web services and applications with 
      cloud friendly data via a Bluetooth connection is a key component in the 
      shift to cloud computing and more broadly, the Internet of Things.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      OS-level support for Bluetooth 4.0 technology in Windows 8 allows 
      hardware and software developers to tap into the billions-strong market 
      of Bluetooth products in a scalable way. App developers will be able to 
      use an API to feed data collected from Bluetooth Smart low-energy 
      sensors, like a fitness monitor or medical device, to an application 
      running on a Bluetooth Smart Ready product like the Microsoft Surface.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The launch of Bluetooth
			v4.0 unleashed a wave of new Bluetooth 
      Smart and Smart Ready devices which provide manufactures and 
      developers the opportunity to create the next generation of devices and 
      software applications that will transform the way consumers interact 
      with their technology. Microsoft is the latest in a list of companies 
      utilizing Bluetooth v4.0 and the technology&#8217;s low energy capabilities, a 
      list that also includes major brands like Nike, Samsung, Panasonic, 
      Nintendo, Sony and Ford, among others. Bluetooth technology&#8217;s massive 
      ecosystem is expected to expand remarkably within the next five years 
      reaching 20 billion cumulative Bluetooth enabled device shipments by 
      2017.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Quarterly refining profit more than doubles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Oil and gas production down 7.5 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Shares edge lower&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Anna Driver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nov 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp, the world's
largest publicly traded oil company, reported a quarterly profit
on Thursday that topped expectations, as higher margins from its
refining arm countered a 7.5 percent decline in oil and gas
output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon and other global oil producers are buying oil and gas
assets in North America as they struggle to raise production in
a sector where vast energy resources are tightly controlled by
countries like Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Exxon agreed to buy Celtic Exploration
Ltd for $2.64 billion. That deal will give Exxon access to some
of the most promising shale oil and gas region in Western
Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in September, Exxon said it planned to buy 196,000 acres
in the Bakken shales in North Dakota and Montana in a $1.6
billion deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The (earnings) beat definitely came from the refining side
of the business," said Brian Youngberg, energy company analyst
at Edward Jones in Saint Louis. "The production decline was more
than expected. It has been a recurring challenge for Exxon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refining margins have improved as companies benefit from
processing cheaper grades of crude oil from Canada as well as
shale basins like the Eagle Ford in south Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings from Exxon's global refining business more than
doubled to $3.2 billion. The company's exploration and
production business had a profit of $5.97 billion, down 29
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural gas prices in the United States fell about 30
percent from a year-ago in the quarter as huge supplies weighed.
Brent crude prices in the quarter were also declined, pinched by
worry about global demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those lower prices cut into Exxon's profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Irving, Texas company said its third-quarter earnings
had fallen to $9.57 billion, or $2.09 per share, from $10.33
billion, or $2.13 per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.95 per
share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's revenue fell 8 percent to $115.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil and gas output declined 7.5 percent to 3.96 million
barrels oil equivalent per day, Exxon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts at Houston-based energy investment bank Simmons &amp;
Co had expected Exxon to report a production decline of 5
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it had bought back 58 million shares of its
own stock for $5.1 billion in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Exxon were up 10 cents at $91.27 in mid-morning
trade on the New York Stock Exchange trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;Third quarter results reflect our ongoing commitment to help deliver 
      the energy needed to underpin economic recovery and growth while 
      maintaining our strong focus on safety and environmental performance.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;Third quarter 2012 earnings were $9.6 billion, down 7% from the 
      third quarter of 2011.
			Earnings for the first nine months of 2012 
      were $34.9 billion, up 10% compared to the first nine months of 2011.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;Capital and exploration expenditures were $9.2 billion in the third 
      quarter and a record $27.4 billion for the first nine months of 2012 as 
      we continue pursuing opportunities to find and produce new supplies of 
      oil and natural gas to meet global demand for energy.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;The Corporation distributed $7.6 billion to shareholders in the 
      third quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares 
      outstanding.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			THIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Earnings of $9,570 million decreased $760 million or 7% from the third 
        quarter of 2011.
      
			
        Earnings per share (assuming dilution) were $2.09, a decrease of 2% 
        from the third quarter of 2011.
      
			
        Capital and exploration expenditures were $9.2 billion, up 7% from the 
        third quarter of 2011.
      
			
        Oil-equivalent production decreased 7.5% from the third quarter of 
        2011. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects 
        and divestments, production decreased 2.9%.
      
			
        Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $14.0 billion, including 
        proceeds associated with asset sales of $0.6&#160;billion.
      
			
        Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding were $5 billion.
      
			
        Dividends per share of $0.57 increased 21% compared to the third 
        quarter of 2011.
      
			
        As announced, on September 19, 2012, ExxonMobil and its subsidiary, 
        XTO Energy Inc., signed an exchange agreement with Denbury Onshore, 
        LLC, a subsidiary of Denbury Resources Inc., to acquire 100 percent of 
        Denbury&#8217;s Bakken shale assets, which consist of approximately 196,000 
        net acres in North Dakota and Montana, with expected production to be 
        more than 15,000 net oil-equivalent barrels per day when the deal 
        closes.
      
			
        As announced, on October 16, 2012, ExxonMobil Canada Ltd. entered into 
        an agreement with Celtic Exploration Ltd. (&#8220;Celtic&#8221;) under which an 
        ExxonMobil Canada affiliate will acquire Celtic. Under the terms of 
        the agreement, ExxonMobil Canada will acquire 545,000 net acres in the 
        liquids-rich Montney shale, 104,000 net acres in the Duvernay shale 
        and additional acreage in other areas of Alberta. Current production 
        of the acreage to be acquired is 72 million cubic feet per day of 
        natural gas and 4,000 barrels per day of crude, condensate and natural 
        gas liquids.
      
			
        The Sakhalin-1 Consortium, operated by Exxon Neftegas Limited (ENL), 
        recently drilled the world&#8217;s longest extended-reach well at the Chayvo 
        field, offshore Russian Far East. Using ExxonMobil&#8217;s fast-drill 
        technology, the Z-44 well reached a measured depth of 12,376 meters 
        (40,604 feet), more than 27 times the height of the Empire State 
        Building.
      
			
        ExxonMobil is investing more than $200 million to expand its Baton 
        Rouge, Louisiana chemical and lubricants plants to increase capacity 
        for synthetic lubricant base stocks manufacturing and lubricants 
        blending, packaging and storage.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Third Quarter 2012 vs. Third Quarter 2011
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Upstream earnings were $5,973&#160;million in the third quarter of 2012, down 
      $2,421 million from the third quarter of 2011. Production volume and mix 
      effects reduced earnings by $700 million. Lower liquids and natural gas 
      realizations decreased earnings by $130&#160;million. All other items, 
      including the absence of prior year asset sales ($1.0&#160;billion), 
      unfavorable tax items and foreign exchange impacts, decreased earnings 
      by a total of $1.6&#160;billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On an oil-equivalent basis, production decreased 7.5% from the third 
      quarter of 2011. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC 
      quota effects and divestments, production decreased 2.9%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Liquids production totaled 2,116&#160;kbd (thousands of barrels per day), 
      down 133 kbd from the third quarter of 2011. Excluding the impacts of 
      entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, liquids 
      production was down 3.1%, as field decline was partially offset by 
      project ramp-up in Angola and Nigeria.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Third quarter natural gas production was 11,061&#160;mcfd (millions of cubic 
      feet per day), down 1,136 mcfd from 2011. Excluding the impacts of 
      entitlement volumes and divestments, natural gas production was down 
      2.7%, due primarily to field decline.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations were $633&#160;million, $551&#160;million 
      lower than the third quarter of 2011. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were 
      $5,340 million, down $1,870&#160;million from the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Downstream earnings were $3,190&#160;million, up $1,611&#160;million from the 
      third quarter of 2011. Downstream margins, mainly refining, increased 
      earnings by $850 million, while volume and mix effects were essentially 
      flat. All other items, including higher gains on asset sales of $360 
      million, favorable foreign exchange effects, and lower operating 
      expenses, increased earnings by $780 million. Petroleum product sales of 
      6,105&#160;kbd were 453&#160;kbd lower than last year's third quarter due mainly 
      to divestments and the Japan restructuring.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Earnings from the U.S. Downstream were $1,441&#160;million, up $631&#160;million 
      from the third quarter of 2011. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings of 
      $1,749&#160;million were $980&#160;million higher than last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chemical earnings of $790&#160;million were $213 million lower than the third 
      quarter of 2011. Lower margins decreased earnings by $150 million. All 
      other items, mainly unfavorable foreign exchange effects, decreased 
      earnings by $60 million. Third quarter prime product sales of 5,947&#160;kt 
      (thousands of metric tons) were 285&#160;kt lower than last year's third 
      quarter due mainly to the Japan restructuring.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Corporate and financing expenses were $383&#160;million for the third quarter 
      of 2012, down $263 million from the third quarter of 2011, due mainly to 
      favorable tax items.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the third quarter of 2012, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 58 
      million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of 
      $5.1 billion. These purchases included $5.0 billion to reduce the number 
      of shares outstanding, with the balance used to acquire shares in 
      conjunction with the company&#8217;s benefit plans and programs. Share 
      purchases to reduce shares outstanding are currently anticipated to 
      equal $5&#160;billion in the fourth quarter of 2012. Purchases may be made in 
      both the open market and through negotiated transactions, and may be 
      increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.

      mix effects decreased earnings by $1.9&#160;billion. Liquids and natural gas 
      realizations decreased earnings by $80 million. All other items, 
      including higher operating expenses and unfavorable tax effects, reduced 
      earnings by $1.5 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On an oil-equivalent basis, production was down 6.2% compared to the 
      same period in 2011. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC 
      quota effects and divestments, production was down 1.6%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Liquids production of 2,179&#160;kbd decreased 153 kbd compared with 2011. 
      Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and

      partly offset by project ramp-up in Angola and Nigeria.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Natural gas production of 12,249&#160;mcfd decreased 739&#160;mcfd from 2011. 
      Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes and divestments, natural 
      gas production was down 1.3%, as field decline was partially offset by 
      higher demand and lower downtime.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations for 2012 were $2,321&#160;million, 
      down $1,591&#160;million from 2011. Earnings outside the U.S. were 
      $19,812&#160;million, down $1,886 million.

      Downstream earnings of $11,422&#160;million in the first nine months of 2012 
      increased $7,388 million from 2011. Higher refining margins increased 
      earnings by $1.4 billion, while volume and mix effects increased 
      earnings by $140 million. All other items increased earnings by $5.8 
      billion due primarily to a $5.3 billion gain associated with the Japan 
      restructuring and other divestment gains. Petroleum product sales of 
      6,197&#160;kbd decreased 189&#160;kbd from 2011 due mainly to divestments and the 
      Japan restructuring.

      million. Volume and mix effects lowered earnings by $60 million. All 
      other items increased earnings by $80 million, as a $630 million gain 
      associated with the Japan restructuring was mostly offset by unfavorable 
      foreign exchange effects and higher operating expenses. Prime product

      requirements; the outcome of commercial negotiations; changes in 
      technical or operating conditions; and other factors discussed under the 
      heading "Factors Affecting Future Results" in the &#8220;Investors&#8221; section of 
      our website and in Item 1A of ExxonMobil's 2011 Form 10-K.
			Completion 
      of pending acquisitions will depend on the terms and timing of 
      government approvals and other conditions to closing contained in the 
      applicable agreements.
			We assume no duty to update these 
      statements as of any future date.
			References to quantities of oil 
      or natural gas may include amounts that we believe will ultimately be 
      produced, but that are not yet classified as &#8220;proved reserves&#8221; under SEC 
      definitions.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Frequently used terms
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Consistent with previous practice, this press release includes both 
      earnings excluding special items and earnings per share excluding 
      special items.
			Both are non-GAAP financial measures and are 
      included to help facilitate comparisons of base business performance 
      across periods.
			Reconciliation to net income attributable to 
      ExxonMobil is shown in Attachment II.
			The release also includes 
      cash flow from operations and asset sales.
			Because of the regular 
      nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is 
      useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with the sales of 
      subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of 
      investments together with cash provided by operating activities when 
      evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing 
      activities.
			A reconciliation to net cash provided by operating 
      activities is shown in Attachment II.
			Further information on 
      ExxonMobil's frequently used financial and operating measures and other 
      terms is contained under the heading "Frequently Used Terms" available 
      through the &#8220;Investors&#8221; section of our website at exxonmobil.com.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Reference to Earnings
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			References to total corporate earnings mean net income attributable 
      to ExxonMobil (U.S. GAAP) from the income statement.
			Unless 
      otherwise indicated, references to earnings, special items, earnings 
      excluding special items, Upstream, Downstream, Chemical and Corporate 
      and Financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are ExxonMobil's 
      share after excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.

&lt;p&gt;EDINBURGH (Reuters) - In a bid to resurrect Walter Scott's historical novel "Ivanhoe", retired Scottish medical professor David Purdie unsheathed his scalpel to cut out the early 19th century verbiage and deliver a new edition for 21st century readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivanhoe is a romantic tale of fair maidens, bold knights-at-arms, merry friars, skulduggery, enmity between Saxons and Norman barons, and even a cameo appearance by Robin Hood during the reign of England's Richard I in 1194.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first historical novel by Scott (1771-1832) set outside Scotland was hugely popular when it was published at the start of 1820. Its first printing of 10,000 copies sold out in less than two weeks and it set the scene for the rise of the historical novel in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott was widely read through Europe and North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purdie, chairman of the Sir Walter Scott Club in Edinburgh, said the idea for his abridged Ivanhoe "came from repeated observations in the press that Scott was &#8216;difficult', above all, verbose...and out of touch with the attention span of a modern audience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The punctuation style of 1820 just jarred, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have shortened paragraphs and sentences, removed excessive commas, trimmed descriptions, especially of scenery, and adjusted syntax," Purdie told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new edition is published by Luath Press Limited in Edinburgh for sale at 9.99 pounds ($16.09).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purdie, who is also editor-in-chief of the (Robert) Burns Encyclopaedia, said he had trimmed Ivanhoe to 95,000 words - about the length of a modern solid novel - from 195,000 words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a former surgeon, I used the good old surgical discipline of only cutting where necessary, and then only removing extraneous matter, conserving the vital organs of the story while minimizing blood loss and keeping the patient alive," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graham Tulloch, professor of English at Australia's Flinders University in Adelaide and editor of the definitive 1998 Edinburgh Edition of Ivanhoe, told Reuters he would naturally like readers to peruse the original, but commended Purdie's efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"David Purdie has gone to some trouble to make the book in size, cover, and page layout look like a modern historical novel. If this can attract more readers, then I am all in favor.

mandatory registration and validation processes for both the MasterCard

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Open 
      Networking Foundation (ONF), a non-profit organization dedicated to 
      promoting Software-Defined Networking (SDN), today announced the 
      election of Steven M. Schwartz of Goldman Sachs to the ONF Board of 
      Directors. Mr. Schwartz serves as global head of Telecommunications and 
      Market Data Services at Goldman Sachs, where he is responsible for 
      global networks, voice, multimedia, and market data technology. As a 
      member of the Board of Directors, Mr. Schwartz will contribute to the 
      Foundation&#8217;s mission of propelling real world applications and 
      implementations of SDN and the OpenFlow protocol.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Steve&#8217;s commitment to open standards and his technical expertise in 
      this demanding market sector will offer ONF a unique perspective, 
      helping us to improve the quality and impact of our work and set a 
      strategic path that will bring other enterprise companies into our 
      movement,&#8221; said Dan Pitt, executive director of the Open Networking 
      Foundation. &#8220;We are delighted to have him involved and look forward to 
      his contributions to the organization.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Schwartz has held several technology roles at Goldman Sachs over the 
      last 20 years, including responsibility for engineering the firm&#8217;s data 
      network infrastructure. He is currently responsible for helping to steer 
      the path of open standards and technologies within Goldman Sachs&#8217; 
      computing and network environments, and with his team is in the process 
      of developing a network infrastructure based on an open-source control 
      plane and OpenFlow-compliant switching. He serves on the firm&#8217;s 
      Technology Operating Committee, the Infrastructure Leadership Group and 
      the Americas Technology Diversity Committee.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Goldman Sachs has been a strong supporter of the open standards 
      community and is committed to furthering the SDN movement and OpenFlow,&#8221; 
      said Mr. Schwartz. &#8220;ONF&#8217;s mission to commercialize and promote SDN and 
      its underlying technologies as a disruptive approach to networking is 
      changing the way enterprise organizations are thinking about building 
      networks and the role of network infrastructure in the larger datacenter 
      ecosystem. I look forward to working with the ONF Board of Directors to 
      continue to influence the open standards community, provide an 
      enterprise perspective, and ultimately spur greater community 
      involvement and development of products influenced by these open 
      standards.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 1 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc reported quarterly
revenue well below Wall Street expectations, following the loss
of patent protection on its Lipitor cholesterol fighter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. drugmaker said on Thursday that it had
earned $3.21 billion, or 43 cents per share, in the third
quarter. That compared with $3.74 billion, or 48 cents per
share, in the year-earlier period, when the company recorded a
$1.3 billion gain on the sale of its Capsugel business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 53 cents per share.
Analysts on average expected 53 cents, according to Thomson
Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global sales fell 16 percent to $13.98 billion, well below
Wall Street expectations of $14.64 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			MetLife Bank&#8217;s Mortgage Servicing Portfolio to Be Purchased by
			JPMorgan 
       Co.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) announced today an agreement to sell MetLife 
      Bank, N.A.&#8217;s approximately $70 billion mortgage servicing portfolio to 
      JPMorganChase Bank, N.A. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. 
      The transaction is subject to certain regulatory approvals and other 
      customary closing conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Given MetLife&#8217;s strategic focus as a global insurance and employee 
      benefits leader, the company decided in 2011 that a bank holding company 
      structure was no longer appropriate. &#8220;Since that time, MetLife has 
      entered into agreements to sell MetLife Bank&#8217;s deposit business to GE 
      Capital, sold the bank&#8217;s warehouse finance business to EverBank, sold 
      the bank's reverse mortgage servicing rights to Nationstar, and ceased 
      writing residential mortgages,&#8221; said Jim Rose, MetLife Bank President.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The acquisition of this high-quality portfolio reflects our strategy to 
      strengthen and grow our Servicing business,&#8221; said Eric Schuppenhauer, 
      Head of Mortgage Servicing at Chase. &#8220;We will be able to provide our 
      full range of products and services to an additional 350,000 individuals 
      and families. We expect that many of these customers will take advantage 
      of historically low interest rates by refinancing.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The $70 billion servicing portfolio will increase Chase&#8217;s $1.1 trillion 
      Servicing business by more than 5%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MetLife&#8217;s entire retail banking business, including mortgages, 
      represented less than 2% of MetLife&#8217;s 2011 operating earnings. In a 
      regulatory filing on October 24, MetLife announced it was exploring a 
      sale of its mortgage servicing portfolio and in connection with that 
      decision, began reporting MetLife Bank&#8217;s forward mortgage servicing 
      assets and operations as divested businesses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MetLife was advised on the J.P. Morgan Chase transaction by KL Gates 
      LLP, Milestone Advisors LLC and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) has urged the U.S. Supreme Court to throw out a mortgage securities class-action lawsuit that it said could cost Wall Street tens of billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is challenging a September 6 decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York allowing the lawsuit, which accuses it of misleading investors about the securities' risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That court let the NECA-IBEW Health &amp; Welfare Fund, which owned some mortgage-backed certificates underwritten by Goldman, sue on behalf of investors in certificates backed by mortgages from the same lenders, but which the fund did not own itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Circuit Judge Barrington Parker wrote for a three-judge panel that the NECA-IBEW fund could pursue these claims because they "implicated the same set of concerns" as its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's lawyers argued that the 2nd Circuit created a direct conflict with the federal appeals court in Boston, which in a similar case involving Japan's Nomura Asset Acceptance Corp, found in January 2011 that a plaintiff could not pursue claims on behalf of a class that it could not bring by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stakes are "difficult to overstate," according to an October 26 brief by Theodore Olson, a partner at Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher and former U.S. solicitor general, who represents Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the context of mortgage-backed securities litigation in which this case arises, the decision will effectively increase by tens of billions of dollars the potential liability that financial institutions face in this and similar class actions," he wrote. "Moreover, the new standard threatens to expand the scope of class actions in many other areas of the law."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A split among federal courts often increases the chance that the Supreme Court will accept an appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NECA-IBEW fund serves electrical workers and is based in Decatur, Illinois. It has an opportunity to respond to Goldman's filing. If the Supreme Court accepted Goldman's appeal, no decision would likely be issued before the middle of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joseph Daley and Arthur Leahy, partners at Robbins Geller Rudman &amp; Dowd who represent the NECA-IBEW fund, did not immediately respond on Friday to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMORGAN SEEKS HOLD ON SEPARATE CASE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and its rivals have faced thousands of lawsuits by investors seeking to recoup losses on mortgage securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors typically claim they were misled about the risks relating to the underlying home loans, most of which were made before or as the U.S. housing slump took hold in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 17 offerings in the NECA-IBEW lawsuit dated from 2007, were sold under the same registration statement, and contained loans from many mortgage lenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to court papers, the fund had bought certificates from two Goldman-led offerings that contained loans from GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, later part of Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N), and Wells Fargo &amp; Co (WFC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2nd Circuit let the NECA-IBEW fund represent investors in these and five other offerings backed by GreenPoint or Wells Fargo loans. It said the 10 other offerings were too different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) urged a Manhattan federal judge to put a similar case against it on hold while the Supreme Court addresses Goldman's appeal. That case is led by the Fort Worth Employees' Retirement Fund in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's appeal is Goldman Sachs &amp; Co et al v.

&lt;p&gt;* Goldman accused of misleading mortgage debt investors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* US appeals court in New York revived part of lawsuit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Goldman says lower courts divided on central issue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc 
has urged the U.S. Supreme Court to throw out a mortgage

from the same lenders, but which the fund did not own itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Circuit Judge Barrington Parker wrote for a three-judge
panel that the NECA-IBEW fund could pursue these claims because
they "implicate the same set of concerns" as its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's lawyers argued that the 2nd Circuit created a
direct conflict with the federal appeals court in Boston, which
in a similar case involving Japan's Nomura Asset Acceptance
Corp, found in January 2011 that a plaintiff could not pursue
claims on behalf of a class that it could not bring by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stakes are "difficult to overstate," according to an
Oct. 26 brief by Theodore Olson, a partner at Gibson, Dunn &amp;

investors seeking to recoup losses on mortgage securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors typically claim they were misled about the risks
relating to the underlying home loans, most of which were made
before or as the U.S. housing slump took hold in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 17 offerings in the NECA-IBEW lawsuit dated from 2007,
were sold under the same registration statement, and contained

&lt;p&gt;LAUSANNE (Reuters) - Nestle SA's (NESN.VX) $11.9 billion purchase of Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) baby food business has won approval in China, taking the Swiss group a step towards sealing a deal which still rests on months of bargaining with antitrust authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked whether Chinese regulators had cleared the transaction, Chief Executive Paul Bulcke said: "It was just this week."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nestle is acquiring Pfizer's infant nutrition unit to combine it with its existing infant formula business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bulcke, speaking on the sidelines of the inauguration of the Nestle Institute of Health Sciences, said the Pfizer integration was on track and could be completed in about a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nestle declined comment on whether the deal had been approved in other countries or regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have said the company may have to sell up to 30 percent of the Pfizer businesses, including those in Latin America, the Middle East and Asia, as part of an approval process which may take up to 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are pleased that Nestle's acquisition of Pfizer Nutrition has been approved in China," the company said. "The acquisition is still subject to other closing conditions. We therefore do not make any further comment at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bulcke also signaled Nestle could look at further deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have to look at how many opportunities are out there ... We're happy with what may come and we'll embrace that. We're always open to opportunities," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if Nestle could do more deals of the size of the Pfizer unit purchase, Bulcke said: "That's a big acquisition ... we don't do that every day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Silke Koltrowitz; Editing by David Holmes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Dan Levine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Nov 2 (Reuters) - Two weeks before a
high-stakes trial pitting Google's Motorola Mobility unit
against Microsoft, Google made what has become a common request
for a technology company fighting for billions of dollars: A
public court proceeding, conducted largely in secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google and Microsoft, like rivals embroiled in smartphone
patent wars, are eager to keep sensitive business information
under wraps - in this case, the royalty deals they cut with
other companies on patented technology. Microsoft asked for
similar protections in a court filing late on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such royalty rates, though, are the central issue in this
trial, which begins Nov. 13 in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge James Robart has granted requests to
block many pre-trial legal briefs from public view. Though he
warned he may get tougher on the issue, the nature of the case
raises the possibility that even his final decision might
include redacted, or blacked-out, sections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal experts are increasingly troubled by the level of
secrecy that has become commonplace in intellectual property
cases where overburdened judges often pay scant attention to the
issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Widespread sealing of documents infringes on the basic
American legal principle that court should be public, and
encourages companies to use a costly, taxpayer-funded resource
to resolve their disputes, says law professor Dennis Crouch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are plenty of cases that have settled because one
party didn't want their information public," said Crouch, an
intellectual property professor at University of Missouri School
of Law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech companies counter that they should not be forced to
reveal private business information as the price for having
their day in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The law does permit confidential information to be kept from
public view in some circumstances, though companies must show
the disclosure would be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google argues that revelations about licensing negotiations
would give competitors "additional leverage and bargaining power
and would lead to an unfair advantage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robart has not yet ruled on Google and Microsoft's requests,
which, in the case of Google includes not only keeping documents
under seal, but also clearing the courtroom during crucial
testimony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also unclear whether Robart will redact any discussion
of royalty rates in his final opinion. The judge, who will
decide this part of the case without a jury, did not respond to
requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOT PAYING ATTENTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp have been
litigating in courts around the world against Google Inc
 and partners like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd
, which use the Android operating system on their
mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple contends that Android is basically a copy of its iOS
smartphone software, and Microsoft holds patents that it
contends cover a number of Android features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google bought Motorola for $12.5 billion, partly to use its
large portfolio of communications patents as a bargaining chip
against its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robart will decide how big a royalty Motorola deserves from
Microsoft for a license on some Motorola wireless and video
patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple, for its part, is set to square off against Motorola
on Monday in Madison, Wisconsin, in a case that involves many of
the same issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Wisconsin, Apple and Motorola have filed most court
documents entirely under seal. U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb
did not require them to seek advance permission to file them
secretly, nor did she mandate that the companies make redacted
copies available for the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judges have broad discretion in granting requests to seal
documents. The legal standard for such requests can be high, but
in cases where both sides want the proceedings to be secret,
judges have little incentive to thoroughly review secrecy
requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Apple's Northern California litigation against Samsung,
both parties also sought to keep many documents under seal.
After Reuters challenged those secrecy requests, on grounds it
wanted to report financial details, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh
ordered both companies to disclose a range of information they
considered secret - including profit margins on individual
products - but not licensing deals. Apple and Samsung are
appealing the disclosure order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to questions from Reuters last week, Judge Crabb
in Wisconsin, who will also decide the case without a jury,
acknowledged she had not been paying attention to how many
documents were being filed under seal. Federal judges in Madison
will now require that parties file redacted briefs, she said,
though as of Wednesday, Apple and Motorola were still filing key
briefs entirely under seal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just because there is a seed or kernel of confidential
information doesn't mean an entire 25-page brief should be
sealed," said Bernard Chao, an intellectual property professor
at University of Denver Sturm College of Law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crabb promised that the upcoming trial would be open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whatever opinion I make is not going to be redacted," she
told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHECKING THE COMPS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft sued Motorola two years ago, saying Motorola had
promised to license its so-called "standards essential" patents
at a fair rate, in exchange for the technology being adopted as
a norm industrywide. But by demanding roughly $4 billion a year
in revenue, Microsoft says Motorola broke its promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robart will sort out what a reasonable royalty for those
standards patents should be, partly by reviewing deals Motorola
struck with other companies such as IBM and Research in
Motion - much like an appraiser checking comparable
properties to figure out whether a home is priced right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, though, the public may not be able to
understand exactly what figures Robart is comparing.
Representatives for Microsoft and Google declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its brief, Microsoft said licensing terms could be sealed
without the need to clear the courtroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Permitting redaction of this information will minimize the
harm to Microsoft and third parties while also giving due
consideration to the public policies favoring disclosure," the
company argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM and RIM have also asked Robart to keep licensing
information secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chao doesn't think Robart will ultimately redact his own
ruling, even though it may include discussion of the specific
royalty rates. "I can't imagine that," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most judges cite lack of resources and overflowing dockets
as the reason why they don't scrutinize secrecy requests more
closely, especially when both parties support them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Wisconsin, Crabb said that even though she will now
require litigants to ask permission to file secret documents, it
is highly unlikely that she will actually read those arguments -
unless someone else flags a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're paddling madly to stay afloat," Crabb said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wisconsin case in U.S. District Court, Western District
of Wisconsin is Apple Inc. vs. Motorola Mobility Inc.,
11-cv-178. The Seattle case in U.S. District Court, Western
District of Washington is Microsoft Corp. vs. Motorola Inc.,
10-cv-1823.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Chevron Corp posted earnings on Friday that were much lower than expected as maintenance exacerbated a decline this year in oil and natural gas production, and shares of the second-largest U.S. oil company slid 2.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter production fell to 2.52 million barrels of oil equivalent per day from 2.60 million bpd a year earlier. With a fourth-quarter bounce expected, Chevron expected 2012 production to average about 2.6 million bpd, or 97 percent of its original 2.68 million bpd target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasing output from the wellhead is a struggle for many big oil companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp and Royal Dutch Shell. With oil and gas assets tightly controlled by the countries where they are located, the majors are left to drill in pricier areas on land and offshore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smaller U.S. oil company Hess Corp, on the other hand, delivered on Friday a strong increase in profits and production owning to its interest in the Bakken oil basin in North Dakota, and a resurgent Libya operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Chevron, the third quarter was marred by a huge fire at its Richmond refinery in California that damaged the crude unit there and now expected to be repaired in the first quarter. However, the company said this had a limited impact on third-quarter earnings, which were hit hard by weak marketing margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, third-quarter net income fell to $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, from $7.83 billion, or $3.92 per share, a year earlier. Earnings dropped 17 percent to $5.1 billion in the oil and gas production business and plunged 65 percent to $689 million in the refining, or downstream, operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Downstream was the primary culprit behind the miss," Simmons &amp; Co analysts said in a note to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reported profit included about $600 million from an asset sale gain, offset by a negative foreign exchange impact, they said. Leaving out certain items, Chevron earned $2.55 per share, compared with the analysts' average estimate of $2.83, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer John Watson said that, apart from heavy planned oilfield maintenance, pricing for its output was also weaker. This was in part because of the oversupplied U.S. market for natural gas liquids, while the average Brent oil price of $110 per barrel was down $2 from a year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A storm cut into Gulf of Mexico production, while planned maintenance in Kazakhstan and the United Kingdom caused the majority of the production decline outside the United States, according to Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One downstream bright spot was that Chevron's smaller North American refineries in British Columbia and Salt Lake City were running discounted crude piped in from the Bakken, said Mike Wirth, executive vice president for downstream and chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large spread between U.S. oil prices and international benchmark Brent has emerged due to the combination of a surge in North American oil production along with subdued U.S. demand and the limited ability to ship it out to international markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On this crude disconnect, it is like real estate," Wirth told analysts on a conference call. "It is location, location, location, and our large coastal refineries are distant from where these advantages really are."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More broadly, Wirth said he was pessimistic about near-term demand for refined products based on the sales figures he saw in Asia and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Chevron were down 2.5 percent at $108.67 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;GENEVA (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Chevron said on Friday that Angolan subsidiary Cabinda Gulf Oil Company had declared force majeure at the Kuito offshore oil terminal on October 29 due to a fault with a mooring line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is one of the west African country's top producers and typically loads two 920,000 barrel tankers a month from its Kuito platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Kuito operation is currently undergoing a planned turnaround, and we do not anticipate any resulting production impacts from this action," a company spokesman said in an emailed statement, without giving an immediate comment on the duration of the force majeure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that a mooring line had separated from a loading buoy during a routine inspection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angolan loading programs showed that Chevron was due to load just one 920,000 barrel tanker in November, reflecting the impact of the maintenance work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A force majeure allows a company to suspend contractual obligations in the face of unexpected events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPEC member Angola is Africa's second largest producer after Nigeria and typically exports around 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exports for November are slightly lower than average at around 1.67 million bpd, partly due to lower Kuito output and lower volumes on the Girassol grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Emma Farge; Additional reporting by Jonathan Saul in London, editing by William Hardy and Jason Neely)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Dan Levine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Nov 2 (Reuters) - Two weeks before a
high-stakes trial pitting Google's Motorola Mobility unit
against Microsoft, Google made what has become a common request
for a technology company fighting for billions of dollars: A
public court proceeding, conducted largely in secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google and Microsoft, like rivals embroiled in smartphone
patent wars, are eager to keep sensitive business information
under wraps - in this case, the royalty deals they cut with
other companies on patented technology. Microsoft asked for
similar protections in a court filing late on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such royalty rates, though, are the central issue in this
trial, which begins Nov. 13 in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge James Robart has granted requests to
block many pre-trial legal briefs from public view. Though he
warned he may get tougher on the issue, the nature of the case
raises the possibility that even his final decision might
include redacted, or blacked-out, sections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal experts are increasingly troubled by the level of
secrecy that has become commonplace in intellectual property
cases where overburdened judges often pay scant attention to the
issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Widespread sealing of documents infringes on the basic
American legal principle that court should be public, says law
professor, Dennis Crouch, and encourages companies to use a
costly, tax-payer funded resource to resolve their disputes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are plenty of cases that have settled because one
party didn't want their information public," said Crouch, an
intellectual property professor at University of Missouri School
of Law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech companies counter that they should not be forced to
reveal private business information as the price for having
their day in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The law does permit confidential information to be kept from
public view in some circumstances, though companies must show
the disclosure would be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google argues that revelations about licensing negotiations
would give competitors "additional leverage and bargaining power
and would lead to an unfair advantage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robart has not yet ruled on Google and Microsoft's requests,
which, in the case of Google includes not only keeping documents
under seal, but also clearing the courtroom during crucial
testimony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also unclear whether Robart will redact any discussion
of royalty rates in his final opinion. The judge, who will
decide this part of the case without a jury, did not respond to
requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOT PAYING ATTENTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp have been
litigating in courts around the world against Google Inc
 and partners like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd
, which use the Android operating system on their
mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple contends that Android is basically a copy of its iOS
smartphone software, and Microsoft holds patents that it
contends cover a number of Android features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google bought Motorola for $12.5 billion, partly to use its
large portfolio of communications patents as a bargaining chip
against its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robart will decide how big a royalty Motorola deserves from
Microsoft for a license on some Motorola wireless and video
patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple, for its part, is set to square off against Motorola
on Monday in Madison, Wisconsin, in a case that involves many of
the same issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Wisconsin, Apple and Motorola have filed most court
documents entirely under seal. U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb
did not require them to seek advance permission to file them
secretly, nor did she mandate that the companies make redacted
copies available for the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judges have broad discretion in granting requests to seal
documents. The legal standard for such requests can be high, but
in cases where both sides want the proceedings to be secret,
judges have little incentive to thoroughly review secrecy
requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Apple's Northern California litigation against Samsung,
both parties also sought to keep many documents under seal.
After Reuters challenged those secrecy requests, on grounds it
wanted to report financial details, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh
ordered both companies to disclose a range of information they
considered secret - including profit margins on individual
products - but not licensing deals. Apple and Samsung are
appealing the disclosure order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to questions from Reuters last week, Judge Crabb
in Wisconsin, who will also decide the case without a jury,
acknowledged she had not been paying attention to how many
documents were being filed under seal. Federal judges in Madison
will now require that parties file redacted briefs, she said,
though as of Wednesday, Apple and Motorola were still filing key
briefs entirely under seal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just because there is a seed or kernel of confidential
information doesn't mean an entire 25-page brief should be
sealed," said Bernard Chao, an intellectual property professor
at University of Denver Sturm College of Law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crabb promised that the upcoming trial would be open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whatever opinion I make is not going to be redacted," she
told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHECKING THE COMPS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft sued Motorola two years ago, saying Motorola had
promised to license its so-called "standards essential" patents
at a fair rate, in exchange for the technology being adopted as
a norm industrywide. But by demanding roughly $4 billion a year
in revenue, Microsoft says Motorola broke its promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robart will sort out what a reasonable royalty for those
standards patents should be, partly by reviewing deals Motorola
struck with other companies such as IBM and Research in
Motion - much like an appraiser checking comparable
properties to figure out whether a home is priced right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, though, the public may not be able to
understand exactly what figures Robart is comparing.
Representatives for Microsoft and Google declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its brief, Microsoft said licensing terms could be sealed
without the need to clear the courtroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Permitting redaction of this information will minimize the
harm to Microsoft and third parties while also giving due
consideration to the public policies favoring disclosure," the
company argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM and RIM have also asked Robart to keep licensing
information secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chao doesn't think Robart will ultimately redact his own
ruling, even though it may include discussion of the specific
royalty rates. "I can't imagine that," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most judges cite lack of resources and overflowing dockets
as the reason why they don't scrutinize secrecy requests more
closely, especially when both parties support them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Wisconsin, Crabb said that even though she will now
require litigants to ask permission to file secret documents, it
is highly unlikely that she will actually read those arguments -
unless someone else flags a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're paddling madly to stay afloat," Crabb said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wisconsin case in U.S. District Court, Western District
of Wisconsin is Apple Inc. vs. Motorola Mobility Inc.,
11-cv-178. The Seattle case in U.S. District Court, Western
District of Washington is Microsoft Corp. vs. Motorola Inc.,
10-cv-1823.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Nestle buying Pfizer infant nutrition unit for $11.85 bln&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* CEO says integration to be completed in about a month&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Says always open to acquisition opportunities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAUSANNE, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Nestle SA's $11.9
billion purchase of Pfizer Inc's baby food business has
won approval in China, taking the Swiss group a step towards
sealing a deal which still rests on months of bargaining with
antitrust authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked whether Chinese regulators had cleared the
transaction, Chief Executive Paul Bulcke said: "It was just this
week."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nestle is acquiring Pfizer's infant nutrition unit to
combine it with its existing infant formula business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bulcke, speaking on the sidelines of the inauguration of the
Nestle Institute of Health Sciences, said the Pfizer integration
was on track and could be completed in about a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nestle declined comment on whether the deal had been
approved in other countries or regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have said the company may have to sell up to 30
percent of the Pfizer businesses, including those in Latin
America, the Middle East and Asia, as part of an approval
process which may take up to 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are pleased that Nestle's acquisition of Pfizer
Nutrition has been approved in China," the company said. "The
acquisition is still subject to other closing conditions. We
therefore do not make any further comment at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bulcke also signalled Nestle could look at further deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have to look at how many opportunities are out there
... We're happy with what may come and we'll embrace that. We're
always open to opportunities," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if Nestle could do more deals of the size of the
Pfizer unit purchase, Bulcke said: "That's a big acquisition ...
we don't do that every day."&lt;/p&gt;

      Placement
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Westphalia Development Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) 
      announces that it has completed its final closing on its previously 
      announced private placement offering. The Corporation closed on 
      aggregate proceeds of $15,748,700 and issued 1,574,870 units at a price 
      of $10.00 per Unit under the private placement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The private placement consisted of a non-brokered private offering of up 
      to 2,007,700 units at a subscription price of $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit 
      is comprised of $5.00 principal amount of 8% unsecured, subordinated, 
      convertible, extendable debentures (the &#8220;Debentures&#8221;) and one 
      non-voting share of the Corporation having a price of $5.00 (the &#8220;Shares&#8221;).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As previously announced on August 21, 2012, the Corporation&#8217;s 
      wholly-owned subsidiary, Walton Westphalia Development (USA), LLC (the &#8220;US 
      Subsidiary&#8221;) entered into assignment and co-ownership agreements 
      with Walton Maryland, LLC (&#8220;Walton MD&#8221;) and Walton Westphalia 
      Europe, LP (&#8220;WWE&#8221;), an entity managed by the Walton Group of 
      companies. Under the agreements, WWE proposed to acquire from the US 
      Subsidiary up to a 30.67% undivided interest in the 310-acre Westphalia 
      development project located in Prince George&#8217;s County, Maryland, USA 
      (the &#8220;Property&#8221;).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Effective October 31, 2012, WWE acquired an additional 3.1% undivided 
      interest in the Property, for an aggregate ownership interest in the 
      Property of 14.4%. WWE paid the same purchase price per acre as the US 
      Subsidiary paid to acquire the Property plus other costs paid at 
      closing. The proceeds received from the sale of the interests in the 
      Property to WWE was used by the Corporation to repay a portion of the 
      related party loan provided by Walton International Group Inc. to 
      partially fund the purchase by the US Subsidiary of the Property. As of 
      October 31, 2012, this related party loan has been repaid in full as a 
      result of the aggregate proceeds raised under the private placement and 
      the sale of the further interests in the Property to WWE.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      All revenues and expenses incurred for development of the Property will

&lt;p&gt;* Says a mooring line fault occurred at offshore site&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Coincides with planned maintenance work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Emma Farge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GENEVA, Nov 2 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Chevron 
said on Friday that Angolan subsidiary Cabinda Gulf Oil Company
had declared force majeure at the Kuito offshore oil terminal on
October 29 due to a fault with a mooring line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is one of the west African country's top producers
and typically loads two 920,000 barrel tankers a month from its
Kuito platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Kuito operation is currently undergoing a planned
turnaround, and we do not anticipate any resulting production
impacts from this action," a company spokesman said in an
emailed statement, without giving an immediate comment on the
duration of the force majeure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that a mooring line had separated from a loading
buoy during a routine inspection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angolan loading programmes showed that Chevron was due to
load just one 920,000 barrel tanker in November, reflecting the
impact of the maintenance work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A force majeure allows a company to suspend contractual
obligations in the face of unexpected events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPEC member Angola is Africa's second largest producer after
Nigeria and typically exports around 1.8 million barrels per day
(bpd) of crude oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exports for November are slightly lower than average at
around 1.67 million bpd, partly due to lower Kuito output and
lower volumes on the Girassol grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 2 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp posted a drop in
quarterly profit on Friday as maintenance exacerbated a steady
decline in production from its oil and natural gas wells over
the past year and as a massive fire at one of its California
refineries hit the refining business.&lt;/p&gt;

      &#8220;This quarter&#8217;s earnings were solid, but off from their near record 
      level of a year ago,&#8221; said Chairman and CEO John Watson. &#8220;Crude oil 
      prices were down and we had a heavy period of planned oil field 
      maintenance which temporarily reduced oil and gas production in several 
      locations. Foreign currency movements also hurt our results this 
      quarter, while they benefited the year-ago period.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We continue to progress our upstream projects,&#8221; Watson added. &#8220;Gorgon 
      in Australia and Bigfoot and Jack/St. Malo in the deepwater Gulf of 
      Mexico are all over 50 percent complete. The Wheatstone Project in 
      Australia is also off to a good start. Each of these projects is 
      expected to deliver significant future value for our shareholders.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additional upstream milestones in recent months include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Australia &#8211; Completed the acquisition of additional interest in 
        the Clio and Acme fields in the Carnarvon Basin in exchange for 
        Chevron&#8217;s interest in the Browse development. Consolidating interests 
        in the Carnarvon Basin fits strategically with long-term plans to grow 
        the Wheatstone area resource base, and create expansion opportunities 
        for the Wheatstone Project.
      
			
				Australia &#8211; Completed the sale of an equity interest in the 
        Wheatstone Project to Tokyo Electric.

      &#8220;In the downstream, we continue to reposition the business toward high 
      growth chemical and specialty products and to sell non-core assets,&#8221; 
      Watson said. The company&#8217;s 50 percent-owned Chevron Phillips Chemical 
      Company LLC (CPChem) announced that its 35 percent-owned Saudi Polymers 
      Company began commercial production at its petrochemical project in Al 
      Jubail, Saudi Arabia. Also in the third quarter, the company completed 
      the sale of its idled Perth Amboy, New Jersey, refinery, which had been 
      operating as a terminal, and two of its fuels marketing businesses in 
      the Caribbean.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Watson noted that, while investing for long-term production growth, the 
      company remained focused on providing near-term shareholder returns as 
      well. The company purchased $1.25 billion of its common stock in the 
      third quarter 2012 under its share repurchase program.

      Worldwide net oil-equivalent production was 2.52 million barrels per day 
      in the third quarter 2012, down from 2.60 million barrels per day in the 
      2011 third quarter. Production increases from project ramp-ups in 
      Thailand, Nigeria and the United States were more than offset by the 
      effects of planned maintenance-related downtime, normal field declines, 
      continued shut-in of the Frade Field in Brazil, dispositions and 
      storm-related shut-ins in the Gulf of Mexico. The company expects 
      increased production in the fourth quarter 2012 compared to the current 
      quarter, reflecting the completion of planned turnarounds and 
      restoration of shut-in production in the Gulf of Mexico.

      U.S. upstream earnings of $1.12 billion in the third quarter 2012 were 
      down $386 million from a year earlier, primarily due to lower crude oil 
      and natural gas realizations and lower production.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company&#8217;s average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural 
      gas liquids was $91 in the third quarter 2012, down from $97 a year ago. 
      The average sales price of natural gas was $2.63 per thousand cubic 
      feet, compared with $4.14 in last year&#8217;s third quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net oil-equivalent production of 637,000 barrels per day in the third 
      quarter 2012 was down 25,000 barrels per day, or 4 percent, from a year 
      earlier. The decrease in production was associated with normal field 
      declines, an absence of volumes associated with Cook Inlet, Alaska, 
      assets sold in 2011, and the effects of storm-related shut-ins in 2012 
      in the Gulf of Mexico. Partially offsetting this decrease was further 
      ramp-up at the Perdido and Caesar/Tonga projects in the Gulf of Mexico. 
      The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production decreased 3 
      percent in the 2012 third quarter to 440,000 barrels per day, while net 
      natural gas production decreased 6 percent to 1.18 billion cubic feet 
      per day.

      International upstream earnings of $4.02 billion decreased $676 million 
      from the third quarter 2011. The decline between quarters was primarily 
      due to lower volumes and realizations for crude oil, as well as higher 
      exploration expense. Mostly offsetting these effects was a nearly $600 
      million gain on sale of an equity interest in the Wheatstone Project, 
      and lower tax items. Foreign currency effects decreased earnings by $252 
      million, compared with an increase of $304 million a year earlier.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The average sales price for crude oil and natural gas liquids in the 
      2012 third quarter was $98 per barrel, down from $103 a year earlier. 
      The average price of natural gas was $6.03 per thousand cubic feet, 
      compared with $5.50 in last year&#8217;s third quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net oil-equivalent production of 1.88 million barrels per day in the 
      third quarter 2012 was down 58,000 barrels per day from a year ago. 
      Production increases from project ramp-ups in Thailand and Nigeria were 
      more than offset by planned maintenance-related downtime, continued 
      shut-in of the Frade Field in Brazil and normal field declines.
			The 
      net liquids component of oil-equivalent production decreased 8 percent 
      to 1.25 million barrels per day, while net natural gas production

      and Ireland. An unfavorable change in effects on derivative instruments 
      also contributed to the lower earnings in the 2012 quarter. Foreign 
      currency effects decreased earnings by $43 million in the 2012 quarter, 
      compared with an increase of $148 million a year earlier.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Refinery crude oil input of 909,000 barrels per day increased 27,000 
      barrels per day from third quarter 2011. Total refined product sales of 
      1.56 million barrels per day in the 2012 third quarter were 2 percent 
      lower than a year earlier, primarily related to the sale of the 
      company&#8217;s refining and marketing assets in the United Kingdom and 
      Ireland. Excluding the impact of 2011 asset sales, sales volumes were 3 
      percent higher between periods.

      Reform Act of 1995
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			This press release contains forward-looking statements relating to 
      Chevron&#8217;s operations that are based on management&#8217;s current 
      expectations, estimates and projections about the petroleum, chemicals 
      and other energy-related industries. Words such as &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; 
      &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;targets,&#8221; &#8220;forecasts,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221;

      similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking 
      statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance 
      and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some 
      of which are beyond the company&#8217;s control and are difficult to predict. 
      Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what 
      is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. The 
      reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking 
      statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release. 
      Unless legally required, Chevron undertakes no obligation to update 
      publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new 
      information, future events or otherwise.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ 
      materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: changing 
      crude oil and natural gas prices; changing refining, marketing and 
      chemical margins; actions of competitors or regulators; timing of 
      exploration expenses; timing of crude oil liftings; the competitiveness 
      of alternate-energy sources or product substitutes; technological 
      developments; the results of operations and financial condition of 
      equity affiliates; the inability or failure of the company&#8217;s 
      joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and development 
      activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production 
      from existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; 
      potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned 
      projects; the potential disruption or interruption of the company&#8217;s net 
      production or manufacturing facilities or delivery/transportation 
      networks due to war, accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe 
      weather or crude oil production quotas that might be imposed by the 
      Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; the potential liability 
      for remedial actions or assessments under existing or future 
      environmental regulations and litigation; significant investment or 
      product changes under existing or future environmental statutes, 
      regulations and litigation; the potential liability resulting from other 
      pending or future litigation; the company&#8217;s future acquisition or 
      disposition of assets and gains and losses from asset dispositions or 
      impairments; government-mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, 
      industry-specific taxes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on 
      scope of company operations; foreign currency movements compared with 
      the U.S. dollar; the effects of changed accounting rules under generally 
      accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; and 
      the factors set forth under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; on pages 29 
      through 31 of the company&#8217;s 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In 
      addition, such results could be affected by general domestic and 
      international economic and political conditions. Other unpredictable or 
      unknown factors not discussed in this press release could also have 
      material adverse effects on forward-looking statements.

			Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer Announce New Data on Stroke 
      Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation to be Presented at American Heart 
      Association 2012 Scientific Sessions
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Data Include Key ELIQUIS Subanalyses from Pivotal ARISTOTLE Trial 
      and Real-World Data on Stroke Prevention Treatment in Atrial Fibrillation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bristol-Myers 
      Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) and Pfizer 
      Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced that a large number of data 
      presentations sponsored by the companies on ELIQUIS&#174; 
      (apixaban) and the treatment of atrial fibrillation will be presented at 
      the American Heart Association 2012 Scientific Sessions, November 3-7, 
      2012, in Los Angeles, California. Among the presentations are two 
      prespecified subanalyses from the ARISTOTLE trial: a more detailed 
      analysis of ISTH major bleeding with ELIQUIS versus warfarin and an 
      evaluation of the safety and efficacy of ELIQUIS versus warfarin in 
      patients with prior warfarin experience (warfarin-experienced compared 
      with warfarin-na&#239;ve). Also being presented is a subanalysis from 
      ARISTOTLE of the safety and efficacy of ELIQUIS versus warfarin in 
      patients with prior coronary artery disease. The ARISTOTLE trial 
      evaluated the efficacy and safety of ELIQUIS, an investigational 
      compound for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism, in patients 
      with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation compared with warfarin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Company-sponsored real-world data analyses providing relevant insights 
      on management of atrial fibrillation and experience with warfarin, such 
      as the correlation between bleeding and discontinuation, warfarin 
      outcomes in the real-world compared to trial data, and early ischemic 
      outcomes after warfarin initiation will also be presented.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Details on the ARISTOTLE data analyses and real-world data analyses at 
      the congress are as follows:

			About Atrial Fibrillation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia (irregular 
      heart beat). It is estimated that more than 5.8 million Americans and 6 
      million individuals in Europe have atrial fibrillation. The lifetime 
      risk of developing atrial fibrillation is estimated to be approximately 
      25 percent for individuals 40 years of age or older. One of the most 
      serious medical concerns for individuals with atrial fibrillation is the 
      increased risk of stroke, which is five times higher in people with 
      atrial fibrillation than those without atrial fibrillation. In fact, 15 
      percent of all strokes are attributable to atrial fibrillation in the 
      U.S. Additionally, strokes due to atrial fibrillation are more 
      burdensome than strokes due to other causes. Atrial fibrillation-related 
      strokes are more severe than other strokes with an associated 30-day 
      mortality of 24 percent and a 50 percent likelihood of death within one 
      year in patients who are not treated with an antithrombotic.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About ELIQUIS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ELIQUIS is the approved trade name for apixaban in Europe and the 
      proposed trade name in the U.S. ELIQUIS is not approved for the 
      prevention of stroke or systemic embolism in patients with atrial 
      fibrillation in any country. In May 2011, Bristol-Myers Squibb and 
      Pfizer announced the first regulatory approval for ELIQUIS in the 27 
      countries of the European Union plus Iceland and Norway for the 
      prevention of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in adult patients who 
      have undergone elective hip or knee replacement surgery.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The companies continue to progress the ELIQUIS application for stroke 
      prevention in atrial fibrillation based on the ARISTOTLE and AVERROES 
      studies. On September 21, 2012, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer Inc. 
      announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
      of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion 
      recommending that ELIQUIS be granted approval for the prevention of 
      stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation and with one or more risk factors for stroke. On September 
      26, 2012, The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) acknowledged 
      receipt of the ELIQUIS (apixaban) New Drug Application (NDA) 
      resubmission to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in adult 
      patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. The FDA has deemed the 
      resubmission a complete response to its June 22, 2012 Complete Response 
      Letter (CRL) that requested additional information on data management 
      and verification from the ARISTOTLE trial. The FDA Prescription Drug 
      User Fee Act (PDUFA) date is March 17, 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ELIQUIS is also being investigated in Phase 3 trials for the treatment 
      of VTE.

			About the Bristol-Myers Squibb/Pfizer Collaboration
		&lt;/p&gt;

      In 2007, Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb entered into a worldwide 
      collaboration to develop and commercialize ELIQUIS, an investigational 
      oral anticoagulant discovered by Bristol-Myers Squibb. This global 
      alliance combines Bristol-Myers Squibb's long-standing strengths in 
      cardiovascular drug development and commercialization with Pfizer&#8217;s 
      global scale and expertise in this field.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Dan Levine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Nov 2 (Reuters) - Two weeks before trial in a
high-stakes lawsuit pitting Google's Motorola Mobility unit
against Microsoft, Google made what has become a common request
for a tech company fighting for billions of dollars: a public
court proceeding conducted largely in secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google, like its counterparts in the smartphone patent wars,
is eager to keep sensitive business information under wraps --
in this case, the royalty deals that Motorola cuts with other
companies on patented technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such royalty rates, though, are the central issue in this
trial, which starts Nov. 13 in Seattle. U.S. District Judge
James Robart has granted requests to block many pre-trial legal
briefs from public view. Though he has warned he may get tougher
on the issue, the nature of the case raises the possibility even
his final decision might include redacted, or blacked-out,
sections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal experts are increasingly troubled by the level of
secrecy that has become commonplace in intellectual property
cases where overburdened judges often pay scant attention to the
issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Widespread sealing of documents infringes on the basic
American legal principle that court should be public, says law
professor Dennis Crouch, and actually encourages companies to
use a costly, tax-payer funded resource to resolve their
disputes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are plenty of cases that have settled because one
party didn't want their information public," said Crouch, an
intellectual property professor at University of Missouri School
of Law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech companies counter that they should not be forced to
reveal private business information as the price for having
their day in court. The law does permit confidential information
to be kept from public view in some circumstances--though the
companies must compellingly show the disclosure would be
harmful. Google argues that revelations about licensing
negotiations would give competitors "additional leverage and
bargaining power and would lead to an unfair advantage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robart has not yet ruled on Google's request, which includes
not only keeping documents under seal but also clearing the
courtroom during crucial testimony. It is also unclear whether
he will redact any discussion of royalty rates in his final
opinion. The judge, who will decide this part of the case
without a jury, did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOT PAYING ATTENTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp have been
litigating in courts around the world against Google Inc
 and partners like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd
, which use the Android operating system on their
mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple contends that Android is basically a copy of its iOS
smartphone software, and Microsoft holds patents that it
contends cover a number of Android features. Google bought
Motorola for $12.5 billion, partly to use its large portfolio of
communications patents as a bargaining chip against its
competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robart will decide how big a royalty Motorola deserves from
Microsoft for a license on some Motorola wireless and video
patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple, for its part, is set to square off against Motorola
on Monday in Madison, Wisconsin, in a case that that involves
many of the same issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Wisconsin, Apple and Motorola have filed the overwhelming
majority of court documents entirely under seal. U.S. District
Judge Barbara Crabb did not require them to seek advance
permission to file them secretly, nor did she mandate that the
companies make redacted copies available for the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judges have broad discretion in granting requests to seal
documents. The legal standard for such requests can be high, but
in cases where both sides want the proceedings to be secret,
judges have little incentive to thoroughly review secrecy
requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Apple's Northern California litigation against Samsung,
both parties also sought to keep many documents under seal.
After Reuters intervened to challenge the requests, on grounds
it wanted to report financial details, U.S. District Judge Lucy
Koh ordered both companies to disclose a range of information
that they considered secret -- including profit margins on
individual products -- but not licensing deals. Apple and
Samsung are appealing the disclosure order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to questions from Reuters last week, Judge Crabb
in Wisconsin, who will also decide the case without a jury,
acknowledged that she had not been paying attention to how many
documents were being filed under seal. Federal judges in Madison
will now require that parties file redacted briefs, she said,
though as of Wednesday Apple and Motorola were still filing key
briefs entirely under seal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just because there is a seed or kernel of confidential
information doesn't mean an entire 25-page brief should be
sealed," said Bernard Chao, an IP professor at University of
Denver Sturm College of Law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crabb promised that the upcoming trial would be open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whatever opinion I make is not going to be redacted," she
told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHECKING THE COMPS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft sued Motorola two years ago, saying Motorola had
promised to license its so-called "standards essential" patents
at a fair rate, in exchange for the technology being adopted as
a norm industrywide. But by demanding roughly $4 billion a year
in revenue, Microsoft says Motorola broke its promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robart will sort out what a reasonable royalty for those
standards patents should be, partly by reviewing deals Motorola
struck with other companies such as IBM and Research in
Motion -- much like an appraiser checking comparable
properties to figure out whether a home is priced right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet in this case, the public may not be able to understand
exactly what figures Robart is comparing. In addition to
Google's motion to seal those licensing terms, IBM and RIM have
also asked Robart to keep the information secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Competitors and potential counterparties to licensing and
settlement agreements would gain an unfair insight into IBM's
analyses," that company wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has supported Google's bids to seal documents in
the past, and vice versa, though Microsoft has not yet taken a
position on Google's latest request. Representatives for
Microsoft and Google declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chao doesn't think Robart will ultimately redact his own
ruling, even though it may include discussion of the specific
royalty rates. "I can't imagine that," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most judges cite lack of resources and overflowing dockets
as the reason why they don't scrutinze secrecy requests more
closely -- especially when both parties support them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Wisconsin, Crabb said that even though she will now
require litigants to ask permission to file secret documents, it
is highly unlikely that she will actually read those arguments
-- unless someone else flags a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're paddling madly to stay afloat," Crabb said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron is one of the west African country's top producers and typically loads two 920,000 barrel tankers a month from its Kuito platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Kuito operation is currently undergoing a planned turnaround, and we do not anticipate any resulting production impacts from this action," a company spokesman said in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angolan loading programs showed that Chevron was due to load just one 920,000 barrel tanker in November, reflecting the impact of the maintenance work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trade sources said that the force majeure was declared because of technical problems with mooring equipment at the Kuito site, located about 30 miles offshore. A force majeure allows a company to suspend contractual obligations in the face of unexpected events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPEC member Angola is Africa's second largest producer after Nigeria and typically exports around 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exports for November are slightly lower than average at around 1.67 million bpd, partly due to lower Kuito output and lower volumes on the Girassol grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Emma Farge; Additional reporting by Jonathan Saul in London, editing by William Hardy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Nov 1 (Reuters) - Two weeks before trial in a
high-stakes lawsuit pitting Google's Motorola Mobility unit
against Microsoft, Google made what has become a common request
for a tech company fighting for billions of dollars: a public
court proceeding conducted largely in secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, like its counterparts in the smartphone patent wars,
is eager to keep sensitive business information under wraps --
in this case, the royalty deals that Motorola cuts with other
companies on patented technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such royalty rates, though, are the central issue in this
trial, which starts Nov. 13 in Seattle. U.S. District Judge
James Robart has granted requests to block many pre-trial legal
briefs from public view. Though he has warned he may get tougher
on the issue, the nature of the case raises the possibility even
his final decision might include redacted, or blacked-out,
sections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal experts are increasingly troubled by the level of
secrecy that has become commonplace in intellectual property
cases where overburdened judges often pay scant attention to the
issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Widespread sealing of documents infringes on the basic
American legal principle that court should be public, says law
professor Dennis Crouch, and actually encourages companies to
use a costly, tax-payer funded resource to resolve their
disputes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are plenty of cases that have settled because one
party didn't want their information public," said Crouch, an
intellectual property professor at University of Missouri School
of Law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech companies counter that they should not be forced to
reveal private business information as the price for having
their day in court. The law does permit confidential information
to be kept from public view in some circumstances--though the
companies must compellingly show the disclosure would be
harmful. Google argues that revelations about licensing
negotiations would give competitors "additional leverage and
bargaining power and would lead to an unfair advantage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robart has not yet ruled on Google's request, which includes
not only keeping documents under seal but also clearing the
courtroom during crucial testimony. It is also unclear whether
he will redact any discussion of royalty rates in his final
opinion. The judge, who will decide this part of the case
without a jury, did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOT PAYING ATTENTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp have been
litigating in courts around the world against Google Inc
 and partners like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd
, which use the Android operating system on their
mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple contends that Android is basically a copy of its iOS
smartphone software, and Microsoft holds patents that it
contends cover a number of Android features. Google bought
Motorola for $12.5 billion, partly to use its large portfolio of
communications patents as a bargaining chip against its
competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robart will decide how big a royalty Motorola deserves from
Microsoft for a license on some Motorola wireless and video
patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple, for its part, is set to square off against Motorola
on Monday in Madison, Wisconsin, in a case that that involves
many of the same issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Wisconsin, Apple and Motorola have filed the overwhelming
majority of court documents entirely under seal. U.S. District
Judge Barbara Crabb did not require them to seek advance
permission to file them secretly, nor did she mandate that the
companies make redacted copies available for the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judges have broad discretion in granting requests to seal
documents. The legal standard for such requests can be high, but
in cases where both sides want the proceedings to be secret,
judges have little incentive to thoroughly review secrecy
requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Apple's Northern California litigation against Samsung,
both parties also sought to keep many documents under seal.
After Reuters intervened to challenge the requests, on grounds
it wanted to report financial details, U.S. District Judge Lucy
Koh ordered both companies to disclose a range of information
that they considered secret -- including profit margins on
individual products -- but not licensing deals. Apple and
Samsung are appealing the disclosure order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to questions from Reuters last week, Judge Crabb
in Wisconsin, who will also decide the case without a jury,
acknowledged that she had not been paying attention to how many
documents were being filed under seal. Federal judges in Madison
will now require that parties file redacted briefs, she said,
though as of Wednesday Apple and Motorola were still filing key
briefs entirely under seal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just because there is a seed or kernel of confidential
information doesn't mean an entire 25-page brief should be
sealed," said Bernard Chao, an IP professor at University of
Denver Sturm College of Law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crabb promised that the upcoming trial would be open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whatever opinion I make is not going to be redacted," she
told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHECKING THE COMPS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft sued Motorola two years ago, saying Motorola had
promised to license its so-called "standards essential" patents
at a fair rate, in exchange for the technology being adopted as
a norm industrywide. But by demanding roughly $4 billion a year
in revenue, Microsoft says Motorola broke its promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robart will sort out what a reasonable royalty for those
standards patents should be, partly by reviewing deals Motorola
struck with other companies such as IBM and Research in
Motion -- much like an appraiser checking comparable
properties to figure out whether a home is priced right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet in this case, the public may not be able to understand
exactly what figures Robart is comparing. In addition to
Google's motion to seal those licensing terms, IBM and RIM have
also asked Robart to keep the information secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Competitors and potential counterparties to licensing and
settlement agreements would gain an unfair insight into IBM's
analyses," that company wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has supported Google's bids to seal documents in
the past, and vice versa, though Microsoft has not yet taken a
position on Google's latest request. Representatives for
Microsoft and Google declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chao doesn't think Robart will ultimately redact his own
ruling, even though it may include discussion of the specific
royalty rates. "I can't imagine that," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most judges cite lack of resources and overflowing dockets
as the reason why they don't scrutinze secrecy requests more
closely -- especially when both parties support them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Wisconsin, Crabb said that even though she will now
require litigants to ask permission to file secret documents, it
is highly unlikely that she will actually read those arguments
-- unless someone else flags a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're paddling madly to stay afloat," Crabb said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 4 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc has cut the
number of employees it lists as partners to help streamline
expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman has reduced the number of partners to 407, down 31
from February, the bank said in a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, without identifying the
partners that had been dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becoming a Goldman partner is a coveted title on Wall Street
because of its prestige and lucrative compensation. Fewer
partners were named this year because of a broad decline in
Goldman's staff levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the end of 2010, the investment bank has cut 3,100
employees from its payroll, shrinking its workforce by 9
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2011, dozens of partners have left the investment bank,
including some high-profile executives such as David Heller and
Ed Eisler, two co-heads of Goldman's securities business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said 15 to 20
percent of Goldman partners typically leave the firm every two
years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Viniar said the bank has already finished most
of a cost-saving program that aims to reduce annual expenses by
$1.9 billion, by cutting staff and other non-compensation
expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has set aside $10.97 billion for compensation so far
this year, a 10 percent increase from a year ago. That equates
to $336,442 per employee, up 15 percent from $292,836 per worker
during the first nine months of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harvey Schwartz will take over from Viniar, the
longest-serving CFO on Wall Street, at the end of January.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;
            PG has a long history of responding to natural disasters. Seven 
            years ago, we launched Tide Loads of Hope, to provide much needed 
            free laundry services to families affected by Hurricane Katrina. 
            Today, the program includes the Tide Loads of Hope truck outfitted 
            with 32 energy-efficient Frigidaire&#174; Affinity&#8482; 
            washers and dryers. Collectively, Tide has washed over 49,000 
            loads of laundry for more than 35,000 families impacted by 
            disasters since the program launched. Duracell brings its reliable 
            power to communities affected by disasters through the Duracell 
            Power Relief program. Trailers, trucks and stationary units allow 
            victims of natural disasters to recharge, reconnect and recover by 
            providing the power they need to stay safe and connected with 
            what&#8217;s most important to them. As part of our overall effort to 
            touch and improve lives in the wake of disasters, the PG Mobile 
            Relief Unit provides mobile bathroom and shower facilities so that 
            people can shower and take care of other personal needs. We also 
            offer kits that contain essential personal care items like Ivory 
            bar soap, Pantene shampoo and Gillette razors in an effort to help 
            restore a sense of normalcy.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - "Star Wars" was the force behind Walt Disney's $4 billion purchase of producer George Lucas's Lucasfilm entertainment holdings. Not so far, far away is Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic, his award-winning special effects shop that will likely save Disney millions of dollars in costs for its big-budget movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ILM, started by Lucas in 1975 when he couldn't find a special effects house he liked for "Star Wars," has provided computer-generated dinosaurs, space ships and action characters for a roster of films that includes "Avatar," "Mission Impossible" and the "Harry Potter" series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As much as one-third of the cost of films with budgets of $200 million and more are for special effects, according to Janney Montgomery Scott analyst Tony Wible, who estimates ILM last year generated at least $100 million in revenue. Disney uses ILM's computer animators for its "Pirates of the Caribbean" series of films and Marvel-inspired characters for films like "The Avengers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ILM is among the companies producing special effects for the Disney film "The Lone Ranger," a 2013 release estimated to cost more than $200 million to produce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By bringing ILM in-house, Disney can shave as much as $20 million a year from its films' special effects budgets, a welcome savings at a time when all major studios are trying to rein in production spending, Wible said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's one of the underappreciated aspects of this deal," he said, along with Skywalker Sound, a Lucas sound production company that will also become part of the Disney empire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney executives, in a conference call with Wall Street analysts, scarcely mentioned ILM in explaining the company's valuation of Lucasfilm, instead describing its estimate of the company's rights to its consumer products and the declining value of DVD sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Bob Iger praised ILM's work for Disney and other studios. "Our current thinking is that we would let it remain as-is. They do great work," Iger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Disney spokesman said the company could not comment further about ILM or the rest of the acquisition until it is cleared by regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects house is headquartered in San Francisco at the Letterman Digital Arts Center, a Lucasfilm campus where a statue of Yoda perches atop an outdoor fountain. The effects company employs about 1,000 people between that location and sites in Singapore and Vancouver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studio provides effects for as many as 18 projects per year, working with all the major Hollywood studios that compete with Disney. That outside work beyond "Star Wars" will give Disney another revenue source from ILM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can handle quite a slate of films," Lucasfilm spokesman Miles Perkins said of ILM. "We look forward to continuing that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ILM also generates money by supplying effects for commercials by big-name brands Coca-Cola, Budweiser and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Disney's Iger, who prides his company as being among Hollywood's most forward thinking on new technology, the Lucasfilm buy might also provide another front for the media giant. Its computer-wielding artists could work with Disney's Imagineering unit, which creates many of the technologies the company uses at its theme parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucasfilm engineers created THX, which was designed to help theaters create the best sound for movies through a system that the Lucas company certifies meets its technical standards. THX, which was spun off from Lucasfilms in 2001, also certifies home entertainment systems, consumer electronic products and automobile sound systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hollywood studios have a generally poor record owning effects companies, said Scott Ross, a former general manager of ILM and one of the founders of effects company Digital Domain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney bought Dream Quest Images in 1996 and shuttered it five years later. Warner Bros. also has shut or sold off effects companies it acquired. Only Sony Corp has found success with its Imageworks effects unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studios usually discover that running an effects business is costly and foreign competitors can do the job cheaper, Ross said. "They come to the conclusion that running a visual effects company is not a profitable business," Ross said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger, in announcing the deal to Wall Street analysts, praised ILM's work and said he had no immediate plans to change it. "It's been a decent business for Lucasfilm and one we have every intention of staying in," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Lisa Richwine and Ronald Grover; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - "Master Chief" springs back into action on Tuesday with the release of Microsoft Corp's Halo 4, the latest installment of the Xbox blockbuster that will compete with Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty franchise for holiday-season bragging rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft hopes the return of the laconic green-armored super-soldier protagonist of Halo, which has generated $3 billion of revenue since its 2001 launch, after a five-year hiatus will bring out gamers in droves when the title begins selling in more than 40 countries starting midnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Halo series, made by Microsoft Game Studios, spearheaded the company's foray into gaming that began with the 2001 launch of the first Xbox. It has sold more than 46 million copies to date and helped the console lead the market ahead of Sony's Playstation and Nintendo's Wii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen if the well-reviewed game can revive flagging videogame sales or surpass "Call of Duty: Black Ops 2", which goes on sale next week and will vie for the title of 2012's top-selling game. The first-person shooter series is now the biggest title on the Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nintendo is also selling its new Wii U console, featuring a companion tablet controller, over the holidays. Microsoft's rival Activision Blizzard is set to release a dedicated Wii U version for its "Call of Duty: Black Ops 2" title when the new console hits stores on November 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because there hasn't been a game to star "Master Chief" for five years, there's a bit of a pent-up demand," said Ryan McCaffrey, Xbox Executive editor at videogame website IGN.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Call of Duty has taken over as the most popular game on the Xbox, so I think it will be very close," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Halo 4, "Master Chief" deals out death and destruction to evil aliens while embarking on a quest to save his longtime friend and artificial-intelligence construct Cortana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which has high hopes for the latest Halo, is pulling out the stops. Halo: Reach, the fourth game in the series sans Master Chief, was launched in September 2010 and raked in $200 million in global sales on launch-day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is hosting marquee events in cities from Seattle and Berlin to London - where the company will stage an as-yet-undisclosed stunt on the Thames river.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also held a massive launch event last week in the small country of Liechtenstein in Europe. Some historic landmarks and the countryside of the 62-square mile nation was transformed into a futuristic Halo-like universe and reporters were allowed to test the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GameStop Corp, the largest U.S. chain, is also planning midnight events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With less than 12 hours before the title's launch, GameStop spokeswoman Wendy Dominguez said fans had begun lining up outside a handful of stores, including at their Flower Mound, Texas outlet. Some dressed in Halo costumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They've either pre-ordered Halo or they're waiting to get their hands on a copy and they're pretty excited about it," Dominguez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Malathi Nayak; Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Nov 5 (Reuters) - "Star Wars" was the force
behind Walt Disney's $4 billion purchase of producer
George Lucas's Lucasfilm entertainment holdings. Not so far, far
away is Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic, his award-winning
special effects shop that will likely save Disney millions of
dollars in costs for its big-budget movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ILM, started by Lucas in 1975 when he couldn't find a
special effects house he liked for "Star Wars," has provided
computer-generated dinosaurs, space ships and action characters
for a roster of films that includes "Avatar," "Mission
Impossible" and the "Harry Potter" series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As much as one-third of the cost of films with budgets of
$200 million and more are for special effects, according to
Janney Montgomery Scott analyst Tony Wible, who estimates ILM
last year generated at least $100 million in revenue. Disney
uses ILM's computer animators for its "Pirates of the Caribbean"
series of films and Marvel-inspired characters for films like
"The Avengers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ILM is among the companies producing special effects for the
Disney film "The Lone Ranger," a 2013 release estimated to cost
more than $200 million to produce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By bringing ILM in-house, Disney can shave as much as $20
million a year from its films' special effects budgets, a
welcome savings at a time when all major studios are trying to
rein in production spending, Wible said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's one of the underappreciated aspects of this deal," he
said, along with Skywalker Sound, a Lucas sound production
company that will also become part of the Disney empire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney executives, in a conference call with Wall Street
analysts, scarcely mentioned ILM in explaining the company's 
valuation of Lucasfilm, instead describing its estimate of the
company's rights to its consumer products and the declining
value of DVD sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Bob Iger praised ILM's work for Disney and
other studios. "Our current thinking is that we would let it
remain as-is. They do great work," Iger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Disney spokesman said the company could not comment
further about ILM or the rest of the acquisition until it is
cleared by regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects house is headquartered in San Francisco at the
Letterman Digital Arts Center, a Lucasfilm campus where a statue
of Yoda perches atop an outdoor fountain. The effects company
employs about 1,000 people between that location and sites in
Singapore and Vancouver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studio provides effects for as many as 18 projects per
year, working with all the major Hollywood studios that compete
with Disney. That outside work beyond "Star Wars" will give
Disney another revenue source from ILM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can handle quite a slate of films," Lucasfilm spokesman
Miles Perkins said of ILM. "We look forward to continuing that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ILM also generates money by supplying effects for
commercials by big-name brands Coca-Cola, Budweiser and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Disney's Iger, who prides his company as being among
Hollywood's most forward thinking on new technology, the
Lucasfilm buy might also provide another front for the media
giant. Its computer-wielding artists could work with Disney's
Imagineering unit, which creates many of the technologies the
company uses at its theme parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucasfilm engineers created THX, which was designed to help
theaters create the best sound for movies through a system that
the Lucas company certifies meets its technical standards. T HX,
which was spun off from Lucasfilms in 2001, also certifies home
entertainment systems, consumer electronic products and
automobile sound systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hollywood studios have a generally poor record owning
effects companies, said Scott Ross, a former general manager of
ILM and one of the founders of effects company Digital Domain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney bought Dream Quest Images in 1996 and shuttered it
five years later. Warner Bros. also has shut or sold off
effects companies it acquired. Only Sony Corp has found

&lt;p&gt;* Manhattan federal judge allows parts of lawsuit to proceed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Case is one of many pending mortgage securities suits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Ruling could have impact on other cases against banks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Nate Raymond&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Nov 5 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co lost
a bid on Monday to dismiss a U.S. regulator's lawsuit accusing
the bank of misleading Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
 in their purchase of billions of dollars worth of
risky mortgage securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan pared down
parts of the lawsuit filed by the Federal Housing Finance Agency
but allowed other allegations in the case to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is one of hundreds of lawsuits filed by investors
and regulators related to mortgage-backed securities, which were
at the center of the 2008 financial crisis when they sank in
value during the housing downturn. Cote's ruling could have an
impact on other lawsuits by the FHFA against banks that packaged
mortgages and sold them to investors as securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FHFA has accused JPMorgan of falsely representing that
the mortgages underlying the securities followed underwriting
standards as they applied to the quality of the loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for JPMorgan did not immediately respond to a
request for comment on the ruling. FHFA representatives also
were not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case was one of 17 lawsuits that the agency, as
conservator for Fannie and Freddie, filed in September 2011
against Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc. and
other banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FHFA sued UBS AG in June 2011, contending that
the bank misled Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into buying $6.4
billion of subprime and other residential mortgage-backed
securities. In May, Cote denied a motion to dismiss that case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the JPMorgan case, the FHFA said Fannie and Freddie had
bought more than $33 billion in mortgage-backed securities
sponsored or underwritten by the bank or two other companies it
acquired, Bear Stearns &amp; Co Inc and Washington Mutual Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan contended FHFA didn't put forward enough facts to
back its allegations that the loans weren't underwritten
properly. It also contended the lawsuit was filed too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Cote on Monday ruled that FHFA's allegations "amply
support" its claim that the securitizations' offering documents
contained false statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge dismissed some of the agency's claims. The FHFA
had accused JPMorgan of fraud over statements in the offering
documents on owner-occupancy rates and loan-to-value ratios for
the mortgages supporting the securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cote said the only basis for a fraud claim was a comparison
between the figures in the offering documents and the results of
an analysis the FHFA conducted. The judge said the analysis
wasn't enough to support the allegation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Federal Housing Finance Agency v. JPMorgan Chase
&amp; Co., U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
York, 11cv06188&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  BIRMINGHAM, AL, Nov 05 (Marketwire) -- 
Walter Energy Inc. (NYSE: WLT) (TSX: WLT)


--  Reports net loss of $1.1 billion including non-cash impairment charges
--  Reports third quarter revenues of $612 million; Adjusted EBITDA of
    $117 million
--  Earns adjusted net income of $30 million, excluding impairment charges
--  Produces 3.33 million metric tons of metallurgical coal, up 47% from
    third quarter 2011

    

Walter Energy Inc. (NYSE: WLT) (TSX: WLT), the world's leading,
publicly traded "pure-play" producer of metallurgical (met) coal for the
global steel industry, today announced results for the third quarter
ended September 30, 2012.

    Revenues were $612 million in the third quarter of 2012 down from $689
million in the third quarter of 2011 due principally to lower pricing and
softening world demand. In the third quarter of 2012, the Company
reported a net loss of $1.1 billion or $16.97 loss per diluted share.
This loss includes estimated non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $1.1
billion or $17.05 per share primarily related to the 2011 acquisition of
Western Coal and a charge of $40 million associated with the abandonment
of a natural gas exploration project. Adjusted net income and adjusted
EBITDA excluding these non-cash charges were $29.8 million or $0.48 per
share and $117 million, respectively. Results for the third quarter also
included a $41 million tax benefit. 

    "Our operational results in the third quarter were encouraging as we
improved metallurgical coal production 14% as compared to the second
quarter, while lowering cash costs of production," said Walt Scheller,
Chief Executive Officer. "However, the recovery in the global economy and
metallurgical coal markets is uncertain. As a result we are focusing on
achieving further cost reductions, tightly managing capital spending and
reducing marginal production in order to improve our results and be well
positioned going into 2013." 

    Metallurgical Sales Volume and Pricing

    Third quarter of 2012 met coal sales volume including both hard coking
coal (HCC) and low-volatility (low-vol) PCI was 2.62 million metric tons
(MMTs), or 8% less than in the second quarter. Sales were impacted by
weaker worldwide demand and excess supply. HCC sales volume was 2.18 MMTs
in the third quarter of 2012 compared to 2.29 MMTs in the second quarter.
PCI sales volume was 0.44 MMTs, down from 0.55 MMTs in the prior quarter.

    The average third quarter 2012 selling price of HCC (primarily low-vol
and mid-vol) was $198 per metric ton (MT), which was slightly lower than
the second quarter's average price of $201 per MT. The average selling
price for low-vol PCI was $160 per MT as compared to $164 per MT in the
second quarter.

    Metallurgical Coal Production

    Met coal production was 3.33 MMTs in the third quarter of 2012, comprised
of 2.37 MMTs of HCC and 0.96 MMTs of low-vol PCI. Met coal production
increased 47% from the 2.27 MMTs produced in the third quarter 2011 and
was 14% higher than the 2.91 MMTs produced in the second quarter of 2012. 

    Canadian operations increased production to a quarterly record 1.61 MMTs
in the third quarter of 2012, compared to 1.19 MMTs in the second
quarter. Weak worldwide demand for PCI coal, however, resulted in a
significant increase in the Company's inventory levels in the third
quarter. The Company plans on reducing production and inventory during
the fourth quarter. 

    Cash Cost of Sales

    The consolidated cash cost of sales for HCC was $122 per MT in the third
quarter compared to $115 per MT in the second quarter of 2012. In U.S.
operations, the cash cost of sales for HCC increased to $119 per MT in
the third quarter, up from $107 per MT in the second quarter. The U.S.
operations sold a higher proportion of higher cost Mine No 4 production
in the quarter which had a negative impact on cost per MT. In Canada, the
cash costs of sales for HCC decreased 2% to $142 per MT in the third
quarter of 2012, as compared with $144 per MT in the second quarter of
2012.

    Cash cost of sales for low-vol PCI decreased 16% to $183 per MT in the
third quarter of 2012 as compared with $218 per MT in the second quarter
2012. The Willow Creek development mine represented 21% of the low-vol
PCI production and had average cash cost of sales of $290 per MT in the
third quarter. As the Willow Creek mine completed the majority of its
development work in the third quarter of 2012, costs at this mine are
expected to decline materially going forward. 

    Capital Expenditures

    The Company's capital expenditures were $85 million for the third quarter
of 2012 and $331 million for the first nine months of 2012. For 2013, the
Company currently expects capital expenditures of approximately $220
million. 

    Liquidity

    At the end of the third quarter 2012, available liquidity was $297
million, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $130 million plus
$167 million of availability under the Company's $375 million revolving
credit facility. 

    Safety and Stewardship Highlights

    Walter Energy's emphasis on safety continues to show results as the
majority of locations are achieving lower total reportable injury rates.
On a consolidated basis Walter's total reportable injury rate has
decreased by 22% on a year-to-date basis as compared with 2011.

    Walter is also pleased to report that in September 2012 the coal
processing facility at Mine No. 4 in Alabama received a certificate of
achievement in safety entitled Sentinels of Safety Award sponsored by the
National Mining Association for its outstanding safety record. The
processing facility achieved 156,217 employee hours worked without a lost
workday injury.

(1) Certain previously reported three months ended September 30, 2011
    balances have been recast to reflect the effects of finalizing the
    allocation of the Western Coal purchase price during the 2012 first
    quarter. Previously reported net income increased by $10.9 million and
    diluted earnings per share increased by $0.18 per share.
(2) The 2011 third quarter includes $6.1 million of costs associated with
    the acquisition of Western Coal.
(3) The 2012 third quarter includes a goodwill impairment charge of $1.1
    billion and an impairment charge of $40.0 million associated with the
    abandonment of a natural gas exploration project.
(4) The 2012 and 2011 third quarters primarily consist of losses on the sale
    and remeasurement to fair value of equity investments.
(5) The Company recognized an income tax benefit of $41.2 million for the
    three months ended September 30, 2012, compared to a tax provision of
    $30.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2011. For the
    2012 third quarter, the Company determined the current year income tax
    provision for Canada, U.K. and West Virginia operations using actual
    year-to-date financial results as compared to the estimated annual
    effective tax rate method utilized in 2011 resulting in a tax benefit.
    The current year income tax provision for the Alabama operations
    continues to be based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate
    method. The decrease in income tax expense is primarily due to the
    pretax operating loss for the three months ended September 30, 2012 as
    compared to pretax operating income for the same period of 2011.
(6) In periods of net loss, the number of shares used to calculate diluted
    earnings per share is the same as that used to calculate basic earnings 
    per share.

    operations continues to be based upon an estimated annual effective tax 
    rate method. The decrease in income tax expense is primarily due to the 
    pretax operating loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 as
    compared to pretax operating income for the same period of 2011.
(6) Discontinued operations includes the gain on the sale of our closed
    Kodiak operations, net of tax.
(7) In periods of net loss, the number of shares used to calculate diluted
    earnings per share is the same as that used to calculate basic earnings 
    per share.

(2) Average Cash Cost per Ton is based on reported Cost of Sales and
    includes items such as freight, royalties, manpower, fuel and other
    similar production and sales cost items but excludes depreciation,
    depletion and post retirement benefits. Average Cash Cost per Ton is a
    non-GAAP financial measure which is not calculated in conformity with
    U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and should be
    considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute or superior to
    financial measures calculated in conformity with GAAP. We believe Cash
    Cost per Ton is a useful measure as our management uses that as a
    measure of performance and we believe it aids some investors and
    analysts in comparing us against other companies to help analyze our
    current and future potential performance.

(4) Production and Average Cash Cost per Ton for our Willow Creek mining
    operations are separately provided for the current quarter as the Willow
    Creek mine is in the development stage and is experiencing higher
    average cash cost per ton than the other Canada mines.

(5) During the current quarter, in our Canadian and U.K. operations certain 
    metrics around tons included production were realigned to align with how
    we account for production in the U.S. operations.  Historically, the
    Canadian and U.K. operations were not recording tons produced until they
    were deemed finished goods.  We have revised this methodology to include
    all tons mined, no matter if in process or finished, as produced based
    on a clean coal tonnage equivalent.  The reconciliation below provides a
    comparison of production statistics of the earlier methodology as
    compared with the realigned methodology from the Western Coal
    acquisition date of April 1, 2011 through June 30, 2012 (in thousands

(2) EBITDA from continuing operations is defined as earnings excluding
    discontinued operations before interest expense, interest income, income
    taxes, and depreciation and depletion expense.
(3) EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest expense, interest income, 
    income taxes, and depreciation and depletion expense. EBITDA is a
    financial measure which is not calculated in conformity with U.S.
    Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and should be considered
    supplemental to, and not as a substitute or superior to financial
    measures calculated in conformity with GAAP. We believe that EBITDA is a
    useful measure as some investors and analysts use EBITDA to compare us
    against other companies and to help analyze our ability to satisfy
    principal and interest obligations and capital expenditure needs. EBITDA
    may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other
    entities.
(4) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding impairment charges.
    Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance in accordance 
    with generally accepted accounting principles, and items excluded from
    Adjusted EBITDA are significant in understanding and assessing our
    financial condition. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered
    in isolation, nor as an alternative to net income, income from
    operations, cash flows from operations or as a measure of our
    profitability, liquidity or performance under generally accepted
    accounting principles. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA presents a useful
    measure of our ability to incur and service debt based on ongoing
    operations. Furthermore, analogous measures are used by industry
    analysts to evaluate our operating performance. Investors should be
    aware that our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to 
    similarly titled measures used by other companies.
(5) Adjusted net income (loss) is defined as net income (loss) excluding
    income from discontinued operations, net of tax, and impairment charges.
    Adjusted net income (loss) is not a measure of financial performance in 
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and items
    excluded from Adjusted net income (loss) are significant in
    understanding and assessing our financial condition. Therefore, Adjusted
    net income (loss) should not be considered in isolation, nor as an
    alternative to net income (loss) under generally accepted accounting
    principles.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - An experimental Pfizer Inc cholesterol drug showed promise in a small midstage trial, putting the world's largest drugmaker in the race to develop a medicine from a promising new class, albeit behind similar programs by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Amgen Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug, RN316, which Pfizer acquired with its purchase of Rinat Neuroscience, is a PCSK9 inhibitor, a class of biotech medicines that has generated great excitement in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drugs work by blocking a protein that slows removal of bad LDL cholesterol from the blood and are considered potentially the most important advance in the field since widely used statin drugs, such as Pfizer's Lipitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 12-week trial of about 130 patients already on high doses of cholesterol-lowering statins, Pfizer's PCSK9 drug cut LDL cholesterol by 56 percent at the highest dose of 6 milligrams/kilogram of weight. The 3 mg/kg dose lowered LDL levels by 46 percent on top of statins, according to data unveiled on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barry Gumbiner, executive director of clinical research for Pfizer's PCSK9 program, said the results were somewhat misleading because any patient whose LDL level fell below 25 had doses withheld as a precaution, skewing the overall results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After four weeks, patients on the highest dose had LDL reductions of up to 80 percent before some had doses withheld, Pfizer explained. The data was presented at the American Heart Association scientific meeting in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PCSK9 drugs are intended for use by the millions of people who either cannot tolerate statins or cannot get their LDL levels down to target goals with statins and other drugs, including patients with a genetic condition that makes them predisposed to extreme, dangerously high cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have said the PCSK9 drugs could generate billions of dollars in annual sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pfizer drug was administered intravenously once every four weeks for a total of three dosings in the brief proof-of-concept trial. Subsequent trials will use a version injected under the skin, with the next Phase II study designed to determine which doses of the drug will be advanced into much larger, late-stage studies, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients on the higher doses who were not taken off the drug over the 12 weeks experienced sustained LDL level declines of 75 percent, said Gumbiner, who presented the data at the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug was also tested at doses of 0.25 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg against a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer researchers said the drug appeared to be well-tolerated, with no allergic reactions or safety issues of concern cropping up in the small study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Monday, U.S. biotech Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and its partner, French drugmaker Sanofi, announced plans to begin enrolling subjects in an 18,000-patient study to determine whether its PCSK9 drug can reduce heart attacks, strokes and death. That and an ambitious program that includes several smaller Phase III studies solidify Regeneron as the clear front-runner in the race to bring one of these new medicines to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amgen Inc, which is also aggressively pursuing a rival PCSK9 drug, is somewhat further along than Pfizer. The world's largest biotech company presented data from two Phase II studies at the heart meeting on Monday and planned to present the results of two more midstage trials on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sean Harper, Amgen's research chief, said in a telephone interview that the company expects to begin its Phase III trials early next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Berkrot and Deena Beasley; editing by Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Microsoft expects its newly launched Windows Phone to become a strong challenger in the smartphone market, Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's Android and Apple's iPhone devices dominate the smartphone market. However, Microsoft unveiled its Windows 8 products 10 days ago and Ballmer said that expects sales of Windows Phone to grow fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the work we have done with Nokia, HTC, Samsung and others ... there is now an opportunity to create really a strong third participant in the smartphone market," he said in Tel Aviv at Microsoft's first Windows 8 launch outside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are still relatively small ... I expect the volumes on Windows Phone to really ramp quickly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finnish phone maker Nokia last week launched its Windows 8-based Lumia smartphones, on which the company's recovery hopes rest. Nokia, once the world's biggest mobile phone manufacturer, last month reported an underlying loss for a third straight quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shipments of Android-based smartphones made by Samsung, HTC and other vendors nearly doubled in the third quarter, reaching 136 million units, according to industry research company IDC. The strong sales boosted Android's share of the worldwide smartphone market to 75 percent, from 57.5 percent in the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple's share of the market rose to 14.9 percent during the third quarter, from 13.8 percent a year earlier. Apple's iPhone uses the company's own iOS mobile software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said that there will be more marketing and advertising around Windows 8, its Surface tablet and Windows Phone than for any previous Microsoft products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also reiterated that Microsoft sold more than four million upgrades of Windows 8 in the first weekend after its launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The initial reaction to these products has been really really phenomenal ... And if you look at how people will get Windows 8, the truth of the matter is more people over time will get Windows 8 by buying a new computer than by upgrading old computers," Ballmer said, noting that 400 million personal computers are sold globally each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Steven Scheer; Editing by David Goodman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nov 5 - Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'AA+' rating to Microsoft Corp.'s
(Microsoft) senior unsecured note offering. The Rating Outlook 
is Stable. 

The ratings and Outlook reflect the following:

--Fitch anticipates modest revenue growth in fiscal year 2013 as the launch of 
Windows 8 and continued strength in the Server and Tools segment will be offset 
by macro headwinds and declines in PC unit volume in 2012. Fitch expects new PC 
product launches such as ultrabooks and hybrid PC/tablets will be successful and
strengthen Microsoft's competitive position relative to Apple.   

--Fitch expects the launch of the Surface tablet, particularly the Pro version, 
to be a commercial success given its compatibility with Microsoft Office 
applications, enhanced security and easier manageability, given the existing 
Windows installed base. However, free cash flow (FCF) contribution will likely 
be minimal in 2013, given the initial lack of scale and highly competitive 
landscape for tablets.    

--Fitch believes Microsoft's position in the mobile phone market has improved in
the past year due to Windows 8 licensing agreements with the vast majority of 
Android device manufacturers and original design manufacturers. Microsoft 
revenue is estimated at $5 to $15 per phone. While some market share gains are 
likely in the mobile phone market, the extent of the gains are highly uncertain,
and the ratings do not factor in any meaningful free cash flow contributions 
from these products.

 

--The company's Online and Entertainment &amp; Devices segments (Bing, Xbox, Skype, 
Windows Phone, etc) will continue to be a drag on profitability over the 
intermediate term. These segments remain a critical component of Microsoft's 
longer-term strategy in the consumer market, however, competition remains fierce
and Fitch does not expect these segments to contribute materially to FCF for the
foreseeable future.

--Fitch expects Microsoft to continue to produce strong FCF, in excess of $15 
billion per year, which the company utilizes to fund its share repurchase and 
dividend programs. Fitch expects cash generation from operations to be strong 
enough to pay for modest annual increases in both dividends and share 
repurchases over the next several years excluding potential for meaningful 
acquisitions. Fitch expects all repurchases will be done within the context of 
FCF.

--The company's sizable liquidity and superior credit profile provide a 
significant degree of financial flexibility within the current ratings. Going 
forward, Fitch believes Microsoft will become more active with acquisitions and 
share buybacks over time but continue to maintain a significant net cash 
position.

--Absent broader corporate tax reform, Fitch does not expect any negative 
outcome from Microsoft's recent tax hearings with the Senate Permanent 
Subcommittee on Investigations.

Credit Strengths:

--Leading market positioning in its core software businesses, including over 90%
in PC operating systems (OS) and 75% in servers.

--Very strong balance sheet with $66 billion in cash and short-term investments.
Microsoft generates nearly $1 billion in pretax income from interest and 
dividends alone.

--Diversification of end market with consumers and enterprise demand as well as 
strong geographic diversification. No customer is larger than 10% of revenue.

Credit Concerns:

--Reliance on Windows and Office for vast majority of FCF and potential high 
correlation between the two business segments if alternative operating systems 
take meaningful PC market share. Microsoft's Windows and Office segments account
for approximately 90% of total EBIT.

--Growing popularity of other operating systems outside of the core PC space, 
principally Apple's iOS as well as Google's Android and Chrome platforms. Fitch 
believes both platforms will continue to grow as competitive threats to Windows.

--Extensions of PC replacement cycles due to the popularity of tablets and 
smartphones. 

--Minimal historical success in developing profitable businesses outside of 
Microsoft's core Windows and Office ecosystem despite significant investment 
over a decade-plus in other consumer markets which Fitch believes is indicative 
of the challenging competitive environment Microsoft has targeted.

--Significant dividend and share repurchase programs, although funded entirely 
today by FCF, could pressure the company to issue increasing amounts of debt to 
avoid repatriation of foreign earnings, which represent the majority of total 
annual FCF.

WHAT COULD TRIGGER A RATING ACTION

Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to 
negative rating action include:

--Penetration of alternative operating system's such as Chrome OS in the PC 
market and/or greater market share gains by Apple.

 

--Greater than expected extensions of PC replacement cycles due to tablets, 
without a commensurate gain from Microsoft Surface. Fitch currently expects PC 
replacement cycles to extend on average up to 12 months.

--Greater acceptance of cheaper software applications that compete with 
Microsoft Office such as Google Docs.  

Positive: Upside movement on the ratings is unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Study Highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
			
		Recreational cocaine users may have higher blood pressure, stiffer arteries and thicker heart muscle walls than non-users &#8212; all of which can cause a heart attack.
			
		The Australian study is the first to document some of these cardiovascular abnormalities in seemingly healthy cocaine users long after the immediate effects of cocaine have worn off.
		&lt;p&gt;
			American Heart Association Meeting Report:
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	LOS ANGELES, Nov. 5, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- People who regularly use cocaine socially have stiffer arteries, higher blood pressure and thicker heart wall muscle than non-users, according to research presented at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Australian researchers used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure the effects of cocaine in 20 otherwise healthy adults who chronically used the illegal substance. Compared with 20 non-users, cocaine users had higher rates of multiple factors associated with higher risks of heart attack and stroke:&lt;/p&gt;
			
		30 percent to 35 percent increase in aortic stiffening;
			
		8 mm Hg higher systolic blood pressure; and
			
		18 percent greater thickness of the heart's left ventricle wall.
		&lt;p&gt;
	"It's so sad," said Gemma Figtree, M.B.B.S., D.Phil., lead researcher of the study. "We are repeatedly seeing young, otherwise fit individuals suffering massive heart attacks related to cocaine use. Despite being well-educated professionals, they have no knowledge of the health consequences of regularly using cocaine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"It's the perfect heart attack drug," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The combined effects of greater blood clotting, increased heart stress and more blood vessel constriction put users at high risk of a spontaneous heart attack, said Figtree, an associate professor of medicine at Sydney Medical School at the University of Sydney in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	A surge of cocaine-related infarcts at Sydney's Royal North Shore Hospital led the team to study the incidence of cardiovascular abnormalities in apparently healthy, regular cocaine users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Researchers recruited recreational cocaine users (17 men, 3 women, average age 37) who reported using cocaine at least once a month for the last year. They completed questionnaires about their drug use, cardiovascular risk factors and socioeconomic status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	At least 48 hours after their last cocaine use, volunteers had their blood pressure taken and then underwent cardiac MRIs to assess heart mass and levels of heart and aortic functioning. Researchers performed direct comparisons with similar aged non-users, taking into account history of diabetes, smoking and other drug use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	In the study, investigators observed higher systolic blood pressure and increased arterial stiffness, in association with heart wall thickening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Stiffer vessels are known to be associated with elevated systolic blood pressure.&#160; As a result, the heart is required to work harder, and its walls become hypertrophied or thicker," Figtree said.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Researchers didn't find evidence of earlier silent heart attacks among cocaine users, contrary to previous studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The study is the first to document persistent hypertension and vascular stiffness in cocaine users, long after the acute effects have worn off.&#160;Previous studies have shown the immediate effects of cocaine on the heart, and primarily among cocaine addicts &#8212; not social users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Although it is currently unclear how repeated social cocaine use causes blood vessels to stiffen, researchers are investigating a signaling pathway that might be activated to cause such a response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The study outcomes underscore the need for education about the short- and long-term effects of cocaine use to help prevent heart attack and stroke, Figtree said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Global Web Conferencing Market 2011-2015 with 
      Cisco Systems Inc., Citrix Systems Inc. and Microsoft Corp Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/rthk74/global_web) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Web Conferencing Market 2011-2015" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      TechNavio's analysts forecast the Global Web Conferencing market to grow 
      at a CAGR of 18.2 percent over the period 2011-2015. One of the key 
      factors contributing to this market growth is the increasing need for 
      information sharing among organizations. The Global Web Conferencing 
      market has also been witnessing increasing mergers and acquisitions. 
      However, interoperability issues could pose a challenge to the growth of 
      this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The other vendors included in the report are IBM Corp., Adobe Systems 
      Inc., and ATT Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from TechNavio's Telecom team said: 
      ''The Global Web Conferencing market is witnessing an increasing 
      adoption of web conferencing solutions by small and medium-sized 
      businesses (SMBs). The SaaS-based web conferencing model is gaining 
      popularity among SMBs. Therefore, vendors are re-evaluating their 
      product pricing to gain the maximum market share. In addition, vendors 
      are developing local language support to cater to SMBs in certain 
      countries where English is not the major language. Therefore, it will 
      become mandatory for vendors to provide support in local languages if 
      they want to increase their market share in this growing market in the 
      future.''
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, as a result of the increasing scope in business 
      and increasing advantages of globalization, enterprises are expanding 
      their businesses globally. This increases the demand for international 
      communication facilities for information sharing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report discusses that one of the major challenges is 
      interoperability because the compatibility of an existing system with a 
      new system is always a concern for end-users.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Nov 5 (Reuters) - JP Morgan has poached
David Clarkson from rival Credit Suisse to head its
prime brokerage business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clarkson's appointment comes after Teresa Heitsenrether, who
launched JP Morgan's European prime brokerage business in 2011,
left London to move to New York as global head this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan is one of several banks trying to expand into
prime broking - providing hedge funds with services such as
financing, stock lending and clearing of trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial crisis has encouraged many funds to widen
their prime brokerage relationships across multiple banks in an
industry previously dominated by Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan became a big player in the sector in the U.S. when
it acquired failed bank Bear Stearns in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global hedge fund assets under management slumped as the
financial crisis took hold but have since recovered and are now
back above $2 trillion. As a result, prime broking has not come
under the same pressures as other investment banking areas in
the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, increased capital requirements, new regulations and
reduced demand from hedge fund clients wanting to juice up bets
with borrowed cash - a big earner for banks - is still holding
back revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clarkson, who will report to Heitsenrether, was most
recently chief of staff in prime services at Credit Suisse, JP
Morgan said in a statement announcing his appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has also worked at Deutsche Bank as European
head of equity swaps and started his career as a chartered
accountant with Arthur Andersen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan ranks behind Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse as
the biggest supplier of prime brokerage services, according to
the inaugural global survey by data group Hedge Fund
Intelligence. Morgan Stanley lies fourth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Tova Cohen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TEL AVIV Nov 5 (Reuters) - Microsoft expects its
newly launched Windows Phone to become a strong challenger in
the smartphone market, Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said on
Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google's Android and Apple's iPhone
devices dominate the smartphone market. However, Microsoft
unveiled its Windows 8 products 10 days ago and Ballmer said
that expects sales of Windows Phone to grow fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the work we have done with Nokia, HTC, Samsung and
others ... there is now an opportunity to create really a strong
third participant in the smartphone market," he said in Tel Aviv
at Microsoft's first Windows 8 launch outside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are still relatively small ... I expect the volumes on
Windows Phone to really ramp quickly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finnish phone maker Nokia last week launched its
Windows 8-based Lumia smartphones, on which the company's
recovery hopes rest. Nokia, once the world's biggest mobile
phone manufacturer, last month reported an underlying loss for a
third straight quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shipments of Android-based smartphones made by Samsung
, HTC and other vendors nearly doubled in
the third quarter, reaching 136 million units, according to
industry research company IDC. The strong sales boosted
Android's share of the worldwide smartphone market to 75
percent, from 57.5 percent in the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple's share of the market rose to 14.9 percent during the
third quarter, from 13.8 percent a year earlier. Apple's iPhone
uses the company's own iOS mobile software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said that there will be more marketing and
advertising around Windows 8, its Surface tablet and Windows
Phone than for any previous Microsoft products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also reiterated that Microsoft sold more than four
million upgrades of Windows 8 in the first weekend after its
launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The initial reaction to these products has been really
really phenomenal ... And if you look at how people will get
Windows 8, the truth of the matter is more people over time will
get Windows 8 by buying a new computer than by upgrading old
computers," Ballmer said, noting that 400 million personal
computers are sold globally each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			MONEXT, An approved VISA Merchant Agent
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			MONEXT has become the first approved VISA Merchant Agent in France. 
      In other words, MONEXT is approved as a trusted third party on the VISA 
      website. This is the culmination of a process started 5 years ago, and 
      which certifies all of MONEXT PCI-DSS platforms. For its customers &#8211; 
      banks, merchants and e-merchants &#8211; this is the assurance of an 
      ultra-secure handling of bank data during the storage and transmission 
      of sensitive information.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			MONEXT admitted to the prestigious VISA Merchant Agent list
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With the increase in cyber-attacks to steal bank data from financial 
      intermediaries, the VISA network has announced that from January 1st, 
      2013, cyber-merchants and traditional merchants must use certified 
      platforms to host their transactional applications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a payment service provider, Monext has therefore obtained Visa 
      approval which attests to the protection of the cardholder data 
      according to the PCI DSS security standard. For MONEXT&#8217;s customers, both 
      small and large merchants, it is the assurance of securing all their 
      payment transactions without incurring any heavy financial investment 
      and thus continuing to benefit from the guarantees of the VISA network.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Monext&#8217;s key PCI-DSS-certified services
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This year again, our acquiring , issuing and payment solutions for 
      merchants have successfully renewed their PCI-DSS certification (Payment 
      Card Industry &#8211; Data Security Standard) which attests to MONEXT&#8217;s good 
      practices in terms of sensitive data management.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Concretely, Monext is a trusted third party for:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        The international issuing platform : prepaid, debit, credit and 
        corporate cards;
      
			
				3D secure: confidential code for securing Internet payments;
      
			
				Servicing, that is, the activity of two call centres: blocking 
        cards, cardholder assistance;
      
			
        International acquiring platform: for processing card payment 
        transactions in or to foreign countries;
      
			
				Payline : a secure online payment platform for e-merchants;
      
			
				Payavenue : to allow merchants to view and manage all their 
        payment transactions (bank cards, checks, etc.);
      
			
				Tokenization platform which allows customers to significantly 
        reduce the scope of certification by outsourcing PCI DSS compliance 
        requirements to Monext.

		&lt;p&gt;
      CACI International Inc (NYSE:CACI) 
      announced today that CACI Chairman of the Board Dr. J.P. (Jack) London 
      has been inducted as the 2012 Hall of Fame laureate at the Greater 
      Washington Government Contractor (GovCon) Awards at its gala held on 
      November 1st in Washington, D.C. Dr. London was recognized 
      for his lifetime achievement and long-term contributions to the industry 
      at a gathering of over 1,000 industry colleagues at the Wardman Park 
      Marriott Hotel. The GovCon Awards is the premier event honoring the 
      leadership, innovation, and commitment to excellence of the people and 
      businesses in the Washington, D.C. metro government contracting 
      community. 2012 marks the 10th anniversary of these 
      prestigious awards, which are sponsored by the Fairfax County Chamber of 
      Commerce, Professional Services Council, and Washington Technology.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dr. London is the 10th inductee to the Hall of Fame. He also 
      belongs to the Washington Business Hall of Fame and the Arlington, 
      Virginia Chamber of Commerce Business Hall of Fame, both lifetime 
      achievement awards honoring Dr. London&#8217;s major positive impact on the 
      business and civic life of these communities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dr. London&#8217;s selection recognizes his achievement in growing CACI from a 
      small consulting firm into a worldwide information solutions and 
      services company serving vital national needs in defense, intelligence, 
      homeland security, and the modernization of government. A market 
      visionary, Dr. London was the architect of CACI strategies that 
      continually positioned the company for growth in rapidly changing 
      business climates, while also helping to expand the region&#8217;s IT 
      capabilities. London's creation and leadership of a robust mergers and 
      acquisitions program has brought more than 50 acquisitions to CACI to 
      date. The company&#8217;s revenue has grown from $1.6 million in 1972, the 
      year London joined CACI, to nearly $4 billion today. Dr. London's 
      leadership in developing CACI&#8217;s reputation for its culture of ethics and 
      integrity is known throughout the industry.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company&#8217;s service as a national asset for national priorities is 
      demonstrated by its dedicated focus on supporting the men and women in 
      the U.S. Armed Forces, both in-theatre and when they return home. CACI&#8217;s 
      work with organizations such as Cause (Comfort for America&#8217;s Uniformed 
      Services) has helped serve the needs of wounded service members. And the 
      company&#8217;s award-winning Deploying Talent &#8211; Creating Careers 
      program hires veterans with disabilities and provides them with 
      opportunities to use their unique skill sets to build careers. In the 
      arena of community service, the CACI Cares initiative is a company-wide 
      effort to promote and advance philanthropic activities. After more than 
      50 years of service to the federal government and our nation, CACI Cares 
      complements the company&#8217;s business-driven initiatives.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In his remarks made when accepting the award, Dr. London thanked the 
      near 15,000 people of CACI, pointing out, &#8220;One of the lessons I learned 
      early was that the reason you lead is not to be admired, but rather it&#8217;s 
      because you admire and respect the people you lead. That&#8217;s why I thank 
      the remarkable employees of CACI &#8211; past, present, and future &#8211; who are 
      on the front lines with our clients, who are the drivers of our 
      innovation and the implementers of our goals.&#160;They embody CACI&#8217;s 
      reputation for its culture of integrity and excellence. They are the 
      greatest part of CACI&#8217;s success.&#160;For that, I extend my deepest 
      appreciation &#8211; and admiration &#8211; to them all.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CACI President and Chief Executive Officer Dan Allen noted, &#8220;We all 
      congratulate Dr. London on joining the Hall of Fame at the Greater 
      Washington Government Contractor Awards. For more than 40 years, Jack 
      has been a leader everyone at CACI emulates and respects. His induction 
      recognizes the government contracting community&#8217;s high esteem for his 
      business acumen and the high ethical standards he champions.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Nov 05 (Marketwire) -- 
For companies operating in the money center banks industry, such as
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and KeyCorp, the recent disruptions caused by
Super-storm Sandy have made quite a stir. As offices in the area begin to
open up once again, a number of industry players have recently announced
their commitment to waiving and refunding a variety of fees for the
affected period. StBulls.com has initiated technical analysis on JPMorgan
Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) and KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) which serves the Money
Center Banks industry. These reports are free upon registration. Rest

    Stronger economic growth is important to money center banks, but the
wider effect of the hurricane on the economic recovery in the U.S.
remains unclear. Estimates predict a $25 billion cut in output for the
fourth quarter, as millions of employees were forced to stay home and
innumerable businesses shut down. Read our technical analysis on JPMorgan
Chase &amp; Co. by clicking on 

    http://www.stbulls.com/JPMorganChaseandCo05112012.pdf 

    During the third quarter, money center banks like KeyCorp seem to have
enjoyed some positive trends. However, some were negatively impacted by
one time charges and higher mortgage repurchase costs. Many continue to
report modest loan growth and improved non-interest income, while in some
cases strong mortgage banking results have also propelled companies
forward. Investors looking for technical analysis on KeyCorp are

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) has cut the number of employees it lists as partners to help streamline expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman has reduced the number of partners to 407, down 31 from February, the bank said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, without identifying the partners that had been dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becoming a Goldman partner is a coveted title on Wall Street because of its prestige and lucrative compensation. Fewer partners were named this year because of a broad decline in Goldman's staff levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the end of 2010, the investment bank has cut 3,100 employees from its payroll, shrinking its workforce by 9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2011, dozens of partners have left the investment bank, including some high-profile executives such as David Heller and Ed Eisler, two co-heads of Goldman's securities business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said 15 to 20 percent of Goldman partners typically leave the firm every two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Viniar said the bank has already finished most of a cost-saving program that aims to reduce annual expenses by $1.9 billion, by cutting staff and other non-compensation expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has set aside $10.97 billion for compensation so far this year, a 10 percent increase from a year ago. That equates to $336,442 per employee, up 15 percent from $292,836 per worker during the first nine months of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harvey Schwartz will take over from Viniar, the longest-serving CFO on Wall Street, at the end of January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sakthi Prasad and Lauren Tara LaCapra; Editing by Ryan Woo)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  SUGAR LAND, TX, Nov 05 (Marketwire) -- 
Researched by Industrial Info Resources (Sugar Land, Texas) -- Chevron
Corporation (NYSE:CVX) (San Ramon, California) saw declines in revenues
and profits in the third quarter of 2012, as crude oil prices dropped and
the company conducted a large amount of planned maintenance in its
fields, which reduced the overall output of oil and gas. Net income for
the quarter was reported to be $5.25 billion, a 32.9% decrease from the
third quarter of 2011. Industrial Info is tracking more than $100 billion
in active projects involving Chevron.

&lt;p&gt;TEL AVIV Nov 5 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp Chief
Executive Steve Ballmer said Windows Phone 8 being launched with
its partners would create a strong third player in the
smartphone market and sell quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With the work we have done with Nokia, HTC, Samsung and
others ... there is now an opportunity to create really a strong
third participant in the smartphone market," Ballmer said at an
event to launch Microsoft's Windows 8 operating system in
Israel, referring to Google's Android and Apple's iOS platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're still relatively small ... I expect the volumes on
Windows Phone to really ramp quickly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said Microsoft will do more marketing and
advertising around Windows 8, its Surface tablet and Windows
Phone than any products the company had ever done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Tuesday approved Pfizer Inc's Xeljanz treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, one of the company's most potentially lucrative experimental drugs, which is now poised to compete with Abbott Laboratories Inc's top-selling Humira.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it had approved Pfizer's pill for patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis who have not benefited from or been able to tolerate the standard oral treatment, methotrexate. Xeljanz can be used by itself or in combination with methotrexate and certain other standard treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry analysts have predicted Pfizer's drug, which works differently from current treatments and is better known by its chemical name tofacitinib, could eventually capture annual sales of up to $3 billion. The revenue is sorely needed, amid plunging sales of its Lipitor cholesterol fighter and other Pfizer medicines facing cheaper generics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a twice-daily pill, Xeljanz could prove more attractive to some patients than Abbott's $8 billion-a-year Humira, which is given by injection every other week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Abbott has said Humira sales will continue growing by leaps and bounds, despite competition from Xeljanz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is understandable why (new) patients might prefer an oral therapy versus one that requires needle-based delivery," Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note. He added that patients already benefiting from other medicines are unlikely to switch to a new product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA approved a 5 milligram dose of Xeljanz, given twice a day. But the agency said further safety data are needed to assess a 10 milligram, twice-daily dose, that Pfizer had also put before regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anderson said Xeljanz will likely cost $25,000 a year, in line with injectable medicines. Besides Humira, the injectables include Amgen Inc's Enbrel and Johnson &amp; Johnson's Remicade -- all three of which work by blocking a protein called tumor necrosis factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anderson predicted the Pfizer pill, approved two weeks before Wall Street expected, will generate peak annual sales of at least $2.5 billion. Sales could be considerably higher, he said, if Xeljanz is also eventually approved for psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease and other inflammatory conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis and related diseases have been one of the most lucrative segments for drugmakers, with more than $20 billion in annual sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue, causing inflammation and pain in the joints. It affects an estimated 1.5 million Americans, the FDA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An estimated 30 percent to 40 percent of patients with rheumatoid arthritis do not respond to available drugs, meaning there is room for other options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's drug works by blocking molecules called Janus kinases which are linked to joint inflammation. The drug was associated with an increased risk of serious infections, tuberculosis, cancers and lymphoma. Humira, Embrel and Remicade also make patients more prone to serious infections and other complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA said it approved the drug with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, requiring safety information on the drug's package insert label and a communication plan to inform healthcare workers about its risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency is also requiring Pfizer to conduct a postmarketing study to evaluate the drug's long terms effects on heart disease, cancer and serious infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares rose 1.5 percent in after-hours trade to $25.09.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Leslie Adler, David Gregorio and Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

      (tofacitinib citrate) and Invitation to Media Briefing from Pfizer
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) has received approval from the U.S. Food and 
      Drug Administration (FDA) for XELJANZ&#174; (tofacitinib citrate) 
      5 mg twice daily for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely 
      active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have had an inadequate response or 
      intolerance to methotrexate. XELJANZ may be used as monotherapy or in 
      combination with methotrexate or other non-biologic disease-modifying 
      antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). XELJANZ should not be used in combination 
      with biologic DMARDs or with potent immunosuppressives, such as 
      azathioprine and cyclosporine.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      XELJANZ (ZEL'jans') is the first approved RA treatment in a new class of 
      medicines known as Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and the first new oral 
      DMARD approved for RA in more than 10 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On November 6, at 6:00 P.M. ET, Pfizer will convene a panel, including 
      Pfizer leadership and a prominent RA expert, to discuss the implications 
      of having an additional treatment option for RA patients and 
      rheumatologists. These panelists will be available for a QA session

        It is not known if XELJANZ is safe and effective in children.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Important Safety Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				XELJANZ can lower the ability of the immune system to fight 
        infections. Some people have serious infections while taking XELJANZ, 
        including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, 
        or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died 
        from these infections. Healthcare providers should test patients for 
        TB before starting XELJANZ, and monitor them closely for signs and 
        symptoms of TB and other infections during treatment.
			
			
				XELJANZ may increase the risk of certain cancers by changing the 
        way the immune system works. Lymphoma and other cancer can happen in 
        patients taking XELJANZ.
			
			
        Some people taking XELJANZ get tears in their stomach or intestines. 
        Patients should tell their healthcare providers right away if they 
        have fever and stomach-area pain that does not go away or a change in 
        bowel habits.
      
			
        XELJANZ can cause changes in certain lab test results including low 
        blood cell counts, increases in certain liver tests and increases in 
        cholesterol levels. Normal cholesterol levels are important to good 
        heart health. Healthcare providers may stop XELJANZ treatment because 
        of changes in blood cell counts or liver test results.
      
			
        Patients should tell their healthcare providers if they plan to become 
        pregnant or are pregnant.
      
			
        It is not known if XELJANZ will harm an unborn baby. To monitor the 
        outcomes of pregnant women exposed to XELJANZ, a pregnancy registry 
        has been established. Physicians are encouraged to register patients 
        and pregnant women are encouraged to register themselves by calling 
        1-877-311-8972.
      
			
				&lt;p&gt;
          Patients should tell their healthcare providers if they plan to 
          breastfeed or are breastfeeding. Patients and their healthcare 
          providers should decide if they will take XELJANZ or breastfeed. 
          They should not do both.
        &lt;/p&gt;
			
			
        In carriers of the hepatitis B or C virus (viruses that affect the 
        liver), the virus may become active while using XELJANZ. Healthcare 
        providers may do blood tests for hepatitis before and during treatment 
        with XELJANZ.
      
			
        Common side effects include upper respiratory tract infections (common 
        cold, sinus infections), headache, diarrhea, nasal congestion, sore 
        throat and runny nose (nasopharyngitis).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York, Nov. 6, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MicroEdge, LLC, the leading provider of solutions to the giving
community worldwide, has announced plans to certify its products on
the newly released version of Microsoft's Windows operating
system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft released Windows 8 and Internet Explorer 10 to the
market on Friday, October 26, 2012.&#160; MicroEdge has been
working to ensure its products will be certified on the new
operating system and browser in a timely manner.&#160; The company
has been testing with beta versions of Windows 8 and Internet
Explorer 10, and will soon be moving forward to roll out
certification for many of its products, including GIFTS, GIFTS
Alta, GIFTS Online, IGAM, ReviewerCONNECT, GIFTS Plus Pack, FIMS,
DonorCentral, MyGIFTS and AngelPoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MicroEdge will announce these certifications as they are
available, beginning in the first quarter of 2013. Many of the
major systems manufacturers continue to offer Windows 7 on new PC
purchases, so MicroEdge clients purchasing new systems can remain
on currently certified operating systems; however, if new systems
are purchased with the new operating system, MicroEdge will support
all clients that adopt Windows 8 prior to the product
certification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;"Technology is constantly changing," says MicroEdge CEO,
Preston McKenzie. "As a software provider, we understand that it is
imperative for us to keep up with these changes so that the
business operations of our clients can continue to run seamlessly
and with little to no interruption.&#160; Planning ahead for major
releases such as Windows 8 will allow us to do that.&#160; Because
we have been planning for this release for some time, we expect a
smooth transition to this new operating system. "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

			Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated Reports Third Quarter and First 
      Nine Months 2012 Results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated (NASDAQ: COKE) today announced it 
      earned $10.1 million, or basic net income per share of $1.09, on net 
      sales of $419.9 million for the third quarter of 2012, compared to net 
      income of $9.8 million, or basic net income per share of $1.06, on net 
      sales of $405.9 million for the third quarter of 2011. The results for 
      the third quarter of 2012 included $0.6 million of after-tax gains ($1.0 
      million on a pre-tax basis) due to mark-to-market adjustments on 
      aluminum hedges and a $0.4 million increase in income tax expense due to 
      recording a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets. The 
      results for the third quarter of 2011 included $1.1 million of after-tax 
      losses ($1.8 million on a pre-tax basis) due to mark-to-market 
      adjustments on fuel and aluminum hedges and a $0.9 million net decrease 
      in tax expense related to changes in reserves for uncertain tax 
      positions and other income tax changes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On a comparable basis, the Company earned $9.8 million in the third 
      quarter of 2012, or comparable basic net income per share of $1.06, 
      versus $10.0 million in the third quarter of 2011, or comparable basic 
      net income per share of $1.09.

      J. Frank Harrison, III, Chairman and CEO, said, &#8220;We are pleased to 
      report solid growth in our revenue and gross margin for both the third 
      quarter and year-to-date 2012. Growing revenue and gross margin are 
      essential for our long-term success. The revenue growth was driven by a 
      slight volume increase, primarily in our still beverage portfolio, and 
      modest price increases. Our gross margin growth was attributable to both 
      higher pricing and lower than expected increases in our raw material 
      costs. We continue to focus our efforts on innovation, process 
      improvements and efficiency in our operations to continue to be able to 
      grow revenue and gross margin.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Henry W. Flint, President and COO, added, &#8220;We are pleased with our 
      positive results for 2012 which have been achieved in an extremely 
      competitive environment. Driving increases in both volume and price in 
      this competitive environment is a testament to the strength of our 
      brands and outstanding execution by our people. On a comparable basis, 
      our net income and earnings per share were down from the prior year due 
      to higher S,DA costs. Our increased S,DA costs related primarily to 
      higher wages and related benefits costs, increased marketing spending to 
      support our brands, and investments in technology to help drive 
      continued operational improvement and efficiency.&#8221;

			Included in this news release and other information that we make 
      publicly available from time to time are forward-looking management 
      comments and other statements that reflect management&#8217;s current outlook 
      for future periods.
			These statements include, among others, 
      statements regarding the focus of our efforts on innovation, process 
      improvements and efficiency in our operations to continue to be able to 
      grow revenue and gross margin and investments in technology to help 
      drive continued operational improvement and efficiency.

			These statements and expectations are based on currently available 
      competitive, financial and economic data along with our operating plans 
      and are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause 
      anticipated events not to occur or actual results to differ materially 
      from historical or anticipated results.
			Among the events or 
      uncertainties which could adversely affect future periods are: lower 
      than expected selling pricing resulting from increased marketplace 
      competition; changes in how significant customers market or promote our 
      products; changes in our top customer relationships; changes in public 
      and consumer preferences related to nonalcoholic beverages; unfavorable 
      changes in the general economy; miscalculation of our need for 
      infrastructure investment; our inability to meet requirements under 
      beverage agreements; material changes in the performance requirements 
      for marketing funding support or our inability to meet such 
      requirements; decreases from historic levels of marketing funding 
      support; changes in The Coca-Cola Company&#8217;s and other beverage 
      companies&#8217; levels of advertising, marketing and spending on brand 
      innovation; the inability of our aluminum can or plastic bottle 
      suppliers to meet our purchase requirements; our inability to offset 
      higher raw material costs with higher selling prices, increased 
      bottle/can sales volume or reduced expenses; consolidation of raw 
      material suppliers could impact our profitability; increased purchases 
      of finished goods subject us to incremental risks that could impact our 
      profitability; sustained increases in fuel costs or our inability to 
      secure adequate supplies of fuel; sustained increases in workers&#8217; 
      compensation, employment practices and vehicle accident claims costs; 
      sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits; product liability 
      claims or product recalls; technology failures; changes in interest 
      rates; the impact of debt levels on operating flexibility and access to 
      capital and credit markets; adverse changes in our credit rating 
      (whether as a result of our operations or prospects or as a result of 
      those of The Coca-Cola Company or other bottlers in the Coca-Cola 
      system); changes in legal contingencies; legislative changes affecting 
      our distribution and packaging; adoption of significant product labeling 
      or warning requirements; additional taxes resulting from tax audits; 
      natural disasters and unfavorable weather; global climate change or 
      legal or regulatory responses to such change; issues surrounding labor 
      relations; bottler system disputes; our use of estimates and 
      assumptions; changes in accounting standards; impact of obesity and 
      health concerns on product demand; public policy challenges regarding 
      the sale of soft drinks in schools; the impact of volatility in the 
      financial markets on access to the credit markets; the impact of 
      acquisitions of bottlers by their franchisors; and the concentration of 
      our capital stock ownership.
			The forward-looking statements in 
      this news release should be read in conjunction with the more detailed 
      descriptions of the above factors located in our Annual Report on Form 
      10-K for the year ended January 1, 2012 under Part I, Item 1A &#8220;Risk

&lt;p&gt;Nov 6 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Tuesday approved Pfizer
Inc's Xeljanz treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, one of
the company's most potentially lucrative experimental drugs,
which is now poised to compete with Abbott Laboratories Inc's
 top-selling  Humira.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in a release it
had approved Pfizer's pill for patients with moderate to severe
rheumatoid arthritis who have not benefited from or been able to
tolerate the standard oral treatment, methotrexate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry analysts have predicted Pfizer's drug, better known
by its chemical name tofacitinib, could garner annual peak sales
of up to $3 billion. As a pill, it could prove more attractive
to some patients than Abbott's $8 billion-a-year injectable
Humira. Abbott has said the Pfizer drug poses no major
competitive threat to its flagship product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said
on Tuesday it has approved a new drug to treat rheumatoid
arthritis developed by Pfizer Inc, two weeks ahead of
the date the agency was expected to complete its review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug, Xeljanz, known generically as tofacitinib, is
approved to treat adults with moderate to severe arthritis who
cannot take, or have an inadequate response to, methotrexate, a
standard rheumatoid arthritis treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease in which the
body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue, causing
inflammation and pain in the joints. It affects an estimated 1.5
million Americans, the FDA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's drug works by blocking molecules called Janus
kinases which are implicated in joint inflammation. The drug was
associated with an increased risk of serious infections,
tuberculosis, cancers and lymphoma. It carries a boxed warning,
the most serious available, related to its side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overview
     -- In our view, metallurgical coal prices, which have declined 
dramatically in 2012, are likely to remain low in 2013 because of slower 
global steel production. 
     -- Low coal prices as well as initially high costs at recently acquired 
Canadian mines are likely to drive U.S.-based miner Walter Energy Inc.'s 
leverage to about 5x EBITDA.
     -- We lowered our ratings on Walter Energy Inc., including its corporate 
credit rating to 'B+' from 'BB-'. 
     -- The negative outlook reflects the potential for another downgrade if 
global economic conditions weaken further and cause the company to maintain 
leverage above 5x and strain its liquidity.
 
Rating Action
On Nov. 6, 2012, Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services lowered its corporate 
credit rating on Walter Energy Inc. to 'B+' from 'BB-'. At the same time, we 
lowered our rating on the company's senior secured bank debt to 'B+' from 
'BB-'. Our recovery rating on the secured bank debt remains unchanged at '3' 
and indicates our expectation for meaningful (50%-70%) recovery in the event 
of default. The outlook remains negative.

Rationale
The downgrade reflects our expectation that Walter Energy's leverage will 
climb to about 5x next year due to sharply lower metallurgical (met) coal 
prices, as well as higher-than-expected operating costs at its recently 
acquired Canadian mines. This is well above our previous expectations and 
indicative of an "aggressive" financial risk profile, in our view. These 
conditions caused the company to write down all $1.1 billion of goodwill 
related to its 2011 acquisition of Western Coal Corp. and negotiate more 
flexibility under restrictive leverage covenants governing its revolving 
credit facility. We are maintaining our negative outlook on the company given 
difficult market conditions and the company's significant capital expenditure 
needs.

Our ratings on Birmingham, Ala.-based Walter Energy reflect our view of the 
company's "weak" business risk and its aggressive financial risk. Key risks 
include a cyclical slowdown in steel production that is suppressing demand for 
met coal, a high reliance on a single Southern Appalachian mining complex for 
most of its operating income, and elevated debt levels related to the 
company's $3.3 billion acquisition of Western Coal Corp. Still, we maintain 
our view that Walter Energy's coal reserves are of a very high quality and 
that its mining costs are comparably low. Therefore, we expect its credit 
metrics to improve when this cycle turns and met coal prices rebound, though 
the timing of a recovery is uncertain.

The third quarter (2012) benchmark met coal price (against which Walter Energy 
and other producer's prices are pegged) dropped to $225 per metric ton, down 
29% from a year earlier. Fourth-quarter benchmark prices fell further to $170 
per metric ton, with spot prices even lower. Given this price environment, we 
expect Walter Energy's EBITDA to drop below $550 million in 2012--even if the 
company hits the upper end of its production guidance (13 million tons). This 
is down from our previous EBITDA estimate of $700 million-$800 million for 
2012 and would imply leverage of about 5x based on $2.7 billion of debt 
(including pension and other adjustments).

Our estimates for 2013 assume that benchmark prices remain below $200 and that 
Walter Energy's production climbs above 15 million tons. Based on these 
assumptions, we expect about $600 million of EBITDA with leverage near the 
middle of the 4x-5x range. We also expect funds from operation (FFO)-to-debt 
to be near the lower end of the 12%-20% range through 2013. Both ranges are 
consistent with an aggressive risk financial profile. 

Walter Energy mines met coal, which is used primarily in steelmaking. Its 
underground mines in Alabama contain high-quality coal and typically achieve 
pricing close to the industry benchmark. Its longwall mining operations (a 
highly productive mining technique) contribute to low costs relative to peers 
that use less efficient techniques. These Alabama mines accounted for nearly 
all of the company's operating income in the first half of 2012, partly 
because of lower-than-expected production and higher costs at its recently 
acquired Canadian sites.
Liquidity
We view Walter Energy's liquidity to be adequate based on the following 
assumptions and observations:
     -- The company has successfully negotiated relief under restrictive 
leverage covenants, which support our view that Walter Energy has solid 
relationships with its lenders;
     -- We expect sources of liquidity to exceed uses by more than 1.2x over 
the next 12 months; and
     -- We expect liquidity sources to exceed uses even if EBITDA were to 
decline 15% from our current estimates.
 
We expect the company to generate about $350 million of cash from operations 
in 2012 and between $400 million and $450 million in 2013. Liquidity uses 
include between $200 million and $300 million of maintenance and expansion 
capital expenditures and about $30 million of dividends. Walter Energy does 
not have any meaningful maturities in the balance of 2012 or in 2013.

Walter Energy had $130 million of cash on Sept. 30, 2012, and $167 million 
available on a $375 million revolving credit facility on June 30, 2012--net of 
borrowings and outstanding letters of credit. The credit facility is governed 
by restrictive financial covenants, which the company recently amended for a 
second time in 2012. The covenants now permit leverage up to 6.25x through the 
first three quarters of 2013 and ratchets down thereafter to 4.5x by September 
2014. We expect the company to remain in compliance with these new, more 
flexible covenants.

Recovery analysis
For our full recovery analysis, see our recovery report on Walter Energy, 
published Feb. 28, 2012, on RatingsDirect.

Outlook
The negative outlook reflects our view that Walter Energy's leverage is likely 
to climb to about 5x EBITDA in 2012 and is likely to remain at or above 5x 
into 2013. We would lower our rating if leverage continues to rise and is 
sustained well above 5x. This could occur if met coal prices continue to 
deteriorate because steel manufacturing further slows weaker-than-expected 
global economic conditions.

An upgrade is unlikely in the current environment, but we would revise our 
outlook to stable after the company eases its covenant pressures and maintains 
leverage in the 4x-5x range. Walter Energy could maintain this level of 
leverage if coal prices stabilize or improve and perpetuates current 
productions levels in Alabama while improving production levels and lowering 
costs in Canada.

			Dell 
      Services today announced Microsoft 
      Dynamics for Manufacturing, a new solution to help manufacturers 
      with all aspects of a Microsoft Dynamics implementation. Dell&#8217;s 
      end-to-end solution provides one of the most comprehensive Microsoft 
      Dynamics software provider offerings on the market, from hardware and 
      software licensing, cloud and on-premise deployment, supply chain advice 
      based on Dell&#8217;s own best practices and expertise in the areas of 
      multi-location implementation, lean manufacturing and enterprise 
      applications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft Dynamics AX, Microsoft&#8217;s most global and scalable ERP 
      solution, enables organizations to anticipate and embrace change to help 
      support growth and success. The solution contributes to increased 
      productivity and provides easy access to valuable information throughout 
      an organization. Dell itself has seen great benefits as a Microsoft 
      Dynamics AX user. Leveraging its own internal best practices, Dell is 
      adding Microsoft Dynamics services and support to its Microsoft Dynamics 
      reseller offerings for manufacturers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;After applying Microsoft Dynamics AX to our own manufacturing process, 
      and realizing how impactful the solution can be, we knew we had an 
      opportunity to help our manufacturing customers experience the same 
      benefits,&#8221; said Mike Gauthier, Dell Services&#8217; Microsoft Dynamics AX 
      Practice Manager. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been a Microsoft Dynamics software provider for 
      some time, but today we&#8217;re announcing the addition of a full service and 
      consulting component to our offerings based on our internal, hands-on 
      experience with the solution.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The full suite of services available with the new solutions includes:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Multiple software licensing options for Microsoft Dynamics
      
			
        Deployment options including on-premise and cloud based solutions
      
			
        Infrastructure assessment, design and support services
      
			
        Business process re-engineering and organizational change management

        Custom application development
      
			
        Managed services and ongoing support
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dell&#8217;s new solution is designed specifically for manufacturers that have 
      incomplete visibility into their global supply chain, are challenged 
      with optimizing their business systems based on changing demands and are 
      looking to increase efficiency and simplicity through the entire 
      manufacturing process.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To address these challenges, Dell&#8217;s Microsoft Dynamics for Manufacturing 
      solution focuses on manufacturing simplification and lean transformation 
      by re-engineering processes from start to finish based on lean 
      principles and simplified procedures. The solution helps manufacturers 
      get the most out of Microsoft Dynamics with guidance and counsel on how 
      to best leverage the product. Based on Dell&#8217;s own experiences, the 
      solution shows manufacturers how to use Microsoft Dynamics to help make 
      the most informed decisions possible, while reaching global alignment 
      and transformation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dell turned to Microsoft Dynamics AX in 2010 to modernize its 
      application footprint of more than 70 applications, 95 percent of which 
      were custom-developed by Dell to support unique requirements at each 
      factory. To run these applications, each manufacturing facility 
      maintained between 400 and 600 physical servers. Standardizing on 
      Microsoft Dynamics AX allowed Dell to eliminate various inefficiencies 
      related to factory differences, large IT footprint and an overabundance 
      of applications and to reduce operating costs and downtime.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Implementing Microsoft Dynamics AX helped Dell successfully re-architect 
      its manufacturing process which resulted in cost reduction and increased 
      simplification and performance:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Cost Reduction

        
					
            IT cost of goods decreased by an estimated 40% by the end of 2012

		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With Microsoft Dynamics AX, we could roll out one factory at a time, 
      and didn&#8217;t have to worry about changes to our core financial and HR and 
      server management and all of the other upstream systems that we didn&#8217;t 
      want to touch.&#8221; - Matt Griffiths, IT Executive Director,

&lt;p&gt;  TORONTO, ONTARIO, Nov 06 (MARKET WIRE) --
LexisNexis(R) Canada (www.lexisnexis.ca), a leading provider of content
and technology solutions, announced today the launch of Quicklaw(R) for
Microsoft(R) Office in Canada. This innovative product enables legal
professionals to access content and services from the LexisNexis(R)
Quicklaw(R) online legal research service and the open web while
operating directly within Microsoft Office applications, including
Microsoft(R) Outlook and Microsoft(R) Word. Quicklaw for Microsoft Office
provides clear time efficiencies and gives legal practitioners confidence
they are getting the relevant information they need.

    "Quicklaw for Microsoft Office is a leading example of how technology is
changing the practice of law," said Pamela Thompson, Director, Product
Development, at LexisNexis Canada. "A powerful, one-of-a-kind
productivity tool such as this is not a nice to have; it is an essential
for a profession that is being asked to work as efficiently, effectively,
and with as much confidence as possible every single day." 

    Quicklaw for Microsoft Office is part of the innovative Lexis(R) for
Microsoft(R) Office suite of products, which were developed in
conjunction with Microsoft, and was shaped by input from hundreds of
customers and other legal professionals. Users can now streamline work by
accessing the Quicklaw services they already rely on directly from their
day-to-day desktop applications. This creates the potential for stronger
client retention through more competitive billing, better margins and
cost management, and an opportunity for business growth with increased
productivity. Quicklaw, one of the world's first online legal research
services, has become an industry standard in Canada, and will be
celebrating a remarkable 40 years of innovation in 2013.

    Features

    Quicklaw for Microsoft Office results appear in a convenient,
side-by-side panel within a user's Microsoft Word document or Outlook
email message. Key features include:


--  Search All, Background and Suggest: Access relevant information without
    leaving a document or email message through text recognition
    capabilities, identifying citations, legal entities and terms of art.

--  Check Cited Docs and Get Cited Docs: Use Get Cited Docs within the
    context of a document and pull citations into a side-by-side pane in a
    "virtual stack" of cited cases. Through text analysis, legal citations
    found in the document are highlighted. Case content can also be accessed
    and validated simply by clicking the citation.

--  Cases, Forms and Precedents: Access links to relevant cases, forms and
    precedents for topics of interest within Microsoft Word documents.
    During transactional drafting, legal professionals can work with greater
    confidence and efficiency by accessing forms and precedents.

--  PDF Converter and Pinning: Users can easily convert PDFs into Microsoft
    Word documents so they can tap into the full functionality of Quicklaw
    for Microsoft Office and begin research and analysis. Pinning can be
    used to quickly save documents, links and notes for future reference. 

--  Quicklaw(R) Browser and History Map: The Quicklaw Browser creates a one-
    click, seamless bridge between research and Quicklaw for Microsoft
    Office to enable deeper research within a document. Through the History
    Map feature, users can create an easy-to-follow graphic depiction of
    steps taken and documents accessed during the research process that can
    be used as personal or shared reference.

			SL Corporation&#8217;s RTView&#174; Extends IBM&#174; 
      Tivoli&#174; Netcool&#174; to Meet the Needs 
      of Application Support Teams
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			RTView Enables Filtering and Enrichment of Netcool Events to Better 
      Determine How to Solve Problems as They Are Happening
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SL 
      Corporation&#174;, a leading provider of application and 
      service-level system monitoring solutions, today announced that their 
      flagship product, RTView&#174; 
      Enterprise Monitor, extends IBM&#174; Tivoli&#174; Netcool&#174; 
      to provide application support teams with the visibility they need to 
      understand how Netcool events impact their particular applications and 
      services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;While many organizations publish Netcool events to their application 
      support teams, often these events become noise due to a lack of context 
      and relevance,&#8221; said Rodney Morrison, Vice President of Products for SL 
      Corporation. &#8220;RTView interfaces with Netcool events and data to provide 
      application support teams with a visibility system that is both about 
      them, and under their control.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The facets of this tailored event management solution include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Enrichment of Netcool events through introspection of the event and 
        correlation with additional data to determine the services or groups 
        impacted and ensure the event is actionable
      
			
        Annotation of events with details about who interacted with the event, 
        and how the event was evaluated and handled
      
			
        Filtering of Netcool events based on role, business service, etc. so 
        that each application support team member only sees what they care 
        about
      
			
        Additional filtering of Netcool events based on suppression &#8211; the 
        ability to interact with events and set rules to categorically filter 
        out those that are not relevant
      
			
        Top-level views with drill down into the full content of a Netcool 
        alert, and analysis of the alert data against historical trends to 
        prioritize the alert based on potential impact
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fortune 100 companies currently using RTView Enterprise Monitor to 
      extend Netcool events are leveraging up to four RTView functional 
      modules to deliver the visibility required by their application support 
      teams:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      1) Holistic, single-pane-of-glass views &#8211; bringing together all of the 
      data from Netcool and other systems and applications that RTView is 
      monitoring, as well as data from other monitoring tools, all in one place
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      2) Correlation and filtering of events, storage of history, and 
      centralized views across all events via a highly scalable and flexible 
      platform
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      3) Event Management &#8211; workflow describing who owns an event, how it is 
      handled, and how it is ultimately resolved
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      4) Business impact &#8211; similar to a BSM solution for Netcool, enrichment 
      of alerts based on a service dependency model to see the impact on 
      services of those events
    &lt;/p&gt;

			With Out of the Box Integrations for Salesforce CRM, Oracle and

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      TreeHouse Interactive&#8482; (www.treehousei.com), 
      the technology leader in on-demand partner 
      relationship management (PRM) and marketing 
      automation solutions, today announced its Reseller View&#8482; PRM system 
      is now available on the Microsoft Dynamics Marketplace. With this 
      development, Microsoft Dynamics CRM users will have access to the 
      complete partner management capabilities offered in Reseller View.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Earlier this year, TreeHouse Interactive announced integration of its 
      Reseller View PRM system with Microsoft Dynamics CRM, offering a fully 
      customized partner portal, seamless integration of partner funnels with 
      Dynamics CRM, partner on-boarding, deal registration, lead distribution, 
      automated partner marketing enablement, automated training and 
      certification (LMS), partner locator and a host of other features to 
      make partner management easier and give partners everything they need to 
      better sell, service and support a company&#8217;s products. Reseller View is 
      compatible with Microsoft Dynamics On-Premise versions 4.0 and 2011, as 
      well as the cloud-based Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Availability on Microsoft Dynamics Marketplace requires Microsoft 
      testing and approval, and is accompanied by reviews from Microsoft 
      Dynamics CRM users. Reseller View's availability on the Microsoft 
      Dynamics Marketplace is a testament to the continuing innovation and 
      customer-driven design that is paramount to TreeHouse's approach to 
      product development. Reseller View is now the only PRM offering to have 
      standard integrations with salesforce.com, Oracle and Microsoft out of 
      the box.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our competitors in this space have really missed the mark,&#8221; said Erich 
      Flynn, CEO, TreeHouse Interactive. &#8220;Integration with CRM is core to 
      creating, maintaining and growing successful partner networks. We have

			VKernel, now part of Dell 
      Software, and the award-winning provider of enterprise-class capacity 
      management and performance 
      monitoring products for virtualized data centers and cloud 
      environments, announced today the availability of VKernel&#8217;s highly 
      regarded free tool, vOPS 
      Server Explorer, as a Hyper-V virtual appliance. vOPS Server 
      Explorer assesses virtual machine performance, efficiency and capacity 
      in a easy to download, simple to install virtual appliance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Previously available for VMware vSphere and Red Hat Enterprise 
      Virtualization environments, this release marks vOPS Server Explorer 
      availability for Hyper-V 
      environments and is designed to meet the growing installed base of 
      Hyper-V customers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;vOPS Server Explorer complements Microsoft&#8217;s System Center with 
      additional functionality such as detecting critical VM configurations, 
      inefficiency and waste to maximize performance and ROI,&#8221; says Tommy 
      Patterson, Sr. IT Pro Evangelist &#8211; Virtualization  Cloud at Microsoft. 
      &#8220;Are you a held hostage in the virtualization 
      hunger games? Now, admins have the analysis and advice at their 
      fingertips that help them become victors instead of victims.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Virtual environments are dynamic and in constant change, making it 
      challenging for administrators to maintain control over the 
      environments. Establishing just how in control or out of control an 
      environment may be requires a significant amount of manual data mining 
      and calculations. VKernel&#8217;s vOPS Server Explorer uses the same analytics 
      and advisory engine from the paid vOPS 
      Server Standard product to provide virtual administrators with a 
      rapid assessment of the state of their environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Customers use the product to:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Identify 
        critical VM configuration errors such as memory limits and old 
        snapshots that will severely affect performance and can be especially 
        hard to track down and solve.
      
			
        Recognize performance bottlenecks from high CPU ready, memory 
        swapping, device latency and other causes.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;By Jason Napodano, CFA&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;On November 1, 2012, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) held a conference call (webcast link) to discuss its third quarter earnings and financial outlook with investors. In the past, Pfizer's conference calls have provided the best source of information on the status of Remoxy for DURECT (NASDAQ:DRRX) investors. Pfizer's tone before the call last Thursday had always been upbeat and optimistic on resolving the manufacturing issues that resulted in the two complete response letters for Remoxy. The tone last Thursday was a bit different. When asked about Remoxy during the QA session of the call, John Young, Pfizer's President  General Manager, Primary Care Business Unit, responded (35:19):&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"Remoxy has been a challenging asset that our teams have been working on very diligently since the acquisition of King. As a result of that work and extensive insights that we've gained around the formulation, we've initiated confirmatory bioavailability studies to assess the pharmacokinetic or PK profile of modified Remoxy formulation compositions. And we expect those studies to read out early in 2013. We think that the results of those studies will provide us a much greater clarity on whether or not we'll be able to adequately address the questions raised in the complete response letter that we received from the FDA. So we're targeting a late March meeting with the FDA to discuss those outputs and agree on a net go or no-go decision. I think one last comment just to make is that I think it's important to remember that our commitment to this area is very strong, and as such we continue to invest in our compound ALO-02, which is an extended release oxycodone, which uses a naltrexone platform technology and it's currently in Phase 3."&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;John Young certainly didn't serve up doom and gloom on Remoxy, but the comments above are a decisively more cautious tone than in the past when we've heard Pfizer say:&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"We see it as when, not if."&#160;- Ian Reed, CEO (August 2011)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"We are continuing to make progress."&#160;- Ian Reed, CEO, (November 2011)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"We have a much better understanding of the formulation. We anticipate meeting with the FDA during the third quarter this year [2012] to discuss next steps."&#160;- Oliver Brandicourt, President  GM (January 2012)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"We remain cautiously optimistic. Hoping to meet with the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2012"&#160;- John Young, President  GM (July 2012)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Pfizer conducted two bioavailability (BE) / pharmacokinetic (PK) studies on Remoxy earlier in 2012. The first of these two studies was initiated in March 2012 and completed in June 2012 (Clinialtrials.gov Identifier:&#160;NCT01552850). The second study also initiated in March 2012 and completed in August 2012 (Clinialtrials.gov Identifier:&#160;NCT01552863). Based on John Young's comments above, it seems as though results of these two studies was not sufficient for Pfizer to schedule a meeting with the FDA before the end of the year. Instead, Pfizer plans to conduct some confirmatory BE / PK studies with a new modified formulation of Remoxy. Management expects read-outs from these studies in early 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;As a result, the timeframe for the FDA meeting, guided to take place in fourth quarter 2012 in July 2012 has now been pushed back to March 2013. I note that DURECT's CEO, James Brown, mentioned on their third quarter call on November 5, 2012 (webcast link, 4:29) that, "You don't run confirmatory studies unless you are confirming something." Which sounds like DURECT believes the data Pfizer generated was good and just needs to be replicated before they bring it to the FDA. In fact, DURECT said they have seen the data from the second BE / PK study that Pfizer completed in August 2012 and were pleased with the outcome. This suggests that Pfizer is confirming progress rather than failure.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;However, just as Pfizer's comments last week cannot be ignored, they should not be considered positive. There is no FDA meeting scheduled in March 2013, this is only the current goal. And there may never be a meeting between Pfizer and the FDA on Remoxy unless Pfizer feels comfortable that it generated the type of data it needs to move forward. As of today, regardless of what DURECT thinks is being confirmed, this has not happened. The facts are, this is the first time that Pfizer has raised concerns on whether or not they will be able to adequately address the questions raised in the complete response letter. The fact that Pfizer is now talking about a "go / no-go" decision, versus previous comments on "when, not if." certainly spooked investors.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;But what has really changed? In the past I've written that Remoxy has a 50/50 chance at approval post re-file. I still believe that to be the case. Perhaps what I should have said is that Remoxy has a 50/50 chance at a re-file. If Pfizer meets with the FDA in March 2013 after running three or four BE / PK studies and then decides to re-file the NDA, the odds of approval are probably better than 50/50.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Finally, Pfizer mentioning ALO-02 in the same breath as Remoxy also raised investor concerns. ALO-02 was acquired by Pfizer when they acquired King Pharmaceuticals in October 2012. ALO-02 was developed by Alpharma, which King acquired in December 2008. ALO-02 is an investigational oxycodone hydrochloride and naltrexone hydrochloride extended-release capsule. In October 2012, Pfizer announced that ALO-02 offered a long-term safety profile comparable to competing formulations (release). However, the 395-patient study showed that about 60% of the patients discontinued taking the drug during a 12-month period, almost 20% due to the drugs side-effects. Pfizer is currently conducting a phase 3 efficacy trial on ALO-02 (Clinialtrials.gov Identifier:&#160;NCT01571362) with data expected in the third quarter 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;At this point, I'm not yet concerned that Pfizer will scrap Remoxy for ALO-02. ALO-02 has both potential safety and tolerability issues, and intellectual property issues. Based on the formulation, Remoxy looks like a superior option for Pfizer, even with potentially up to 30% royalty payments to DURECT and Pain Therapeutics (NASDAQ:PTIE). I also note the manufacturing of ALO-02 is no slam dunk either, as Pfizer has had trouble with Embeda, a product with a similar drug delivery platform technology. Investors thinking ALO-02 is a competitive threat to Remoxy should temper their fears. As of now, it seems like more of a long-shot.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Where Does That Leave Investors With Remoxy?&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;In September 2012, Zacks initiated coverage of DURECT Corp. with a 'Buy' rating and $2.50 price target. I encourage investors to read my 26-page report available for free on the Zacks.com website (downloaded copy:&#160;http://bit.ly/DRRX-Initiation-Sept2012).&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Back in September 2012, I believed the story was vastly undervalued. I stripped the company down into its individual product components through a "sum-of-parts" analysis and arrived at a $2.50 per share value. Today, despite the seemingly more cautious tone Pfizer has taken with Remoxy, I am reiterating the rating. However, pushing back the Remoxy (and POSIDUR discussed below)&#160;time frame&#160;reduces the target by $0.50 to $2.00. I should note that the vast majority of my valuation still comes from Remoxy. In September, I expected that Pfizer would be in position to re-file the new drug application on Remoxy during the first half of 2013. I have pushed back this expectation to the second half of 2013, and thus the reduction to the target.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I see Remoxy, a tamper-resistant extended release formulation of oxycodone, as a blockbuster drug. I think that Pfizer will be able to capture 30% of the OxyContin market from Purdue Pharma LP within five years of launch. Its shear marketing muscle, with the ability to co-detail Remoxy next to blockbuster pain medications like Lyrica and Celebrex, along with Purdue's less-than-stellar reputation should help drive uptake once approved. Abuse of OxyContin is a major healthcare concern, and recent FDA advisory panels and CDC workshops have the problem on the top of the "get it fixed" list. I think Remoxy is a meaningful step forward in the fight to reduce the OxyContin abuse epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;DURECT is entitled to receive a tiered royalty on global sales of Remoxy at Pfizer. There are no expenses associated with the ongoing royalty stream. In fact, DURECT and Pfizer recently signed a long-term supply agreement whereby DURECT will supply some of the excipients included in the Remoxy formulation at a cost-plus transfer price. The royalties from Remoxy, heavily discounted, are worth $1.50 per share.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Pipeline Update
			 On the DURECT conference call on November 5, 2012, management provided a brief update on the rest of the pipeline outside of Remoxy. Generally, little has changed from the Zacks initiation of coverage in September 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Investors still may be questioning DURECT's strategy to file for approval of Posidur based on the failure of the phase 3 BESST trial earlier in the year. Back in September, management was guiding for filing the NDA before the end of the year. Now, the NDA has been pushed into the first quarter of 2013. Management notes not wanting to rush the NDA around the holidays as the chief reason for the delay. I do not see this as a major concern.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;My model assumes the company receives a complete response letter (CRL) and that the FDA requires DURECT to re-conduct another phase 3 program. I think BESST was outside the core capabilities of the product - surgical pain. I think odds favor success in a second phase 3 trial with a more narrow focus for Posidur, such as laparoscopic cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal). I see only a 20% chance of approval on the first NDA. Nevertheless, even with the expected CRL and the delay and costs necessary to conduct another phase 3 trial, I think Posidur, with peak sales around $250 million, is worth $0.35 per share if DURECT can eventually gain approval on a second attempt in, say, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Management reports being in discussions with potential partners on both TRANSDUR-Sufentanil and ELADUR. I have minimal expectations for both factored into my valuation. Any potential deal for either of these products would be a pleasant surprise for investors. Finally, Zogenix (NASDAQ:ZGNX) continues enrollment in its phase 1 study with Relday, which we are expecting to be completed by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Below is a summary of my sum-of-parts analysis (full analysis can be found in the Zacks report). I include only modest contributions from the rest of the pipeline, including Eladur, TRANSDUR-sufentanil, Relday, and early-stage ORADUR candidates. I also include projected operating expenses over the next several years at around $30 to $35 million in combined RD and SGA, a net operating loss (NOL) carryforward of approximately $228 million at year end 2011, and a projected cash balance of $17.5 million at year end 2012. I see cash sufficient to fund operations into 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;DURECT is a high-risk investment, tied closely to the future of Remoxy. However, at today's price I like the risk / reward. My modeling shows the shares have over 100% upside to fair-value. Besides Remoxy, this upside could come from virtually any other product in the pipeline. I see several catalysts on the horizon, including the Posidur NDA filing and potential partnerships on TRANSDUR, ELADUR, and ORADUR-ADHD as bringing investor attention back to the name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nov 06 - Fitch Ratings has upgraded Turkey-based Coca-Cola Icecek A.S.'s (CCI)
Long-term foreign currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured rating to 'BBB' from
'BBB-'. Fitch has also affirmed the Long-term local currency IDR at 'BBB'. The Outlook on both
IDRs is Stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rating actions follow Fitch's upgrade of Turkey's Sovereign Rating and 
Country Ceiling to 'BBB-' and to 'BBB', respectively (see "Fitch Upgrades Turkey 
to Investment Grade"; dated 5 November 2012 at www.fitchratings.com). CCI's 
Long-term foreign currency IDR is now aligned with its Long-term local currency 
IDR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAT COULD TRIGGER A RATING ACTION?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positive: an upgrade of the local currency and foreign currency IDRs is unlikely 
due to CCI's limited scale, diversification and profitability against certain 
peers and forex exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to 
negative rating action include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- A material permanent deterioration in FCF generation with lease-adjusted net 
debt/EBITDAR above 2.5x for an extended period along with FFO interest coverage 
below 6x.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the event of a sharp devaluation of the Turkish lira, Fitch will look at the 
group's willingness and timing to undertake any necessary cash preservation 
measures such as dividend and capex reduction (as observed in 2009).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BUENOS AIRES/QUITO (Reuters) - An Argentine judge has embargoed up to $19 billion in Chevron assets in connection with an environmental lawsuit by Ecuadorean villagers, a lawyer for the plaintiffs said on Wednesday, the latest volley in a two-decade-long legal saga that now spans several countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Ecuadorean court last year ordered Chevron Corp (CVX.N) to pay the enormous sum for contamination of watersheds over nearly 30 years that the plaintiffs say sickened indigenous tribespeople and farmers in the Ecuadorean Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has refused to make any payments and accuses Ecuadorean courts of fraud. Because the company has few assets in the Andean nation, the plaintiffs are seeking enforcement of the ruling in other countries including Brazil and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The freeze order applies to the entire $19 billon amount of the Ecuador judgment, meaning that Chevron will effectively be barred from investing further in Argentina unless it wants to risk seizure of those assets as well," the plaintiffs said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling could pave the way for the plaintiffs to collect on the award. But it could also be just another round of judicial ping-pong in a complex legal battle that has included frequent appeals and vicious accusations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs' lawyer, Enrique Bruchou, said the ruling by Argentine judge Adrian Elcuj includes an embargo on 40 percent of Chevron's Argentine oil revenue, the company's shares in its Argentine subsidiary and a stake in an oil pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We consider this to be an exemplary ruling," he said. "We are letting the world know that foreign investment is welcome in Latin America, but that investors must adhere to the same environmental standards that apply in their own countries."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, Argentina's fourth-largest oil producer, said it was not aware of any Argentine court order and reiterated its position that the Ecuador ruling is unenforceable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Ecuador judgment is a product of bribery, fraud, and it is illegitimate ... We do not believe that the Ecuador judgment is enforceable in any court that observes the rule of law," the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bruchou said the company can appeal, but would have to file for an appeal in Ecuador because the judge issued the embargo after a request by an Ecuadorean court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs plan to file similar suits in Colombia as well as in as yet unidentified countries in Asia and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. appeals court in January said that a U.S. judge did not have the authority to stop courts in other countries from enforcing the judgment. Chevron appealed the decision, but the U.S. supreme court rejected the appeal in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONG LEGAL FIGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filled with intrigue, accusations of corruption, bribery and dirty tricks, the complicated case has been fought for nearly two decades, mainly in courts in Ecuador and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron filed for arbitration in 2009, accusing Ecuador of violating a treaty with the United States requiring the OPEC-member country to guarantee Chevron a fair trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has also accused the plaintiffs, their legal team and their advisers of fraud in a U.S. court. The trial is scheduled to begin on October 15, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs from villages in the oil-rich Amazon won an $18.2 billion case against the oil giant over claims that Texaco, bought by Chevron in 2001, contaminated the area from 1964 to 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their legal team argues that Texaco's remediation efforts were insufficient. Their long-term legal adviser, Steven Donziger, has also filed counter claims in a U.S. court accusing Chevron of fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The claimants' lawyers estimate that Chevron's assets in Argentina are worth around $2 billion and that they could obtain some $600 million a year if the embargo is enforced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, Chevron signed an accord with state-controlled YPF (YPF.N), Argentina's No. 1 energy company, to consider a joint exploration project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron argues that the company has no direct assets in Argentina because its operations in the country are conducted by subsidiaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Plaintiffs' lawyers have no legal right to embargo subsidiary assets in Argentina and should not be allowed to disrupt Argentina's pursuit of its important energy resources," Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting By Alejandro Lifschitz and Eduardo Garcia; Writing by Hugh Bronstein; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Jim Marshall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Argentine lawsuit stems from $19 bln ruling against
Chevron&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Chevron says Ecuador judgment fraudulent, unenforceable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Plaintiffs have also filed lawsuits in Canada and Brazil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Guido Nejamkis and Eduardo Garcia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUENOS AIRES/QUITO, Nov 7 (Reuters) - An Argentine judge has
embargoed up to $19 billion in Chevron assets in connection with
an environmental lawsuit by Ecuadorean villagers, a lawyer for

after a request by an Ecuadorean court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs plan to file similar suits in Colombia as
well as in as yet unidentified countries in Asia and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. appeals court in January said that a U.S. judge did
not have the authority to stop courts in other countries from

dirty tricks, the complicated case has been fought for nearly
two decades, mainly in courts in Ecuador and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron filed for arbitration in 2009, accusing Ecuador of
violating a treaty with the United States requiring the
OPEC-member country to guarantee Chevron a fair trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has also accused the plaintiffs, their legal
team and their advisers of fraud in a U.S. court. The trial is

Chevron of fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The claimants' lawyers estimate that Chevron's assets in
Argentina are worth around $2 billion and that they could obtain
some $600 million a year if the embargo is enforced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, Chevron signed an accord with state-controlled
YPF, Argentina's No. 1 energy company, to consider a
joint exploration project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron argues that the company has no direct assets in
Argentina because its operations in the country are conducted by
subsidiaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Plaintiffs' lawyers have no legal right to embargo
subsidiary assets in Argentina and should not be allowed to
disrupt Argentina's pursuit of its important energy resources,"
Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;

    Management Commentary

    "Results in the quarter reflect continued improvements in our key growth
markets and increased demand for our services," said Al Cadotte,
Newalta's President and CEO. "With many outstanding organic growth
opportunities across all areas of our business, particularly our U.S.
operations and heavy oil contract operations, we are expanding our
capital investment plan to aggressively pursue high-return, low-risk
opportunities that will provide excellent returns for our investors in
2013 and beyond."

    Realigning for Growth

    Newalta announced that effective January 1, 2013, we will realign our
reporting structure into three divisions - New Markets, Oilfield and
Industrial.  

    "This new structure best aligns our operations with our customers so that
we can provide a seamless service package, and also focus our efforts on
developing new and innovative solutions for our national and
international customers. It also provides the optimum structure to
allocate management to execute our growth plans," said Mr. Cadotte. "The
reorganization will result in enhanced disclosure to our investors,
particularly on our New Markets division."

    The reorganization of the three new divisions will be as follows:

    New Markets


--  Heavy Oil Business Unit (includes heavy oil facilities and onsite) 
--  U.S. Business Unit (includes U.S. facilities, drill site and onsite) 


     Oilfield 


--  Includes oilfield facilities, oilfield onsite, environmental services
    and Canadian drill site 


    Industrial


--  Western Business Unit (includes oil recycling, industrial facilities and
    industrial onsite in western Canada) 
--  Eastern Business Unit (includes VSC, SCL, industrial facilities and
    industrial onsite in eastern Canada)  


    Newalta will maintain the current reporting structure of Facilities and
Onsite divisions for the remainder of fiscal 2012.

    2013 Capital Expenditure Budget 

    Growth capital in 2012 is expected to be $125 million, or $10 million
above budget, bringing our total capital spend to approximately $155
million. The increase is attributable to the significant expansion in
scope of the mature fine tailings ("MFT") processing contract. Reflecting
the strength of our pipeline of capital projects and organic growth
opportunities, our 2013 capital budget is $190 million; a 23 percent
increase over 2012 capital. Growth capital and maintenance expenditures
are expected to be $155 million and $35 million, respectively. Growth
expenditures will comprise of approximately $70 million for New Markets,
$40 million for Oilfield and $30 million for Industrial. The remaining
$15 million in growth capital expenditures are for Technical Development
and corporate investments. The capital program will be funded through
cash flow from operations and the proceeds from the equity offering that
closed on October 26, 2012.

    Consolidated Financial Overview

    Third quarter revenue grew 4% year-over-year to $190.1 million. Gross
profit rose 9% from Q3 2011 as a result of improved performance in Onsite
driven by increased demand for our services. This was partially offset by
reduced activity in Facilities. Adjusted EBITDA rose slightly to $42.5
million compared to Q3 2011. Higher gross profit was tempered by
increased Adjusted selling, general and administrative ("Adjusted SG")
expenses to support our continued growth in 2013. Net earnings rose 29%
as a result of lower net finance charges and deferred income tax expense.


    Year-to-date in 2012, Adjusted EBITDA of $108.8 million was relatively
flat compared to the same period in 2011. Stronger demand for our
services was offset by lower value received for our products of $8.3
million and higher Adjusted SG expenses.

    Operational Overview

    Revenue and gross profit from Facilities in the quarter were $101.7
million and $25.3 million, down 15% and 10%, respectively, from Q3 2011.
Western Facilities experienced strong demand for our services despite
decreased oilfield activity. Facilities results were impacted by lower
activity levels at VSC and timing of volumes received at SCL.
Year-to-date revenue and gross profit declined slightly from prior year
to $323.3 million and $78.3 million, respectively, primarily driven by
VSC. 

    In Onsite, Q3 revenue increased 42% and gross profit was 41% higher
compared to Q3 2011. Strong demand in most areas was offset by Canadian
drill site which was impacted by lower drilling activity. During the
quarter, we began processing waste volumes under our MFT contract and we
began processing slop oil emulsion volumes on a customer's site in the
Bakken play under a multi-year arrangement. Year-to-date, revenue and
gross profit rose 28% and 24%, respectively, from the prior year period.
Increased contract and project activity offset the impact of lower
drilling activity and commodity prices. 

    Technical Development began the demonstration of new technology at a
Western Facility during the quarter, consistent with its plan. We expect
this process to be in commercial production before the end of 2012.

    Other Highlights

    Capital expenditures for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2012 were $32.3 million and $114.9 million respectively, focused
primarily on growth capital projects in Onsite. 

    In July 2012, we entered into an amended and restated extendible
revolving Credit Facility ("Credit Facility"). Key changes to the Credit
Facility include an increase in the borrowing amount from $200 million to
$225 million, improved covenant ratio thresholds and better pricing.

    On October 26th, Newalta completed an equity financing with the issuance
of 5.5 million common shares for gross proceeds of $77 million (net
proceeds of approximately $73.5 million).

    On a pro-forma basis as at September 30, 2012, the impact of the equity
financing reduces Newalta's Total debt from $411.5 million to $338.0
million and improves our Total debt to EBITDA ratio from 2.88 to 2.36. We
anticipate ending the year with Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA
significantly better than our leverage ratio at December 31, 2011.

    On October 17, 2012, DBRS upgraded our issuer rating to BB from BB (Low)
and revised the trend to Stable from Positive. The rating change is
attributable to our execution of the business plan, and our growing
contract business that is more stable with multi-year terms,
strengthening our financial profile. DBRS has also upgraded the Senior
Unsecured Debentures to BB from BB (low) with the trend being Stable. 

    Newalta announced today it has implemented a Dividend Reinvestment Plan
("DRIP"). The DRIP provides eligible Newalta shareholders with the
opportunity to reinvest their quarterly cash dividend to acquire
additional shares at a purchase price equal to 95% of the average market
price (defined as the volume weighted average trading price of the shares
for the five trading days immediately preceding the distribution payment
date). The first dividend eligible to be reinvested under the DRIP is the
dividend payable to shareholders of record on December 31, 2012. The full
text of the DRIP and an Enrollment Form are available from Valiant Trust
at www.valianttrust.com or on Newalta's website at www.newalta.com.

    Newalta's Board of Directors declared a third quarter dividend of $0.10
per share ($0.40 per share annualized) paid October 15, 2012 to
shareholders of record September 28, 2012. This higher dividend rate
established earlier this year reflects our strong financial position and
positive outlook.

    Outlook

    In Q4 2012, we anticipate year-over-year improvement in performance
driven by continued growth in Onsite, higher SCL volumes, increased
production at VSC and strong demand for our services in western Canada. 

    In Onsite, we expect year-over-year improvement in the fourth quarter to
be driven by increased Heavy Oil and U.S. contract and project work,
including gains from the contract to process mature fine tailings

    RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES 

    This Press Release contains references to certain financial measures,
including some that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by
International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS" or "GAAP") and may
not be comparable to similar measures presented by other corporations or
entities. These financial measures are identified and defined below:

    "EBITDA", "EBITDA per share", "Adjusted EBITDA", and "Adjusted EBITDA per
share" are measures of our operating profitability. EBITDA provides an
indication of the results generated by our principal business activities
prior to how these activities are financed, assets are amortized or how
the results are taxed in various jurisdictions. In addition, Adjusted
EBITDA provides an indication of the results generated by our principal
business activities prior to recognizing stock-based compensation.
Stock-based compensation, a component of employee remuneration, can vary
significantly with changes in the price of our common shares. As such,
Adjusted EBITDA provides improved continuity with respect to the
comparison of our operating results over a period of time. EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA are derived from the consolidated statements of
operations, comprehensive income and retained earnings. EBITDA per share
and Adjusted EBITDA per share are derived by dividing EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA by the basic weighted average number of shares. 

    They are calculated as follows:

    "Adjusted net earnings" and "Adjusted net earnings per share" are
measures of our profitability. Adjusted net earnings provides an
indication of the results generated by our principal business activities
prior to recognizing stock-based compensation expense and the gain or
loss on embedded derivatives. Stock-based compensation expense, a
component of employee remuneration, can vary significantly with changes
in the price of our common shares. The gain on the embedded derivative is
a result of the change in the trading price of the debentures and the
volatility of the applicable bond market. As such, Adjusted net earnings
provides improved continuity with respect to the comparison of our
results over a period of time. Adjusted net earnings per share is derived
by dividing Adjusted net earnings by the basic weighted average number of
shares.

&lt;p&gt;Overview
     -- Grupo Televisa S.A.B.'s cable and telecom and
direct-to-home (DTH) satellite TV segments' strong performance have contributed
to the company's solid financial performance.
     -- We are affirming our 'BBB+' global scale and 'mxAAA' national scale 
ratings on Televisa.
     -- The stable outlook reflects our view that Televisa's key financial 
metrics will remain stable over the next two years, fueled by its revenue 
growth.

Rating Action
On Nov. 7, 2012, Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services affirmed its 'BBB+' global 
scale and 'mxAAA' national scale ratings on Grupo Televisa S.A.B. The outlook 
remains stable. 

Rationale
The 'BBB+' global scale rating on Televisa reflects the company's 
"satisfactory" business risk profile and its "modest" financial risk profile. 
The rating also reflects Televisa's positive free cash flow generation, high 
operating margins, strong liquidity, manageable maturity debt profile, its 
leadership in Mexico's (foreign currency rating BBB/Stable/A-2, local currency 
rating A-/Stable/A-2) television industry, and its increasing participation in 
the telecommunications industry. However, these factors are partly offset by 
the company's somewhat dependence on advertisement revenue, its high capital 
expenditures requirements, and the increased competition in Mexico's telecom 
industry. 

Our view of country risk in Mexico influences our ratings on Televisa because 
the company's operations are concentrated in this market. We stress tested the 
company under a Mexican sovereign default scenario, including a sharp currency 
devaluation and a significant decline in the company's revenue and EBITDA. 
Under this scenario, we concluded that Televisa would still be able to 
generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt obligations.

Televisa is the largest media company in Mexico, with holdings in a wide 
variety of businesses, including content, cable and telecom, Sky (the 
company's the direct-to-home satellite television unit), and publishing among 
others. While the company is still somewhat dependent on advertising revenue, 
the growth in the cable and telecom and Sky segments have allowed Televisa to 
diversify its revenues. For third-quarter 2012, the cable and telecom and Sky 
segments accounted for 22% and 21% of consolidated revenues, respectively, 
compared with 15.5% and 18% for the same period in 2008. In addition, 
Televisa's investment in Grupo Iusacell S.A. de C.V. (Iusacell; not rated), a 
Mexican wireless provider, is in line with the company's continued pursuit of 
growth opportunities and diversification in the telecom sector. Although the 
company's equity participation in Iusacell is still negative, we believe it 
could turn positive in the next few years as the company increases its 
subscriber base. 

Televisa's financial results remain positive, in our view. The company's 
revenues increased by 8.7% during third-quarter 2012, compared with the same 
period in 2011. This reflected revenue growth, particularly in the content, 
cable and telecom, and Sky segments. The EBITDA margins remained stable at 
about 40%. 

Under our base case scenario, we expect a high single-digit increase in 
revenues during the next few years, driven by the company's content, Sky, and 
cable and telecom segments. We expect that the content segment's ad revenues 
will increase with or slightly below Mexico's GDP growth. We also expect that 
royalties from Univision will continue to grow as a result of an increase in 
retransmission revenues. 

Sky and cable and telecom segments will likely derive growth from an increased 
subscriber base and, to a lesser extent, from the sale of premium services. We 
expect that the EBITDA margin will remain very stable at about 40% going 
forward. 

Liquidity
We consider Televisa's liquidity as strong under our criteria. We anticipate 
that the sources of liquidity will exceed uses by a ratio of more than 1.5x 
over the next 12 months to 18 months. In our forecast, we expect the sources 
of liquidity to include cash of Mexican peso (MXP) $21.58 billion as of Sept. 
30, 2012, and funds from operations (FFO) of more than MXP$28 billion for the 
next 12 months. We expect that cash uses for the next 12 months will include 
capital expenditures of about MXP$11.0 billion and will remain focused on the 
cable and telecom and Sky segments, debt maturities of about MXP$520 million, 
and dividend payments of about MXP$1.5 billion. 

Televisa's stable cash flow generation supports strong liquidity. During the 
first nine months of 2012, the company reported FFO of MXN19.3 billion, which, 
when paired with its solid cash position, is enough to cover its capital 
expenditures and its investments. We expect that the company will keep 
generating positive free operating cash flow through the next few years. 

Our liquidity analysis also incorporates qualitative factors, including our 
view that the company has the capacity to withstand high-impact 
low-probability events, its sound banking relationships with banks and access 
to capital markets, and an overall prudent financial risk management. 
Televisa's covenant headroom was ample as of Sept. 30, 2012, in our view. 

Outlook
The stable outlook reflects our view that Televisa's stable revenues and 
operating margin trends will continue over the next two years. The outlook 
also takes into account our assumption that Televisa's moderate financial 
policy will maintain the company's financial ratios commensurate with a solid 
investment-grade rating. 

We could lower the ratings over the next two years if Televisa's adjusted debt 
to EBITDA were to persistently exceed 2.5x, or if the company's adjusted 
FFO-to-debt ratio were to fall to less than 30%. Factors that could contribute 
to such a development include a reverse in the currently favorable operating 
trends, aggressive debt-financed acquisitions, or additional unexpected cash 
outflows for the Iusacell investment. We consider the possibility of an 
upgrade to be remote because of the risks associated with operating in Mexico, 
the strong competition, and the sovereign credit ratings on Mexico.

&lt;p&gt;Indigenous tribespeople and farmers in the Ecuadorean Amazon have sued the U.S.-based oil major in Argentina and Colombia to collect the $19 billion award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2011 decision by a court in Lago Agrio, Ecuador, ordered Chevron to pay the sum as a result of water contamination and inappropriately disposing of oil industry waste during crude production in the Amazon over a period of nearly 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Chevron has few assets in Ecuador that can be taken as compensation, the plaintiffs are trying to get the ruling enforced in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is the fourth-largest producer of oil in Argentina. In September, it signed an accord with state-controlled YPF (YPF.N), Argentina's No. 1 energy company, to consider a joint exploration project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiff's lawyer, Enrique Bruchou, said the Argentine judgment includes an embargo on 40 percent of Chevron's Argentine oil revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We consider this to be an exemplary ruling," he said. "We are letting the world know that foreign investment is welcome in Latin America, but that investors must adhere to the same environmental protection standards that apply in their own countries."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company quickly issued a statement calling the Ecuador ruling unenforceable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Ecuador judgment is a product of bribery, fraud, and it is illegitimate," the statement said. "We do not believe that the Ecuador judgment is enforceable in any court that observes the rule of law."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs in Ecuador deny Chevron's accusations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the company's operations in Argentina are conducted by subsidiaries, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Plaintiffs' lawyers have no legal right to embargo subsidiary assets in Argentina and should not be allowed to disrupt Argentina's pursuit of its important energy resources," Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting By Alejandro Lifschitz and Eduardo Garcia; Writing by Hugh Bronstein; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Ecuador court ordered Chevron to pay $19 bln&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Chevron says Ecuador judgment fraudulent, unenforceable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Guido Nejamkis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUENOS AIRES, Nov 7 (Reuters) - An Argentine judge has
embargoed up to $19 billion in Chevron Corp assets in
the South American country over an environmental damages lawsuit
in Ecuador, a lawyer for the plaintiffs told reporters on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indigenous tribespeople and farmers in the Ecuadorean Amazon
have sued the U.S.-based oil major in Argentina and Colombia to
collect the $19 billion award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2011 decision by a court in Lago Agrio, Ecuador, ordered
Chevron to pay the sum as a result of water contamination and
inappropriately disposing of oil industry waste during crude
production in the Amazon over a period of nearly 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Chevron has few assets in Ecuador that can be taken
as compensation, the plaintiffs are trying to get the ruling
enforced in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is the fourth-largest producer of oil in Argentina.
In September, it signed an accord with state-controlled YPF

the Ecuador judgment is enforceable in any court that observes
the rule of law."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs in Ecuador deny Chevron's accusations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the company's operations in Argentina are conducted by
subsidiaries, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Plaintiffs' lawyers have no legal right to embargo
subsidiary assets in Argentina and should not be allowed to
disrupt Argentina's pursuit of its important energy resources,"
Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* New $100 mln research center anchors downtown renewal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Brazil pushes for high-tech jobs to boost productivity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRASILIA Nov 7 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp will
invest 200 million reais ($100 million) in a new research center
in Rio de Janeiro, executives said on Wednesday, helping
Brazil's push to generate high-tech jobs in an economy long
built on commodities and basic industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investment over the next three to four years will focus
on the development of new search technology, according to
Microsoft's most senior executive in Latin America, Hernan
Rincon, and other management at a news conference in the capital
Brasilia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research center - one of four such offices in the world
and the first in Latin America - anchors efforts to renovate
Rio's downtown port district ahead of the 2016 Olympic Games,
which the city will host.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long home to headquarters of oil and mining companies, Rio
has gained attention recently for its nascent Internet startup
scene, offering entrepreneurs access to sun, sand and seed
capital without the traffic jams, pollution and other hassles of
sprawling Sao Paulo, Brazil's economic capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's investment also reinforces Rio's growing
attractiveness for major multinational companies. Starting in
the 1980s, many spurned the city as crime soared, urban
infrastructure decayed and government became chaotic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco Systems Inc announced plans for a research
center in Rio this year, joining similar facilities owned by
General Electric, Halliburton, Baker Hughes
 and Schlumberger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said they gave Microsoft no tax breaks to secure
the investment, but President Dilma Rousseff has made a priority
of generating more jobs in Brazil's tech sector as a way to
boost innovation and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After lengthy negotiations of tax breaks and other benefits,
Taiwan's Foxconn announced last month that it would invest 1
billion reais to build a new electronics manufacturing complex
in Sao Paulo. Foxconn Technology Group is the trading name of
Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, the main assembler of
Apple Inc devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil has also mandated wireless telephone carriers build
new networks with at least 60 percent Brazilian hardware,
spurring equipment manufacturers to set up local factories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      firm serving global 2000 and other large enterprise customers throughout 
      North America, today announced it will exhibit at the Microsoft

      held Nov. 12 &#8211; 15, at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, is the most 
      comprehensive event for IT professionals dedicated to SharePoint and 
      related technologies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft&#8217;s SharePoint 2013 platform enables businesses to improve 
      collaborative processes and enhance access to an organization&#8217;s 
      knowledge base. As one of only seven Microsoft Worldwide National 
      Systems Integrator (NSI) Partners, Perficient partners with clients to 
      create enterprise SharePoint portal solutions that promote user 
      adoption, increase operational productivity, and drive measurable 
      business value.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;One of the biggest challenges leaders face today is how to share 
      information across channels and collaborate on people-driven business 
      processes. These companies are in search of solutions that provide the 
      tools needed to effectively collaborate with co-workers, clients and 
      partners,&#8221; said Aaron Sloman, general manager of Perficient&#8217;s Microsoft 
      National Business Group. &#8220;The SharePoint 2013 platform plays a key role 
      in bringing people together, making social collaboration, enterprise 
      search and mobile access possible. It has the power to help 
      organizations share knowledge, enhance communication and drive teamwork 
      and innovation. We&#8217;re pleased to highlight our experience with

      During the conference, Microsoft and Perficient client Jones 
      Lang LaSalle (JLL) will discuss the work Perficient did to 
      successfully implement SharePoint 2013 for Jones Lang LaSalle&#8217;s new 
      website. JLL has used SharePoint as a self-service web content 
      management system since 2008. However, in recent years, JLL has seen 
      growth in the site&#8217;s mobile device usage. The company worked in 
      partnership with Microsoft and Perficient to develop and execute on 
      strategies that provide a positive, more-focused mobile experience. 
      Conference attendees can learn more about JLL&#8217;s success in redesigning 
      its website utilizing the SharePoint 2013 platform in the sessions:

      In addition to highlighting its work with Jones Lang LaSalle, Perficient

      business platform, SharePoint 2013 can support a variety of intranet, 
      extranet, and web applications for an enterprise. Perficient also will 
      offer demos highlighting SharePoint 2013 capabilities around search and 
      social business, as well as Perficient&#8217;s SharePoint design experience.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Social computing played a major role in the design and functionality of 
      SharePoint 2013. Microsoft has recognized that people&#8217;s online 
      experiences as consumers are driving the way they want to work 
      day-to-day in a professional environment,&#8221; said Rich Wood, senior 
      solution architect, Perficient&#8217;s Microsoft National Business Group. 
      &#8220;With the SharePoint 2013 platform, organizations allow users to put 
      social to work by sharing ideas, discovering answers and keeping track 
      of colleagues and projects. Knowledge is power, and SharePoint 2013&#8217;s 
      newest features like social tagging, communities and micro-blogging are 
      making knowledge sharing easy and effective, and leading to better

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 7 (Reuters) - A lawyer for Goldman Sachs
 urged a U.S. appeals court Wednesday to send a former
employee's gender discrimination dispute to arbitration rather
than allow her to proceed with a proposed class action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is being watched closely because it could help

New York that a lower court was incorrect in deciding last year
not to send Parisi's case to arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When she signed the agreement and became one of the more
highly paid people at Goldman, she agreed to arbitration as the
forum," Giuffra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Paul Bland, a lawyer for Parisi, argued that arbitration
clauses can't prohibit employees from bringing class actions
alleging a pattern or practice of discrimination at a company
under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a substantive right," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions have favored

&lt;p&gt;  HOUSTON, TX, Nov 07 (Marketwire) -- 
The Energistics Consortium announced today that ExxonMobil Upstream
Research Company has provided an enhanced version of the Standards DevKit
that adds support for RESQML(TM) 1.1 including managing the HDF5 file
format. This enhanced version of the Standards DevKit will support
RESQML(TM), the Energistics reservoir data exchange standards as well as
WITSML(TM) and PRODML(TM), the Energistics standards for drilling and
production data exchange.

    The Standards DevKit (developed by ExxonMobil Technical Computing
Company) is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0, and leverages
Microsoft .NET technology to allow developers to quickly and easily work
with objects directly in .NET while seamlessly translating those objects
into XML to be saved as files or transferred to web servers. The open
source DevKit will provide developers a simple path to adopting
Energistics standards without requiring them to learn the extensive XML
structure. The DevKit is available for download on the Energistics
website.

    "Reducing barriers to adoption is the key to realizing the benefits of
the Energistics open data exchange standards," said Cindy Reece, Upstream
Technical Computing Manager, ExxonMobil Technical Computing Company, and
member of the Energistics Board of Directors.

    The release of this enhanced Standards DevKit is intended to encourage
the use of WITSML(TM), PRODML(TM) and RESQML(TM) across the oil and gas
industry by lowering the learning curve and reducing custom development
efforts. Additionally, the DevKit will bring the library support for
these standards up to the current level of formats like Excel and ASCII. 

    "This update improves the functionality of an important tool used in our
efforts to improve adoption of the standards," said Jerry Hubbard,
president and CEO of Energistics. "Our focus on maximizing adoption rates
will be greatly assisted through the use of the Standards DevKit."

			New Jersey Selects J.P. Morgan for Bond Sale
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      New Jersey selected J.P. Morgan to be sole manager for an upcoming $2.6 
      billion bond sale following a highly competitive selection process that 
      was arranged quickly after it became clear that Hurricane Sandy would 
      make landfall in the state. Proceeds will assist the state in meeting 
      its cash flow needs in the current fiscal year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      New Jersey cancelled its original plan for an auction of Tax Revenue 
      Anticipation Notes (TRANs) on October 30 and arranged a negotiated sale 
      as Sandy approached the East Coast and municipal markets became 
      susceptible to storm-related volatility and headline risk. J.P. Morgan 
      will help New Jersey complete its sale of annual TRANs sale by reaching 
      out to investors who understand that New Jersey is a strong credit that 
      has never failed to meet its debt obligations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We have more than 30,000 employees and 10 million customers in the 
      tri-State area. This storm hit home for all of us,&#8221; said Matt Zames, 
      co-Chief Operating Officer of JPMorgan Chase. &#8220;J.P. Morgan wants to be 
      part of the rebuilding process that restores New Jersey&#8217;s communities 
      and the Jersey Shore. We think investors will want to be there, too."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan is the top-ranked underwriter in U.S. municipal finance, 
      including short-term municipal notes.

			Goodwin Procter Expands Government Investigations, Gambling/Gaming 
      Practices with Addition of Abim Thomas from Mass. Gov. Deval Patrick&#8217;s 
      Office

			Goodwin 
      Procter, a national Am Law 50 firm, announced today that Abim 
      Thomas, formerly Deputy Chief Legal Counsel to Massachusetts 
      Governor Deval Patrick, has joined the firm&#8217;s Litigation Department as 
      counsel in its Boston office. Thomas will be a member of Goodwin&#8217;s Securities 
      Litigation  White 
      Collar Defense Group, as well as the firm&#8217;s Gaming, 
      Gambling  Sweepstakes Practice.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Over the course of her tenure in the Governor&#8217;s office, Thomas&#8217; work 
      focused primarily on support of the administration&#8217;s initiatives in 
      economic development, housing and public safety. She advised the 
      Governor on Massachusetts&#8217; 2011 gaming bill and served as the state&#8217;s 
      lead negotiator for the 2012 tribal-state gaming compact. Thomas also 
      drafted recommendations to improve the Probation Department and 
      legislation to reform Massachusetts&#8217; ethics and lobbying laws.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are delighted that Abim has selected Goodwin Procter as her firm of 
      choice for her return to private practice,&#8221; said Mark 
      Tully, chairman of Goodwin&#8217;s Litigation Department. &#8220;Her experience 
      expands our ability to advise companies, entrepreneurs and investors on 
      online, as well as brick-and-mortar, casino gaming and gambling issues. 
      And Abim adds to our strength in representing those caught up in 
      government investigations and conducting major internal corporate 
      investigations.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Thomas earned her J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center, where she 
      served as an editor for the Georgetown Journal of Gender and the Law, 
      and graduated from Harvard College, where she served as class president. 
      She is vice president of the Massachusetts Black Lawyers Association, 
      serves on the board of the Women&#8217;s Bar Foundation and was recently 
      selected by the Women&#8217;s Bar Association as a member of its Women&#8217;s 
      Leadership Initiative. A member of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial 
      Court&#8217;s Standing Committee on Pro Bono Legal Services, Thomas has worked 
      for the Lawyers&#8217; Committee for Civil Rights in both Boston and San 
      Francisco. She is admitted to practice in Massachusetts and before the 
      U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, the U.S. District Court for

			Microsoft Extends Lead to 23% of the IPTV Middleware Market, 
      According to ABI Research
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft&#8217;s Mediaroom IPTV platform leads the IPTV middleware market and 
      continues to grow in market share as of mid-2012 to 23% of deployed IPTV 
      boxes, despite an environment that is beginning to fragment with many 
      small and regional players. Chinese system integrators ZTE and Huawei 
      also play strongly in the market, based on strong and growing IPTV 
      platforms within China, notably those by China Telecom, which use 
      different suppliers on a regional basis. &#8220;There is a strong split in the 
      IPTV middleware market between system integrators providing an entire 
      solution and specialists in applications and customer experience,&#8221; 
      according to Sam Rosen, ABI Research practice director for TV  video.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With the exception of Cisco, who recently purchased NDS, the system 
      integrator&#8217;s role in customer experience will likely decline over the 
      next few years; instead, this role will be left to client-centric 
      middleware companies with better user experience,&#8221; continued Sam Rosen. 
      &#8220;In addition to Microsoft, companies such as Viaccess-Orca (a subsidiary 
      of France Telecom), Netgem, and others, all have a distinct philosophy 
      on how to create an IPTV system.&#8221; Overall growth in IPTV households, 
      however, means that few companies are likely to lose out. IPTV 
      households will grow from 80 million in 2012 to 117 million in 2017, 
      with growth driven by Asia-Pacific.

&lt;p&gt;BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) has informed the Iraqi government it wants to pull out of a $50 billion oil project, and Baghdad expelled Turkey's state oil operator from another contract on Wednesday, both signals of trouble in Iraq's petroleum policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Exxon has stated in its letter that it has started discussions with some international oil companies to sell its stake," Abdul-Mahdy al-Ameedi, director of Iraq's contracts directorate, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move by Exxon to quit the West Qurna-1 oilfield in south Iraq will exacerbate tensions between Baghdad and the autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan region, where Exxon has signed oil deals seen as more lucrative but dismissed by the central government as illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurdistan has upset Baghdad by signing oil deals with foreign companies including Exxon, Chevron (CVX.N) and Total (TOTF.PA). Kurdish officials say they have the constitutional right to do so, but the central government says only it controls oil policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq's cabinet also said it was expelling Turkey's state-owned TPAO from its exploration block 9 oilfield for an unspecified reason, denying it was prompted by any move by the Turkish company into Kurdistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baghdad plans to reply to the letter from Exxon by Sunday, another oil official said. But it was unclear who would replace Exxon if it leaves the huge oilfield, which pumps around 400,000 barrels per day of crude, with minority partner Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has not commented publicly on its plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doubts about who can replace Exxon in the important project could raise questions about Iraq's target to increase crude output to 5-6 million barrels per day by 2015 from 3.4 million bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some industry sources have said Baghdad is keen to replace Exxon with companies from Russia or China as a way to hit back at major Western oil majors. But it was unclear which companies would have the financial heft to follow Exxon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia's LUKOIL (LKOH.MM) and Gazprom Neft (SIBN.MM) are already working in Iraq. LUKOIL, which already runs a project to develop West Qurna-2, has said that it lacks the resources to take on a project like West Qurna-1 for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon is now at the heart of a long-running dispute over oil reserves and territory between the Arab-led central government and ethnic Kurds, who have run their own regional administration in northern Iraq since 1991.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EXPULSION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq's cabinet also decided to expel Turkey's TPAO from Block 9, where it holds a 30 percent stake, and asked Kuwait Energy to boost its stake to 70 percent from 40 percent. Dragon Oil (DGO.I) holds the remaining 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We respect their decision. If they see such a contract renewal or stake transfer appropriate, we don't mind either," Turkish Energy Minister Taner Yildiz told reporters on Wednesday, in response to Iraq's plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraqi officials said the decision was not related to possible TPAO deals with Kurdistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The cabinet rejected the approval of Turkey's TPAO as a partner," al-Ameedi said. "Removing TPAO has no connection with Kurdistan deals. We know TPAO has no deals in Kurdistan. But this decision was taken for other reasons."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He refused to give any further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraqi oil officials said removing TPAO from the exploration project will not affect the company's other activities in oil and gas fields across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TPAO has minority stakes in the two small oilfields of Badra and Maysan in the south and is running two gas fields along with Kuwait Energy in the province of Diyala and the southern oil hub of Basra, both near Iraq's borders with Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"TPAO can still operate in other oil and gas projects in Iraq without being affected by removal from the exploration deal," Ameedi told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expulsion comes amid tensions between Baghdad and Ankara after Turkey accused Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki of sidelining Sunni Muslims since the onset of a political crisis in Iraq after U.S. troops left in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maliki, a Shi'ite close to Iran, has traded insults with Turkey's Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan several times, with the Iraqi leader calling Turkey a hostile state and Erdogan accusing Maliki of fanning sectarian tensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ahmed Rasheed; writing by Patrick Markey; editing by Jane Baird)&lt;/p&gt;

(OTCBB:SANP), (the "Company"), is pleased to announce that the Santo Mining exploration team supervised by company staff geologist Elpidio Moronta completed the collection of over 220 soil samples from the Walter claim located one mile from Perilya Cerro de Maim&#243;n Mine (VMS) to the west and the world class mine of Barrick's Pueblo Viejo to the east.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Within 48 hours the geochemical soil samples will be delivered to Acme Laboratories for multi-element analysis including gold, silver and copper. The samples were taken on a 100 meter grid at a depth of 70 centimeters using a combination of a small power auger followed by a hand auger. Recently 87 active river sediment samples were collected at 100 meter intervals from the streams that meander through the prospective claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Even though most of the surface area of the Walter claim is covered by Quaternary fluvial sediments, there are plenty of outcrops in the five creeks that meander through the area.&#160;The rock under these sediments is the Maim&#243;n Schist, a bimodal metavolcanics formation.&#160;Foliation is well developed and a few areas of hydrothermal alterations were observed in the Lajas and Guar&#233; creeks. According to the Company's geological consultants, "This concession has considerable potential of finding Volcanogenic Massive Sulfide (VMS) deposits similar to Perilya Gold's nearby Cerro de Maim&#243;n, Loma Pesada, Loma La Mina, etc."&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	This Thursday, the Santo Mining exploration team expects to begin intensive due diligence on the Gexplo " Richard" claim which lies 200 meters SE of Barrick Gold's Pueblo Viejo mine. According to Dominican State charts the tail of the geological trend that passes below Pueblo Viejo extends in a southeast direction passing immediately below "Richard". The exploration team will spend the first few days mapping the Richard geology and follow up with a geochemical survey consisting of soil sampling on a 100 meter grid similar to that undertaken on the nearby Walter claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Santo Mining CEO Al French stated, "Both Walter and Richard lie in the shadow of Barrick Gold's world class Pueblo Viejo mine and we believe that both can be highly prospective for gold, silver, copper and zinc. We are looking to find traces of gold and other metals in the soil medium that may indicate underlying deposits of an economic scale."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      Sustainability Report
		&lt;/p&gt;

			Report Highlights Sustainability-Minded Innovations Critical to 
      Formula for Growth
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) today issued its ninth annual 
      Sustainability Report and second Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
      Report highlighting the Company&#8217;s efforts to create value for 
      shareowners while enhancing well-being for people and communities around 
      the globe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Coca-Cola is intent on growing our business by making a difference 
      wherever our business touches the world and the world touches our 
      business. We are committed to enhancing people&#8217;s lives, economically 
      empowering women, providing access to safe water and promoting water 
      replenishment &#8211; in collaboration with critical partners from civil 
      society and government,&#8221; said Bea Perez, Chief Sustainability Officer at 
      The Coca-Cola Company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since naming its first Chief Sustainability Officer in July 2011, the 
      Company has evolved its sustainability framework. Formerly organized 
      across seven pillars and themed, &#8220;Live Positively,&#8221; the new framework 
      focuses sustainability efforts into three pillars: People, Communities 
      and Environment. This new approach was designed to further embed 
      sustainability initiatives into business plans, while providing clarity 
      to consumers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Highlights of key sustainability efforts and accomplishments achieved by 
      the Company and its nearly 275 bottling partners worldwide, many of 
      which are detailed further in the 2011-2012
				Sustainability 
      Report, include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Our portfolio includes full-, reduced-, low- and no-calorie sparkling 
        beverages, waters, juice and juice drinks, sports and energy drinks, 
        teas, coffees, and milk- and soy-based beverages. We now offer more 
        than 800 low- or no-calorie options &#8212; nearly 25 percent of our global 
        portfolio. Since 2000, our average calories per serving have decreased 
        by 9 percent globally.
      
			
        The Coca-Cola system currently sponsors more than 280 physical 
        activity and nutrition education programs in more than 115 countries 
        with a goal to provide at least one such program in the more than 200 
        countries where it has operations by 2015.
      
			
        The Company&#8217;s 5by20 initiative to enable the economic empowerment of 5 
        million women entrepreneurs across its value chain by 2020 has gained 
        exciting momentum over the past year. By the end of 2011, 131,000 
        women were empowered throughout Brazil, India, the Philippines and 
        South Africa, by programs that offered access to business skills 
        training, financial services, assets and networks of mentors and 
        peers. We expect to enable the economic empowerment of 300,000 women 
        by the end of 2012.
      
			
        In 2011, the Company and The Coca-Cola Foundation gave back a total of 
        $123.5 million to improve living standards for people around the 
        world. This is a 21 percent increase over 2010.
      
			
        Since 2005, as part of the efforts to become water neutral by 2020, 
        the Coca-Cola system has conducted 382 community water projects in 94 
        countries, working hand in hand with local governments and partners 
        including WWF, the United States Agency for International Development, 
        The Nature Conservancy and CARE. Also in 2011, the water use ratio in 
        manufacturing operations achieved its targeted 20 percent reduction, 
        based on a 2004 baseline. In September of this year, the Company 
        announced a long-term global clean water partnership with DEKA 
        Research and Development to bring DEKA President Dean Kamen's 
        "Slingshot" technology to communities where potable water access is 
        limited.
      
			
        The Company has distributed more than 10 billion fully recyclable 
        PlantBottle&#8482; packages across 24 countries, eliminating the need for 
        the equivalent of more than 200,000 barrels of oil since the debut of 
        this innovative plastic bottle in 2009. To continue to accelerate 
        global production of plastic packaging made from plants, in September 
        of this year, the Company announced a partnership with JBF Industries 
        Ltd. To support the partnership, JBF Industries Ltd. will build the 
        world's largest facility to produce bioglycol &#8211; the key ingredient 
        used to make PlantBottle&#8482; packaging.
      
			
        In response to a 2015 goal for all new cold-drink equipment to be 
        HFC-free, approximately 24 percent of our 2011 cold-drink equipment 
        purchases were HFC-free. Also in 2011, CO2 was adopted as 
        the system&#8217;s HFC-free refrigerant of choice for new equipment 
        purchases. By phasing out HFCs, the Company expects to avoid the 
        emission of more than 52.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide 
        equivalent over the life of its equipment fleet.
      
			
        With long-standing conservation partner WWF, Coca-Cola launched Arctic 
        Home, the Company&#8217;s largest cause-marketing campaign in its history. 
        Together with Coca-Cola fans, awareness and funds were raised to help 
        protect the polar bear and its habitat.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Perez says, &#8220;We recognize that the sustainability of our business 
      depends on the health of the communities we serve. We also know that we 
      won&#8217;t reach our 2020 Vision of doubling the business without embedding 
      sustainability into our business to drive efficiency and effectiveness.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Auxilium Inc ended a marketing deal for its hand-disorder drug with Pfizer Inc, regaining the rights to sell the drug in Europe, and pushed up its 2012 revenue forecast to reflect deferred revenue from the termination of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, which had the right to negotiate marketing other Xiaflex indications in the European Union, will return the rights to the Dupuytren's contracture treatment by April 24, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auxilium, which is also testing Xiaflex to treat penile curvature, will record $94 million in deferred revenue. The drugmaker said it now expects between $153 million and $163 million in Xiaflex sales for 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company earlier expected Xiaflex sales of between $65 million and $77 million for the year. Sales of Xiaflex, called Xiapex in Europe, accounted for 22 percent of the company's total sales in its third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auxilium, which filed a marketing application with U.S. health regulators to sell Xiaflex to treat penile curvature on Wednesday, said it still expects 2012 to be its first profitable year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Vidya P L Nathan; Editing by Joyjeet Das)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Nov 07 (Marketwire) -- 
The application software industry, which contains companies such as
Compuware and Microsoft, has been up and down of late. Demand from some
areas along with new products has helped drive sales. However, the
struggling macro-economy has made significant gains a challenge.

    With technology moving forward in leaps and bounds, companies are working
hard to stay ahead of the competition by offering new and improved
products. Some have been focusing on the increasingly popular area of
cloud computing, while others have been enhancing existing product suites
to better meet evolving customer demands. Still others have been relying
on partnerships and collaborations which could also improve sales moving
forward. Read our technical analysis on Compuware by clicking on

    On the earnings side of things, recent quarterly results have been
inconsistent as uneven demand for products, services and subscriptions
have led to some companies falling short. Overseas sales have helped some
companies, though foreign markets have also been mixed in some cases. How
companies perform during the 4th quarter of 2012 remains to be seen, but
those with the newest, most in demand offerings could outperform their
peers. Read our technical analysis on Microsoft at

&lt;p&gt;  BALTIMORE, MD, Nov 07 (Marketwire) -- 
Goldman Small Cap Research, a stock market research firm focused on the
small cap and micro cap sectors, has issued research coverage of Itonis,
Inc. (PINKSHEETS: ITNS), a holding company with divisions in key
verticals, including pharmaceuticals, industrials, and technology. 

    The crown jewel in the Itonis family is Itonis Pharmaceuticals, which is
developing what may be the first over-the-counter, systemically active
preparation delivered via a nasal and/or sublingual spray for the
alleviation of mild to moderate nausea. The size of this market is an
estimated $1 billion annually. 

    Itonis Pharmaceuticals is led by Dr. Charles Hensley, the famed
homeopathic and nutraceutical pioneer and a founder of the Firm that
launched the popular Zicam(R) Cold Remedy.

    In the Goldman Opportunity Research report on the Company, analyst Rob
Goldman outlines his investment thesis. 

    "Dr. Hensley's product development innovation and marketing savvy helped
make Zicam(R) a household name and transformed how homeopathic drugs are

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Tuesday approved Pfizer Inc's Xeljanz treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, one of the company's most potentially lucrative experimental drugs, which is now poised to compete with Abbott Laboratories Inc's top-selling Humira.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it had approved Pfizer's pill for patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis who have not benefited from or been able to tolerate the standard oral treatment, methotrexate. Xeljanz can be used by itself or in combination with methotrexate and certain other standard treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry analysts have predicted Pfizer's drug, which works differently from current treatments and is better known by its chemical name tofacitinib, could eventually capture annual sales of up to $3 billion. The revenue is sorely needed, amid plunging sales of its Lipitor cholesterol fighter and other Pfizer medicines facing cheaper generics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a twice-daily pill, Xeljanz could prove more attractive to some patients than Abbott's $8 billion-a-year Humira, which is given by injection every other week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Abbott has said Humira sales will continue growing by leaps and bounds, despite competition from Xeljanz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is understandable why (new) patients might prefer an oral therapy versus one that requires needle-based delivery," Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note. He added that patients already benefiting from other medicines are unlikely to switch to a new product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA approved a 5 milligram dose of Xeljanz, given twice a day. But the agency said further safety data are needed to assess a 10 milligram, twice-daily dose, that Pfizer had also put before regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anderson said Xeljanz will likely cost $25,000 a year, in line with injectable medicines. Besides Humira, the injectables include Amgen Inc's Enbrel and Johnson &amp; Johnson's Remicade -- all three of which work by blocking a protein called tumor necrosis factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anderson predicted the Pfizer pill, approved two weeks before Wall Street expected, will generate peak annual sales of at least $2.5 billion. Sales could be considerably higher, he said, if Xeljanz is also eventually approved for psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease and other inflammatory conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis and related diseases have been one of the most lucrative segments for drugmakers, with more than $20 billion in annual sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue, causing inflammation and pain in the joints. It affects an estimated 1.5 million Americans, the FDA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An estimated 30 percent to 40 percent of patients with rheumatoid arthritis do not respond to available drugs, meaning there is room for other options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's drug works by blocking molecules called Janus kinases which are linked to joint inflammation. The drug was associated with an increased risk of serious infections, tuberculosis, cancers and lymphoma. Humira, Embrel and Remicade also make patients more prone to serious infections and other complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA said it approved the drug with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, requiring safety information on the drug's package insert label and a communication plan to inform healthcare workers about its risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency is also requiring Pfizer to conduct a postmarketing study to evaluate the drug's long terms effects on heart disease, cancer and serious infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares rose 1.5 percent in after-hours trade to $25.09.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Leslie Adler, David Gregorio and Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BAGHDAD Nov 7 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil has informed Iraq of
its intention to sell its share in the West Qurna 1 oilfield,
and Baghdad will respond to the decision by next Sunday, Iraqi
oil officials said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remarks were the first official confirmation that Exxon
is looking to quit West Qurna after signing exploration deals
instead with autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan in the north, a move
worsening tensions with Baghdad's central government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon Mobil sent a letter to the South Oil Company
expressing its wish to sell its stake in West Qurna 1 oilfield,"
Abdul-Mahdy al-Ameedi, director of Iraq's contracts directorate,
told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baghdad would reply to the letter by Sunday, another oil
official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq also plans to remove Turkey's state-owned oil company
TPAO from its contract for exploration block 9 in the south of
the country, al-Ameedi said without giving any reason for the
decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Media giant Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) posted higher quarterly profit on Thursday, lifted by an increase in visitors to its theme parks and revenue gains at sports juggernaut ESPN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company that recently announced a blockbuster deal to buy "Star Wars" producer Lucasfilm reported diluted earnings per share of 68 cents. That matched expectations from Wall Street analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net income for the quarter that ended in September rose 14 percent to $1.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Disney faces challenges that will pressure results for its fiscal first quarter from October to December, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo told analysts on a conference call. Among them, sports rights' costs will increase by $170 million while home video sales decline by $150 million in light of tough comparisons to "Cars 2" a year earlier, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those issues will not hurt full-year earnings for fiscal 2013, Rasulo said. "I'm confident we will have solid earnings growth for the rest of the year," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Bob Iger said Disney was entering a "transition year" after making investments in projects such as the "Cars Land" expansion at Disneyland Resort in California and a new cruise ship that launched this year. The company is moving from "investment mode" into "a more compelling growth mode," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney plans to stimulate its growth through its $4 billion acquisition of Lucasfilm, announced on October 30, and plans for three new "Star Wars" films starting in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results for the just-ended quarter were driven by the media networks unit that houses ESPN, the Disney Channels and ABC. The division posted operating income of $1.6 billion, a 7 percent gain from a year earlier. ESPN brought in higher rates from cable operators and reduced its marketing costs although advertising income fell, Disney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased programming costs at online video service Hulu dragged on results for the ABC broadcasting unit, Rasulo said.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Lisa Richwine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Nov 8 (Reuters) - Media giant Walt Disney Co
 posted higher quarterly profit on Thursday, lifted by an
increase in visitors to its theme parks and revenue gains at
sports juggernaut ESPN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company that recently announced a blockbuster deal to
buy "Star Wars" producer Lucasfilm reported diluted earnings per
share of 68 cents. That matched expectations from Wall Street
analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net income for the quarter that ended in September rose 14
percent to $1.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Disney faces challenges that will pressure
results for its fiscal first quarter from October to December,
Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo told analysts on a conference
call. Among them, sports rights' costs will increase by $170
million while home video sales decline by $150 million in light
of tough comparisons to "Cars 2" a year earlier, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those issues will not hurt full-year earnings for fiscal
2013, Rasulo said. "I'm confident we will have solid earnings
growth for the rest of the year," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Bob Iger said Disney was entering a "transition year"
after making investments in projects such as the "Cars Land"
expansion at Disneyland Resort in California and a new cruise
ship that launched this year. The company is moving from
"investment mode" into "a more compelling growth mode," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney plans to stimulate its growth through its $4 billion
acquisition of Lucasfilm, announced on Oct. 30, and plans for
three new "Star Wars" films starting in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results for the just-ended quarter were driven by the media
networks unit that houses ESPN, the Disney Channels and ABC. The
division posted operating income of $1.6 billion, a 7 percent
gain from a year earlier. ESPN brought in higher rates from
cable operators and reduced its marketing costs although
advertising income fell, Disney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased programming costs at online video service Hulu
dragged on results for the ABC broadcasting unit, Rasulo said.
The quarter was "slightly negative" for ABC and would have ended
"slightly higher" without Hulu, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theme parks division gained from passengers spending
more time on Disney cruise ships plus higher attendance at parks
in Hong Kong, California and Paris, the company said. Operating
income climbed 18 percent to $497 million during the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operating income at Disney's film studio fell 32 percent, in
part because the box office performance of animated film "Brave"
did not match the previous year's release of "Cars 2."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney shares dropped 2 percent in after-hours trading to
$49. Earlier, shares closed at $50.04, down 4 cents, on the New
York Stock Exchange. They are up 33 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morningstar analyst Michael Corty said Disney produced
"another solid quarter" particularly with its cable networks
business, though he noted that revenue was below what some
analysts expected. Overall revenue rose 3 percent in the quarter
to $10.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Disney has so many good things going for it that any
weakness in the stock would be a buying opportunity," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

      The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) today reported earnings for its

      EPS for the current year includes a $184 million non-cash gain recorded

      EPS for the current quarter includes the Lehman recovery ($79 million),

			Cable Networks
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Operating income at Cable Networks increased $471 million to $5.7 
      billion for the year due to growth at ESPN and the worldwide Disney 
      Channels and an increase in equity income. The increase at ESPN was 
      driven by higher affiliate and advertising revenue, partially offset by 
      higher programming costs. Higher affiliate revenue was due to 
      contractual rate increases while the increase in advertising revenue was 
      primarily due to higher rates. The programming cost increase was driven 
      by contractual rate increases for college sports, NFL, Major League 
      Baseball, and NBA programming and expanded rights for the Wimbledon 
      Championships. Growth at the worldwide Disney Channels was driven by 
      higher affiliate revenue due to contractual rate increases domestically 
      and subscriber growth internationally. These increases were partially 
      offset by lower Disney Channel program sales. Increased equity income 
      was driven by growth at A  E Television Networks (AETN), which 
      reflected higher advertising and affiliate revenues partially offset by 
      higher programming costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the quarter, operating income at Cable Networks increased by $118 
      million to $1.4 billion due to growth at ESPN, higher equity income at 
      AETN, and improvement at ABC Family, partially offset by lower operating 
      income at the domestic Disney Channels. The increase at ESPN reflected 
      higher contractual rates for affiliate fees, decreased marketing costs, 
      and higher equity income at the ESPN Star Sports joint venture due to 
      lower programming costs. These increases were partially offset by higher 
      programming costs driven by contractual rate increases for college 
      football and Major League Baseball and expanded rights for the Wimbledon 
      Championships. The improvement at ABC Family was primarily due to lower 
      programming and marketing and sales costs. At the domestic Disney 
      Channels, the benefit of higher affiliate revenue due to contractual 
      rate increases was more than offset by a decrease due to a significant 
      program sale that occurred in the prior-year quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Broadcasting
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Operating income at Broadcasting remained relatively flat at $915 
      million for the year as higher program sales, lower programming and 
      production costs and higher affiliate and royalty revenue were largely 
      offset by lower advertising revenues and higher equity losses at Hulu. 
      Program sales growth was driven by Castle and Once Upon a Time, 
      partially offset by lower home entertainment revenues primarily due to Lost. 
      Lower programming and production costs reflected the absence of The 
      Oprah Winfrey Show at the owned television stations and lower 
      program write offs at the ABC Television Network. Lower advertising 
      revenues were driven by lower network ratings, which were partially 
      offset by higher rates, and a decrease at the owned television stations 
      driven by lower political advertising. Higher equity losses at Hulu were 
      driven by increased programming and marketing costs, partially offset by 
      higher advertising and subscription revenues.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the quarter, operating income at Broadcasting decreased $9 million 
      to $192 million driven by a decline in ABC Television Network 
      advertising revenues due to lower ratings and higher equity losses at 
      Hulu, partially offset by higher program sales driven by Castle 
      and Wipeout.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Parks and Resorts
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Parks and Resorts revenue for the year increased 10% to $12.9 billion 
      and segment operating income increased 22% to $1.9 billion. For the 
      quarter, revenues increased 9% to $3.4 billion and segment operating 
      income increased 18% to $497 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Results for the year reflected increases at our domestic parks and 
      resorts, Tokyo Disney Resort, Disney Cruise Line and Hong Kong 
      Disneyland Resort, partially offset by a decrease at Disneyland Paris.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Higher operating income at our domestic parks and resorts was driven by 
      increased guest spending and attendance, partially offset by higher 
      costs. Increased guest spending reflected higher average ticket prices, 
      food and beverage spending and daily hotel room rates. Increased 
      attendance reflected strong growth at Disneyland Resort which benefitted 
      from the opening of Cars Land at Disney California Adventure. 
      Higher costs were driven by resort expansion and new guest offerings, 
      including investments in supporting systems infrastructure, labor cost 
      inflation and higher employee benefits costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The increase at Tokyo Disney Resort reflected the loss of income in the 
      prior year due to the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which 
      resulted in a temporary suspension of operations and a reduction in 
      volume after reopening, and the collection of related business 
      interruption insurance proceeds in the current year. Operating income 
      growth at Disney Cruise Line was due to increased passenger cruise days 
      driven by the Disney Fantasy and the Disney Dream, 
      partially offset by the related operating costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Operating income growth at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was primarily due 
      to guest spending, which was driven by higher average ticket prices and 
      daily hotel room rates, and increased attendance, partially offset by 
      higher costs related to resort expansion. At Disneyland Paris, increased 
      guest spending, driven by higher daily hotel room rates, and higher 
      attendance were more than offset by labor cost inflation and lower hotel 
      occupancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the quarter, operating income growth reflected increases at Disney 
      Cruise Line, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, our new Aulani resort and 
      hotel in Hawaii, and Disneyland Paris.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Higher operating income at Disney Cruise Line was driven by increased 
      passenger cruise days driven by the Disney Fantasy, partially 
      offset by the related operating costs. The increases at both Hong Kong 
      Disneyland Resort and Disneyland Paris were driven by higher attendance. 
      Improved results at Aulani reflected a full quarter of operations in the 
      current year compared to the prior-year quarter which included 
      pre-opening costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Results for the quarter at our domestic parks and resorts were 
      comparable to the prior-year quarter as increased guest spending at 
      Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World Resort and increased attendance 
      at Disneyland Resort were largely offset by higher operating costs. The 
      guest spending increase reflected higher average ticket prices, daily 
      hotel room rates and food and beverage spending. Higher operating costs 
      were driven by resort expansion and new guest offerings, including 
      investments in supporting systems infrastructure, labor cost inflation, 
      and higher employee benefits costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Studio Entertainment
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Studio Entertainment revenues for the year decreased 8% to $5.8 billion 
      and segment operating income increased 17% to $722 million. For the 
      quarter, revenues decreased 4% to $1.4 billion and segment operating 
      income decreased 32% to $80 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The revenue decline for the year was driven by fewer theatrical releases 
      in the current year and lower home entertainment sales volume. Higher 
      operating income for the year was driven by increases in domestic 
      theatrical and worldwide television distribution, partially offset by 
      higher film cost write-downs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Domestic theatrical operating income growth reflected the strong 
      performance of Marvel&#8217;s The Avengers in the current year, 
      partially offset by marketing costs for Frankenweenie, which was 
      released after the fiscal year-end. The revenue decline from fewer 
      theatrical releases was largely offset by a decrease in the related 
      distribution and marketing costs and production cost amortization.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In worldwide television distribution, lower revenues from the domestic 
      markets were largely offset by higher international syndication 
      revenues. The increase in operating income was due to a lower average 
      production cost amortization rate on current-year titles.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the quarter, lower segment operating income was driven by a decrease 
      in worldwide theatrical results and higher film cost write-downs, 
      partially offset by improved results in worldwide home entertainment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lower worldwide theatrical operating income was driven by the 
      performance of Brave in the current quarter compared to Cars 2 in 
      the prior-year quarter and the pre-release marketing expense for Frankenweenie 
      in the current quarter. Improved home entertainment results 
      were driven by the strong performance of Marvel&#8217;s The Avengers in 
      the current quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Consumer Products
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Consumer Products revenues for the year increased 7% to $3.3 billion and 
      segment operating income increased 15% to $937 million. For the quarter, 
      revenues increased 8% to $883 million and segment operating income 
      increased 29% to $267 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Higher segment operating income for both the year and quarter was 
      primarily due to increases at Merchandise Licensing and our retail 
      business as well as favorable foreign currency impacts. At Merchandise 
      Licensing, the increase for the year and quarter was driven by earned 
      royalty growth reflecting the strong performance of Spider-Man, 
      Avengers,
			and Minnie and Mickey merchandise in the current year 
      and an increase in Japan as a result of the impact of the earthquake and 
      tsunami which occurred in the second quarter of the prior year. These 
      increases were partially offset by lower sales of Cars
			and Toy 
      Story
			merchandise. Licensing results for the current year also 
      benefitted from lower revenue share with Studio Entertainment and higher 
      guaranteed shortfall recognition. The revenue share impact was due to a 
      lower mix of revenues from properties subject to revenue share in the 
      current year reflecting the strong prior-year sales of Cars merchandise.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At our retail business, higher operating income for the year and quarter 
      was driven by new stores in North America and Europe and higher online 
      sales.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Interactive
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Interactive revenues for the year decreased 14% to $845 million and 
      segment operating results improved $92 million to a loss of $216 
      million. For the quarter, revenues decreased 14% to $191 million and 
      segment operating results improved $18 million to a loss of $76 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Improved segment operating results for the year reflected an increase at 
      our social games business and higher allocations to other Company 
      businesses, primarily related to website design and maintenance, 
      partially offset by a decrease at our console game business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Social game results reflected lower acquisition accounting impacts and 
      improved title performance in the current year. Lower console game 
      results were driven by a decline in sales volume from fewer significant 
      releases which was partially offset by lower marketing costs, higher 
      minimum guarantee recognition and decreased product development costs. 
      The reduction in console games product development reflected an ongoing 
      shift from console game releases to mobile and social game releases.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the quarter, improved operating results were primarily due to lower 
      acquisition accounting impacts at our social games business and higher 
      allocations to other Company businesses related to website design and 
      maintenance, partially offset by a decrease at our console game business 
      driven by fewer significant titles in release in the current quarter.

			Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses

		&lt;p&gt;
      Corporate and unallocated shared expenses increased $15 million to $474 
      million for the year and increased $16 million to $140 million for the 
      quarter. The increase for the year was driven by higher compensation 
      related costs and charitable contributions, while the increase for the 
      quarter was primarily due to higher charitable contributions.

      The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year was due to the 
      impact in the prior-year of the gain on the sale of Miramax and an 
      increase in current year earnings from foreign operations subject to tax 
      at rates lower than the federal statutory income tax rate. The book 
      value of Miramax included non-deductible goodwill such that the taxable 
      gain on the sale of Miramax resulted in tax expense that exceeded the 
      book gain and an increase in the prior-year effective tax rate. The 
      decreases from the impacts of the Miramax gain and foreign earnings were 
      partially offset by the impact in the prior-year related to an 
      impairment charge. The prior-year impairment charge related to assets 
      that had tax basis in excess of the book value resulting in a tax 
      benefit that exceeded the pre-tax impairment charge and a decrease in 
      the prior-year effective tax rate.

      Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year 
      increased $40 million to $491 million and for the quarter decreased $18 
      million to $146 million. The increase for the year was due to improved 
      operating results at ESPN and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort partially 
      offset by lower operating results at Disneyland Paris including the 
      impact of the DLP debt charge. The decrease for the quarter was driven 
      by the impact of the DLP debt charge.

      Cash provided by operations for fiscal 2012 increased 14% or $972 
      million to $8.0 billion as compared to fiscal 2011. The increase in cash 
      provided by operations was due to higher segment operating results and 
      the timing of and improved receivable collections, partially offset by 
      higher income tax payments, the payment of interest accrued in prior 
      years on Disneyland Paris borrowings, and higher film production

      discussion of non-GAAP financial measures that follows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The total borrowings shown above include $267 million and $2,311 million 
      attributable to our consolidated international theme parks as of 
      September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011, respectively. Cash and cash 
      equivalents attributable to our consolidated international theme parks

			Non-GAAP Financial Measures

      This earnings release presents earnings per share excluding the impact 
      of certain items, net borrowings, free cash flow, and aggregate segment 
      operating income, all of which are important financial measures for the 
      Company but are not financial measures defined by GAAP.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      These measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP 
      financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of 
      earnings per share, borrowings, cash flow or net income as determined in 
      accordance with GAAP. Earnings per share excluding certain items, net 
      borrowings, free cash flow, and aggregate segment operating income as we 
      have calculated them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures 
      reported by other companies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Earnings per share excluding certain items 
      &#8211; The Company uses earnings per share excluding certain items to 
      evaluate the performance of the Company&#8217;s operations exclusive of 
      certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to 
      period. The Company believes that information about earnings per share 
      exclusive of these impacts is useful to investors, particularly where 
      the impact of the excluded items is significant in relation to reported 
      earnings, because the measure allows for comparability between periods 
      of the operating performance of the Company&#8217;s business and allows 
      investors to evaluate the impact of these items separately from the 
      impact of the operations of the business.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The following table reconciles reported earnings per share to earnings 
      per share excluding certain items:

			(1) Restructuring and impairment charges for the current year 
      totaled $100 million and consisted of $78 million of severance and 
      facilities costs, of which $35 million was recorded in the current 
      quarter, and $14 million for an intellectual property impairment 
      recorded in the current quarter. Restructuring and impairment charges 
      for the prior year totaled $55 million and consisted of severance and 
      facilities costs totaling $39 million, a $10 million impairment charge 
      related to the sale of assets and $6 million for radio FCC license 
      impairment. The assets that were sold had tax basis significantly in 
      excess of the book value, resulting in a $44 million tax benefit on the 
      restructuring and impairment charges.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			(2) Other income/(expense), net for the current year consists 
      of the UTV gain ($184 million) and the Lehman recovery ($79 million), 
      partially offset by the DLP debt charge ($24 million). The Lehman 
      recovery and the DLP debt charge were recorded in the current quarter. 
      Other income/(expense), net for the prior year consists of gains on the 
      sales of Miramax and BASS ($75 million). The tax effect on these gains 
      exceeded the pretax benefit resulting in a $32 million net loss.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			(3) Diluted EPS excluding certain items may not equal the sum 
      of the column due to rounding.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Net borrowings &#8211; The Company believes that 
      information about net borrowings provides investors with a useful 
      perspective on our financial condition. Net borrowings reflect the 
      subtraction of cash and cash equivalents from total borrowings. Since we 
      earn interest income on our cash balances that offsets a portion of the 
      interest expense we pay on our borrowings, net borrowings can be used as 
      a measure to gauge net interest expense. In addition, a portion of our 
      cash and cash equivalents is available to repay outstanding indebtedness 
      when the indebtedness matures or when other circumstances arise. 
      However, we may not immediately apply cash and cash equivalents to the 
      reduction of debt, nor do we expect that we would use all of our 
      available cash and cash equivalents to repay debt in the ordinary course 
      of business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Free cash flow &#8211; The Company uses free cash 
      flow (cash provided by operations less investments in parks, resorts and 
      other property), among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its 
      operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than 
      capital expenditures. Management believes that information about free 
      cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash 
      available to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments 
      and pay dividends or repurchase shares.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Aggregate segment operating income &#8211; The 
      Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on 
      segment operating income, and management uses aggregate segment 
      operating income as a measure of the performance of operating businesses 
      separate from non-operating factors. The Company believes that 
      information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors 
      by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the 
      Company&#8217;s portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors 
      that affect net income, thus providing separate insight into both 
      operations and the other factors that affect reported results.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A reconciliation of segment operating income to net income is as follows 
      (in millions):

&lt;p&gt;OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's Supreme Court struck down the patent on global pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer Inc's Viagra erectile dysfunction drug on Thursday and opened the door to generic competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court backed an appeal by Israeli-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd - the world's largest generic drug maker - which argued Pfizer had been too vague when filing its patent, which runs out in 2014 in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a unanimous 7-0 verdict, the court said Pfizer had not provided enough details to identify the active ingredient in Viagra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer gained a benefit from the (Patent) Act - exclusive monopoly rights - while withholding disclosure in spite of its disclosure obligations under the act," Justice Louis LeBel wrote on behalf of the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a matter of policy and sound interpretation, patentees cannot be allowed to 'game' the system in this way ... (the patent) is invalid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, Pfizer has successfully defended patent lawsuits from Teva in the United States, Spain, Norway and New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer expects to face generic competition in Canada shortly. The company ... is disappointed with the court's ruling," the firm said in a statement e-mailed to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company spokeswoman Christina Antoniou, citing commercial confidentiality, declined to say how much the Canadian Viagra market is worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's Canadian patent - which came into force in 1998 - was divided into seven parts and covered 260 quintillion different chemical compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But only one of the compounds - sildenafil - was active and the court said the patent had not provided enough information to allow another company to produce Viagra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer had the information needed to disclose the useful compound and chose not to release it," the ruling said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even though Pfizer knew that the effective compound was sildenafil at the time it filed the application ... it chose a method of drafting that failed clearly to set out what the invention was."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LeBel - who said "wilful intent to mislead has not been alleged or proven in this case" - noted that Pfizer's submission to the Supreme Court had offered no explanation for withholding the information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teva took the case to the Supreme Court after two lower courts in Canada ruled against it. No one at the firm was immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damien Conover, an analyst at Morningstar, said he expects the Canadian ruling to have minimal impact on Viagra sales in the United States, even though people are more likely to buy "lifestyle" drugs such as Viagra as generics than they are to buy generic life-saving drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But I think it'll be a minor impact. I can't say how much it will hurt (U.S.) sales, but it'll be minimal," Conover added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even Teva isn't expected to gain much, said Kevin Kedra, an analyst at Gabelli &amp; Co. "I don't think this is something that will move the needle for either company," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viagra is Pfizer's sixth-biggest medicine, with annual sales of about $2 billion. Its sales have been crimped by competition from Eli Lilly and Co's longer-acting Cialis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is 33951, Teva Canada Ltd against Pfizer Canada Inc et al.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(With additional writing by Jeffrey Hodgson, additional reporting by Debra Sherman; Editing by Jan Paschal, Andrew Hay and Peter Galloway)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Court rules Viagra patent no longer valid&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Pfizer says expects generic competition shortly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By David Ljunggren&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OTTAWA, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Canada's Supreme Court struck down
the patent on global pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer Inc's 
Viagra erectile dysfunction drug on Thursday and opened the door
to generic competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court backed an appeal by Israeli-based Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd - the world's largest
generic drug maker - which argued Pfizer had been too vague 
when filing its patent, which runs out in 2014 in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a unanimous 7-0 verdict, the court said Pfizer had not
provided enough details to identify the active ingredient in
Viagra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer gained a benefit from the (Patent) Act - exclusive
monopoly rights - while withholding disclosure in spite of its
disclosure obligations under the act," Justice Louis LeBel wrote
on behalf of the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a matter of policy and sound interpretation, patentees
cannot be allowed to 'game' the system in this way ... (the
patent) is invalid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, Pfizer has successfully defended patent
lawsuits from Teva in the United States, Spain, Norway and New
Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer expects to face generic competition in Canada
shortly. The company ... is disappointed with the court's
ruling," the firm said in a statement e-mailed to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company spokeswoman Christina Antoniou, citing commercial
confidentiality, declined to say how much the Canadian Viagra
market is worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's Canadian patent - which came into force in 1998 -
was divided into seven parts and covered 260 quintillion
different chemical compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But only one of the compounds - sildenafil - was active and
the court said the patent had not provided enough information to
allow another company to produce Viagra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer had the information needed to disclose the useful
compound and chose not to release it," the ruling said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even though Pfizer knew that the effective compound was
sildenafil at the time it filed the application ... it chose a
method of drafting that failed clearly to set out what the
invention was."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LeBel - who said "wilful intent to mislead has not been
alleged or proven in this case" - noted that Pfizer's submission
to the Supreme Court had offered no explanation for withholding
the information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teva took the case to the Supreme Court after two lower
courts in Canada ruled against it. No one at the firm was
immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damien Conover, an analyst at Morningstar, said he expects
the Canadian ruling to have minimal impact on Viagra sales in
the United States, even though people are more likely to buy
"lifestyle" drugs such as Viagra as generics than they are to
buy generic life-saving drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But I think it'll be a minor impact. I can't say how much
it will hurt (U.S.) sales, but it'll be minimal," Conover added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even Teva isn't expected to gain much, said Kevin Kedra, an
analyst at Gabelli &amp; Co. "I don't think this is something that
will move the needle for either company," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viagra is Pfizer's sixth-biggest medicine, with annual sales
of about $2 billion. Its sales have been crimped by competition
from Eli Lilly and Co's longer-acting Cialis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is 33951, Teva Canada Ltd against Pfizer Canada Inc
et al.&lt;/p&gt;

			With a Salute to Veterans Day, Coca-Cola Welcomes More Than 800 of 
      Our Nation&#8217;s Heroes to the Team That Refreshes the World
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Coca-Cola Refreshments Surpasses Commitment to Hire 800 Veterans in 
      2012
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Companywide Celebrations, Including Visit from U.S. Secretary of 
      Labor Hilda Solis, Honor the Men and Women of the U.S. Military
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For Coca-Cola, Veterans Day this year is just a bit more special. In 
      May, Coca-Cola Refreshments made a pledge to offer at least 800 job and 
      career opportunities to military veterans in 2012. As of this week, that 
      commitment has been surpassed, with 807 new members joining the 
      Coca-Cola team from our armed services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Every year Coca-Cola associates pause to honor the veterans and members 
      of the U.S. military who sacrifice to serve their country and protect 
      our freedoms. As part of this year&#8217;s Veterans Day celebration, employees 
      were joined by U.S. Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis, who shared her 
      thoughts about the importance of supporting the U.S. Armed Forces.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;President Obama laid down a challenge for American companies to put our 
      veterans back to work, and Coca-Cola has answered that call. Company 
      officials announced in May they would bring 800 veterans onboard, and 
      six months later, they've already exceeded their goal,&#8221; said Hilda 
      Solis, U.S. Secretary of Labor. &#8220;Talk about the 'Real Thing;&#8217; when it 
      comes to veterans hiring, Coca-Cola is true to its brand.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola has supported military service members and veterans since the 
      1940s. Today the Company employs more than 5,500 veterans in the U.S., 
      working in a variety of roles across all 50 states.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Coca-Cola Company has a proud history of standing behind America&#8217;s 
      men and women in uniform, which dates back more than 70 years,&#8221; said 
      Muhtar Kent, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Coca-Cola 
      Company. &#8220;We continue that tradition today by partnering with 
      organizations like the USO, bringing veterans into the Coca-Cola 
      workforce and refreshing the members of the extended U.S. military 
      family millions of times around the world each day.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;People are the foundation of Coca-Cola and they have always been one of 
      our most valuable assets,&#8221; said Steve Cahillane, President and Chief 
      Executive Officer, Coca-Cola Refreshments. &#8220;Veterans have distinct 
      skillsets and a commitment to doing the job right, which is why we&#8217;re 
      expanding their ranks at Coca-Cola. With more than 800 former members of 
      the U.S. military joining our team, we&#8217;re strengthened by individuals 
      who know how to lead, how to collaborate and how to perform under 
      pressure.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The announcement of exceeding the 2012 veterans hiring goal caps several 
      days of honoring military heroes at Coca-Cola. Today, the Company hosted 
      its 13th annual Veterans Day ceremony, which included special 
      remarks from the Secretary of Labor, who joined Steve Cahillane in 
      recognizing the Company&#8217;s rich heritage with veterans and the military. 
      The event also featured a keynote address from Michele Jones, Director 
      of External Veterans/Military Affairs and Community Outreach for the 
      President's Veterans Employment Initiative. To close the event, 
      attendees were treated to a rousing performance by national recording 
      artist, Mark Wills.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On Wednesday, hundreds of Coca-Cola associates helped support 
      active-duty military members with a USO Care Package &#8220;stuffing party.&#8221; 
      Atlanta-area employees pitched in to fill more than 10,000 packages with 
      items such as batteries, Odwalla bars, phone cards, toothpaste and 
      personal letters of thanks from Coca-Cola associates. These parcels will 
      be distributed to service men and women to offer them a touch of home 
      and a bit of comfort and convenience as they serve their country.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Addressing employees at the event, Muhtar Kent said, &#8220;With each package 
      you assemble, you&#8217;re telling a soldier you care and that you remember 
      and honor his or her service and sacrifice. And that&#8217;s a very worthy and 
      honorable thing.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reaching the milestone of hiring 800 veterans is not the end of the 
      recruitment effort at Coca-Cola. The U.S. military provides a qualified 
      pipeline of talented individuals who offer a wide variety of abilities, 
      diversity of perspective and ingrained leadership and drive. Moving 
      forward, the Company will ramp up comprehensive programs to recruit, 
      develop and retain our nation's heroes to help build our business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola began its support of U.S. military troops in 1941 during World 
      War II when former Company President Robert Woodruff committed &#8220;to see 
      that every man in uniform gets a bottle of Coca-Cola for five cents, 
      wherever he is and whatever it costs the Company.&#8221; That same decade, the 
      Company began a more than 70-year partnership with the USO. Today, the 
      Coca-Cola system provides more than 2.5 million beverage servings per 
      day to active-duty members of the armed forces, reservists, retirees and 
      their families. In addition, throughout the year, many marketing 
      programs pay tribute to and reward veterans for their service.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Veterans Day provides the opportunity to honor our coworkers who have 
      served, or are currently serving in the military, and to remember the 
      families who await the safe return of their loved ones serving on active 
      duty,&#8221; continued Steve Cahillane. &#8220;Every day we offer refreshment to 
      members of our armed forces. So, whether they&#8217;re stationed in the U.S. 
      or abroad, they can enjoy a little bit of home, and happiness.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co said it plans to buy back as much as $3 billion of stock early next year after U.S. regulators authorized it to buy shares again, the latest sign the largest U.S. bank is healing after big trading losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank halted its share repurchases in May when it said it was going to suffer at least $2 billion of trading losses from bad bets on credit. Those losses ballooned to more than $6 billion. The bank now believes that most of the pain is in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company disclosed the buyback approval on Thursday in a quarterly filing in which it also revealed that it has reached "an agreement in principle" with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to resolve two previously-disclosed investigations related to mortgage-backed securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve told the bank on November 5 that it had approved the plan, JPMorgan said in the SEC filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is moving past the losses from what became known as the "London Whale" trades, for the trader who entered at least some of the positions. The regulatory consequences are still lingering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan disclosed that it is still responding to investigations into the debacle by government authorities in the United States and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The losing derivatives positions were disclosed by JPMorgan on May 10, more than a month after reports surfaced in the credit markets that Bruno Iksil, a London-based trader for JPMorgan known as the London Whale, had made massive bets in credit markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approved plan provides for JPMorgan to continue paying its current quarterly dividend on common stock, the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spent $9 billion in 2011 to buy back its shares. It was on track to spend as much as $12 billion this year until the derivatives losses surfaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Jamie Dimon told investors on May 21 the bank had suspended repurchases of its stock to rebuild its capital and meet higher requirements for financial safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under restrictions imposed after the financial crisis, JPMorgan and other big banks cannot buy back stock or increase their dividends without approval from the Federal Reserve. Those restrictions came about because many banks paid out too much capital in 2007 and 2008 as the mortgage crisis widened, leaving them weaker when they were hit by big losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan must submit another plan to the Federal Reserve, and get approval, to be able to continue using capital to buy back stock after next March. The newest approval suggests that JPMorgan will be allowed to spend at least $12 billion next year, analyst David George of Robert W. Baird &amp; Co noted in a research report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current dividend, which is 30 cents a share, costs the company about $4.5 billion a year. If the company were to pay out that much in dividends and spend $12 billion buying its stock, the total return of capital to shareholders of $16.5 billion would amount to about 80 percent of net income that analysts expect the company to earn in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mid-day trading on the New York Stock Exchange, JPMorgan stock rose 0.9 percent to $40.86 after being up as much as 2.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AGREEMENT WITH SEC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company did not provide an estimate of how much the settlements with the SEC over mortgage securities could cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the cases stems from disclosures by JPMorgan of delinquencies involving one mortgage-backed securitization. The other case is over multiple securitizations by Bear Stearns, the failed investment bank that JPMorgan took over in March 2008 in the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company had disclosed in February that the SEC had said in January that it was considering whether to recommend taking action against the company for the two matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company faces numerous other investigations and private lawsuits stemming from the financial crisis and from the Whale debacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the filing Thursday, JPMorgan raised its estimate of how much litigation could cost the firm above its legal reserves to $6 billion from $5.3 billion disclosed three months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also said it is "in the early stages" of counting the potential impact of Hurricane Sandy hitting the East Coast on October 29. The bank has waived some checking account and loan fees for late payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total financial cost of Sandy to the bank will depend in part on the losses its borrowers suffer after collecting insurance proceeds and government assistance, the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry in New York; editing by Bernadette Baum and Andrew Hay)&lt;/p&gt;

      Procter  Gamble (PG) y Orgullosa est&#225;n trabajando con el Hispanic

      a carreras en ciencias, tecnolog&#237;a, ingenier&#237;a y matem&#225;ticas (conocidas

			Procter  Gamble, its Orgullosa Program and Hispanic Scholarship Fund 
      Partner in Their Efforts to Raise Awareness on the Importance of Higher 
      Education
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			In recognition of November as national scholarship month, PG and 
      Orgullosa will provide scholarships to help increase enrollment among 
      Hispanics in STEM related fields
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Procter  Gamble (PG) and its Orgullosa program are working with the 
      Hispanic Scholarship Fund (HSF) to support Latino students pursuing STEM 
      (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) careers and empower 
      the community with the needed financial and educational resources so 
      they can achieve their scholastic dreams.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Data shows that Hispanics are underrepresented in STEM related fields, 
      where they comprised only 5.9 percent of life, physical and social 
      scientists, 5.7 percent of workers in computer and mathematical 
      occupations and 6.4 percent of engineers1.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Moreover, these careers represent the largest job opportunities in the 
      upcoming years: according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 
      employment in professional, scientific, and technical services is 
      projected to grow by 29 percent, adding about 2.1 million new jobs 
      between 2010 and 2020.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PG and Orgullosa believe a college education, combined with an 
      enterprising spirit and strong work ethic can open a world of 
      possibilities, but barriers &#8211; such as the lack of financial resources &#8211; 
      still keep many deserving Hispanics from achieving their higher 
      education goals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;PG and Orgullosa share HSF&#8217;s passion to support the advancement of our 
      Latino community on the road to success. That is why for more than 25 
      years PG has partnered with HSF, contributing over $4 million 
      nationally. Our commitment to HSF comes both in the form of financial 
      contributions and the personal involvement of our employees and 
      executives. But in the end, our impact is best measured in the lives 
      that have been touched by the opportunity of pursuing a college 
      education,&#8221; said Melanie Healey, PG Group President, North America.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Understanding that education is an empowering tool to help the community 
      seize their limitless potential, this year PG and Orgullosa are 
      donating $120,000 to HSF for scholarships to be awarded for school year 
      2013-2014 in an effort to increase enrollment among Hispanics in STEM 
      related fields.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As a company that serves a diverse consumer base, Diversity  Inclusion 
      is a top priority to us. That&#8217;s why PG and Orgullosa are committed to 
      supporting the Latino community and are sensitive to the fact that often 
      Hispanic students who wish to pursue studies in these areas 
      unfortunately can&#8217;t afford to pay for a college education,&#8221; said 
      Valentina Sanchez, Orgullosa Brand Manager.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our data shows that only 13 percent of Latinos have a 4-year college 
      degree, and this is simply not acceptable. We are grateful for PG and 
      Orgullosa&#8217;s support in our mission to make a difference and increase the 
      number of Hispanic college graduates overall and especially in STEM 
      related fields, by providing them with the resources and financial 
      assistance they need,&#8221; said Frank D. Alvarez, President and CEO of the 
      Hispanic Scholarship Fund.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PG and Orgullosa are inviting consumers to help them and HSF in their 
      efforts to raise awareness on the importance of education by visiting 
      and &#8220;liking&#8221; the Orgullosa 
      Facebook page. There they can also find more information on how to 
      apply for the PG/Orgullosa &#8211; HSF STEM scholarships.

&lt;p&gt;CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela expects international arbitration rulings by late 2013 in multi-billion-dollar claims by Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips over nationalizations by President Hugo Chavez's government, the oil minister said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of more than 20 cases against Venezuela at the World Bank and the International Chamber of Commerce's panels, the biggest involve Conoco (COP.N) and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), which are seeking some $40 billion between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both companies filed for arbitration after Chavez ordered foreign firms to slash their stakes in production and upgrading projects for heavy crude oil in the Orinoco Belt as part of a 2007 wave of state takeovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't expect resolutions this year. Probably the biggest cases (Conoco and Exxon) will be resolved in the second half of 2013," Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not give more details of the ongoing cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A huge compensation bill would be painful for cash-strapped state oil firm PDVSA, which has been unable to boost production significantly while facing an ever-growing commitment to finance Chavez's flagship welfare policies in the South American nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry analysts estimate Venezuela will end up paying considerably less than the companies want - perhaps around $7 billion to $9 billion - based on the market value of the assets at the time. Venezuela has said it expects to pay no more than $2.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), a Paris-based group that settles cross-border business disputes, in December ordered Venezuela to pay Exxon $908 million in compensation for lost revenue from the nationalized Cerro Negro project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chavez government quickly made the payment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The principal disputes with Conoco and Exxon are being heard at the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ICC in September ordered PDVSA to pay Conoco $66.8 million in a dispute over OPEC production cuts - unrelated to the nationalizations - applied in 2006 and 2007 to Orinoco Belt heavy crude upgrader Petrozuata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramirez, speaking in a brief telephone chat with Reuters, said Venezuelan lawyers were studying that ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TARGETS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela's plethora of compensation cases are being closely watched by the global oil industry for precedents in future disputes between companies and producer states, which increasingly want a greater share of oil revenue as prices have risen and new reserves become tougher to find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramirez put current Venezuelan output at between 3 million and 3.1 million barrels per day - well short of PDVSA's target of 3.5 million for the end of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Venezuela has a record 373 rigs active, giving it the platform for future increased output, mainly from new Orinoco projects, Ramirez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OPEC nation is pinning hopes for its oil industry on a string of ambitious projects with foreign partners - largely from politically allied nations such as China and Russia - to develop the Orinoco Belt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The region is one of the biggest, mostly untapped reserves of hydrocarbons left in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramirez said the Mariscal Sucre offshore natural gas project was still expected to begin production in December after years of delays, raising national production to 8 billion cubic feet per day from 6 billion to 7 billion in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela wants to boost gas production to meet growing domestic demand that has forced it to import from neighboring Colombia even though it sits on some of the world's biggest gas reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government says it will eventually certify as much as 400 trillion cubic feet (tcf) in reserves, up from 195 tcf now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would propel Venezuela to fourth in the world behind Russia, Iran and Qatar, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data.

      Research and Markets: Global Enterprise Asset Management Applications 
      Market 2011-2015 with IBM Corp., SAP AG, Oracle Corp., and ABB Ltd. 
      Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/7twxgm/global_enterprise) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Enterprise Asset Management Applications Market 2011-2015" 
      report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      TechNavio's analysts forecast the Global Enterprise Asset Management 
      Applications market to grow at a CAGR of 6.45 over the period 2011-2015. 
      One of the key factors contributing to this market growth is the demand 
      for improved enterprise-wide performance visibility. The Global 
      Enterprise Asset Management Applications market has also been witnessing 
      an increasing focus on real-time information management. However, the 
      lack of internal cross-functional collaboration could pose a challenge 
      to the growth of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Other vendors mentioned in the report: Industrial and Financial Systems 
      (IFS) AB, Infor Global Solutions, Invensys Avantis Inc., AssetPoint LLC, 
      AssetWorks Inc., Blue Mountain Quality Resources Inc., NRX Global Inc., 
      QAD Inc., and ViryaNet Ltd.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from TechNavio's Enterprise 
      Computing team said: ''Organizations require real-time performance 
      indicators in order to achieve their desired strategic goals. Enterprise 
      Asset Management Applications (EAM) applications provide flexible, 
      integrated and real-time information management support for the top 
      management in an organization. They improve the responsiveness across an 
      organization. Since planning and long-term investment decisions can be 
      made on the basis of the analysis of return on assets and the 
      utilization rate of each business unit, EAM applications provide better 
      analysis and planning capabilities. Therefore, the increasing focus of 
      enterprises on real-time information management is one of the major 
      trends in the market.''
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers is the demand for 
      improved enterprise-wide performance visibility. EAM applications help 
      organizations in forming a centrally established and monitored system of 
      consolidated assets and they provide a single platform for its 
      visibility.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report discusses that the lack of internal cross-functional 
      collaboration is one of the major challenges confronting this market.

&lt;p&gt;OTTAWA Nov 8 (Reuters) - Canada's Supreme Court on Thursday
ruled against global drug giant Pfizer Inc, ruling that
a patent on its Viagra erectile dysfunction drug was no longer
valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court backed an appeal by Israeli-based Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd - the world's largest
generic drug maker - which argued Pfizer had not provided enough
details when filing its patent, which runs out in 2014 in
Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

			Blue Rooster Launches &#8220;Madison,&#8221; Bringing Secure Document Sharing 
      Based on Microsoft SharePoint to the Enterprise, Introduces Fujitsu 
      Computer Products of America as Launch Partner
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Blue Rooster (www.bluerooster.com), 
      an interactive agency and technology company specializing in driving 
      adoption of Global 500 intranets in today&#8217;s consumer-driven world, today 
      announced the availability of &#8220;Madison&#8221; (www.sharewithmadison.com), 
      a pioneering document sharing and collaboration tool based on Microsoft 
      SharePoint. Blue Rooster developed Madison to make sharing business 
      documents easier than ever before by enabling users to collaborate on 
      documents and manage project folders both inside and outside their 
      respective firewalls.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of today&#8217;s launch, Blue Rooster announced that Fujitsu 
      Computer Products of America, Inc., the market leader in document 
      imaging scanners, is Madison&#8217;s first enterprise customer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Adding to its ease of adoption, Blue Rooster engineered Madison to 
      leverage the core IT infrastructure already in place for the vast 
      majority of Global 500 companies: Microsoft Office, SharePoint and 
      Microsoft Azure. Being powered by SharePoint and Azure enables seamless 
      integration for Madison. In addition to security benefits, this also 
      allows Madison to be cost-effective, as corporations can keep their IT 
      infrastructure within the Microsoft ecosystem.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As a key North American business unit within a multinational 
      corporation such as Fujitsu, we know that the ability to securely share 
      files and improve collaboration that Madison empowers is of tremendous 
      value for our employees that are constantly interacting with 
      stakeholders across multiple countries,&#8221; said Scott Francis, vice 
      president of marketing, Fujitsu Computer Products of America, Inc. &#8220;We 
      look forward to working with Blue Rooster to establish and deepen the 
      implementation to assist in the SharePoint-based document collaboration 
      with our workforce around the globe.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We developed Madison to provide a simple and clean user experience, 
      requiring little to no employee training and offering seamless document 
      sharing, all supported by the security of internal networks and 
      Microsoft&#8217;s proven enterprise software and cloud infrastructure,&#8221; said 
      Kevin Conroy, Blue Rooster founder and president. &#8220;In doing so, Madison 
      breaks new ground, as while existing third-party document sharing 
      services are popular, they can be cumbersome to use and sometimes fail 
      to adequately address many companies&#8217; security policies by placing 
      documents and other files outside of the firewall. We are thrilled to be 
      launching this solution for enterprise workforces who stand to benefit 
      from the improved employee collaboration and productivity that Madison 
      can facilitate.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Conroy added that Madison was especially designed to accommodate and 
      share files that are too big to email or that require extra levels of 
      security. On the back-end, the combination of Microsoft SharePoint and 
      Azure helps to provide a proven and secure platform for Madison to work 
      effectively for corporate users.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, Madison offers a document sharing capability that 
      simultaneously addresses simplicity, flexibility, and security:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        User experience: Blue Rooster developed Madison to be easier than 
        other document sharing options. From a SharePoint document library, 
        users can right-click on a document or folder and select &#8220;Share with 
        Madison&#8221; from the context menu. They can then enter the recipient or 
        recipients, compose a short message, adjust security settings and send 
        it along. From that point, the recipient receives an email with a 
        link. The recipient just has to click, log in or create an account, 
        and they have access to the document or folder. New users can sign up 
        for a free 5GB Madison account and start collaborating immediately.
      
			
        Activity feeds: Madison incorporates employee activity feeds to 
        support improved internal communication and true collaboration. 
        Madison&#8217;s activity feeds are also tied to SharePoint&#8217;s social feeds;
      
			
        Flexibility: If users want or need to send the link over IM and not 
        via email, they can simply take the link from Madison and paste it in 
        their IM. And if they&#8217;re navigating in a folder full of documents, 
        &#8220;Gallery view&#8221; and &#8220;Preview&#8221; capabilities enable users to sort through 
        the documents quickly. They can also open documents in the browser, 
        where a Madison sharing menu is available on the right side of the 
        screen.
      
			
        Security: Madison allows users to password-protect the files they 
        share. If a user only shares a single file, the recipient won&#8217;t be 
        able to access any of the other files in the folder. And the &#8220;Share 
        with Madison&#8221; capability can be added to any document library within a 
        SharePoint installation, but does not need to be installed on all 
        libraries, so IT can manage the libraries on an individual basis.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Madison also provides specific functionality around document preview and 
      commenting in which users can comment on shared documents in the 
      document preview mode. Madison&#8217;s preview capability supports a wide 
      variety of document types, including Microsoft Office file formats as 
      well as PDFs, images and movies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Madison users can also monitor activity feeds and manage access to 
      shared documents and folders accordingly. They can also manage versions 
      of designated documents, as previous versions are archived and can be 
      recovered at any time for updating or reference.

&lt;p&gt;  BEDFORD, MA, Nov 08 (Marketwire) -- 
Acme Packet(R) (NASDAQ: APKT), Verizon and Microsoft are making it easier
for businesses to employ unified communications across a global
enterprise. Acme Packet, the leader in session delivery networks, today
announced that its Net-Net Enterprise Session Director (ESD) enterprise
session border controllers (E-SBC) have been certified as the first to
work with Verizon's IP Trunking Services and Microsoft Lync Server 2010.

    This certification is part of Acme Packet's strategy to simplify and
accelerate SIP trunking, which Acme Packet announced earlier this year. 

    News Highlights:


--  The Acme Packet Net-Net ESD is the first SBC that Verizon has
    certified with Microsoft Lync Server 2010 for the Verizon VoIP IP
    Trunking service.
    
    
--  This announcement builds on the global effort by Acme Packet and
    Verizon to offer managed and non-managed session delivery network
    solutions to customers in more than 20 countries. Verizon's managed
    SBC solution for Acme Packet offerings can be leveraged to provide
    full management support, including design and engineering,
    implementation, ongoing monitoring and change management services.
    
    
--  Acme Packet's portfolio simplifies and accelerates SIP trunking
    deployments through an enhanced provisioning approach that quickly
    resolves multi-vendor interoperability issues and codec
    incompatibilities often found in heterogeneous environments, as well
    as challenges related to security, reliability and regulatory
    compliance.
    
    
--  Verizon customers that implement Verizon VoIP IP Trunking service with
    the Acme Packet and Microsoft Lync 2010 configuration will be able to
    deploy interactive voice and video communications onto a common IP
    backbone. As a result, enterprises can reduce fees, consolidate
    equipment and trunks, streamline operations, and improve collaboration
    and worker productivity.
    
    
--  The Acme Packet Net-Net ESD provides key session control and
    internetworking functions that enable customers to integrate Microsoft
    Lync with legacy multi-vendor communications environments without
    compromising Microsoft Lync's powerful enterprise voice features.
    
    
--  Acme Packet Net-Net ESD solutions for Microsoft Lync Server 2010 were
    the first to be qualified as part of the Enterprise SBC category in
    Microsoft's Lync Server Unified Communications Open Interoperability
    Program (UCOIP).
    


    

Solution Benefits:


--  Smooth migration to Microsoft Lync 2010 unified communications
    environment
--  Enhanced Microsoft Lync 2010 Enterprise Voice experience when
    deploying with Verizon VoIP IP Trunking service

businesses interested in combining Microsoft Lync with our IP Trunking
with the added benefit of Acme Packet's premises-based SBC," said Bob
Minai, executive director of advanced communications product management
for Verizon Enterprise Solutions "The Verizon IP Trunking service
delivers compelling cost efficiencies with features such as burstable
enterprise shared trunks and VoIP enterprise routing to generate cost
savings that can be reinvested to fund new unified communications

strategy to provide secure, simplified SIP trunking to our partners and
end customers," said Dino Di Palma, chief operating officer, Acme Packet.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CORAL GABLES, Fla., Nov. 8, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Catalyst Pharmaceutical Partners, Inc. (Nasdaq:CPRX) today announced top-line results from its U.S. Phase II(b) clinical trial evaluating the use of CPP-109 (vigabatrin) to treat cocaine addiction. The data from the trial showed that CPP-109 did not meet the primary endpoint -- that a significantly larger proportion of CPP-109-treated subjects than placebo-treated subjects were cocaine-free during the last two weeks of the treatment period (Weeks 8 and 9). The data also showed that the two key secondary endpoints, a significantly larger increase in cocaine negative urines and a significant decrease in the weekly fraction of use days in medication-treated subjects during weeks 3-9, also were not met. The clinical trial did not reveal any unexpected "serious" adverse events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Catalyst expects the remaining protocol-specified analyses for other secondary and exploratory clinical endpoints and safety data to be completed during the first half of next year, after all the follow-up clinical data have been received to be able to fully unblind the trial data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Patrick J. McEnany, Catalyst's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "We are obviously very disappointed with the top-line results from our Phase II(b) cocaine trial, particularly given the changes that were incorporated into the protocol for this trial to ensure maximum medication compliance from a more motivated patient population. Once we have the full data set, we will meet with our collaborator on the Phase II(b) trial, the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA), to determine next steps, if any, in the clinical development program for CPP-109 for cocaine addiction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Mr. McEnany continued, "In the near term, we intend to focus all of our efforts on the development of our two other product candidates: FirdapseTM for the treatment of Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) and CPP-115 for the treatment of infantile spasms. Both of these product candidates have received orphan drug designation and are intended to treat a rare neurological disorder. We will also monitor the results of the ongoing investigator-sponsored study evaluating the use of CPP-109 for the treatment of Tourette's Disorder to determine whether we should pursue future studies of CPP-109 with respect to that orphan indication."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			About Catalyst Pharmaceutical Partners&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Catalyst Pharmaceutical Partners, Inc. is a development-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of prescription drugs targeting diseases and disorders of the central nervous system. Catalyst has three products in development, CPP-109 (vigabatrin, a GABA aminotransferase inhibitor), which Catalyst plans to develop for the treatment of cocaine addiction and Tourette's Disorder, CPP-115, another GABA aminotransferase inhibitor that is more potent than vigabatrin and has reduced side effects (e.g., visual field defects, or VFDs) from those associated with vigabatrin, which Catalyst plans to develop for the treatment of drug addiction and epilepsy (primarily infantile spasms) and FirdapseTM, which Catalyst plans to develop for commercialization in North America as a treatment for LEMS.

			This press release contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause Catalyst's actual results in future periods to differ materially from forecasted results. A number of factors, including whether CPP-109 will be determined to be an effective treatment for cocaine addiction and Tourette's Disorder, whether CPP-115 will be determined to be an effective treatment for its targeted indications, whether Firdapse&#8482; will be determined to be an effective treatment for LEMS or other diseases, whether Catalyst will ever receive an approval of an NDA for any of its product candidates, whether Catalyst will ever be in a position to commercialize any of its product candidates, and those other factors described in Catalyst's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), could adversely affect the forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Copies of Catalyst's filings with the SEC are available from the SEC, may be found on Catalyst's website or may be obtained upon request from Catalyst.

&lt;p&gt;  VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, Nov 08 (MARKET WIRE) --
CBM Asia Development Corp. ("CBM Asia" or the "Company") (TSX
VENTURE:TCF)(US:CBMDF)(FRANKFURT:IY2) announces that it is in
negotiations with ExxonMobil to farm into three existing coalbed methane
production sharing contracts (PSC) in the Barito Basin, South Kalimantan,
Indonesia and acquire rights to farm into certain additional PSCs in the
Kutai Basin, East Kalimantan. CBM Asia and ExxonMobil would hold equal
ownership interest in each PSC.

    The final terms and conditions of the proposed farm-in remain subject to
the negotiation and execution of formal agreements between ExxonMobil and
CBM Asia, as well as, among other conditions, government approvals.

    Barito Basin. CBMA will acquire a 35% to 37.5% participating interests in
three existing PSCs in the Barito Basin, South Kalimantan, Indonesia.
Furthermore, CBM Asia will have rights to acquire 35% in one additional
PSC in which ExxonMobil may acquire an interest. CBM Asia and ExxonMobil
plan to carry out certain pilot well test programs, and CBM Asia will
fund certain operating costs associated with the PSCs. 

    Kutai Basin. In addition, CBM Asia will acquire the right to farm into
50% of ExxonMobil's future participating interest in certain coalbed
methane PSCs in which ExxonMobil may acquire an interest located in the
Kutai Basin, East Kalimantan. Subject to, among other things, government
approval, upon ExxonMobil acquiring its participating interest in one or
more of such existing and potential PSCs, ExxonMobil will farm out/assign
50% of its participating interest to CBM Asia.

    "The Barito Basin holds approximately 100 Tcf of in-place(1) CBM
resources based on industry estimates," states CBM Asia Chairman Scott
Stevens. "CBM Asia's technical team has been reviewing the technical data
since May 2012 and consider the Barito Basin to be one of the world's
best undeveloped CBM basins."

    "CBM Asia's management team is excited by the opportunity to work with
ExxonMobil," states CBM Asia President and CEO Alan T. Charuk. "We have
been in detailed discussions with ExxonMobil for several months and
jointly aim for more efficient and effective development programs. Upon
closing, the Barito Basin PSC's farm-ins and the potential Kutai Basin
PSCs will result in a material increase in our Indonesian acreage
position and potential recoverable resource. We are close to finalizing
our 2012 agenda of adding material low-cost acreage to our portfolio and
look forward to our 2013 exploration and pilot production programs."

regulators have approved a plan for the company to use its
capital to buy back its stock in the first quarter of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which had suspended buybacks in May, had

after containing its London Whale derivatives losses at about
$6.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve informed the bank on Nov. 5 that it had
approved the plan, the company said in a quarterly filing on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approved plan provides for the company to continue

			Portland General Electric Reports Third Quarter 2012 Financial Results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Earnings of $0.50 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2012
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Earnings guidance for 2012 reaffirmed ranging between $1.85 to $2.00 
      per diluted share
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Portland General Electric Company (NYSE: POR)
			today reported net 
      income of $38 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, for the third quarter 
      of 2012, compared with $27 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, for the 
      third quarter of 2011. This increase was due to several items including 
      a 2% increase in residential deliveries, the impact of the power cost 
      adjustment mechanism (PCAM), and an increase in unrealized gains on 
      non-qualified benefit plan trust assets. For the nine months ended 
      September 30, 2012, net income was $113 million, or $1.49 per diluted 
      share, compared with $118 million, or $1.57 per diluted share for the 
      nine months ended September 30, 2011. This decrease was primarily driven 
      by a 2% decrease in residential energy deliveries as a result of warmer 
      weather during the 2012 heating season, and a 1% decrease in average 
      variable power cost as a result of lower natural gas prices partially 
      offset by lower energy received from hydro and wind generating resources.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PGE made continued progress toward implementing its Integrated Resource 
      Plan (IRP) this quarter. For the energy and capacity request for 
      proposals, numerous bids, including the Company&#8217;s benchmark proposals, 
      have been received and PGE is in the process of identifying an initial 
      short list of projects, which is expected by the end of 2012. The 
      Company expects negotiations with final short listed bidders to begin in 
      late 2012 or early 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Also, in October, PGE issued a request for proposals seeking 
      approximately 100 average megawatts of renewable generating resources. 
      The Company submitted its renewable resource benchmark proposal and all 
      other bids are due next week. PGE expects to select a final short list 
      and initiate negotiations in early 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I'm pleased with PGE&#8217;s performance this quarter,&#8221; said Jim Piro, 
      President and Chief Executive Officer. &#8220;Our operating performance 
      remains strong, and we continue to move forward with our IRP Action 
      Plan. As a result, we are on track to meet our financial and operating 
      objectives for the year.&#8221;

			Third Quarter Operating Results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Total revenues for the third quarter of 2012 were $450 million 
      compared with $439 million for the third quarter of 2011, an increase of 
      $11 million, or 3%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Retail revenues were $422 million for the third quarter of 2012

      Residential energy deliveries increased 2%, while energy deliveries to 
      industrial and commercial customers were comparable to the third quarter 
      of 2011. For 2012, there was an increase in the number of industrial and 
      commercial customers electing to purchase their energy requirements from 
      an approved electricity service supplier. Due to this shift, retail 
      revenues attributable to commercial and industrial customers declined in 
      the third quarter of 2012 relative to same period of 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Wholesale revenues in the third quarter of 2012 were $19 million, 
      a decrease of 21%, from $24 million for the third quarter of 2011. Lower 
      wholesale revenues were due to a 22% decrease in average price and a 1% 
      decrease in sales volume. Lower wholesale power prices were driven by 
      low natural gas prices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Purchased power and fuel expense for the third quarter of 2012 
      was comparable with the third quarter of 2011. Declines in energy 
      received from hydro and wind resources led to a 1% increase in average 
      variable power cost, which was offset by a 1% decrease in total retail 
      load requirement. The average variable power cost increased to $33.89 
      per megawatt hour in the third quarter of 2012 compared with $33.49 per 
      megawatt hour in the third quarter of 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Energy received from hydroelectric resources, including that purchased 
      from mid-Columbia projects, in the third quarter of 2012 decreased 32% 
      from the third quarter of 2011. This was 14% above the levels projected 
      in PGE&#8217;s 2012 Annual Power Cost Update Tariff (AUT) for the current 
      quarter, compared with 16% above the levels projected in the 2011 AUT 
      for the third quarter of 2011. Energy received from the Company&#8217;s Biglow 
      Canyon Wind Farm decreased 10%, from less favorable wind conditions 
      during the third quarter of 2012 relative to the third quarter of 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2012, actual 
      net variable power costs (NVPC) were approximately $4 million and $14 
      million, respectively, below baseline NVPC. NVPC for the year ending 
      December 31, 2012 is currently estimated to be within the $15 million 
      lower deadband of the PCAM. Accordingly, no estimated refund to or 
      collection from customers was recorded as of September 30, 2012. For the 
      third quarter of 2011, actual NVPC was approximately $7 million below 
      baseline NVPC, with PGE recording an estimated refund to customers of $4 
      million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Administrative and other expense decreased $5 million, or 9%, 
      driven by lower legal fees and employee compensation and benefit costs, 
      partially offset by increased pension-related costs resulting from a 
      lower discount rate and lower return on trust assets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Other income, net was $1 million in the third quarter of 2012 
      compared with Other expense, net of $3 million in the third quarter of 
      2011, as PGE recorded unrealized losses on the non-qualified benefit 
      plan trust assets in the amount of $4 million in the third quarter of 
      2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Income taxes increased in the third quarter of 2012 for an 
      effective tax rate of 33.9% compared with an effective tax rate of 28.9% 
      in the third quarter of 2011. The higher effective tax rate for the 
      third quarter of 2012 compared with the third quarter of 2011 resulted 
      from a reduced income tax rate benefit from both production tax credits 
      (PTCs) and state income tax credits resulting from an increase in 
      pre-tax income. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended 
      September 30, 2012 was 27.7% compared with 26.3% for the same period of 
      2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			2012 Earnings Guidance
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PGE&#8217;s 2012 earnings are expected to be within the guidance range of 
      $1.85 to $2.00 per diluted share, which is based on the following:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Retail energy deliveries approximately one-half of 1% higher than 
        weather adjusted 2011 levels, excluding certain paper customers that 
        do not significantly impact the company&#8217;s gross margin;
      
			
        Favorable power supply operations;
      
			
        Operating and maintenance costs of approximately $105 million to $110 
        million per quarter; and
      
			
        Capital deferrals of $16 million for the full year, with $11 million 
        recorded in the first nine months of 2012.

&lt;p&gt;BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Two Chevron subsidiaries on Friday appealed a freeze on up to $19 billion worth of the company's assets in Argentina, part of an environmental lawsuit by Ecuadorean villagers that has spanned two decades and several countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subsidiaries, Chevron Argentina and Ing. Norberto Priu, argued that they are not directly owned by Chevron Corp (CVX.N), which was the target of the litigation in Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron Corp, the sole judgment debtor, has no assets in Argentina. All operations in Argentina are conducted by subsidiaries that have nothing to do with the fraudulent judgment in Ecuador," Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson said via email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Ecuadorean court last year ordered Chevron to pay $19 billion for the contamination of watersheds over nearly 30 years that the plaintiffs say sickened indigenous tribespeople and farmers in the Ecuadorean Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has refused to make any payments and accuses Ecuadorean courts of fraud. Because the company has few assets in the Andean nation, the plaintiffs are seeking enforcement of the ruling in other countries, including Argentina, Brazil and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Argentine judge ordered the asset embargo on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The claimants' legal team estimates that Chevron's assets in Argentina are worth around $2 billion and that they could obtain some $600 million a year if the embargo were enforced. Chevron is Argentina's fourth-largest oil producer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two Chevron subsidiaries filed a motion to revoke the court's embargo order, arguing "it is improper on the basis of the plaintiffs' documented fraud, jurisdiction, and misapplication of law," Robertson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karen Hinton, U.S. spokeswoman for the Ecuadoreans, said the asset freeze must remain in place until the Argentine court decides whether it can enforce the Ecuadorean judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect that Chevron's attempt to undo the freeze order in Argentina will fail," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Guido Nejamkis and Alejandro Lifschitz; Additional reporting by Eduardo Garcia in Quito; Writing by Hilary Burke; Editing by David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 9 (Reuters) - Avantor Performance Materials has filed a
lawsuit against IBM for fraud and breach of contract
over the implementation of a software project that resulted in a
"disaster" for the chemicals manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which produces chemicals and raw materials for
pharmaceutical products, laboratory chemicals and chemicals used
in the electronics industry, said in a statement that it was
seeking tens of million in damages from IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the lawsuit filed on Thursday in the U.S.
District Court for the District of New Jersey, Avantor said IBM
had misrepresented the capabilities of a software program that
runs on a platform by SAP, resulting "in a near standstill" of
Avantor's business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM, which partners with German business software maker SAP
 in its consulting business, was not immediately
available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avantor in 2010 chose to replace its legacy information
technology systems with a global SAP roll-out as part of a
rebranding and growth strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to IBM's pre-contract representations, Avantor said
 the software program "was woefully unsuited to Avantor's
business, and could not provide crucial functionality that
Avantor needed to run its core business processes".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avantor also called IBM's consultants "incompetent and
inexperienced".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the system went live, Avantor said it was a disaster
due to a number of errors ranging from failure to track or
process orders correctly to directing "that dangerous chemicals
be stored in inappropriate locations".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the lawsuit, IBM received around $13 million in
fees and was asking for more to remedy the issues around the
software implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite part of the Gagosian deposition starts on page 283.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit of background: Charles Cowles asked Larry Gagosian to sell a painting for him, Lichtensteins&#160;Girl in Mirror. They had an agreement that Cowles would receive $2.5 million of the proceeds, but then Gagosian discovered that the painting was damaged, and also the global financial crisis happened, and it became pretty obvious that the work wasnt going to sell for anything like that much money any time soon. At the same time, Gagosian was in negotiations to buy another painting from Cowles, for $2 million. Cowles was hesitant to accept  but then Gagosian offered $3 million for the pair, and Cowles said yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Gagosian knew but Cowles didnt, at this point, was that another collector, Tom Dean, had offered $2 million for the Lichtenstein. What Cowles knew but Gagosian and Dean didnt was that Cowles didnt actually own either of the works: one belonged to his mother, and the other had been pledged to the Metropolitan Museum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the transcript:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q. Once you received an offer from Tom Dean for $2 million, wasnt it in your interest to offer Charles Cowles as little as possible for the painting so that you could maximize your profit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A. I didnt have confidence that Tom Deans deal would necessarily close, but it gave me what I felt a little more confidence to make an offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q. You can answer my question now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A. Thats my answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q. Sir, it was in your interest in your dealings with Charles Cowles in July or August of 2009 regarding the ultimate purchase by you of the Lichtenstein?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A. Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q. To pay Charles as little as possible, correct? Sir, its a yes-or-no answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A. I just dont know how to answer that question, honestly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A. I really just wanted to get him an offer that he would accept for both pictures because we were stuck with the Tansey, and I felt that this extra million would appeal to him because it was a larger sum, and it did. He certainly had the prerogative to reject it. He never asked me what anybody was paying. He never asked who the buyer was, what they were potentially going to pay. He just seemed to want to get an offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q. Because he never asked, you felt absolutely no duty to tell him, correct?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A. I didnt feel a duty to tell him, because there are many transactions where a seller will just accept a certain amount of money and they dont care what you sell it for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Q here is David Baum, of SNR Denton, representing Jan Cowles, the true owner of the Lichtenstein. The A, of course, is Larry Gagosian. And boiled down, Baum is asking Gagosian whether his profit motive, in buying the painting, was to pay as little as possible. Gagosians answer is one for the ages: I just dont know how to answer that question, honestly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gagosian actually doesnt come off too badly in the transcript as a whole, but this is where hes at his slipperiest. Baum says that its &#8220;blatantly unlawful under New York agency law&#8221; for the same person  in this case, Gagosian  to represent both the buyer and the seller in a transaction. I dont know anything about New York agency law, but that seems bonkers to me. After all, Cowles asked Gagosian to sell the piece in the first place precisely because Gagosian represents a deep pool of sellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gagosian is a broker-dealer, no less than Goldman Sachs is. (Well, maybe his balance sheet is a little bit smaller.) He matches buyers and sellers, and he has to deal with a large amount of counterparty risk. (One of the reasons why he says the Lichtenstein deal was fair is that he says he was worried about whether Dean would actually come through with the $2 million.) And of course he has to worry about lawsuits, too: theres a revealing point in the deposition, on page 194, where Gagosian talks about the time when this matter became a litigation. I see him thinking of his business in various ways: theres the gallery shows, theres the fairs, theres the secondary-market deals, and then theres the litigations. Theyre all just part of what it means to be a dealer, these days: sometimes a deal becomes a litigation, and thats just an occupational hazard when youre dealing with egos this big.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, Gagosian really only ever has one business, and thats keeping clients happy. As a result, youll never get him to admit that he views clients as counterparties, or is trying to maximize his take at the expense of theirs. After all, the real money, in this business, comes from relationships more than it does from deals: a healthy long-term income stream is always better than a one-off windfall. Thats the long-term greedy philosophy which defined Goldman, and its certainly the way to succeed in the art world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is why its worth seeing how the transcript continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A. I didnt feel a duty to tell him, because there are many transactions where a seller will just accept a certain amount of money and they dont care what you sell it for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q. In this case, Charles had told you that the minimum he wanted was $2.5 million?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A. Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q. Now, you were offering him $1 million, correct?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A. I was offering him $3 million for two paintings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q. $2 million for the Tansey?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A. Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q. And $1 million for the Lichtenstein?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A. Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q. And do you think Charles made a bad deal?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A. In Charles Cowles case, its hard to say because he didnt seem to even own the paintings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q. Lets assume he did own the paintings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A. Maybe his indifference to the number reflected the fact that his mother owned the Lichtenstein, I guess, I dont know. The guy was a train wreck, lets face it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q. Did you know he was a train wreck at the time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A. In retrospect, looking at the circumstances, yes, I see that he was a train wreck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theres no point in being long-term greedy if youre dealing with a train wreck. The transcript continues with Baum asking Gagosian why he didnt offer Cowles a $500,000 commission on the sale to Dean, rather than buying the painting for $1 million and selling it to Dean for $2 million. And once again, Gagosian says I dont really know how to answer that. So let me guess what the answer is. The answer is that if Cowles were a valued client of the Gagosian gallery, one who could be expected to provide a lot of custom in years to come, then Larry probably would have given him the choice  would have asked whether he wanted to share in the counterparty risk, or whether he just wanted $1 million up front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Larry understood  since reading people is his business  that Cowles was a train wreck, and that he wasnt building a relationship here, he was just trying to get Cowles to agree to a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we all know, Goldman Sachs isnt nearly as long-term greedy as it used to be. Its business is mainly trading, rather than investment banking and advisory work; its counterparties go to wherever they can get the best price, rather than being at all loyal to one firm. As a result, transactions are characterized by greed on both sides, and Goldmans highly-remunerated traders try at all times to maximize the profit theyre making. They would look at what Gagosian did in this situation and consider it the obvious thing to do: you make full use of your balance sheet, you maximize your profit, and you move on to the next trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gagosian, on the other hand, wouldnt necessarily agree with them. Hes a shark, but hes a shark with a smile, and he doesnt want his clients to be afraid that hes ripping them off. I suspect that hes going to win this case: I cant see that he did anything illegal. But the money at stake here is tiny compared to the value of his reputation as an honest broker. And you can see why some collectors feel the need to hire high-priced art consultants whenever they deal with Gagosian  or any other art dealer, for that matter. The dealer always has the upper hand, and it behooves any client to take full advantage of any negotiation help they can get.&lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Global Marketing Automation Market 2011-2015 With 
      IBM Corp., Oracle Corp., SAP AG, and SAS Institute Inc. Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/crpwnh/global_marketing) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Marketing Automation Market 2011-2015" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      TechNavio's analysts forecast the Global Marketing Automation market to 
      grow at a CAGR of 8.16 percent over the period 2011-2015. One of the key 
      factors contributing to this market growth is the need to enhance 
      marketing communication. The Global Marketing Automation market has also 
      been witnessing the emergence of SaaS-based marketing automation. 
      However, the increasing complexity in the effective adoption of the 
      software could pose a challenge to the growth of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Other vendors mentioned in the report: Eloqua Inc., Marketo Inc., 
      Teradata Corp., Neolane Inc., Microsoft Corp., ExactTarget Inc., and 
      Responsys Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from TechNavio's Enterprise 
      Computing team said: ''With the advent of cloud computing technology 
      that offers huge space for data storage, access flexibility and 
      scalability, software as a service (SaaS)-based marketing automation 
      software is increasingly being developed. The SaaS model for marketing 
      automation offers a pay-per-use model, which provides cost-effective 
      accessibility and a paradigm where marketing automation software can be 
      accessed at any time and in any place by multiple users. Furthermore, it 
      enables organizations to scale their marketing automation modules much 
      more easily. Hence, the Global Marketing Automation market is witnessing 
      a trend where many vendors in the market have begun to offer their 
      marketing automation software through the SaaS model to expand their 
      services and enter new markets.''
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers is the need to enhance 
      marketing communication. The effective deployment of marketing 
      automation software enables extended customer visualization, leading to 
      assured, automatic, auditable, consistent and high-quality communication 
      associated with marketing processes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report discusses that the increasing complexity in the 
      effective adoption of the software is one of the major challenges 
      confronting the market.

			JPMorgan Chase Honors Veterans in Communities across the Country
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Military and veteran employees marching in thirteen Veteran&#8217;s Day 
      parades, awarding nine mortgage-free homes to military families
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) announced today that it will host a series of 
      Veterans Day events to honor U.S. military veterans as well as company 
      employees who have served. The initiatives reflect JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 
      longstanding commitment to supporting America&#8217;s servicemembers and their 
      families.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We have the finest military in the world because of the quality of the 
      people who have served,&#8221; said Frank Bisignano, JPMorgan Chase Chief 
      Operating Officer and Mortgage Banking CEO. &#8220;Veterans Day is about 
      honoring their dedication and service, and while we should take the time 
      to thank and recognize them for their contributions to our nation, we 
      must also do everything in our power to support them while they&#8217;re 
      serving and to help them transition when they return to civilian life.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Veteran&#8217;s Day Parades
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chase will again sponsor the New York City Veterans Day Parade on 
      Sunday, November 11. As a leading sponsor of the parade, the bank will 
      showcase a 100,000 Jobs Mission float, which will be accompanied by 
      employee veterans from JPMorgan Chase, members of the 100,000 Jobs 
      Mission and their families. In March 2011, JPMorgan Chase and 10 other 
      companies launched the 100,000 Jobs Mission, a coalition of companies 
      committed to hiring at least 100,000 veterans by 2020. Since then, the 
      coalition has grown to 83 companies and has hired more than 28,000 
      veterans &#8211; and counting.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase employees with military experience and other supportive 
      employees will march in 13 Veteran&#8217;s Day parades in communities across 
      the country&#8212; Colorado Springs; Columbus; Dallas; Houston; Las Vegas; 
      Media, Pa.; New York; Orlando; Overland Park, Kan.; San Antonio; San 
      Diego; Springfield, Mo.; and Tampa. The bank's senior leaders will also 
      celebrate thousands of employees who have served and who continue to 
      serve in the military at 20 luncheons in 19 cities across the U.S.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Home Awards
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In honor of Veterans Day, Chase and its non-profit partners will award 
      nine mortgage-free homes to military families in Florida, Georgia, 
      Illinois, Indiana, Tennessee and Texas. In early 2011, Chase announced 
      that it will award 1,000 mortgage-free homes to deserving veterans and 
      their families by 2016. So far, Chase has provided more than 330 homes 
      to its non-profit partners &#8211; Building Homes for Heroes, Military Warrior 
      Support Foundation and Operation Homefront &#8211; to award to veterans and 
      their families.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Homeownership Assistance
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Maureen Casey, Managing Director of JPMorgan Chase Military and Veteran 
      Affairs, said, &#8220;Our servicemen and women often face a unique set of 
      housing challenges. Frequent moves and deployments place extra demands 
      on military families. It&#8217;s important that we do everything we can to 
      help these families during what can be a very stressful time in their 
      lives.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Designed with the needs of military homeowners in mind, Chase has opened 
      nine Chase Homeownership Centers in cities near large military bases. 
      Each center is staffed with veterans, family members of those currently 
      serving and dedicated employees who understand the needs of military 
      personnel and are specifically trained to provide one-on-one assistance. 
      In addition, military homeowners can obtain information pertaining to 
      the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA), mortgage modifications, and 
      Chase&#8217;s special military programs. The military Chase Homeownership 
      Centers are located in the following areas:

		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, servicemembers who are Chase customers can receive 
      assistance at any of the Chase Homeownership Centers located across 28 
      states and the District of Columbia or attend a Chase-hosted financial 
      counseling outreach event. The bank has hosted 20 of these events near 
      military bases across the country over the last two years. More are 
      planned for 2013. Servicemembers can also call our dedicated military 
      customer service hotline which is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week:

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's second largest crude producer LUKOIL (LKOH.MM) said on Friday it will study an offer from Exxon (XOM.N) to take over the West Qurna-1 oilfield in Iraq, Interfax news agency said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil has informed the Iraqi government it wants to pull out of the $50 billion oil project in southern Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUKOIL, which is already developing West Qurna-2, has previously said West Qurna-1 is "too big for it to swallow", but on Friday said it would at least look into the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We received an offer from Exxon. We will likely study this possibility. But we haven't make any decision today," Andrei Kuzyayev, head of LUKOIL foreign operations was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baghdad expects Exxon to complete the sale of its shares in West Qurna-1 by the end of December and the U.S. company has told Iraq it is already in talks with other oil majors, a senior official said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon informed us that it has started talks with some oil majors, including BP (BP.L), Shell (RDSa.L), Lukoil, CNPC and Eni (ENI.MI) offering them its complete stake in West Qurna-1," said Faisal Abdullah, a spokesman for Deputy Prime Minister for Energy Hussain Shahristani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our condition for approval of the purchase is that the buyer should have adequate financial and technical resources to develop the super-giant oilfield."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUKOIL is attempting to offset production decline at its fields in Russia, where it faces competition from the state-backed companies, by acquiring foreign upstream assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUKOIL is active in Middle East, Central Asia, West Africa and Latin America.

&lt;p&gt;Rumors about a fresh round of funding for streaming music service Spotify resurfaced today, according to a Wall Street Journal report that cites anonymous sources familiar with the deal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report claims Spotify is close to closing over $100 million, which could put the startup&#8217;s valuation at about $3 billion. The round comes from multiple investors, including Goldman Sachs. The funding amount is considerably less (up to $220 million at a $4 billion valuation) than it was in previous rumors of the round back in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The music service has experienced massive growth ever since its initial launch in the U.S. last year. Shortly after, it hooked up with social media behemoth Facebook to be one of the first Timeline launch partners. The service currently has 15 million active users across 15 countries and over 4 million paying subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founder Daniel Ek has previously hinted that Spotify could generate as much as $900 million in revenue this year. That&#8217;s certainly impressive, but as VentureBeat has previously noted, Spotify&#8217;s business model isn&#8217;t bulletproof. Critics cite the company&#8217;s extremely high music licensing costs as one reason it may not succeed in the future, while warning that it&#8217;s overly dependent on major music companies. Also, indie music labels aren&#8217;t happy with Spotify&#8217;s payment structure and have even removed their music from the service entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My guess is that the alleged new funding has something to do with the company wanting to protect itself from heightened competition &#8212; not from rival music services like Pandora, Rdio, MOG, and Rhapsody but from the likes of Microsoft and Apple. Microsoft recently announced plans to launch a streaming service through its Xbox Live platform, which is very similar to Spotify in both pricing and scope. And rumors say Apple will soon throw its hat into the ring with an&#160;Apple-branded Internet Radio service, which has&#160;provoked lots of fear from both Pandora and Sirius XM shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2009, Stockholm, Sweden-based Spotify has raised a total of $189 million to date from Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, Accel Partners, DST Global, Sean Parker, and others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filed under: Deals, Media&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) said it faces a $3.3 billion spike in costs at its LNG project in Papua New Guinea, the latest Asia-Pacific project to be hit by cost overruns as competition is set to grow from new gas supplies coming on tap in North America and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more than 20 percent jump in costs to $19 billion was blamed on unfavorable foreign exchange rates and delays caused by disgruntled workers and landowners, and comes after costs to develop liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in neighboring Australia to supply the Asian market have also shot up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon told its partners in a letter published on Monday the project remained on schedule for start-up and delivery of gas in 2014 and forecast production capacity had been increased by 5 percent to 6.9 million tons per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PNG LNG project is the impoverished nation's biggest-ever resources development and could lift GDP by 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Papua New Guinea has struggled to attract foreign investment to exploit its abundant natural resources due to corruption and unclear regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in the two Australian partners in the project, Oil Search (OSH.AX) and Santos (STO.AX), tumbled 5.2 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"International groups partnering with Australian companies into these projects are starting to feel the high cost environment," Peter Esho, chief Market analyst at City Index Group Sydney, said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LNG plants are notorious for running overbudget and missing schedules. In Australia, three out of seven projects under construction have announced hikes of an average of over 20 percent, while a fourth is conducting a cost and schedule review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developments in Australia have primarily faced cost jumps due to increased labor costs, a high Australian dollar, and stiff competition for resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong demand from Japan and other Asian countries has helped lift the prospects of LNG projects in Asia-Pacific, but competition is also heating up with new supplies set to emerge from North America and East Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil Search said the increase in the final estimated costs at PNG LNG was "considerably beyond the upper end" of its expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oil Search intends to fully review the revised estimates and is committed to working with the operator to seek to mitigate these estimated cost increases," Oil Search Managing Director Peter Botten said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm said it expected the increase would be funded in line with the project's existing finance terms of 70 percent by debt and 30 percent by equity contributions from the projects partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FX BIGGEST PART OF COST RISE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santos (STO.AX) said it had ample liquidity to fund its higher share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With over $6 billion in cash and undrawn debt facilities, Santos is in a strong position to fund all of its capital programs," Santos Chief Financial Officer Andrew Seaton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even including the higher costs, PNG LNG remains a highly robust economic project."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said that foreign exchange was the single biggest cause of the cost increase at $1.4 billion at PNG LNG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Papua New Guinea kina has risen 20 percent against the U.S. dollar in the last 19 months, while the Australian dollar has held above parity to the U.S. currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delays from work stoppages and land access issues had pushed up construction and drilling costs, adding $1.2 billion to the total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Landowner protests against the project this year prompted the government to deploy troops to "restore law and order", according to local media reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the impact of above average rainfall for most of the last two years, was estimated to have added $700 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite the cost increase, project economics are helped by the 5 percent increase in plant capacity and approximately 30 percent increase in commodity pricing since project funding in 2009," Decie Autin, PNG LNG Project Executive, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil five years ago shelved a troubled PNG-to-Australia gas pipeline project after cost overruns pushed the cost of development to more than $3.5 billion.

a $3.3 billion spike in costs at its LNG project in Papua New
Guinea, the latest Asia-Pacific project to be hit by cost
overruns as competition is set to grow from new gas supplies
coming on tap in North America and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more than 20 percent jump in costs to $19 billion was
blamed on unfavourable foreign exchange rates and delays caused
by disgruntled workers and landowners, and comes after costs to
develop liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in neighbouring
Australia to supply the Asian market have also shot up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon told its partners in a letter published on Monday the
project remained on schedule for start-up and delivery of gas in
2014 and forecast production capacity had been increased by 5
percent to 6.9 million tonnes per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PNG LNG project is the impoverished nation's
biggest-ever resources development and could lift GDP by 20
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Papua New Guinea has struggled to attract foreign investment
to exploit its abundant natural resources due to corruption and
unclear regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in the two Australian partners in the project, Oil
Search and Santos, tumbled 5.2 percent and 2.4
percent, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"International groups partnering with Australian companies
into these projects are starting to feel the high cost
environment," Peter Esho, chief Market analyst at City Index
Group Sydney, said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LNG plants are notorious for running overbudget and missing
schedules. In Australia, three out of seven projects under
construction have announced hikes of an average of over 20

review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developments in Australia have primarily faced cost jumps
due to increased labour costs, a high Australian dollar, and
stiff competition for resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong demand from Japan and other Asian countries has
helped lift the prospects of LNG projects in Asia-Pacific, but
competition is also heating up with new supplies set to emerge
from North America and East Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil Search said the increase in the final estimated costs at
PNG LNG was "considerably beyond the upper end" of its
expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oil Search intends to fully review the revised estimates
and is committed to working with the operator to seek to

Director Peter Botten said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm said it expected the increase would be funded in

debt and 30 percent by equity contributions from the projects
partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FX BIGGEST PART OF COST RISE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santos said it had ample liquidity to fund its
higher share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With over $6 billion in cash and undrawn debt facilities,
Santos is in a strong position to fund all of its capital
programs," Santos Chief Financial Officer Andrew Seaton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even including the higher costs, PNG LNG remains a highly
robust economic project."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said that foreign exchange was the single biggest
cause of the cost increase at $1.4 billion at PNG LNG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Papua New Guinea kina has risen 20 percent against the
U.S. dollar in the last 19 months, while the Australian dollar
has held above parity to the U.S. currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delays from work stoppages and land access issues had pushed
up construction and drilling costs, adding $1.2 billion to the
total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Landowner protests against the project this year prompted
the government to deploy troops to "restore law and order",
according to local media reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the impact of above average rainfall for most of the
last two years, was estimated to have added $700 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite the cost increase, project economics are helped by
the 5 percent increase in plant capacity and approximately 30
percent increase in commodity pricing since project funding in
2009," Decie Autin, PNG LNG Project Executive, said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil five years ago shelved a troubled
PNG-to-Australia gas pipeline project after cost overruns pushed

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY (Reuters) - The cost of Exxon Mobil's (XOM.N) massive gas export project in Papua New Guinea will soar more than 20 percent to $19 billion due to foreign exchange impacts and delays from work stoppages and land access issues, but it is still expected to start in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) is due to name new partners on Wednesday, but the benefits of receiving the title are not what they used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman is the only major Wall Street bank to retain this relic from its private partnership days, when senior investment bankers owned the firm, contributing capital and taking home their share of profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employees with the "partner" title still get a bigger portion of the bonus pool than other employees, and more say in Goldman's strategic direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But changes to the compensation structure have made the partner paycheck less lucrative, because more of their rewards are tied up in Goldman shares that have years-long restrictions on selling, sources familiar with the matter said. Other perks have been eliminated either because of new regulations or as part of a broader cost-cutting effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who make it will get a phone call either from Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein or Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn informing them of their achievement around 8:30 a.m. (1330 GMT) on Wednesday morning from New York. Those who don't make it are told the previous day by their supervisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until then, both the identity of partners and number of partners is a closely held secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of November 2, Goldman had 407 partners, down from 440 in February, according to regulatory filings. The investment bank tries to keep its partner pool at around 1 percent of the overall workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is expected to announce a significantly lower number of partners than its prior announcement, when it named 110 new partners. Some bankers say it might be the lowest number of new partners added to the group since Goldman went public in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People inside and outside the bank watch the announcement closely, because becoming a Goldman partner is seen as prestigious. Potential partners must go through a months-long process known as "cross-ruffing," in which coworkers and partners analyze candidates in minute detail and scrub through their work and personal history to determine whether they deserve the position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first year that vice chairman Michael Sherwood, a high-profile London-based trader, is overseeing the process, a duty that previously belonged to Cohn. Those two executives, along with Edith Cooper, head of human resources, are the only ones who know exactly who will become a new partner before the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decline in partners reflects the bank's overall decline in staffing. Goldman had 32,600 employees as of September 30, down 3,100, or nearly 9 percent, since the end of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is in the final stages of a cost-cutting program that will save the bank $1.9 billion a year. But as the industry automates more trading, and new capital rules make the trading business more expensive, Goldman and its rivals are widely expected to have to cut more staff to ensure that the business earns its keep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra in New York; Additional reporting by Dan Wilchins; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

      Mayor Emanuel joined Steve Cahillane, President and CEO of Coca-Cola

      Foundation to the Garfield Park Conservatory Alliance. This grant will

      affordable nutrition education and active lifestyle programs for Chicago 
      communities who are most in need of wellness services. The initiative, 
      which will be run by the Chicago Park District, will also allow the Park 
      District to hire U.S. veterans to teach military-style fitness classes 
      called &#8220;Coca-Cola Troops for Fitness.&#8221; The program will be available in 
      more than 60 community facilities reaching 125,000 residents annually by

&lt;p&gt;PARIS (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's new Surface tablet - its challenger to Apple's iPad - had a "modest" start to sales because of limited availability, Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer told French daily Le Parisien.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company put the Surface tablet center stage at its Windows 8 launch event last month in its fightback against Apple and Google in the exploding mobile computing market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've had a modest start because Surface is only available on our online retail sites and a few Microsoft stores in the United States," Ballmer was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new device, which runs a limited version of Windows and Office with a thin, click-on keyboard cover, is being positioned by Microsoft as the ideal combination of PC and tablet that is good for work as well as entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer also said 4 million upgrades to Windows 8 were sold in the three days following the system's launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ECONOMIC CRISIS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked what he thought of the re-election of U.S. President Barack Obama, Ballmer told the newspaper the $242.7 billion company would work with the president and with governments around the world on issues like data privacy, immigration of qualified engineers and patent litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch of Windows 8 has already raised the hackles of European Union regulators, who warned Microsoft not to repeat the mistake of denying consumers a choice of rival Web browsers in its new operating system, in a dispute that has already cost the software giant more than $1.3 billion in fines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the outlook for the U.S. economy, Ballmer exhorted politicians to take action on the deficit, though he stopped short of saying whether more emphasis should be placed on spending cutbacks or tax increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not about spending more or less, it's about balancing spending and income...The elections are over, it's time to get back to work," Ballmer, who took over the day-to-day running of Microsoft from its billionaire co-founder Bill Gates just over a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lionel Laurent; Editing by David Cowell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  WICHITA, KS, Nov 12 (Marketwire) -- 
Situated along the Little Arkansas River in Wichita, the Riverside
Mansion is a historic, 28-room home on two acres. Constructed in 1888,
the home is zoned for both commercial and residential use and will sell
at an auction on December 18 at an event conducted by J. P. King Auction
Company. 

    Terry and Paula Lowry bought the mansion in 1994, when the home was in
danger of being torn down. Dr. Lowry, an orthodontist in California at
the time, went to see Riverside Estate with his sister, when it was for
sale. 

    "I didn't even know the building was for sale," Dr. Lowry, who was raised
in Wichita, recalled. "My sister wanted to go through the building, so I
went with her. They couldn't find anyone to buy it, and I was already
planning to leave California. We bought it in April of 1994, and it's
been a labor of love ever since."

    The Lowrys have invested about $3 million in the property since, Dr.
Lowry said. In a "state of disrepair" when they purchased it, the couple
rebuilt the carriage house and reinforced the structural work in the main
building. Determined to maintain the home's historic ambiance, every
detail was preserved. 

    "From all the writing and research that we've seen, this is a replica of
a castle 30 miles south of Scotland, constructed by Colonel Burton Harvey
Campbell. His diary talks about how he imported the staircase from
London, which was about 150 years old when he shipped it," Dr. Lowry
said. "The oldest piece in the home is the Greek fireplace. According to
his diary, it was about 550 years old when he bought it, and they build
the home around these structural antiques. Those are the things that make
it absolutely priceless."

    The historic detail in the Riverside Mansion includes the Grecian
fireplace and the staircase as well as fretwork by a man in an Irish
debtors' prison, working his way to freedom. Hand-carved mahogany
woodwork, ornate fireplace carvings and parquet flooring complete the
architecture.

    Each of the home's 14 bedrooms includes a private bathroom, and some have
private balconies. Located two miles from downtown Wichita, the Riverside
Mansion combines the location and conveniences of the Air Capitol of the
World with waterfront privacy. 

    The auction will take place on Tuesday, December 18 at the estate,
located at 1155 North River Blvd. in Wichita. Property tours will be
available by appointment from December 8 through auction day. For
additional information, individuals may contact J. P. King at
800.558.5464 or visit the company's website at www.jpking.com.

properties and portfolios such as luxury homes, developments,
condominiums and land and ranches. The company has marketed properties in
all 50 states and six countries with recent sales in Colorado, Wyoming,

&lt;p&gt;* Cuts 3-mth soy price f'cast to $16.50/bu, from $18.75&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Lowers 3-month forecast for corn to $8.25, from $9.00&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Cuts 3-month wheat forecast to $9.50, from $10.25&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Investment bank Goldman Sachs
 lowered its price forecasts for soybeans, corn and wheat
after the U.S. Department of Agriculture raised its estimate of
the U.S. 2012/13 soybean harvest above trade expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm said in a research note issued to clients on Friday
that it dropped its three-month price forecast for Chicago Board
of Trade soybeans to $16.50 per bushel, from $18.75
previously, and its six-month forecast to $15.50 per bushel,
from $17.25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For CBOT corn , Goldman lowered its three-month price
forecast to $8.25 per bushel, from $9.00 previously. Goldman cut
its three-month price forecast for CBOT wheat to $9.50
per bushel, from $10.25 previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the release on Friday of USDA's monthly
supply/demand reports, Goldman said, "The main surprise came
from the large increase in U.S. soybean yields, to a level above
the high end of consensus expectations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government data, Goldman said, "confirmed that U.S. and
global corn and wheat inventories remain very low, that the U.S.
and global soybean markets remain in deficit but that risks of
critically tight soybean inventories continue to fade quickly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its note, Goldman predicted that the combination of low
U.S. and global grain inventories, downside risks to crop
production and signs of resilient demand would lift grain and
oilseed prices above current values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Goldman said it lowered its outlook for grain
prices "following the recent downward revision to our oil price
forecasts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the CBOT as of 11 a.m. CST (1700 GMT), December corn
 was down 22-3/4 cents at $7.16 a bushel, while December
wheat was down 25-1/2 cents at $8.61 and benchmark January
soybeans were down 44-1/4 cents at $14.07.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said it expected USDA's final report on the U.S.
2012 crops in January to raise the abandonment rate for corn
acreage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also noted uncertainty about the pace of consumption
and the distribution of export origination, all which could lead
to widely varying prices in the first half of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe that this level of uncertainty is currently
mispriced by the options market, with implied volatility for
CBOT corn, wheat and soybean prices near multi-year low levels,"
Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overview
     -- Goldman Sachs International Bank (GSIB) is the largest European bank 
subsidiary of The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS; A-/Negative/A-2).
     -- We consider GSIB to be "core" to GS under our group ratings 
methodology.
     -- We are assigning our 'A/A-1' counterparty credit ratings to GSIB, in 
line with GS' other core operating entities.
     -- The negative outlook reflects the outlook on GS.


Rating Action
On Nov. 12, 2012, Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services assigned its 'A/A-1' 
long- and short-term counterparty credit ratings to Goldman Sachs 
International Bank (GSIB). The outlook is negative.

Rationale
The ratings on GSIB reflect our view of its "core" status to GS. Our 
assessment is based on GSIB's position as the group's largest European banking 
entity, the high level of operational integration with other U.K. entities and 
the group, and our view that offering securities and banking services in 
Europe and Asia remain central to GS' long-term strategy.

As a result of assigning "core" status, we align the ratings on GSIB with 
those on the other "core" operating companies of GS, which includes the other 
rated U.K. entity, Goldman Sachs International (GSI; A/Negative/A-1). As the 
group holding company, GS is rated one notch lower than these operating 
companies due to its structural subordination.

GSIB serves the international clients of GS in Europe, as well as in Asia, 
through GSIB's Korean branch. GSIB's activities include European government 
bond trading, loan origination and secondary loan trading, and securities 
lending. The European government bond trading business was recently 
transferred to GSIB from GSI, a sister company. GSI is the group's primary 
broker-dealer entity outside of the U.S. GS has a history of providing capital 
support to GSIB, and we believe it is committed to maintaining adequate 
capital at the subsidiary for business and regulatory purposes.

GSIB reported pretax profits of $10.6 million in 2011 on revenues of $62.8 
million. While profit will to some extent follow fluctuations in market 
volume, we expect profit at year-end 2012 to better reflect the transfer of 
the government bonds business, which happened only late in 2011.

Outlook
The outlook is negative, reflecting that on GS. We expect the ratings to move 
in line with those on GS. We could also lower the ratings if we no longer 
consider GSIB to be "core" to GS. While an unlikely prospect, this could 
result from a period of sustained very weak operating performance at the 
subsidiary level, or evidence that securities and banking activity in Europe 
is no longer part of the group's global strategy.

			Coca-Cola Wants America to Be Fit!
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Coca-Cola Gives More Than $13 Million to Fund Fitness and Nutrition 
      Education Programs Across the U.S.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      They&#8217;re playing tennis in Portland, dancing in Atlanta, boot-camping in 
      Chicago and working out in fitness centers all over America. From coast 
      to coast, community organizations are amplifying their active living and 
      nutrition education programs due in part to local grants from The 
      Coca-Cola Foundation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Through grants both large and small, the philanthropic arm of The 
      Coca-Cola Company strives to build strong communities by supporting 
      individuals, families and neighborhoods to live active, healthy 
      lifestyles. These grants make a significant impact by creating 
      opportunities for nutrition education and physical activity program 
      expansion through local organizations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For example, last month the Foundation awarded $300,000 to the U.S. 
      Soccer Federation Foundation to fund its Soccer for Success program in 
      underserved communities in Seattle, Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago, 
      Detroit, New York and Miami. Earlier this summer, the Good Sports 
      organization was awarded a $200,000 grant for its Good Sports 2012 
      program &#8211; providing equipment and offsetting participation costs for 
      more than 40,000 youth in select cities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Understanding that physical activity is not limited to traditional 
      sports engagement, the Foundation awarded $15,000 and $50,000 
      respectively to the Moving in the Spirit and Center for Puppetry Arts 
      organizations based in Atlanta. The grants support art-infused 
      dance-fitness education to promote good health and wellness habits.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today, the Foundation announced a $3 million multi-year grant to the 
      Garfield Park Conservatory Alliance (GPC) in Chicago. Through this 
      grant, GPC and the Chicago Park District (CPD) will create the Park 
      Families Wellness Initiative. This program will feature affordable 
      nutrition and active lifestyle programming for communities in Chicago 
      who are most in need of wellness services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Coca-Cola Foundation is committed to building &#8211; and sustaining &#8211; 
      strong, healthy communities,&#8221; said Steve Cahillane, President and CEO, 
      Coca-Cola Refreshments. &#8220;Working in partnership with local and national 
      organizations allows the Foundation to reach and inspire more people to 
      live healthy, active lives.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Working with the National Foundation for Governor&#8217;s Fitness Councils&#174; 
      and the American College of Sports Medicine, The Coca-Cola Company 
      dedicated $5 million to place 100 new fitness centers in schools across 
      the U.S. over the next five years. The centers will feature 
      state-of-the-art fitness equipment and provide more than 5 million 
      workouts annually. This effort expands on a pilot program in California 
      with Jake &#8220;Body by Jake&#174;&#8221; Steinfeld, former Chairman of the 
      California Governor&#8217;s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports and current 
      Chairman of the National Foundation for Governors&#8217; Fitness Councils. To 
      date, three schools in Philadelphia, Washington D.C. and Boston have 
      been identified as fitness center locations. By the end of 2012, the 
      National Foundation will dedicate 15 Live Positively Fitness Centers in 
      elementary and middle schools across the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Supporting nutrition education initiatives and physical activity 
      programs helps people understand the importance of consuming a sensible, 
      balanced diet and maintaining energy balance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Through support from the Foundation, organizations like the Academy for 
      Nutrition and Dietetics are able to provide dietician-led 
      scientifically-based health and nutrition lessons in their local 
      communities. Across our Coca-Cola Digital Network, comprised of more 
      than 60 digital outlets, we have partnered with health professionals 
      such as the American Academy of Family Physicians, American College of 
      Cardiology and National Medical Society to deliver important public 
      health messages.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We remain committed to taking bold and decisive steps towards promoting 
      workable solutions to obesity,&#8221; said Cahillane. &#8220;By working 
      collaboratively with government, business and civil society, we can 
      provide people with nutrition education and support many vital programs 
      that help people lead active lives.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;* Tablet availability limited to online, select stores-CEO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Windows 8 sold 4 million upgrades in 3 days after launch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* U.S. politicians need to get to work on economy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PARIS, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's new
Surface tablet - its challenger to Apple's iPad - had a
"modest" start to sales because of limited availability,
Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer told French daily Le
Parisien.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company put the Surface tablet
centre stage at its Windows 8 launch event last month in its
fightback against Apple and Google in the exploding
mobile computing market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've had a modest start because Surface is only available
on our online retail sites and a few Microsoft stores in the
United States," Ballmer was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new device, which runs a limited version of Windows and
Office with a thin, click-on keyboard cover, is being positioned
by Microsoft as the ideal combination of PC and tablet that is
good for work as well as entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer also said 4 million upgrades to Windows 8 were sold
in the three days following the system's launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ECONOMIC CRISIS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked what he thought of the re-election of U.S. President
Barack Obama, Ballmer told the newspaper the $242.7 billion
company would work with the president and with governments
around the world on issues like data privacy, immigration of
qualified engineers and patent litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch of Windows 8 has already raised the hackles of
European Union regulators, who warned Microsoft not to repeat
the mistake of denying consumers a choice of rival Web browsers
in its new operating system, in a dispute that has already cost
the software giant more than $1.3 billion in
fines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the outlook for the U.S. economy, Ballmer
exhorted politicians to take action on the deficit, though he
stopped short of saying whether more emphasis should be placed
on spending cutbacks or tax increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not about spending more or less, it's about balancing
spending and income...The elections are over, it's time to get
back to work," Ballmer, who took over the day-to-day running of
Microsoft from its billionaire co-founder Bill Gates just over a
decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Offshore Oil and Gas Industry in Ireland - 2012 
      Report Features Companies Statoil ASA, Exxon Mobil Corporation and BP Plc
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/83cgc7/offshore_oil_and) 
      has announced the addition of the Updated report "Offshore 
      Oil and Gas Industry in Ireland" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ireland is undergoing a challenging economic situation, during which the 
      country can make use of its significant reserves of offshore oil and 
      gas. However, the Irish offshore oil and gas sector only has tremendous 
      potential, if the amount of offshore exploration is increased 
      considerably. The country's offshore oil and gas reserves could 
      contribute to the fiscal and economic challenges Ireland is going 
      through at the moment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Irish offshore oil and gas industry, however, has not been 
      attracting a lot of attention, primarily due to the delays in the start 
      up of production at the Corrib gas field, combined with the absence of 
      well developed infrastructure, combined with the harsh and difficult 
      operating conditions. Further to this, the extremely high cost of 
      operating oil and gas exploration offshore Ireland means that there are 
      few investors willing to take on the cost.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In this industry scenario, Taiyou Research analyzes the Offshore Oil and 
      Gas Industry in Ireland. The report covers the following:

      - A profile of the oil and gas industry in Europe, which helps to place 
      the growth of the Irish oil and gas industry in respective of other 
      countries in Europe. The section contains an industry definition, market 
      profile, market value and volume analysis and industry segmentation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - An analysis of the offshore oil and gas industry in Ireland, in which 
      the author analyzes the offshore oil and gas production, offshore oil 
      and gas cumulative production, offshore remaining production of oil and 
      gas, the oil and gas production wells in Ireland, offshore drilling of 
      wells, and offshore oil and gas expenditure in Ireland.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc agreed to pay $67.5 million to settle a class-action lawsuit by former Wyeth Inc shareholders who said they were misled about risks associated with the antidepressant Pristiq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The all-cash settlement was disclosed on Friday, one month after Pfizer agreed to pay $164 million to settle a separate lawsuit accusing it of misleading investors about clinical trial results for the arthritis drug Celebrex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wyeth shares lost more than $7.6 billion of market value on July 24, 2007, after the company said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would not approve Pristiq to treat "hot flashes" in post-menopausal women until it learned more about potential heart and liver problems associated with the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholders led by the Pipefitters Union Local 537 Pension Fund in Boston said Wyeth's failure to reveal adverse effects sooner caused its stock price to be inflated during the June 26, 2006, to July 24, 2007, class period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer bought Wyeth in 2009. Several former Wyeth officials, including onetime Chief Executive Robert Essner, are also defendants in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopher Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said the defendants denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laurie Largent and David Rosenfeld, lawyers for the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond to requests for a comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pristiq generated $461 million of sales from January to September for Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts once hoped annual sales would top $2 billion for the drug, whose chemical name is desvenlafaxine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement followed nearly six months of mediation. It requires approval by U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan in Manhattan, who certified the class action in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the plaintiffs plan to seek attorneys' fees of roughly $16.5 million, plus as much as $650,000 for expenses, court papers show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's shares closed Friday at $24.17 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case, which has a Michigan retirement system as the named plaintiff, is City of Livonia Employees' Retirement System v. Wyeth et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 07-10329.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Jonathan Stempel and Nate Raymond in New York; Editing by Maureen Bavdek)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Wyeth said to have misled about antidepressant's risks
    * Wyeth's market value lost more than $7.6 bln
    * Pfizer bought Wyeth in 2009; does not admit wrongdoing

    By Jonathan Stempel and Nate Raymond
    NEW YORK, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc agreed to
pay $67.5 million to settle a class-action lawsuit by former
Wyeth Inc shareholders who said they were misled about risks
associated with the antidepressant Pristiq.
    The all-cash settlement was disclosed on Friday, one month
after Pfizer agreed to pay $164 million to settle a separate
lawsuit accusing it of misleading investors about clinical trial
results for the arthritis drug Celebrex. 
    Wyeth shares lost more than $7.6 billion of market value on
July 24, 2007, after the company said the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration would not approve Pristiq to treat "hot flashes"
in post-menopausal women until it learned more about potential
heart and liver problems associated with the drug.
    Shareholders led by the Pipefitters Union Local 537 Pension
Fund in Boston said Wyeth's failure to reveal adverse effects
sooner caused its stock price to be inflated during the June 26,
2006, to July 24, 2007, class period.
    Pfizer bought Wyeth in 2009. Several former Wyeth officials,
including onetime Chief Executive Robert Essner, are also
defendants in the case.
    Christopher Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said the defendants
denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle.
    Laurie Largent and David Rosenfeld, lawyers for the
plaintiffs, did not immediately respond to requests for a
comment.
    Pristiq generated $461 million of sales from January to
September for Pfizer.
    Analysts once hoped annual sales would top $2 billion for
the drug, whose chemical name is desvenlafaxine.
    The settlement followed nearly six months of mediation. It
requires approval by U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan in
Manhattan, who certified the class action in September.
    Lawyers for the plaintiffs plan to seek attorneys' fees of
roughly $16.5 million, plus as much as $650,000 for expenses,
court papers show.
    Pfizer's shares closed Friday at $24.17 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
    The case, which has a Michigan retirement system as the
named plaintiff, is City of Livonia Employees' Retirement System
v. Wyeth et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York, No. 07-10329.

      &#8222;Wir haben Coca-Cola Journey bewusst als scharfen Kontrast 
      dazu konzipiert, wie Unternehmenswebsites normalerweise genutzt werden&#8220;, 
      erkl&#228;rt Ashley Brown, Leiter der Abteilung f&#252;r digitale Kommunikation 
      und soziale Medien. &#8222;Unsere Unternehmenswebsite ist die Onlinepr&#228;senz

      mehr bringt.&#8220;

      Anleger, SEC-Einreichungen, Konzernberichte, Lebensl&#228;ufe von 
      F&#252;hrungskr&#228;ften und Stellenanzeigen zu lesen sind, sollen Layout, 
      Gestaltung und redaktionelle Vorgehensweise nun mehr an eine digitale 
      Zeitschrift als an eine Firmenwebsite erinnern.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8222;Wichtiger als die neuesten Design-Trends war in unseren &#220;berlegungen, 
      ein gro&#223;artiges Benutzererlebnis zu schaffen&#8220;, so Brown. &#8222;Wir wollen 
      sicherstellen, dass wir bei der Umwandlung unserer Marke in ein

upcoming expiration of tax cuts and recent effects of Hurricane Sandy
still affecting major areas. When it comes to discovering the right edge
at the right time, all these factors play into effect. For a deeper

      is building on the newly released capabilities in the SharePoint 2013 
      platform to create the first social collaboration solution on Windows&#174; 8 
      and on the iPad for typical business users. harmon.ie 
      Connect now supports Microsoft&#174; Office 2013 and SharePoint 2013, so 
      business users can now access SharePoint from Windows 8 devices through 
      Microsoft&#174; Outlook, from iOS devices and from Outlook 2013 Web apps. 
      harmon.ie&#8217;s suite of connected apps affords business users, for the 
      first time, a consistent and convenient collaboration experience from 
      any workstation, mobile device or kiosk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      harmon.ie will be demonstrating its solutions at the SharePoint 
      Conference in Las Vegas, November 12 &#8211; 15, Booth #1029. harmon.ie

      Microsoft has invested heavily in the user experience and adoption 
      elements of SharePoint 2013. New features include the ability to follow 
      a document, get offline document support through SkyDrivePro, provide ad 
      hoc document sharing, and enhanced social features like microblogging 
      and communities. harmon.ie leverages these new platform capabilities to 
      create business solutions and bring the new capabilities to the places 
      where people spend their work time, Outlook and mobile devices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are pleased to be able to provide business solutions on top of the 
      new platform capabilities that Microsoft continues to bring to market,&#8221; 
      said David Lavenda, vice president of product strategy and marketing. 
      &#8220;Companies need the business flexibility that harmon.ie offers in order 
      to take advantage of the SharePoint social capabilities. Making 
      SharePoint easily accessible to typical business users through Outlook, 
      the iPad and Office Web apps turns SharePoint into practical business 
      solutions for managing knowledge, projects and records.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As workers rely on multiple platforms to get their work done, it is 
      imperative for organizations to provide business flexibility,&#8221; said 
      Yaacov Cohen, co-founder and CEO of harmon.ie. &#8220;Companies must be 
      accommodating and able to provide the most appropriate solutions. And 
      the ability to make these technologies available to users without them 
      having to learn something new makes all the difference.&#8221;

			Coca-Cola Invites the World to Join in Its New Journey
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Company Leads Next-Generation Corporate Storytelling, Replacing 
      Corporate Website with Coca-Cola Journey&#8482;, an Interactive Digital 
      Magazine
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today, The Coca-Cola Company replaces its corporate website with Coca-Cola 
      Journey, 
      a rich, socially enabled digital platform. Coca-Cola Journey 
      represents a significant leap forward in how Coke will use digital 
      communications to drive business results and share the Coca-Cola system 
      story with the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Coca-Cola Journey is a dynamic, digital magazine that 
      focuses on universally important topics, social causes and Company news. 
      It will feature original and curated content, and is designed to spark 
      dialogue and tell the story of Coca-Cola in a creative, refreshing way.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Today, Coca-Cola is taking its digital communications to a new level,&#8221; 
      said Clyde Tuggle, Senior Vice President and Chief Public Affairs and 
      Communications Officer, The Coca-Cola Company. &#8220;Coca-Cola Journey 
      is the most ambitious digital project Coca-Cola has ever undertaken, and 
      we are doubling-down on our commitment to be a quality publisher of 
      compelling content. We hope Coca-Cola Journey will be a 
      place where people will share their curiosity about the world, engage in 
      stimulating debate, and find out what is at the core of Coke &#8211; our 
      quality brands, our business, our people, and our ever-expanding 
      commitment to social good.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Readers can browse regularly refreshed content by type (Stories, 
      Opinions, Brands, Videos and Blogs) or topic (Brands, Business, 
      Community, Entertainment, Environment, Health, History, Innovation and 
      Sports). In addition to in-depth feature stories brought to life with 
      high-res photography, video and audio, Coca-Cola Journey 
      also includes eye-catching infographics and a &#8220;Debate Board,&#8221; which 
      polls readers on a range of Coke-related topics.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The launch issue of Coca-Cola Journey features a cover 
      story on Coca-Cola&#8217;s commitment to supporting schools in India, Chairman 
      and CEO Muhtar Kent&#8217;s &#8216;Five Keys to Innovation&#8217;, an interview with 
      NASCAR driver Danica Patrick and more than 70 other additional original 
      pieces of content.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We designed Coca-Cola Journey to be a sharp departure 
      from how companies use their corporate websites,&#8221; explains Ashley Brown, 
      Director of Digital Communications and Social Media. &#8220;Our corporate site 
      is our most trafficked online property, so we wanted to create an 
      experience that would make this incredibly valuable digital real estate 
      work harder for us.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While Coca-Cola Journey will continue to house corporate 
      content such as press releases, investor information, SEC filings, 
      Company reports, executive bios and job postings, its layout, design and 
      editorial focus now more closely resemble a digital magazine than a 
      company website.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;More than anything, we prioritized what creates a great user experience 
      over the latest design trends,&#8221; said Brown. &#8220;We want to make sure that 
      as our brand becomes a publisher, we do so in the most beautiful and 
      functional way possible.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Coca-Cola Journey
			is the latest product to showcase 
      continued investment by Coca-Cola in digital communications and social 
      media. In September, the Company launched Coca-Cola 
      Unbottled, the Company&#8217;s first corporate communications 
      blog and real-time digital communications vehicle.

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong (Reuters) - The head of Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) Southeast Asian operations is set to step down and move to a new position as an advisory director for the bank at the end of the year, according to company memo obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman has not yet named a new Southeast Asia chairman to succeed L. Brooks Entwistle, 45, who is known for his work in establishing Goldman Sachs' Indian business, a process he began when he moved to Mumbai in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entwistle remained in Mumbai as India country head until early 2011 when he moved to Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Southeast Asia has become increasingly important for investment banks as deal volume in the region booms while activity for other regions wanes. Goldman Sachs relocated high-profile capital markets banker Steven Barg to Singapore in July to become co-head of investment banking Southeast Asia, alongside Hsin Yue Yong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the bank confirmed the contents of the memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lawrence White; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Latest Asia-Pacific LNG project to report cost overruns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Forex, work stoppages fuel $3.3 bln jump in project cost&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Shares fall in Australian partners Santos and Oil Search&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* PNG LNG is nation's biggest-ever resources development&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* First LNG shipments still expected in 2014&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil said it faces
a $3.3 billion spike in costs at its LNG project in Papua New
Guinea, the latest Asia-Pacific project to be hit by cost
overruns as competition is set to grow from new gas supplies
coming on tap in North America and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more than 20 percent jump in costs to $19 billion was
blamed on unfavourable foreign exchange rates and delays caused
by disgruntled workers and landowners, and comes after costs to
develop liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in neighbouring
Australia to supply the Asian market have also shot up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon told its partners in a letter published on Monday the
project remained on schedule for start-up and delivery of gas in
2014 and forecast production capacity had been increased by 5
percent to 6.9 million tonnes per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PNG LNG project is the impoverished nation's
biggest-ever resources development and could lift GDP by 20
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Papua New Guinea has struggled to attract foreign investment
to exploit its abundant natural resources due to corruption and
unclear regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in the two Australian partners in the project, Oil
Search and Santos, tumbled 5.2 percent and 2.4
percent, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"International groups partnering with Australian companies
into these projects are starting to feel the high cost
environment," Peter Esho, chief Market analyst at City Index
Group Sydney, said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LNG plants are notorious for running overbudget and missing
schedules. In Australia, three out of seven projects under
construction have announced hikes of an average of over 20
percent, while a fourth is conducting a cost and schedule
review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developments in Australia have primarily faced cost jumps
due to increased labour costs, a high Australian dollar, and
stiff competition for resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong demand from Japan and other Asian countries has
helped lift the prospects of LNG projects in Asia-Pacific, but
competition is also heating up with new supplies set to emerge
from North America and East Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil Search said the increase in the final estimated costs at
PNG LNG was "considerably beyond the upper end" of its
expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oil Search intends to fully review the revised estimates
and is committed to working with the operator to seek to
mitigate these estimated cost increases," Oil Search Managing
Director Peter Botten said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm said it expected the increase would be funded in
line with the project's existing finance terms of 70 percent by
debt and 30 percent by equity contributions from the projects
partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FX BIGGEST PART OF COST RISE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santos said it had ample liquidity to fund its
higher share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With over $6 billion in cash and undrawn debt facilities,
Santos is in a strong position to fund all of its capital
programs," Santos Chief Financial Officer Andrew Seaton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even including the higher costs, PNG LNG remains a highly
robust economic project."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil Search said that foreign exchange was the single biggest
cause of the cost increase at $1.4 billion at PNG LNG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Papua New Guinea kina has risen 20 percent against the
U.S. dollar in the last 19 months, while the Australian dollar
has held above parity to the U.S. currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Australian partners said they were assessing the impact
of currency exchange movements on their overall costs, though
much would depend on the eventual U.S. dollar gas sales
contracts closer to the project's completion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Santos is well positioned to manage the impact of a strong
Australian dollar on project capital costs," a Santos spokesman 
said, adding that its Australian dollar denominated balance
sheet, cash balances and revenues provided an effective natural
hedge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delays from work stoppages and land access issues had also
pushed up construction and drilling costs, adding $1.2 billion
to the total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Landowner protests against the project this year prompted
the government to deploy troops to "restore law and order",
according to local media reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the impact of above average rainfall for most of the
last two years, was estimated to have added $700 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite the cost increase, project economics are helped by
the 5 percent increase in plant capacity and approximately 30
percent increase in commodity pricing since project funding in
2009," Decie Autin, PNG LNG Project Executive, said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil five years ago shelved a troubled
PNG-to-Australia gas pipeline project after cost overruns pushed
the cost of development to more than $3.5 billion. Exxon and its
partners at the time said they would focus on more profitable
gas projects in the country, including PNG LNG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The energy major said last month it would make a decision on
developing the Scarborough gas field, considered one of the
toughest projects in Western Australia, around the second half
of 2013. Exxon has said it will weigh the development of
Scarborough and any other new LNG project against potential
exports of cheaper North American LNG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Nov 12 (Reuters) - The head of Goldman Sachs
Group Inc's Southeast Asian operations is set to step
down and move to a new position as an advisory director for the
bank at the end of the year, according to company memo obtained
by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman has not yet named a new Southeast Asia chairman to
succeed L. Brooks Entwistle, 45, who is known for his work in
establishing Goldman Sachs' Indian business, a process he began
when he moved to Mumbai in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entwistle remained in Mumbai as India country head until
early 2011 when he moved to Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Southeast Asia has become increasingly important for
investment banks as deal volume in the region booms while
activity for other regions wanes. Goldman Sachs relocated
high-profile capital markets banker Steven Barg to Singapore in
July to become co-head of investment banking Southeast Asia,
alongside Hsin Yue Yong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the bank confirmed the contents of the memo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - The Obama administration should model itself after the Roosevelt administration during the Great Depression and World War Two, Goldman Sachs (GS.N) Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein said in an opinion piece published Tuesday evening on the Wall Street Journal website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1930s there was "extreme bitterness between the business community and the Roosevelt administration," Blankfein wrote. Corporate executives deplored President Franklin Roosevelt's policies. Roosevelt, in turn, said he welcomed their hatred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, the two sides eventually worked together, spurring a colossal increase in industrial production that lifted the U.S. out of the Great Depression and crushed its enemies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein sees a similar opportunity now, and wants the Obama administration and the corporate community to compromise and reconcile so as not to derail the fragile recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is more than a trillion dollars of cash that is sitting on the balance sheets of U.S. nonfinancial companies," Blankfein wrote. "With certainty about tax rates, companies will increase their capital expenditures (currently at anemic levels), contributing to a virtuous cycle of jobs and growth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Broadening the personal income-tax base by closing loopholes will generate substantial additional revenue while minimizing increases in marginal rates that could stifle risk-taking and robust growth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein also stressed the importance of restoring confidence in public finance by implementing spending cuts, entitlement reform and revenue increases. He also wrote that tax increases, especially for the wealthiest, are appropriate so long as they are accompanied by serious cuts in government spending and entitlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also pointed out that developing domestic energy resources enables the country's businesses to take advantage of lower energy costs, making them more competitive in the global economy. Effective trade and immigration policies are also a high priority, Blankfein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are all ready to roll up our sleeves and work with the Obama administration and Congress to help fulfill America's enduring promise," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michelle Conlin; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of Microsoft Corp MSOFT.O slid on Tuesday after the surprise departure of a key executive, who analysts said marks the loss of the driving force behind the company's biggest product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares were down 2.8 percent in afternoon at $27.21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft on Monday night announced the departure of Steve Sinofsky, a 23-year veteran of the company and head of its flagship Windows unit, just two weeks after launching the Windows 8 operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts fear that Chief Executive Steve Ballmer is driving out talent just as the company needs it most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sinofsky may have ruled the kingdom with an iron fist, but he performed amazingly well in rescuing Windows following Vista," Wells Fargo analysts said in a research note on Tuesday, referring to Microsoft's previous operating system. "While we think Windows 8 and Surface have promise, there is still a ton of work ahead to catch iOS and Android."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple AAPL.o and Google (GOOG.O) are seen as holding the lead for systems for mobile computing, a huge growth driver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer has replaced the heads of Microsoft's five main operating units in the past four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Financial, said that while he generally has applauded bringing in new blood, "in this case I don't applaud it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a negative. If I was the CEO, I would have kept him," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer may have been unhappy with Sinofsky's ability to work with other business units, or the pace of progress under him, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinofsky's abrasive management style may also have contributed to his departure, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft on Monday named two executives who are relatively unknown outside of technology circles to assume Sinofsky's responsibilities, something that analysts said could also be dragging on the stock. Julie Larson-Green will head the Windows hardware and software division, while Tami Reller will remain chief financial officer of the Windows unit and assume responsibility for the business of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement issued Monday night, Ballmer said it was "imperative that we continue to drive alignment across all Microsoft teams, and have more integrated and rapid development cycles for our offerings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Sarah McBride; Editing by Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Microsoft leads Nasdaq lower after executive exit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Dow off 0.5 pct, S 500 down 0.4 pct, Nasdaq off 0.7 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Rodrigo Campos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Nov 13 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks sold off late in
the session on Tuesday led by a slide in Microsoft shares,
though retailers were a notable bright spot after Home Depot
raised its outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp was the most actively traded on
Nasdaq, weighing on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite after the
surprising departure of a key executive. The stock fell 3.2
percent to $27.09.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Home Depot shares hit levels not seen since April
2000 and the company's raised outlook suggested a revival in the
long-dormant U.S. housing market. The S retail sector index
 advanced 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Home Depot did say something about housing, which was
perceived as positive and was behind the earlier rally," said
Richard Sichel, chief investment officer at Philadelphia Trust
Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That was tempered by Microsoft, to some extent, and
probably more so by the 'fiscal cliff,'" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S 500 is down 2.7 percent so far this month and closed
below its 200-day moving average for a fourth day in a row, a
technical indicator that suggests the recent declines could gain
momentum. The moving average is currently at 1,381.58, and
failure to rise above that level suggests market weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns about the looming "fiscal cliff" kept investor
activity subdued as lawmakers returned to Washington after the
Nov. 6 election, when President Barack Obama won a second term
while Democrats added to their margin in the U.S. Senate and
picked up seats in the House of Representatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market is grappling with how a divided U.S. Congress
will deal with the series of mandated tax hikes and spending
cuts that start to take effect next year and could take the
world's largest economy back into recession. However, serious
negotiations are still weeks away, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average fell 58.90 points,
or 0.46 percent, to 12,756.18 at the close. The S 500 
dropped 5.50 points, or 0.40 percent, to 1,374.53. The Nasdaq
Composite lost 20.37 points, or 0.70 percent, to
2,883.89.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dow component Home Depot Inc raised its full-year
outlook even before accounting for any future lift in sales in
the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, as the retailer benefited
from a recent uptick in the U.S. housing market. Home Depot's
stock rose 3.6 percent to $63.38, its highest close in more than
12 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJX Cos, which owns the Marshalls and T.J. Maxx
retail chains, reported results that beat analysts' forecasts
and its shares added 2.7 percent to $42.06.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares fell after Steve Sinofsky, head of the
Windows unit, left the company. Sinofsky was considered the
driving force behind Windows, the company's biggest product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology shares led the market's decline, with an S
technology index down 0.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AK Steel Holding shares fell 17.6 percent to $4.50
after the company forecast a fourth-quarter loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 6.2 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock
Exchange, the Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, below the daily average
during November last year of 7.33 billion shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than two issues fell for every one that rose on both
the NYSE and the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY Nov 14 (Reuters) - The cost of Chevron's 
Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG)project is forecast to balloon
out more than A$20 billion dollars to more than A$60 billion,
the Australian Financial Review said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project will soar in cost because of the high value of
the Australian dollar, union demands, high manufacturing costs
locally and productivity issues, the report said, citing sources
with knowledge of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gorgon LNG, the company's flagship development, is currently
undergoing a cost and schedule review as costs at other
Australian LNG developments have been growing rapidly due to a
strong Australian dollar and the rising local price of doing
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking on Monday at an industry conference in Perth,
Chevron Australia's general manager of operations, Brian Smith,
said the project is now 50 percent complete, and is still on
track to go on line in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chevron executive said the project is expected to cost
$37 billion but hinted that the current estimate may change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The cost is still the same number at this point of time. It
may well be in the future that we may mention some other number
... the exchange rate has gone up, it's higher than when project
was approved," Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Decision on replacement for Exxon expected by mid-2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Shahristani urges OPEC members to observe production
quotas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Comfortable with oil prices around $100 per barrel

 (Adds quotes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Simon Falush&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil is in the
advanced stages of talks with potential buyers to take on Iraq's
West Qurna 1 oilfield and there are enough appropriate
candidates, the country's deputy prime minister for energy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A decision will have to be made shortly. To transfer the
assets will take some time, but it will be sooner (than the
middle of next year)," Hussain al-Shahristani told Reuters on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are sufficient number of interested buyers with the
financial resources and the technical know-how to buy their
interest," Shahristani earlier told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil, which has signed oil deals in Iraq's
autonomous Kurdistan region that are seen as more lucrative but
dismissed by the central government as illegal, has informed the
Iraqi government it wants to pull out of the $50 billion West
Qurna 1 project in southern Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty over who can replace the U.S. oil major in the
important project have raised questions about Iraq's target to
increase crude output to 5-6 million barrels per day by 2015
from 3.4 million bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shahristani told reporters on the sidelines of the Oil and
Money conference in London that Exxon would soon hand over the
field to a company that had the capabilities to exploit it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He declined to say how many companies there were involved in
the process or to identify their country of origin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon Mobil has already specified deadlines to submit the
bids and as soon as they receive their bids, there is more than
one interested qualified buyer," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As soon as (Exxon) make a request to us to allow them to
sell the interest to that buyer, then it will be known how long
it will take them to finalise the arrangements. We have already
agreed with Exxon on the timetables to finalise the
arrangement," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some industry sources have said Baghdad is keen to replace
Exxon with companies from Russia or China. But it was unclear
which companies would have the financial heft to follow Exxon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia's second largest crude producer Lukoil said
on Friday it would study an offer from Exxon to take over West
Qurna-1, Interfax news agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lukoil, which is already developing West Qurna-2, has
previously said West Qurna-1 is "too big for it to swallow", but
on Friday it said it would at least look into the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPEC OUTPUT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning to OPEC policy matters, Shahristani said some
members of the Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries
should cut their current levels of production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The total quota for OPEC is 30 million barrels per day,
OPEC is producing 31 million bpd, so there are some members
overproducing their quotas. We are calling, and some other
members are calling, for the quotas to be observed," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no need for overproduction, the market is
well-supplied, prices are stable, there is no great demand, so
there is no need to over-produce," Shahristani added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he was comfortable with oil prices around present
levels. Benchmark Brent crude was trading on Tuesday
near $108 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The current price around $100 per barrel is one which will
encourage investors to keep on developing marginal fields and
it's a price that will not impact economic development in the
rest of the world."

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of Microsoft Corp MSOFT.O slid on Tuesday after the surprise departure of a key executive, who analysts said marks the loss of the driving force behind the company's biggest product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares were down 2.8 percent in afternoon at $27.21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft on Monday night announced the departure of Steve Sinofsky, a 23-year veteran of the company and head of its flagship Windows unit, just two weeks after launching the Windows 8 operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts fear that Chief Executive Steve Ballmer is driving out talent just as the company needs it most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sinofsky may have ruled the kingdom with an iron fist, but he performed amazingly well in rescuing Windows following Vista," Wells Fargo analysts said in a research note on Tuesday, referring to Microsoft's previous operating system. "While we think Windows 8 and Surface have promise, there is still a ton of work ahead to catch iOS and Android."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple AAPL.o and Google (GOOG.O) are seen as holding the lead for systems for mobile computing, a huge growth driver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer has replaced the heads of Microsoft's five main operating units in the past four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Financial, said that while he generally has applauded bringing in new blood, "in this case I don't applaud it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a negative. If I was the CEO, I would have kept him," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer may have been unhappy with Sinofsky's ability to work with other business units, or the pace of progress under him, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinofsky's abrasive management style may also have contributed to his departure, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft on Monday named two executives who are relatively unknown outside of technology circles to assume Sinofsky's responsibilities, something that analysts said could also be dragging on the stock. Julie Larson-Green will head the Windows hardware and software division, while Tami Reller will remain chief financial officer of the Windows unit and assume responsibility for the business of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement issued Monday night, Ballmer said it was "imperative that we continue to drive alignment across all Microsoft teams, and have more integrated and rapid development cycles for our offerings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Sarah McBride; Editing by Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

			Coca-Cola and World Wildlife Fund Partner for Second Year of Arctic 
      Home Campaign
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			As Progress Gains Momentum in the Arctic, Coca-Cola and WWF Invite 
      Fans to Donate This Holiday Season
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Building on more than $2 million donated to World Wildlife Fund (WWF) by 
      Coca-Cola and fans in its first year, Coca-Cola and WWF are teaming up 
      again in the U.S. for Arctic Home, a joint effort to help protect the 
      polar bear and conserve its Arctic habitat.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since launching the campaign in October 2011, WWF has invested 
      Coca-Cola&#8217;s Arctic Home donations in an ongoing project to engage local 
      communities to help conserve and sustainably manage the high Arctic. 
      Over the past year WWF has used donations to contribute to surveys of 
      polar bears, assess population sizes and trends, and better understand 
      important elements of the sea-ice ecosystems. Additionally, the money is 
      being used to refine modeling processes to help predict future ice 
      conditions, organize workshops with local communities and governments, 
      and generate more support and awareness for conservation. Due to the 
      success and inspiration generated last year, Coca-Cola will introduce 
      Arctic Home in additional markets over the coming months.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We understand creating a safe habitat for the beloved polar bear will 
      take time, but Coca-Cola is committed to helping WWF, our longstanding 
      partner, achieve this shared vision,&#8221; said Stuart Kronauge, senior vice 
      president, Coca-Cola Trademark Marketing, Coca-Cola North America. &#8220;An 
      icon for decades, the polar bear is near and dear to our hearts at 
      Coca-Cola, so we&#8217;re encouraging people to join us again in the U.S. this 
      holiday season to help further WWF&#8217;s progress in the Arctic.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      People can show their support by visiting ArcticHome.com to donate or 
      texting &#8220;BEAR&#8221; to 357357. For a second year, Coca-Cola will match all 
      donations made by February 15, 2013, up to $1 million. And this year 
      it&#8217;s even easier to participate. There is a simplified text-to-donate 
      platform, new ways to engage through popular social media channels, and 
      updated information and stunning photography at ArcticHome.com.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This year we saw Arctic sea ice recede to its lowest recorded level,&#8221; 
      said Geoff York, World Wildlife Fund&#8217;s global lead on polar bears.&#160;&#8220;As 
      sea ice continues to diminish, polar bear populations face increasing 
      risks. Thanks to the generous donations of supporters, WWF has developed 
      new tools, gained new information and cultivated new partnerships that 
      will help define a more secure future for these bears we all cherish. We 
      are excited about the second year of Arctic Home, giving people a fresh 
      opportunity to be a part of the solution.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Arctic Home will help advance WWF&#8217;s vision for an Arctic with stable 
      ecosystems, viable populations of wildlife and a sustainable use of 
      natural resources. This includes working with local residents to manage 
      an area where the summer sea ice will likely persist the longest. This 
      area&#8212;potentially covering 500,000 square miles&#8212;could provide a home for 
      the polar bear while protecting the cultural and economic needs of local 
      people.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola is supporting Arctic Home with a 360 degree campaign in the 
      U.S., including in-store activation, retail partners, digital media, TV, 
      radio, point-of-sale and out-of-home advertising. The iconic mother bear 
      and her two cubs will be featured on two new special-edition 12-ounce 
      cans, as well as a variety of Coca-Cola PET bottles from 12.5-ounce to 
      2-liter. The Arctic Home call-to-donate will be highlighted on a range 
      of products, including Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Sprite and Fanta. Coca-Cola 
      is also donating $150,000 worth of Arctic Home themed toys to the Marine 
      Toys for Tots Foundation this holiday season.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Arctic Home builds on the 5-year commitment between The Coca-Cola 
      Company and WWF to help conserve the polar bear&#8217;s habitat, as well as 
      the broader global partnership between the two organizations to conserve 
      freshwater resources, drive sustainable efficiencies and inspire people 
      to act.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Former Walt Disney Co Chief Executive Michael Eisner has struck a distribution deal with Universal Pictures, a likely prelude to the media mogul raising money to fund film development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terms of the multi-year deal call for Universal, owned by cable giant Comcast Corp, to market and distribute movies developed and financed by Eisner under the auspices of his privately owned media holding company Tornante Co, Eisner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a phone interview with Reuters from Los Angeles, Eisner was cagey about precisely how he planned to finance the movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rumors began circulating first in Variety in January and then on CNBC in May about Eisner trying to raise an $800 million film fund, broken out into $400 million of equity and $400 million of debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eisner declined to give specific details on any fundraising efforts that may be taking place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eisner said he will be investing his own money into development and plans to bring partners into the venture. He said JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Morgan Stanley, Blackstone Group LP and Moelis &amp; Co were working with him on behalf of the venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously, I wouldn't be making a distribution deal if I wasn't confident that the films would be financed," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite having spent more than two decades at the helm of Disney, Eisner said he did not have any discussions with the company regarding this deal and described Universal as a "natural fit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I made about 400 movies with Disney and I figured that was enough," joked Eisner. "I thought I'd try my hand working for another organization."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eisner is no stranger to Universal's parent company, Comcast. Steve Burke, CEO of Comcast-owned NBC Universal, ran Disney's theme parks under Eisner. And Burke was one of the main champions behind Comcast's failed $49 billion hostile takeover bid for Disney in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Michael Eisner has been a powerful creative force behind some of the world's greatest films and we're confident that with Tornante, he'll continue that tradition," Universal Pictures Chairman Adam Fogelson and Co-Chairman Donna Langley said in a joint statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eisner, 70, said he hopes to have the first film under the deal in theaters by the end of next year or early in 2014. He declined to comment on the number of movies expected to be released annually, saying only that the plan was to develop "a significant number of films over the whole period" of the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of production budgets, Eisner said they will vary depending on the movie but that the venture was unlikely to make any "incredibly expensive, bet-the-house" investments on any one film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without being precise, he said he would aim for budgets in line with his track record while at Disney and, before that, Paramount Pictures, which he said consistently averaged about 20 percent below the industry norm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I never did a $200 million or $250 million movie, that's not my kind of thing," Eisner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After leaving Disney in 2005, Eisner launched Tornante Co, which has produced shows for the Internet and television but has until now shied away from motion picture production. Through Tornante, Eisner founded digital production studio Vuguru and owns sports trading card company Topps in partnership with private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the projects produced by Vuguru are the animated series "Glenn Martin DDS" on Nickelodeon, "The Booth at the End" on Hulu, and "Little Women, BIG CARS" on AOL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the aim of the Universal deal is to produce new original content, Eisner said movies could grow out of existing Tornante projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still undecided is whether Tornante will control the new venture or if it will operate under another name and simply be housed under the Tornante umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latter structure could mean that Eisner would be eligible to collect producer fees from Tornante for films he develops - in essence, getting paid by his own company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eisner declined to comment on the potential of collecting producer fees, saying only that the venture's financial structure is still being worked out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My goal is to have a good time and make films. Hopefully, it will be a success and out of that success will be some financial rewards," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Peter Lauria; editing by Andrew Hay)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Strikes multi-year distribution deal; first movie expected
by end of 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Deal likely a prelude to Eisner raising money for film
development&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Eisner working with JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Blackstone,
Moelis on venture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Peter Lauria&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nov 13 (Reuters) - Former Walt Disney Co Chief
Executive Michael Eisner has struck a distribution deal with
Universal Pictures, a likely prelude to the media mogul raising
money to fund film development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terms of the multi-year deal call for Universal, owned by
cable giant Comcast Corp, to market and distribute
movies developed and financed by Eisner under the auspices of
his privately-owned media holding company Tornante Co, Eisner
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a phone interview with Reuters from Los Angeles, Eisner
was cagey about precisely how he planned to finance the movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rumors began circulating first in Variety in January and
then on CNBC in May about Eisner trying to raise an $800 million
film fund, broken out into $400 million of equity and $400
million of debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eisner declined to give specific details on any fundraising
efforts that may be taking place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eisner said he will be investing his own money into
development and plans to bring partners into the venture. He
said JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Morgan Stanley,
Blackstone Group LP and Moelis &amp; Co were working with him
on behalf of the venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously, I wouldn't be making a distribution deal if I
wasn't confident that the films would be financed," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite having spent more than two decades at the helm of
Disney, Eisner said he did not have any discussions with the
company regarding this deal and described Universal as a
"natural fit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I made about 400 movies with Disney and I figured that was
enough," joked Eisner. "I thought I'd try my hand working for
another organization."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eisner is no stranger to Universal's parent company,
Comcast. Steve Burke, CEO of Comcast-owned NBC Universal, ran
Disney's theme parks under Eisner. And Burke was one of the main
champions behind Comcast's failed $49 billion hostile takeover
bid for Disney in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Michael Eisner has been a powerful creative force behind
some of the world's greatest films and we're confident that with
Tornante, he'll continue that tradition," Universal Pictures
Chairman Adam Fogelson and Co-Chairman Donna Langley said in a
joint statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eisner, 70, said he hopes to have the first film under the
deal in theaters by the end of next year or early in 2014. He
declined to comment on the number of movies expected to be
released annually, saying only that the plan was to develop "a
significant number of films over the whole period" of the
agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of production budgets, Eisner said they will vary
depending on the movie but that the venture was unlikely to make
any "incredibly expensive, bet-the-house" investments on any one
film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without being precise, he said he would aim for budgets in
line with his track record while at Disney and, before that,
Paramount Pictures, which he said consistently averaged about 20
percent below the industry norm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I never did a $200 million or $250 million movie, that's
not my kind of thing," Eisner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After leaving Disney in 2005, Eisner launched Tornante Co,
which has produced shows for the Internet and television but has
until now shied away from motion picture production. Through
Tornante, Eisner founded digital production studio Vuguru and
owns sports trading card company Topps in partnership with
private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the projects produced by Vuguru are the animated
series "Glenn Martin DDS" on Nickelodeon, "The Booth at the End"
on Hulu, and "Little Women, BIG CARS" on AOL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the aim of the Universal deal is to produce new
original content, Eisner said movies could grow out of existing
Tornante projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still undecided is whether Tornante will control the new
venture or if it will operate under another name and simply be
housed under the Tornante umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latter structure could mean that Eisner would be
eligible to collect producer fees from Tornante for films he
develops - in essence, getting paid by his own company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eisner declined to comment on the potential of collecting
producer fees, saying only that the venture's financial
structure is still being worked out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My goal is to have a good time and make films. Hopefully,
it will be a success and out of that success will be some
financial rewards," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      Are you struggling to bring organization to your SharePoint data? Wish 
      you could access the information in your paper files directly in 
      SharePoint?
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Digitech Systems announces easy data upload for paper records and 
      electronic files directly to SharePoint 2013 and Office 365 from 
      PaperVision&#174; SharePoint Tools, PaperVision Capture, PaperVision&#174; Capture 
      Desktop, and PaperVision&#174; Capture SP for SharePoint. Office 365 offers 
      the ability to create and collaborate with Word, Excel and PowerPoint 
      files using cloud technology. Digitech Systems&#8217; new integration makes it 
      easier to share, organize and manage both electronic files and paper 
      records in Office 365.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The integration with Office 365 simplifies the creation of columns for 
      content types and SharePoint libraries, better organizing file storage 
      and making information easier to locate. SharePoint Tools and 
      PaperVision Capture make sharing easier, organization simpler, and file 
      management more efficient for Office 365 users.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Available as a FREE download from Digitech Systems, PaperVision 
      SharePoint Tools allows businesses to send files from Windows Explorer 
      and to print documents from any Windows application into SharePoint, 
      including SharePoint Online and SharePoint 2013. SharePoint Tools 
      streamlines business processes to fully integrate SharePoint into the 
      daily work environment of your employees. Access the free download at: http://www.digitechsystems.com/product/sharepointtools.htm.

      &#8220;The integration of Digitech Systems products with Office 365 makes the 
      opportunity for total document management a reality for SharePoint 
      Online users,&#8221; said Raimund Wasner, Managing Director of Kollabria, an 
      analyst firm specializing in the SharePoint marketplace. &#8220;SharePoint 
      users can better organize their file storage and simplify file 
      management using the PaperVision Capture technologies.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Businesses can integrate paper-based records into SharePoint libraries 
      using a variety of PaperVision Capture products. PaperVision Capture is 
      an award-winning, production-level scanning application designed for 
      Office 365 users with large volumes of paper records. PaperVision 
      Capture Desktop offers all of the features of the award-winning 
      PaperVision Capture on single desktops, so individual or departmental 
      users can migrate batches of paper records to Office 365 and SharePoint 
      2013. PaperVision Capture SP for SharePoint is the first desktop 
      scanning application designed specifically to help SharePoint users 
      better control paper documents. PaperVision Capture technologies can 
      automatically create the SharePoint columns for libraries and content 
      types needed to manage and organize information effectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This integration with SharePoint 2013, SharePoint Online and Office 365 
      makes it easier for millions of users to get paper and electronic data 
      into SharePoint,&#8221; said HK Bain, CEO of Digitech Systems. &#8220;The 
      integration offers the benefits of PaperVision SharePoint Tools,

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) is deploying more information technology to handle trades and manage its capital as the firm cuts its payroll, CEO Lloyd Blankfein said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm is hiring additional technology workers while cutting its total payroll, Blankfein said at an investor conference.

&lt;p&gt;  FREMONT, CA, Nov 13 (Marketwire) -- 
Foxit(R) Corporation, a leading provider of solutions for reading,
editing, creating, organizing, and securing PDF documents, today
announced that Foxit Reader and PhantomPDF support Microsoft's recently
announced Active Directory(R) Rights Management Service (AD RMS) SDK 2.0
and AD RMS Client 2.0. The Foxit Reader is a Microsoft preferred PDF
reader for AD RMS 2.0, SharePoint(R) 2013, and SharePoint Online in
Office 365 environments. Both products comply with Microsoft's IRM
Protection for PDF Specification Supplement proposal for ISO 32000.

    AD RMS is Microsoft's Information Rights Management (IRM) solution which
protects sensitive information from unauthorized access through
technologies such as encryption and rights policy enforcement. 

    "We are excited to partner with Foxit to extend support for PDF in AD RMS
and SharePoint environments," said Dan Plastina, Information Protection
team Partner Group Program Manager of Microsoft Corporation. "Foxit
Reader's performance, security, and enterprise ready capabilities make it
a Microsoft preferred PDF reader in AD RMS and SharePoint environments."

    permissions of the user.
--  Support Microsoft Office(R)workflows - seamlessly extends AD RMS to
    provide policy protection to PDF documents in Exchange(R), Windows
    Server and/or desktop solutions in a similar workflow as protecting
    Microsoft Office documents.
--  SharePoint file check-in/check-out - enables SharePoint users to
    easily open PDF files that are checked out from SharePoint and then
    check-in those files at the same location on the SharePoint server
    after changes are made.
--  Dynamic security watermarks - Allows the creation of dynamic security
    watermarks to automatically display viewer identity information on
    protected PDF files. This provides additional security to protected
    files from being compromised by users copying confidential information
    through mechanisms such as screen shots, cameras, and video capture.

    

"Document security is becoming an increasing issue as enterprises
are putting more and more digitalized documents on the network," said

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - The executive most widely tipped to be the next chief executive of Microsoft Corp has left the world's largest software maker barely two weeks after launching the flagship Windows 8, as CEO Steve Ballmer moved to tighten his grip on the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exit of 23-year veteran Steven Sinofsky, head of Microsoft's Windows unit, is the latest - and most prominent - in a line of high-profile departures from the Redmond, Washington-based company, which is struggling to keep pace with Apple Inc and Google Inc in mobile computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes hard on the heels of Sinofsky unveiling the most radical revamp of Windows since 1995, designed to catapult Microsoft back into the forefront of Internet-based, touch-screen technology and reinvigorate a stock price that has been static for the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move was unexpected and neither Microsoft nor Sinofsky gave an explanation, although an executive at the company, who asked not to be named, said the decision was "mutual" and said he was not expecting Sinofsky to take a job at another company soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is shocking news. This is very surprising," said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities. "Like a lot of people, I thought Sinofsky was in line to potentially be Ballmer's successor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinofsky, 47, joined Microsoft in 1989 and made his mark as Bill Gates' technical assistant. He grew into an uncompromising leader whose ruthless style of cutting layers of management and formalizing the process of software development gave rise to the term "Sinofskyization" in the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wielded immense power as head of the Windows unit, the traditional center of Microsoft's business, but was not known for working well with other executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One former Microsoft staffer who worked with Sinofsky and other executives said his relentlessly aggressive style exasperated other leaders and may have alienated too many people, including his mentor Gates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He had no one left to fight for him," said the staffer, who asked not to be named. "Gates gave him cover, so he must have eventually caved."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LEADERSHIP STYLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, 56, shows no sign of leaving after almost 13 years in the job, despite almost constant criticism. He has now replaced all the leaders of Microsoft's five main operating units in the past four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told employees in a memo on Monday simply that: "Steven Sinofsky has decided to leave the company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a later media statement, he added that it was "imperative that we continue to drive alignment across all Microsoft teams, and have more integrated and rapid development cycles for our offerings".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could be interpreted as disappointment in Sinofsky's ability, or willingness, to work with other units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Windows has to be much more thoroughly integrated with Xbox, with other parts of the company," said Barnicle. "I don't know that was something Steven was as excited about as focusing on Windows."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could also suggest that Ballmer was not happy with the pace of progress under Sinofsky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Within Microsoft's lead cycle, Sinofsky was delivering at the early edge of it," said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Financial. "But now the competition has moved from a one-year cycle to a six-months cycle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinofsky had a stellar career at Microsoft, overhauling the hugely profitable Office division before going over to manage the release of Windows 7 in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was regarded as a success and Sinofsky was then tasked with overseeing Windows 8, Microsoft's new-look, touch-friendly operating system designed to bridge the gap with mobile computing leaders Apple and Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Sinofsky led the development of Microsoft's Surface tablet, its first own-brand computer, aimed at tackling Apple's wildly successful iPad head on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said it may be too early to judge whether Windows 8 and the Surface have been a success, after launching on October 26, but Sinofsky's departure could have been tied to his abrasive management and ambition for the top job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It sounded like it had more to do with his leadership style," said Barnicle at Pacific Crest. "There wasn't really a next move for Steven at this point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinofsky forfeited some of his bonus this year due to falling sales of Windows and Microsoft's embarrassing failure to comply with an agreement with European regulators to allow users a choice of browsers, which could cost the company millions of dollars in fines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinofsky himself shed no light on his exit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is impossible to count the blessings I have received over my years at Microsoft," he said in a statement. "I am humbled by the professionalism and generosity of everyone I have had the good fortune to work with at this awesome company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not announce any plans to take a job elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinofsky will be succeeded by Julie Larson-Green, who will head the Windows hardware and software division, and Tami Reller, who will remain chief financial officer of the Windows unit. Together, they will report directly to Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinofsky's departure comes two weeks after rival Apple shook up its own top management, forcing out mobile head Scott Forstall and retail chief John Browett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One analyst cited talk that the moves might be related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some are speculating that the availability on the market of Forstall might have something to do with Sinofsky's departure," said Gartner analyst Carolina Milanesi. "I doubt we will have to wait long to know if this is the case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Sakthi Prasad, Nicola Leske and Sarah McBride; Editing by Edmund Klamann)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  PALO ALTO, CA, Nov 13 (Marketwire) -- 
HP Enterprise Services (NYSE: HPQ) today announced that the U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has awarded the company a five-year
contract valued at $36 million to provide a department-wide email and
calendaring infrastructure to the VA's 600,000 users with Microsoft
Office 365 for Government. 

    The agreement was awarded under the Veterans Administration
Transformation Twenty-One Total Technology (VA T4) program, the
department's information technology modernization contract. The
modernization effort will begin with 15,000 people and expand agencywide
to 600,000 people when all contract options are executed.

    "VA is moving to cloud-based email and collaboration as part of a broader
effort to leverage emerging technologies to reduce costs, increase
efficiencies and, most importantly, improve service delivery to our
nation's veterans," said Charles De Sanno, executive director, Enterprise
Systems Engineering, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

    Under the agreement, HP will lead and manage the implementation of Office
365 for the VA to enhance reliability, security, privacy and compliance
as well as create geographically diverse disaster recovery. Moving to the
cloud enables the VA to fulfill the Cloud-First federal mandate while
anticipating improved employee productivity and collaboration and reduced
costs. 

    The VA will use Microsoft Office 365 for Government, which features a
separate community cloud, for email, shared calendars, instant messaging,
and web and video conferencing. It also includes industry-leading
applications for productivity and collaboration including cloud-based
Office, Exchange, Lync and SharePoint.

    "The VA needed to transform into a 21st century organization that could
enable employees to collaborate more effectively," said Marilyn Crouther,
senior vice president and general manager, U.S. Public Sector, HP
Enterprise Services. "Together with the VA and Microsoft, the HP team
will modernize the VA's communications infrastructure while lowering
costs and setting the stage for other U.S. government agencies to enter
the cloud era."

    HP and its alliance partners deliver best-in-class capabilities and
practices, innovation and a distinct history of service-delivery
excellence. For more than 13 years, the VA has worked with HP on some of
the agency's most critical initiatives, including multiple IT solutions
with the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and VA Office of
Information and Technology (OIT). 

    "The VA's decision to implement Office 365 for Government with HP
Enterprise Services validates our longstanding partnership and our
commitment to helping them move to the cloud on their terms with the most
complete productivity and collaboration tools available while keeping
their information protected and secure," said Greg Myers, vice president,
Federal, Microsoft.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Microsoft and Google's Motorola Mobility unit are set to square off on Tuesday at a trial with strategic implications for the smartphone patent wars and which could reveal financial information the two companies usually keep under wraps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proceeding in a Seattle federal court will determine how much of a royalty Microsoft Corp should pay Google Inc for a license to some of Motorola's patents. Google bought Motorola for $12.5 billion, partly for its library of communications patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If U.S. District Judge James Robart decides Google deserves only a small royalty, then its Motorola patents would be a weaker bargaining chip for Google to negotiate licensing deals with rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc and Microsoft have been litigating in courts around the world against Google and partners like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, which use the Android operating system on their mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple contends that Android is basically a copy of its iOS smartphone software, and Microsoft holds patents that it contends cover a number of Android features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motorola had sought up to $4 billion a year for its wireless and video patents, while Microsoft argues its rival deserves just over $1 million a year. A federal judge in Wisconsin last week threw out a similar case brought by Apple against Google just before trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the run-up to trial in Seattle, both Microsoft and Google asked Robart to keep secret a range of financial details about the two companies, including licensing deals and sales revenue projections. Google requested that Robart clear the courtroom when witnesses discuss those details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in an order on Monday, Robart rejected that request. The public will not be able to view the documents describing patent deals or company sales during trial, Robart ruled, but testimony will be in open court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If a witness discloses pertinent terms, rates or payments, such information will necessarily be made public," the judge wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, any documents the judge relies on for his final opinion will be disclosed, Robart wrote on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives for Microsoft and Google could not immediately comment on the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case in U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington is Microsoft Corp. vs. Motorola Inc., 10-cv-1823.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Bill Rigby in Seattle and Dan Levine in San Francisco; editing by Jim Marshall)&lt;/p&gt;

      Kofax&#174; plc (LSE: KFX), a leading provider of Capture Enabled 
      BPM&#8482; (business 
      process management) solutions, today announced that Cornerstone 
      Records Management, a comprehensive records and information 
      management provider, has used Kofax capture software integrated with 
      Microsoft SharePoint to offer greater value to customers through robust 
      scan-to-archive and content management capabilities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Cornerstone needed a secure, scalable solution that would expand our 
      business portfolio and help us grow from a regional to national 
      footprint by offering greater value to our customers,&#8221; said Nicholas 
      Milne, vice president of Sales Support at Cornerstone. &#8220;Using a solution 
      that combined Microsoft SharePoint&#8217;s collaboration capabilities with 
      Kofax&#8217;s information capture leadership enabled us to provide a robust, 
      new product to help grow our business. Cornerstone continues to innovate

		&lt;p&gt;
      Cornerstone Records Management provides document storage, secure 
      document destruction, document imaging and data protection services to 
      its customers. It uses a Kofax solution to automatically capture and 
      perfect images of documents originating in both paper and electronic 
      formats. Meta or index data for the document is then extracted 
      automatically and used to make retrieval easier in a SharePoint 
      repository, so employees in different locations and business lines can 
      have easy access to information. By improving access and visibility into 
      critical information across the enterprise, organizations can better 
      understand that information and quickly decide how best to act on it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Cornerstone Records Management&#8217;s success is an excellent example of how 
      Kofax capture capabilities can seamlessly integrate with SharePoint to 
      meet current and future information capture needs,&#8221; said Martyn 
      Christian, chief marketing officer at Kofax. &#8220;By leveraging Kofax&#8217;s 
      industry leading capture capabilities with SharePoint, organizations can 
      maximize their knowledge sharing investment while significantly reducing 
      retrieval costs and improving regulatory and compliance efforts.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, N.Y., Nov. 13, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via PRWEB - With nearly two months left to wrap up 2012, the Fiance Visa Attorney Office of Joel J. Turney LLC has announced the impressive milestone of completing 1000 fiance visa cases already this year. Specializing in K1 Visa cases, the firm is not only home to some of the most experienced and successful fiance visa attorneys in the country, but also genuinely cares about the families they serve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Fiance visa attorney Joel J. Turney has been helping couples attain their K1 visas and come together for years. That is why he knows, better than perhaps anyone, what is at stake during this process and how much it means to the client seeking legal help and advice to get help from a professional. The firm's main goal is to make the fianc&#233; visa process completely worry-free for clients and their loved ones so that they can enjoy their engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Your engagement to a fiance from another country should be a stress-free time in which to plan your wedding and future life together, without having to dwell upon complicated legal issues. Our number one priority is to get your fianc&#233; here quickly and efficiently to give you the peace of mind every couple deserves during this time of their lives," said Turney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Many of the couples who come to the office of expert fiance visa attorney, Joel J. Turney, have become frustrated with the process of attaining a K1-visa after attempting to get it on their own. For someone who is not an experienced fianc&#233; visa attorney, it can be difficult to make a strong case, become familiar with all of the options available, and understand the complicated legal jargon and documents involved. By utilizing the internet and technology the services of Joel J. Turney LLC are available nationwide and they work with clients from all 50 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	One client, who is now happily married to his wife and is legally living with her in the United States, said, "I was nervous about hiring an attorney from a different state at first, but after trying to obtain a K1 visa myself and seeing how difficult it can really be, I took a chance. It ended up being the best decision I've ever made. Everything went better than I could have ever expected. Someone was always available to help and answer questions, and all of the documents went through no problem. I quickly learned that there was no difference between having an attorney in my home town, and having one across the country." 
	Three months after hiring Joel J. Turney this couple had their visa and the stress and uncertainty of not knowing what their future would hold was behind them. Each of the 1,000 cases that have been completed this year has a similar story, making that important annual milestone much more than a number to Mr. Turney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Initial consultations with an experienced fiance visa attorney are free of charge, and services are priced at one flat fee which can be paid in three increments. Clients are protected with a money back guarantee policy, and are well informed by their attorney every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Nov 13 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs is
shutting its South Korean asset management unit, exiting Asia's
third-biggest funds management market, a Hong Kong-based
spokesman said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit employs about 40 people and manages about $4
billion in assets, the spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fate of the 40 staff was not clear, but the spokesman
said Goldman will try to absorb them in other parts of the
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman will continue to invest in South Korea through its
offshore funds management unit, the spokesman added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 13 (Reuters) - Microsoft and Google's Motorola Mobility
unit are set to square off on Tuesday at a trial with strategic
implications for the smartphone patent wars and which could
reveal financial information the two companies usually keep
under wraps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proceeding in a Seattle federal court will determine how
much of a royalty Microsoft Corp should pay Google Inc
 for a license to some of Motorola's patents. Google
bought Motorola for $12.5 billion, partly for its library of
communications patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If U.S. District Judge James Robart decides Google deserves
only a small royalty, then its Motorola patents would be a
weaker bargaining chip for Google to negotiate licensing deals
with rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc and Microsoft have been litigating in
courts around the world against Google and partners like Samsung
Electronics Co Ltd, which use the Android operating
system on their mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple contends that Android is basically a copy of its iOS
smartphone software, and Microsoft holds patents that it
contends cover a number of Android features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motorola had sought up to $4 billion a year for its wireless
and video patents, while Microsoft argues its rival deserves
just over $1 million a year. A federal judge in Wisconsin last
week threw out a similar case brought by Apple against Google
just before trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the run-up to trial in Seattle, both Microsoft and
Google asked Robart to keep secret a range of financial details
about the two companies, including licensing deals and sales
revenue projections. Google requested that Robart clear the
courtroom when witnesses discuss those details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in an order on Monday, Robart rejected that
request. The public will not be able to view the documents
describing patent deals or company sales during trial, Robart
ruled, but testimony will be in open court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If a witness discloses pertinent terms, rates or payments,
such information will necessarily be made public," the judge
wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, any documents the judge relies on for his
final opinion will be disclosed, Robart wrote on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives for Microsoft and Google could not
immediately comment on the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case in U.S. District Court, Western District of
Washington is Microsoft Corp. vs. Motorola Inc., 10-cv-1823.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PERTH Nov 13 (Reuters) - Chevron's $37 billion
Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) development is now 50 percent
complete, and still on track to go on line in 2014, a senior
executive said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gorgon LNG, the company's flagship development, is currently
undergoing a cost and schedule review as costs at other
Australian LNG developments have been growing rapidly due to a
high Australian dollar and the rising local price of doing
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's no surprise that you would do (a review) on Gorgon,"
Chevron Australia's General Manager of Operations, Brian Smith,
said at an industry conference in Perth, but added that the
project is still expected to cost $37 billion, although he 
hinted that the current estimate may change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The cost is still the same number at this point of time. It
may well be in the future that we may mention some other
number... the exchange rate has gone up, it's higher than when
project was approved," Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LNG plants are notorious for running over budget and missing
schedules. In Australia, three out of seven projects under
construction have announced cost increases of more than 20
percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Head of Windows division Steven Sinofsky leaves company&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Sinofsky known as aggressive, divisive leader&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Insider says departure "mutual decision"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Julie Larson-Green, Tami Reller to lead Windows unit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The executive most widely tipped
to be the next chief executive of Microsoft Corp has
left the world's largest software maker barely two weeks after
launching the flagship Windows 8, as CEO Steve Ballmer moved to
tighten his grip on the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exit of 23-year veteran Steven Sinofsky, head of
Microsoft's Windows unit, is the latest - and most prominent -
in a line of high-profile departures from the Redmond,
Washington-based company, which is struggling to keep pace with
Apple Inc and Google Inc in mobile computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes hard on the heels of Sinofsky unveiling the most
radical revamp of Windows since 1995, designed to catapult
Microsoft back into the forefront of Internet-based,
touch-screen technology and reinvigorate a stock price that has
been static for the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move was unexpected and neither Microsoft nor Sinofsky
gave an explanation, although an executive at the company, who
asked not to be named, said the decision was "mutual" and said
he was not expecting Sinofsky to take a job at another company
soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is shocking news. This is very surprising," said
Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities. "Like
a lot of people, I thought Sinofsky was in line to potentially
be Ballmer's successor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinofsky, 47, joined Microsoft in 1989 and made his mark as
Bill Gates' technical assistant. He grew into an uncompromising
leader whose ruthless style of cutting layers of management and
formalizing the process of software development gave rise to the
term "Sinofskyization" in the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wielded immense power as head of the Windows unit, the
traditional center of Microsoft's business, but was not known
for working well with other executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One former Microsoft staffer who worked with Sinofsky and
other executives said his relentlessly aggressive style
exasperated other leaders and may have alienated too many
people, including his mentor Gates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He had no one left to fight for him," said the staffer, who
asked not to be named. "Gates gave him cover, so he must have
eventually caved."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LEADERSHIP STYLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, 56, shows no sign of leaving after almost 13 years
in the job, despite almost constant criticism. He has now
replaced all the leaders of Microsoft's five main operating
units in the past four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told employees in a memo on Monday simply that: "Steven
Sinofsky has decided to leave the company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a later media statement, he added that it was "imperative
that we continue to drive alignment across all Microsoft teams,
and have more integrated and rapid development cycles for our
offerings".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could be interpreted as disappointment in Sinofsky's
ability, or willingness, to work with other units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Windows has to be much more thoroughly integrated with
Xbox, with other parts of the company," said Barnicle. "I don't
know that was something Steven was as excited about as focusing
on Windows."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could also suggest that Ballmer was not happy with the
pace of progress under Sinofsky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Within Microsoft's lead cycle, Sinofsky was delivering at
the early edge of it," said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC
Financial. "But now the competition has moved from a one-year
cycle to a six-months cycle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinofsky had a stellar career at Microsoft, overhauling the
hugely profitable Office division before going over to manage
the release of Windows 7 in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was regarded as a success and Sinofsky was then tasked
with overseeing Windows 8, Microsoft's new-look, touch-friendly
operating system designed to bridge the gap with mobile
computing leaders Apple and Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Sinofsky led the development of
Microsoft's Surface tablet, its first own-brand computer, aimed
at tackling Apple's wildly successful iPad head on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said it may be too early to judge whether Windows 8
and the Surface have been a success, after launching on Oct. 26,
but Sinofsky's departure could have been tied to his abrasive
management and ambition for the top job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It sounded like it had more to do with his leadership
style," said Barnicle at Pacific Crest. "There wasn't really a
next move for Steven at this point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinofsky forfeited some of his bonus this year due to
falling sales of Windows and Microsoft's embarrassing failure to
comply with an agreement with European regulators to allow users
a choice of browsers, which could cost the company millions of
dollars in fines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinofsky himself shed no light on his exit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is impossible to count the blessings I have received
over my years at Microsoft," he said in a statement. "I am
humbled by the professionalism and generosity of everyone I have
had the good fortune to work with at this awesome company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not announce any plans to take a job elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinofsky will be succeeded by Julie Larson-Green, who will
head the Windows hardware and software division, and Tami
Reller, who will remain chief financial officer of the Windows
unit. Together, they will report directly to Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinofsky's departure comes two weeks after rival Apple shook
up its own top management, forcing out mobile head Scott
Forstall and retail chief John Browett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One analyst cited talk that the moves might be related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some are speculating that the availability on the market of
Forstall might have something to do with Sinofsky's departure,"
said Gartner analyst Carolina Milanesi. "I doubt we will have to
wait long to know if this is the case."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY Nov 15 (Reuters) - The owners of Coates Hire have
roped in Goldman Sachs for a possible sale of Australia's
top equipment hire firm after failing to proceed with other
options including an A$800 million ($831 million) initial public
offer earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private equity firm Carlyle Group and Seven Group
Holdings said in a statement that Goldman Sachs will be
assisted by China International Capital Corp in China and Nomura
Holdings in Japan with the ownership review process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two firms own 46 percent each in Coates, which has
revenues of A$1.3 billion in the year to June 2012 and had 200
branches across Australia serving engineering, construction,
mining and manufacturing industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The strategic review will commence immediately and is
expected to take several months to reach a conclusion," the two
firms said in the joint statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move comes amid little sign of revival in appetite for
IPO's in Australia, which has seen several big deals canned this
year. The last big IPO was QR National's $4.6 billion
offering in late 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, sources told Reuters that Coates hired Bank of
America-Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank JPMorgan 
and Macquarie Group to manage an IPO, which would let
the owners raise funds to repay debt and fund growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear if the mandate has been
cancelled. Seven group and Carlyle did not specify if they
planned to retain a stake at the conclusion of the offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carlyle bought the 46 percent stake in Coates in 2008.
Private equity funds typically hold an asset for three to five
years, although frozen IPO markets and lack of strategic buyers
are forcing them to hold their assets longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the rumor mill is heating up again with news that streaming music service Spotify is raising another round of funding, we&#8217;re hearing new information about where the money is coming from.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Half of the rumored fifth round, which could total more than $100 million, is said to be led by Goldman Sachs, as VentureBeat previously reported. However, an anonymous source tells the New York Times that Coca-Cola could be contributing 10 percent of the round (about $10 million) and that Fidelity could be contributing up to 15 percent, with the remaining 25 percent coming from previous investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spotify declined to comment to VentureBeat about any new funding. However, some reports indicate that the alleged new round could close as early as today. If true, the new round could value the startup at an estimated $3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2009, Stockholm, Sweden-based Spotify has raised a total of $189 million to date from Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, Accel Partners, DST Global, Sean Parker, and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spotify CEO Daniel Ek photo via Fortune Live Media/Flickr&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filed under: Deals, Media&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Adds information on new partners, geographic breakdown,
percentage of staff and Blankfein comment)
    By Lauren Tara LaCapra
    Nov 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc named 70
new partners on Wednesday, the smallest number since the
investment bank went public in 1999.
    Goldman's partner naming, a relic from its past as a private
investment bank, occurs every two years and is a closely watched
event on Wall Street. The prior partner class announced in 2010
consisted of 110 people.
    The list of new partners includes Russell Horwitz, who is
the company's secretary and Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein's
chief of staff, and David Schwimmer, a natural resources banker
who is also a former chief of staff to Blankfein. Schwimmer
advised on the 2005 merger of the New York Stock Exchange and
Archipelago, and later ran Goldman's business in Russia.
    Also on the list are Kent Clark, an executive in the hedge
fund products group of Goldman's asset management division, and
Huw Pill, Goldman's chief European economist.
    Goldman has been cutting staff since last year in an effort
to save $1.9 billion in annual expenses in a weak revenue
environment. 
    Goldman had 407 partners as of Nov. 2, down from 440 in
February, according to regulatory filings. Some of those
partners have announced plans to retire, but won't leave until
year end.
    Goldman projects that, including its new partners, the group
will represent about 1.7 percent of staff, consistent with prior
years. The investment bank's payroll stood at 32,600 employees
at Sept. 30. It employed 35,700 at the end of 2010.
    The geographic breakdown of new partners is 41, or 59
percent of the total, in the Americas; 20, or 29 percent, from
Europe, Middle East and Africa; and nine, or 13 percent, in
Asia-Pacific, a bank spokesman said.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc named 70 new partners to its 2012 partnership class, the smallest number since the investment bank went public in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman's partner naming, a relic from its past as a private investment bank, occurs every two years and is a closely watched event on Wall Street. The prior partner class in 2010 included 110 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has been cutting staff since last year as it looks to cut costs in a weak revenue environment and the smaller partner number is reflective of that. The investment bank tries to keep its partner pool at around 1 percent of the overall workforce, which stood at 32,600 at September 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the new partners are Russell Horwitz, who is Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein's chief of staff; Kent Clark, an executive in the hedge fund products group of Goldman's asset management division; and Huw Pill, Goldman's chief European economist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of November 2, Goldman had 407 partners, according to a regulatory filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Lauren Tara LaCapra; Editing by Mauren Bavdek and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 14 - Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services said today that it assigned its
'B' issue-level rating to Walter Energy Inc.'s proposed senior unsecured
notes due 2020. The recovery rating on the notes is '5', indicating our
expectation for modest (10%-30%) recovery in the event of a payment default. The
company is issuing the notes under Rule 144A with 
registration rights.

Certain subsidiaries of Walter Energy will guarantee the notes on an unsecured 
basis. The notes will be senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally 
with all of Walter Energy's existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. 
The company intends to use the proceeds from this offering to repay a portion 
of its existing indebtedness, as well as for transaction-related fees and 
expenses. Currently, about $975 million of the company's term loan A and $1.4 
billion of its term loan B are outstanding.

The 'B+' corporate credit rating and negative outlook on Walter Energy reflect 
the combination of what we consider to be the company's "weak" business risk 
and "aggressive" financial risk profiles. Key risks to the company's business 
include a cyclical slowdown in steel production that is suppressing demand for 
metallurgical (met) coal and a high reliance on a single Southern Appalachian 
mining complex for most of its operating income. Still, we maintain our view 
that Walter Energy's coal reserves are of a very high quality and that its 
mining costs are comparably low. 

We expect that full-year 2012 and 2013 EBITDA should be about $550 million and 
$600 million, respectively. We expect debt-to-EBITDA to remain at or above 5x, 
and we expect funds from operations (FFO)-to-debt to be near the lower end of 
the 12%-20% range through 2013. Both ranges are consistent with an aggressive 
financial risk profile. Still, the negative outlook reflects the risk that met 
coal prices could continue to deteriorate if steel manufacturing slows due to 
weaker-than-expected global economic conditions. (For the complete corporate 
credit rating rationale, see our research update on Walter published Nov. 6, 
2012.)

		&lt;p&gt;
			Former Top Disney Executive, Al Weiss, Joins Brand Affinity 
      Technologies (BAT) Board of Directors
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Brand Affinity Technologies (BAT), the experts in activating, engaging 
      and monetizing the fan, today announced that Al Weiss, former President 
      of Worldwide Operations for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, has been 
      appointed to its Board of Directors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Weiss brings nearly 40 years of experience expanding Walt Disney&#8217;s 
      brand reach, including its extensive international expansion and 
      development of its comprehensive consumer engagement offerings. As a BAT 
      board member, he will help oversee the advancement of BAT&#8217;s proprietary 
      fan activation platform, Fantapper (www.fantapper.com), 
      in addition to BAT&#8217;s recent acquisition of the fan photography business 
      of Printroom (www.printroom.com), 
      one of the nation&#8217;s leading fan photography services platform for 
      sporting and entertainment events. With Mr. Weiss&#8217; strategic counsel and 
      Printroom&#8217;s ongoing relationships with MLB, CBS Interactive and numerous 
      NBA, NFL and NHL teams, BAT will greatly accelerate its effort to 
      capture and amplify in-game fan experiences, both online and offline.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I have always considered Walt Disney Parks a destination that truly 
      demonstrates creativity and evokes imagination. Like Disney, BAT strives 
      to deliver experiences that strongly resonate with fans, their emotions 
      and memories of any life event, whether it&#8217;s a baseball game, concert, 
      or family reunion,&#8221; said Ryan Steelberg, president and CEO of Brand 
      Affinity Technologies. &#8220;This is why we are incredibly excited for Mr. 
      Weiss to join BAT&#8217;s Board of Directors. His leadership and international 
      expertise will play a critical role as we continue to expand our product 
      offerings to capture and extend our customers&#8217; celebrated life moments.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Previously, Mr. Weiss served as President of Worldwide Operations for 
      Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, the division of The Walt Disney Company 
      that operates eleven theme parks and multiple resort hotels across the 
      world. Under his leadership, he was responsible for operations at the 
      company&#8217;s theme parks and resorts spanning three continents and 
      including the Walt Disney World Resort, Disneyland Resort, Hong Kong 
      Disneyland and Disneyland Resort Paris. During his tenure he also 
      launched the Disney Cruise Line. Mr. Weiss announced his retirement 
      after 39 years of service with the Walt Disney Company in Nov. 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;During my tenure at Disney, I worked with the best to do the 
      impossible, while always remaining hyper-focused on providing the best 
      guest experience. I&#8217;m drawn to BAT&#8217;s arsenal of fan engagement 
      offerings. I believe a continuous dialog with customers results in 
      long-term fan loyalty. I&#8217;m confident that BAT&#8217;s team will fully leverage 
      and extend its existing products and newly acquired Printroom fan photo 
      offerings into a unique fan experience via digital media,&#8221; said Weiss. 
      &#8220;It&#8217;s a true pleasure to come on board to support BAT&#8217;s growth.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Weiss joins a board of experts from a wide array of industries, 
      including executives from startup, venture capital, technology, and 
      entertainment companies.

      Research and Markets: Global Information Lifecycle Management Tools 
      Market 2011-2015 Features Market Leaders IBM Corp., Informatica Corp., 
      Hewlett-Packard Co., and Solix Technologies Inc
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/5ckqnj/global) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Information Lifecycle Management Tools Market 2011-2015" report 
      to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      TechNavio's analysts forecast the Global Information Lifecycle 
      Management Tools market to grow at a CAGR of 18.95 percent over the 
      period 2011-2015. One of the key factors contributing to this market 
      growth is the increase in regulations. The Global Information Lifecycle 
      Management Tools market has also been witnessing the data explosion in 
      enterprises. However, the lack of awareness could pose a challenge to 
      the growth of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from TechNavio's Enterprise 
      Computing team said: ''An enterprise database management system is a 
      system that helps enterprises to effectively manage databases. This 
      system is particularly very useful in enterprises with a large number of 
      employees, leading to a large number of users for each database. 
      Enterprise database management systems help enterprises to effectively 
      plan and manage the databases. They also help in reducing the total 
      costs of business operations. Additionally, one of the major goals of 
      enterprise database management systems is to validate that the data 
      which enters the database is perfectly clean and does not requires any 
      re-evaluation of its quality.''
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers is the increase in 
      regulations. Information lifecycle management (ILM) tools help 
      organizations effectively manage data by supporting the data management 
      policies and regulations. They also ensure transparency and accurate, 
      timely information.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report discusses that lack of awareness is one of the major 
      challenges faced by this market.

			New Hampshire Teen is All Smiles after Learning She is the 2 
      Millionth Patient to Be Treated with Invisalign
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			-- Teens and Adults Embrace Invisalign&#174; and Invisalign Teen&#174; As Align 
      Technology Reaches New Milestone --
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For most teens getting braces is something you smile about after you&#8217;ve 
      finished treatment, but 18-year-old Tessa Dyer hasn&#8217;t stopped smiling 
      since learning her Invisalign orthodontic treatment would be provided at 
      no charge. Dyer is a patient of Drs. Rachel Polgrean and Patricia 
      Timmeny at Apple Tree Orthodontics in Londonderry, New Hampshire, and 
      was informed during a recent visit that she is the two millionth patient 
      worldwide to be treated with Invisalign. To commemorate the milestone, 
      Dyer&#8217;s Invisalign Teen treatment will be completely covered by Align 
      Technology, makers of Invisalign and Invisalign Teen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I&#8217;ve wanted to correct my teeth for a long time and the time was right. 
      Really right,&#8221; said Dyer. &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I am the two millionth 
      patient and that my treatment will be free. Of all the braces options 
      that Drs. Polgrean and Dr. Timmeny presented to me, Invisalign Teen best 
      fit my lifestyle and, best of all, hardly anyone will be able to tell I 
      am straightening my teeth. I was excited about Invisalign Teen before, 
      but now I can&#8217;t wait to get started with my treatment.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dr. Polgrean is equally excited for Dyer and looks forward to making her 
      smile brighter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;When Tessa came in for her consultation and we discussed the options, 
      she very quickly decided on Invisalign Teen,&#8221; said Dr. Polgrean. 
      &#8220;Invisalign is an extremely versatile treatment that can be used to 
      treat many different types of orthodontic cases. I&#8217;m honored to be 
      sharing this milestone with Align Technology and with Tessa.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      When introduced by Align Technology in 1999, Invisalign was viewed as 
      one of the most significant innovations in orthodontics in nearly 20 
      years. Ten years later, Invisalign celebrated the treatment of its one 
      millionth patient. Since then, the treatment&#8217;s popularity amongst adults 
      and teens has accelerated exponentially. And only three years later, one 
      million more patients have chosen Invisalign and Invisalign Teen. 
      Approximately 260,000 teenagers between 11-19 years old have been 
      treated with Invisalign since Invisalign Teen was introduced in 2008.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Invisalign
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Adults and teens now have a modern choice for straightening their teeth. 
      No more wires and brackets required &#8211; Invisalign is the clear 
      alternative to metal braces that uses a series of virtually invisible 
      and removable aligners that gradually move teeth over time. The benefits 
      include&#160;no food restrictions, ability to easily maintain healthy dental 
      brushing habits, minimal interference with sports or other activities, 
      and teeth get straightened without most people knowing you are in 
      treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Align Technology, Inc.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a 
      proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of 
      teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly 
      invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired 
      final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic 
      brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and 
      other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for 
      treating adults and teens. Align Technology was founded in March 1997 
      and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998.

&lt;p&gt;* Decision on replacement for Exxon expected by mid-2013
    * Iraq refuses to pay second tranche of payment to Kurdistan
    * Shahristani urges OPEC members to observe production
quotas


    By Simon Falush
    LONDON, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil is in the
advanced stages of talks with potential buyers to take on Iraq's
West Qurna 1 oilfield and there are enough appropriate
candidates, the country's deputy prime minister for energy said.
    Exxon is selling its stake in the south of the country to
enable it to focus on its deal for exploration blocks in
semi-autonomous northern Kurdistan.
    Hussain al-Shahristani also said Iraq would not pay a second
tranche of an agreed 1 trillion Iraqi dinars ($860 million) to
the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) because it had not met
an oil export target agreed in September.    
   Exxon Mobil, which has signed oil deals in the Kurdistan
region that are seen as more lucrative but are dismissed by the
central government as illegal, has informed Baghdad it wants to
pull out of the $50 billion West Qurna 1 project in southern
Iraq. 
     The central government had told Exxon it had to make a
choice between working in southern Iraq or Kurdistan. The U.S.
oil major opted to stick with Kurdistan.
    Shahristani said Exxon would soon find a buyer.
    "A decision will have to be made shortly. To transfer the
assets will take some time, but it will be sooner (than the
middle of next year)," he told Reuters on Tuesday.
    "There are sufficient number of interested buyers with the
financial resources and the technical know-how to buy their
interest," Shahristani earlier told reporters.
    Uncertainty over who can replace the U.S. major in the 
project has raised questions about Iraq's targets for increasing
crude output.
    Shahristani told the Oil and Money conference in London
earlier in the day that Iraq could lower its oil production
target to between 9 million barrels per day and 9.5 million bpd
between 2017 and 2020 as part of a review. 
    Iraq had previously stated plans to boost its production
capacity to 12 million bpd by 2017 with the help of foreign
firms, but this target has widely been seen as unrealistic.
    
    Shahristani told reporters on the conference sidelines  
that Exxon would soon hand over the field to a company that had
the capabilities to exploit it. He declined to say how many
companies were involved in the process or to identify their
country of origin. 
    "Exxon Mobil has already specified deadlines to submit the
bids and as soon as they receive their bids, there is more than
one interested qualified buyer," he said.
    "As soon as (Exxon) make a request to us to allow them to
sell the interest to that buyer, then it will be known how long
it will take them to finalise the arrangements. We have already
agreed with Exxon on the timetables to finalise the
arrangement," he added. 
    Some industry sources have said Baghdad is keen to replace
Exxon with companies from Russia or China. But it was unclear
which companies would have the financial heft to follow Exxon. 
    Russia's second largest crude producer Lukoil said
on Friday it would study an offer from Exxon to take over West
Qurna-1, Interfax news agency said.   
   Lukoil, which is already developing West Qurna-2, has
previously said West Qurna-1 is "too big for it to swallow", but
on Friday it said it would at least look into the proposal.
 
    
    KURDISH DISPUTE
    The oil contracts row is part of a broader battle between
Baghdad and Kurdistan over oil rights and territory.
    Baghdad and the KRG agreed in September to settle a dispute
over oil payments after the KRG promised to continue exports and
Baghdad pledged to pay foreign companies working there.  
    Under this deal, the KRG agreed to pump 200,000 barrels per
day of oil for export from October in exchange for the 1
trillion dinars. A first payment of 650 billion dinars was
received in October, but Shahristani said no more would be paid.
 
    "There is no second payment. There is only a payment for 650
billion dinars and this has been made," he said. 
    "The agreement required the KRG to pump 200,000 barrels a
day from October and they have not been able to meet that
requirement."
    A KRG official said: "We believe the political will is there
to make (the agreement) work."
    Turning to OPEC policy matters, Shahristani said some
members of the Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries
should cut their current levels of production.
    "The total quota for OPEC is 30 million barrels per day,
OPEC is producing 31 million bpd, so there are some members
overproducing their quotas. We are calling, and some other
members are calling, for the quotas to be observed," he said.
    "There is no need for overproduction, the market is
well-supplied, prices are stable, there is no great demand, so
there is no need to over-produce," Shahristani added.

			Walton Ontario Land L.P. 1 Issues Cash Distribution to Investors and 
      Consolidates Units
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Ontario Land L.P. 1 (the &#8220;Partnership&#8221;) and its general 
      partner, Walton Ontario Land 1 Corporation (the &#8220;General Partner&#8221;), 
      announce that the first cash distribution to investors in the 
      Partnership has been issued on the outstanding limited partnership units 
      of the Partnership (the &#8220;Units&#8221;) in the amount of $6.00 per Unit. 
      The distribution was made following the sale of the Alliston Property 
      owned by the Partnership to Unitholders of record as of the close of 
      business on October 18, 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The distribution amount of $6.00 per Unit includes $4.52 of capital and 
      $1.48 of income. The $1.48 amount does not represent the taxable 
      income per Unit as that will not be calculated until after the 
      Partnership&#8217;s year-end of December 31. The total $6.00 distribution will 
      reduce the adjusted cost base of each Unit for income tax purposes and 
      the taxable income, when it is known and calculated at the end of the 
      year, will increase the adjusted cost base of each Unit for income tax 
      purposes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pursuant to the terms of the Limited Partnership Agreement of the 
      Partnership, immediately after the distribution, the Units will be 
      consolidated so that each Unit prior to the distribution will become 
      0.548 of a Unit after the distribution, resulting in a total of 
      1,961,848 Units outstanding. Replacement certificates will not be issued 
      by the Partnership to reflect this consolidation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Each partner who is a Unitholder of record at the year-end of the 
      Partnership will receive, by mail in March of 2013, a T5013 from the 
      Partnership, the Partnership&#8217;s transfer agent or the Unitholder&#8217;s 
      brokerage firm. The T5013 indicates the amount and nature of the taxable 
      income that the Unitholder is responsible to report.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Launched in January 2010, the Partnership&#8217;s objective is to maximize

&lt;p&gt;(Adds link to partner story, names of new managing directors)
    Nov 15 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc promoted
266 employees to the title of managing director on Thursday,
five more than the previous year.
    The announcement comes the day after the investment bank
said that 70 employees would become partners, the smallest
number since Goldman went public in 1999. 
    Partners earn significantly more than managing directors,
with salaries of about $900,000 for partners vs about $500,000
for managing directors. They also get a cut of a special bonus
pool. The managing director promotion is more of a nod to
promising employees who show potential.

    SESSION SYNOPSIS 

    Track Session #351:

    "Leverage Excel and Oracle OLAP for Secure and Actionable BI and Ad-hoc
Reporting"

    Presented by Thomas Nifkiffa, concept-to-solution and Amyn Rajan, Simba
Technologies Inc.

    November 22nd, from 3pm - 3:45pm: Room 9 - Stockholm

    Discover how Delphis Team Lines, a leading logistics company, securely
extended analysis and reporting capabilities within its data intelligence
network to its external agents around the world, by leveraging Oracle
Database OLAP Option with Microsoft Excel. See how Excel's rich data
selection, multi-dimensional display, hierarchical navigation and data
visualization features ensured faster and better business decisions on
Oracle Database stored data.

    Learn how Excel's familiar interface enabled users to easily and directly
perform sophisticated self-service business intelligence fully adhering
to Oracle database security settings. See how fixed reporting and ad hoc
analysis capabilities directly on Oracle OLAP data resulted in greater
reporting efficiency organization-wide, as well as better control over
data that its users used for self-service business intelligence.

    This session demonstrates how users can leverage Excel to query rich
analytical content and calculations directly from an Oracle OLAP
database. Learn how to benefit from Excel's ad hoc query functionality,
instantaneous report creation and one version of the truth data
reporting, with one set of data models and Oracle security across the
entire solution.

    See how Oracle OLAP data can be queried, analyzed and reported on
directly from within Excel, without pre-staging data into a costly
mid-tier infrastructure and how to feed your PivotTables live enterprise
data to make better, faster decisions. This presentation outlines a
simple architecture for advanced analytics on Oracle-stored data, serving
the complex BI needs of a global enterprise. If your organization uses
Excel, this is a must see presentation.

&lt;p&gt;Nov 15 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc promoted
266 employees to the title of managing director on Thursday,
five more than the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement comes the day after the investment bank
said that 70 employees would become partners, the smallest
number since Goldman went public in 1999.

&lt;p&gt;SANTA CLARA, California (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's chief executive said his company would look at more opportunities to build its own devices, after the launch of its Surface tablet last month, potentially bringing the software giant into competition with its hardware partners and opening the door to a Microsoft-branded phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Do I anticipate that partners of ours will build the lion's share of all Windows devices over the next five years? The answer is, absolutely," Steve Ballmer said at a tech industry event in Santa Clara, California, on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With that said, it is absolutely clear that there is an innovation opportunity on the scene between hardware and software and that is a scene that must not go unexploited at all by Microsoft," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Xbox game console and now the Surface tablet -- designed to take on Apple Inc's iPad -- Ballmer has been moving Microsoft toward being a "devices and services" company that would develop its own hardware where it made sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports surfaced two weeks ago that Microsoft was already testing a design for its own phone, but the company has not confirmed anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's new Surface tablet is the company's first foray into building its own PCs and has raised questions in the tech industry about how aggressively it plans to move into marketing more of its own personal computing devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking to Apple's success with its iPads and iPhones, Microsoft believes tightly controlling the design of both hardware and software can lead to superior consumer products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But building its own tablets and "hybrid" PCs puts Microsoft into direct competition against manufacturers like Hewlett-Packard, Acer and Lenovo, who for years have been customers of Microsoft's Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Noel Randewich; Additional reporting by Bill Rigby in Seattle; Editing by Chris Gallagher)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Walton Street Capital collected $60 million in fees on failed 
      CalWest Industrial Portfolio investment, UNITE HERE reports
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			A new report by UNITE HERE takes a closer look at the CalWest deal 
      and the fees Walton Street charged investors.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			In June 2012, Walton Street Capital handed its largest investment 
      ever, the $2.8 billion CalWest Industrial Portfolio, over to lenders. 
      Investors in the Walton Street funds that owned CalWest lost nearly half 
      of their investment (around $193 million) in the deal.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			A new 
      report by UNITE HERE takes a closer look at the CalWest 
      deal and the fees Walton Street charged investors.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Street recently disclosed that it had collected &#8220;slightly less 
      than $60 million&#8221; in fees on the CalWest Industrial Portfolio, more than 
      four and a half times (4.5X) Walton Street principals&#8217; $13 million 
      investment in the deal.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Street&#8217;s acquisition fee on CalWest would have been at least $26 
      million, meaning Walton Street principals had little downside risk on 
      CalWest from day one, while limited partners bore considerable risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Walton Street&#8217;s failed CalWest investment and aggressive 
      collection of fees recalls the failure of JMB Realty&#8217;s C$2.1 billion Cadillac 
      Fairview deal, in which investors including 39 pension 
      funds lost 80% of their investment while JMB Realty (predecessor to 
      Walton Street) generated C$275 million in fees.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Both deals raise questions about Walton Street&#8217;s commitment to interest 
      alignment between the General Partner and limited partners in its real 
      estate fund &#8211; i.e. whether the Walton Street principals should do well 
      even as investors suffer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With its new fund, Walton Street Real Estate Fund VII, Walton Street has 
      maintained the structures &#8211; an acquisition fee linked to equity and 
      debt, a high (80%) leverage cap, a low (2.25%) General Partner 
      commitment &#8211; that enabled it to collect $60 million on an investment 
      that lost $193 million of limited partners&#8217; capital.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Investors in the CalWest deal that have thus far not reinvested in 
      Walton Street&#8217;s new Fund VII include the Chicago Municipal Employees 
      Annuity and Benefit Fund, Chicago Teachers Pension Fund, Denver 
      Employees Retirement Plan, Houston Police Officers Pension System, 
      Illinois State Board of Investment, Los Angeles City Employees

			Coca-Cola &#8216;Recycle  Win&#8217; &#8211; Looking to Increase Metro Nashville 
      Recycling Rates Once Again
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Partnership Provides Public Incentive to Increase Recycling
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      It&#8217;s back and better than before. Metro Nashville in partnership with 
      Coca-Cola and Kroger are bringing back Recycle  Win &#8211; a proven &#8220;green&#8221; 
      initiative designed to increase recycling rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      After Metro Nashville Public Works introduced Coca-Cola Recycle  Win in 
      2011, recycling rates throughout the city increased. Now, Recycle  Win 
      is back as the city continues efforts to realize Nashville Mayor Karl 
      Dean&#8217;s goal of becoming one of the &#8220;greenest&#8221; cities in the Southeast. 
      Coca-Cola and Kroger have invested over $250,000 on the program&#8217;s 
      implementation in the Nashville market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To kick off the program, a Coca-Cola Recycle  Win educational packet 
      has been mailed to all single-family households in Nashville. The mailer 
      outlines the Do&#8217;s and Don&#8217;ts of recycling, along with instructions on 
      how to win a $50 Kroger gift card by placing a &#8220;Give it Back&#8221; sticker on 
      curbside recycling carts. To help residents understand which items are 
      accepted for recycling, an additional YES! sticker, with photos of 
      permitted recyclables, is also included in the mailer. Residents can 
      also have the chance to win a $10 Kroger gift card simply by going to www.cokerecycleandwin.com 
      and taking a pledge to recycle.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Programs such as &#8216;Recycle  Win&#8217; promote good environmental stewardship 
      and encourage recycling participation, which reduces the amount of 
      material destined for landfills,&#8221; Mayor Dean said. &#8220;Public-private 
      partnerships like this one helps Metro provide good services and stretch 
      tax dollars. &#8216;Recycle  Win&#8217; also provides our residents with vital 
      information and tips on proper recycling.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Bringing back the Recycle  Win program just made sense.&#8221; said Veronica 
      Frazier, Director of Metro Beautification and Environment. &#8220;The first 
      Recycle  Win program significantly raised awareness throughout the 
      county about the importance of recycling for both economic and 
      environmental reasons. And as we look to increase recycling rates and 
      participation, we believe the Coca-Cola Recycle  Win program can help 
      with this goal.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Coca-Cola is proud to once again sponsor the Recycle  Win initiative,&#8221; 
      said Lauren Steele, Vice President, Corporate Affairs, Coca-Cola 
      Bottling Company Consolidated. &#8220;It is more important than ever to 
      educate everyone on the importance of recycling and recycling properly. 
      We also believe that recycling should be a rewarding experience, and 
      what better way to encourage people to recycle than by giving them an 
      opportunity to be a winner!&#8221; Steele, a long-time proponent of recycling 
      added, &#8220;Recycle  Win enhances Nashville&#8217;s reputation as a leader in 
      this country&#8217;s sustainability efforts.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Recycle Win Street Team will begin patrolling for Recycle 
       Win stickers in early December and plans are to award ten (10) $50 
      Kroger Gift Cards a week for a total of 260 prizes over six months.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;At Kroger, we believe it is both our privilege and obligation to engage 
      in our communities, protect the environment and have a positive economic 
      impact. Over the years we&#8217;ve implemented numerous programs in all phases 
      of our operations designed to improve efficiencies and otherwise lessen 
      our impact on the environment," said Melissa Eads, Kroger Community 
      Affairs Manager. "Recycle  Win is a great program because it offers an 
      incentive for community members to develop positive recycling habits 
      while bringing additional attention to the importance of recycling. We 
      are proud to partner with Coca-Cola in this effort and thank Metro 
      Nashville Public Works for joining us as well."

&lt;p&gt;By Richard Beales
The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217; holy grail is becoming harder to reach  but less rewarding. The Wall Street firm named 70 new partners on Wednesday, the smallest biannual class since it went public in 1999. Fewer of the old guard are moving on and Goldman&#8217;s total headcount is shrinking. While a partnership is still a ticket to riches, lower profitability means it&#8217;s tougher to achieve and less of a bonanza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That won&#8217;t stop a few dozen nearly-men and nearly-women from feeling frustrated  110 top Goldmanites made the cut two years ago. But the total number of partners will remain about the same as a proportion of total headcount. At 32,600 at the end of September, that has shrunk 13 percent since two years ago. Another factor making new partnerships scarcer is that unhelpful market conditions have led more people to stay put rather than quitting for even grander jobs at rival firms or, say, to start hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old and new partners alike may also be nostalgic for the days when the serious wealth came more quickly. Goldman&#8217;s return on common equity in the two years to 2006, when it named 115 partners, averaged around 27 percent. A strong 2007 followed by the crisis year of 2008 brought an average ROE of 19 percent and 94 partners. By 2010 the two-year return had slipped to 17 percent, but the firm still named 110 partners. By comparison, the problem for this year&#8217;s cohort is stark. The return on equity averaged over last year and the first nine months of 2012 is running at just over 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ROE is not exactly a measure of what partners are paid, though it&#8217;s related. It&#8217;s more an indication of the amount of pressure on Goldman&#8217;s rainmakers to bring in more money for the firm and take less for themselves so that outside shareholders do better. Returning to past bonanzas looks tough: all banks must now carry more capital that five years ago, reducing returns. For the new arrivals in the top rank of Wall Street&#8217;s elite, that means harder work for less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;

			PremierConnect Wins IBM CTO Innovation Award for Advanced Analytics 
      in Healthcare
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Premier healthcare alliance&#8217;s integrated technology platform 
      allows providers to interactively network, benchmark patient outcomes 
      information and share best practices
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Premier healthcare alliance has received IBM&#8217;s 2012 CTO (Chief 
      Technology Officer) Innovation Award for PremierConnect&#8482;, 
      its integrated technology platform. Using PremierConnect, providers 
      benchmark patient level quality and financial outcomes data with 
      national standards and against one-another to make high-quality, 
      efficient care delivery decisions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Premier is the only organization to receive the CTO Innovation Award 
      this year, which recognizes organizations that create an innovative, 
      one-of-a-kind solution that extends the boundaries of current technology 
      usage and provides a new vision that others may follow.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Premier received the award at the 2012 IBM Information On Demand 
      Conference in Las Vegas. Keith J. Figlioli, Premier&#8217;s senior vice 
      president of healthcare informatics, described the power of Premier&#8217;s 
      partnership with IBM in building PremierConnect as a keynote speaker 
      during the conference&#8217;s general session.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PremierConnect turns data from 2,700 hospitals, 90,000 other care sites 
      and 400,000 physicians across Premier&#8217;s membership into meaningful 
      information. The platform accesses the nation&#8217;s largest outcomes 
      database, containing information from 1 in 4 U.S. hospital discharges, 
      2.5 million real-time clinical transactions daily and nearly $43 billion 
      in annual purchasing data. It also enables health systems to interact 
      within the world&#8217;s largest social healthcare network to share learnings 
      and accelerate the adoption of best practices that improve the health of 
      communities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Stakeholders across a health system can benefit from PremierConnect. For 
      example:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				A supply chain executive can make purchasing decisions based on 
        price, quality and safety information from thousands of outcomes. They 
        can interact with peers nationwide to get feedback on products they&#8217;re 
        considering for contracts and be alerted when new contracts are 
        launched to easily obtain best pricing.
      
			
				A physician or chief medical officer can monitor clinical 
        performance, understand practice variation, access patient level 
        detail and support government reporting requirements. This information 
        is clearly and simply presented and based on every diagnosis, 
        procedure and patient visit.
      
			
				An infection preventionist can be alerted to possible 
        harm-related events within their system through real-time 
        surveillance. They can also better coordinate care with other 
        departments, such as pharmacy, to ensure the proper drugs are 
        administered.
      
			
				A human resources executive can access staffing plans and 
        industry best practices to minimize inefficient processes that take 
        too long or require too many employees to complete, or instances when 
        higher paid employees do work that less expensive or experienced staff 
        could do equally well.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      PremierConnect is powered by IBM information management, business 
      analytics, enterprise content management, social business, Rational, 
      Tivoli and WebSphere software, as well as IBM Power Systems hardware to 
      provide insights from vast amounts of data.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Premier has placed among the nation&#8217;s 100 top technology innovators on 
      the InformationWeek 
      500 list for three years in a row. On the 2012 list, Premier ranked 
      30th overall, and third in the healthcare industry.

			RLJ Lodging Trust Enters the Boston Market &#8211; Acquires the Embassy 
      Suites Boston/Waltham
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RLJ Lodging Trust (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) (NYSE: RLJ) today announced that it 
      acquired the 275-room Embassy Suites Boston/Waltham (the &#8220;Hotel&#8221;), 
      through an off-market transaction, for a purchase price of $64.5 
      million, or approximately $235,000 per key. The purchase price 
      represents a forward capitalization rate of approximately 7.9% on the 
      hotel's projected 2013 net operating income. The Company purchased this 
      asset with cash available on its balance sheet.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are excited to enter the Boston market, one of the strongest 
      performing RevPAR hotel markets in the country,&#8221; commented Thomas J. 
      Baltimore, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer. &#8220;This hotel&#8217;s 
      recent conversion to an Embassy Suites has positioned this 
      centrally-located asset for exceptional growth.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Hotel went through an extensive $12-million brand conversion from a 
      DoubleTree Guest Suites to an Embassy Suites in 2011, one of only three 
      Embassy Suites in the greater Boston area. During the conversion, the 
      guest suites and the public spaces were also significantly upgraded.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The strength of this newly upgraded hotel in Boston&#8217;s premier Waltham 
      submarket is evident by the impressive performance it has generated in 
      2012. With more than 37% RevPAR growth already generated through 
      September, the Company expects that this hotel will continue to produce 
      outsized returns due to its recent brand conversion and its prime 
      location within this excellent market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Hotel&#8217;s prime location in Boston&#8217;s submarket of Waltham, provides 
      the Hotel with a wide variety of demand generators. Waltham&#8217;s economy is 
      heavily concentrated in education and high tech and is recognized as a 
      central hub for national and international biotech, technology, and 
      information system companies, such as Raytheon, IBM, Novell, and 
      Verizon. With more than 15 million square feet of office space in this 
      Boston submarket, the Hotel benefits from strong corporate demand. The 
      property itself is proximate to multiple corporate office parks and two 
      universities. Additionally, the Hotel&#8217;s all-suite product is an 
      attractive option to the more than 18 million leisure travelers that 
      visit the greater Boston area annually.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The acquisition of this premium-branded hotel is compliant with the 
      Company&#8217;s overall investment thesis. With the addition of this new 
      hotel, the Company now owns 145 hotels with more than 21,600 rooms 
      across 21 states and the District of Columbia.

&lt;p&gt;  BOSTON, MA, Nov 15 (Marketwire) -- 
Spindle Labs, Inc., whose mission is to make valuable social content more
discoverable, today announced the release of Spindle 1.1 in the iTunes
App Store. In a related announcement, Spindle Labs, Inc. has also raised
$2.3M in total funding from Polaris Ventures, Greylock Partners, Lerer
Ventures, SV Angel, Atlas Ventures, Broad Beach Ventures, Project 11, Ray
Ozzie and Raman Narayanan. 

    "We believe that social content represents the greatest untapped
opportunity on the web today," said Pat Kinsel, Founder and CEO, Spindle.
"The social web is now the most dynamic and authoritative source of news
and information. While the typical person sees updates from their roughly
250 friends, Spindle goes beyond the friend list to uncover the most
relevant and valuable updates from the billion other people, businesses,
and organizations sharing every day." 

    The premise and promise for Spindle is simple: The context now provided
by our mobile devices and social networks can compose a far richer query
than any keyword search ever could. By harvesting the social graph and
leveraging signals such as location and time of day, Spindle has built a
fundamentally new technology that knows what's happening around you and
delivers you great content.

    "What we're talking about is the ability to understand and assess how
interesting and useful any piece of content is to any person at any time
and place. Because Spindle is constantly improving its understanding of
your context, the opportunity to expand the universe of local queries is
endless," added Kinsel. 

    "Spindle is reimagining search to be social, mobile, and contextual at
its core. With a billion people and organizations sharing online, Spindle
has an enormous opportunity to connect people with content that can
satisfy any interest or inform any decision. They've created an entirely
new class of search relevance, evaluating an endless stream of content
with technology that leverages today's new signals: social, location, and
context," said Dave Barrett, General Partner, Polaris Ventures.

    "My favorite mobile apps are the ones that give you super powers --
Spindle's done a ton of work on both the user experience and the big data
back end to let you see all the things that are happening around you
right now," said John Lilly, Partner, Greylock Partners.

    Currently available in Boston and San Francisco with other major cities
soon to follow, Spindle combines the power and flexibility of search
technologies with location, time of day, the structure of the physical
world, the social graph, and attributes of each social update to answer a
common query -- "What's happening around me?" Currently there exists
three types of local discovery that try to answer this question:

    1. Place Lookup: i.e. Google Maps 
 2. Social Recommendations:
Foursquare, Ness, Yelp, etc. 
 3. Licensed Event Data

    Yet Spindle is about more than just surfacing great content and venues.
Unlike other tools that just reshuffle a static list of businesses,
Spindle is reinventing local discovery with real-time content evaluation.
Spindle evaluates what every business is sharing to determine what's
interesting and relevant now. Its recommendations are always fresh,
always dynamic, and often surprising. 

    Other Spindle features worth noting include:


--  User Profiles &amp; Sharing: You can now see your own activity and
    discover your friends' activity. You can tell friends where you're
    going, let them know when there's something happening in your current
    location, or point people to something cool you discovered via
    Facebook, Twitter, SMS and email.
--  Filter by Theme: You can choose a filter like Shopping, Restaurants or
    Nightlife to find just what you're looking for without the extra
    'noise.'
--  Favorites &amp; Likes: Add spots to your Favorites list and Spindle
    will tell you what's happening at just those places. Like posts to
    save them to your profile and share with your friends. Discover your
    friends' Likes in the activity feeds and on Facebook.
--  Place Search &amp; Location Selector: You can now search for a
    specific place by name to discover what's happening there, or use the
    map to zoom in on activity in a specific location.

they couldn't otherwise discover. Through the Spindle app consumers can

		&lt;p&gt;
      Barneys New York, the luxury specialty retailer, and The Walt Disney 
      Company, the world&#8217;s leading entertainment company, launched the 2012 
      Holiday project Electric Holiday at the Barneys New York Madison 
      Avenue flagship store. A multi-platform initiative infused with fashion 
      and fantasy, Electric Holiday merges the creativity and magic of 
      Disney with the wit and surprise of the legendary Barneys New York 
      annual holiday project to create a celebration of festive modern 
      electric lights, music and fashion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Disney is proud to be part of New York&#8217;s holiday magic this year,&#8221; said 
      Robert A. Iger, chairman and chief executive officer of The Walt Disney 
      Company. &#8220;Together with Barneys, we&#8217;ve created a one-of-a-kind 
      experience that combines Disney&#8217;s great characters and storytelling with 
      high fashion for a spectacular celebration of the season.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of the Electric Holiday program, 25% of sales from the 
      limited-edition Electric Holiday product collection sold at select 
      Barneys stores and Barneys.com will be donated to the American Red 
      Cross. This is in addition to the
			$2 million dollars The Walt 
      Disney Company has already pledged to support relief efforts, including 
      $1 million to the Red Cross for immediate relief and an additional $1 
      million to support rebuilding efforts in Hurricane Sandy affected 
      communities. In addition, Disney/ABC Television Group organized&#160;a 
      national "Day of Giving" on Nov. 6, 2012, seamlessly integrating 
      outreach messaging across various&#160;programming and raising more than $18 
      million dollars for the American Red Cross.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			THE ELECTRIC HOLIDAY WINDOWS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Electric Holiday program and the Madison Avenue flagship&#8217;s 
      windows were unveiled featuring &#8216;Electric Holiday&#8217;, a moving art 
      video starring Minnie Mouse on a fun, fabulous fashion adventure in 
      Paris, along with an array of notable fashion personalities and Disney 
      characters.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Disney is a magical brand and Barneys New York is a surprising brand. 
      We feel we&#8217;ve captured both the magic and the surprise with this holiday 
      project&#8221; said Mark Lee, Barneys New York CEO. &#8220;It has been a dream to 
      collaborate with Disney and we at Barneys are grateful that they found 
      it intriguing to mix characters from our different worlds in this way.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Capturing the essence of the highly stylized fashion world along with 
      the electrically-charged colors and brilliant lights of the magical 
      world of Disney, the video begins with Minnie dreaming of the glamour of 
      Paris. In her dream, she is whisked away to the City of Light, where she 
      comes face to face with revered fashion personalities and takes the 
      runway along with Mickey Mouse, Daisy Duck, and more in fabulous 
      designer fashions. The storyline concludes happily when Minnie wakes up 
      and Mickey presents her with the same designer dress she has just 
      sported in her dream on the catwalk.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The moving art video was conceived to be a playful interpretation of the 
      high fashion world, and will screen for a six-week period in the Madison 
      Avenue windows, as well as in Barneys flagship stores across the 
      country. To help bring the show to life, Oscar&#174;-winning composer Michael 
      Giacchino has created an original score. The video is exclusively on 
      Barneys.com, Disney.com and AOL.com.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Bolivia enjoys growth, relative calm under leftist Evo
Morales&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Returns to global debt markets as commodities exports soar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Shopping malls, cinemas open to meet new consumer demand&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Simmering unrest, poverty remain major challenges&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Helen Popper&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EL ALTO, Bolivia, Nov 15 (Reuters) - A chaotic sprawl high
in the Andes, the Bolivian city of El Alto has a fearsome
reputation for altitude sickness, poverty and violent uprisings
that topple governments. No wonder many businesses stayed away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But years of economic growth and relative stability are
changing attitudes as well as fortunes in one of Latin America's
poorest and most volatile nations. Entrepreneurs are even waking
up to El Alto's potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its first supermarkets, shopping centers and cinemas are
planned -- multimillion-dollar private sector investments that
would have been unthinkable almost anywhere in Bolivia a decade
ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks and pizza delivery stores have set up shop in the
city's stark, traffic-choked streets and its bare brick
buildings are climbing higher into the thin air as local
commerce thrives 4,050 meters (13,300 feet) above sea level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People hardly bought anything in the past. With this
government there's business," said Alicia Villalba, 33, selling
Brazilian-made aluminum pans at a twice-weekly market where
everything from livestock to second-hand cars is on sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just hope the economy keeps on growing so I'm able to
look after my family," she said as a woman wearing the
traditional dress of a wide pleated skirt and bowler hat bought
a full set of pots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About $2 million changes hands at the market every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SIGNS OF CHANGE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven years since they helped elect leftist coca farmer Evo
Morales as Bolivia's first president of indigenous descent,
there are subtle signs of change among El Alto's mainly Aymara
Indian population too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"El Alto was always where conflicts kicked off. Why? Because
people had nothing to lose. That's not the case today," said
Alejandro Yaffar, a prominent businessman who owns a new
fast-food court in El Alto and has two more retail projects
planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People have opened their eyes to a new way of life," he
said in his office in the adjoining city of La Paz, Bolivia's
administrative capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much remains to be done, however. Heaps of garbage and packs
of stray dogs blight the bleak urban landscape. Water and
drainage are inadequate, and local businesses complain about
rising crime and scant policing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public infrastructure projects have struggled to meet the
fast-growing city's needs or the expectations of residents and
some are disappointed with Morales and the pace of change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Here in El Alto we all voted for him, myself included,"
said Nora Villeros, 65, her long braids streaked with gray, as
she sat in front of her busy store selling colorful bathroom
tiles and fittings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He promised us miracles but the first couple of years went
by and then he forgot about us," she said, complaining that
Morales had favored members of his Movement Toward Socialism
party (MAS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of El Alto's residents are self-employed and resist
efforts by authorities to increase tax revenue by cracking down
on contraband goods. That means protests and roadblocks are
still a regular occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'MORE WORK, MORE MONEY'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Alto is not the only place that is changing in Bolivia, a
landlocked country of about 10 million that sits on South
America's s e cond-biggest natural gas reserves and rich deposits
of silver, tin, zinc and other metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In La Paz, which lies in a crater-like valley below El Alto,
low unemployment and affordable credit are fueling a
construction boom and consumers feel unusually well off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's more work and more money around. I think people are
living better than they were six years ago," said Marco Arkaza,
33, a bank employee as he strolled in one of two new cinema and
shopping complexes in La Paz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People have greater purchasing power. Young people and the
middle class have enough money to come to places likes this
now," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After seven years of economic growth averaging 4.7 percent a
year, Bolivia joined the World Bank's list of lower
middle-income countries in 2010. The ranking allows more credit
access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government officials say up to a million Bolivians have
entered middle-class ranks under Morales. They credit policies
such as welfare payments for school children and pensioners for
lifting almost a million more out of extreme poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, 38 percent of Bolivians lived in extreme poverty,
data from the state-run INE national statistics shows. That has
fallen to about 25 percent though nearly half of Bolivians are
still poor, according to the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some sectors have done better than others. Critics say a
disproportionate amount of public money has been poured into the
steamy Chapare region that is home to much of Bolivia's illegal
coca crops and a stronghold of Morales support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mining cooperatives have won significant political
concessions from Morales and a few have grown rich due to
soaring global metals prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mining cities like Oruro and Potosi, famous for the Cerro
Rico (Rich Mountain) of colonial times, newspapers carry stories
of miners-turned-millionaires and fantastic earnings luring
fortune seekers from other parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most of the cooperative miners scrape a living working
in dangerous and precarious conditions, a few have become
wealthy enough to buy expensive cars and invest in real estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This amazing mining boom has helped develop markets in
places no one ever would have imagined," said Christian Eduardo,
president of the CADECO construction industry chamber in La Paz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Construction activity has been growing at an average of
about 10 percent per year since 2007, forcing the over-stretched
local cement industry to meet demand with Peruvian imports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FISCAL CONSERVATIVE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the surprise of his detractors, Morales -- an ally of
Venezuela's Hugo Chavez who shares his penchant for fiery
leftist rhetoric -- has proved a fiscal conservative. The
country is expected to register its seventh-straight annual
fiscal surplus in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morales, 53, has nationalized areas of the economy from the
vital natural gas industry to telecommunications companies and
tin smelters, but he has also let the central bank's foreign
reserves swell to record levels and warded off the scourge of
high inflation that battered Bolivia in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economy is expected to grow more quickly than many of
its wealthier neighbors this year and should maintain a healthy
5 percent expansion in 2013, according to the latest
International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bolivia is no longer a country with a weak economy,"
Economy Minister Luis Arce said last month after the nation sold
its first global bonds in almost a century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most analysts said the interest rate of less than 5 percent
was low considering Morales' record of nationalizing companies,
often without prior notice or paying compensation, and it has
proved an unlikely public relations success for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The interesting thing is that Bolivia sold the bonds at
half the rate paid by Venezuela. That's an important message to
the world," said Horst Grebe, director of La Paz-based research
institute, Prisma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The problem is that Bolivia's biggest growth is in its
macroeconomic numbers. What we're not seeing is a transformation
of the productive economy that is sustainable in the long term."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bolivia remains acutely dependent on exports of
non-renewable raw materials. Natural gas and metals accounted
for 87 percent of last year's record $9.1 billion export
earnings, said Gary Rodriguez of the Bolivian Foreign Trade
Institute (IBCE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'DRUNK ON POWER'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as Wall Street economists laud Morales' macroeconomic
policies as prudent, critics at home say he betrayed supporters
by watering down policy pledges and pandering to big business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since the Spanish arrived 500 years ago we'd never had an
Indian president. It was the people's dream and we thought
things would be different. But six years on, he's dishonored
us," said long-time indigenous activist Felipe Quispe, known as
El Mallku, the "Condor" or "authority" in Aymara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With six years and 10 months in the job, Morales has held
Bolivia's presidency for the longest unbroken period of any
elected leader. An opinion poll conducted last month by Ipsos
Bolivia put his approval rating at 53 percent in urban areas and
69 percent in the countryside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite his continuing domination of the political
scene, Morales has lost his initial aura of invincibility since
some allies turned against him over an Amazon highway plan and a
fuel price hike two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government critics from the left and the right would like to
see strong challengers emerge in time for a 2014 presidential
election in which Morales has hinted he may seek a third term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The government's made a lot of mistakes ... they've got
drunk on power," Quispe said, accusing Morales of seeking to
stifle media criticism and control the judiciary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In El Alto, several large state infrastructure projects,
such as a $234 million cable car system and a double-lane
highway to Oruro, should be ready in time for the election. They
are unlikely to satisfy growing expectations, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's been a lot of investment in the city but it hasn't
been enough yet," said Javier Ajno, president of the powerful
FEJUVE neighborhood federation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FEJUVE was a protagonist in the so-called Gas War that led
to the ouster of former President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada in
2003 and the protests that drove Carlos Mesa from office two
years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ajno said El Alto's rebellious spirit was still very much
alive, but that for now there is broad support for Morales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"El Alto has been the cradle of this process of change ...
we've carried an Indian to the presidency and people still
believe in this process," he said. "We've definitely still got a
long way to go, but in five or 10 years this will be the city of
the future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. federal regulators temporarily banned JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's energy trading arm from a segment of the domestic power market, the first time such a penalty has been imposed for making factual misrepresentations during an investigation into market manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move will prevent the U.S. bank from receiving competitive market prices for physical power it sells for six months starting in April 2013, though it will still be able to sell the power at cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's serious punishment because, clearly, they can't profit from that business," Susan Court, former chief of enforcement at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), said in an interview. JPMorgan, she said, was also the "most notable company" she could think of that had been dealt such a punishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's ability to trade derivatives, futures, natural gas and other commodities will not be impacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision came just months after a major derivatives trading scandal rocked JPMorgan and left it with some $6.2 billion in losses from bad bets on corporate debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC dealt the punishment to JPMorgan after a months-long investigation into complaints that JPMorgan traders may have manipulated electricity prices in California and the Midwest by some $73 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In investigating the complaint, FERC said the JPMorgan unit, JP Morgan Ventures Energy Corp, "made factual misrepresentations and omitted material information" in filings to the commission and statements to California power authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That, alone, was enough to take away the company's right to trade electricity at so-called market-based rates, FERC said, because "the Commission grants market-based rate authority to companies on the presumption that they will not engage in fraud, deception or misrepresentation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan disagreed with the decision, which drew one dissenting vote on the commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As the dissenting Commissioner stated, this is a novel use of FERC's authority over market-based rates and is unsupported by FERC's own regulations," JPMorgan spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli said in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that the bank is reviewing FERC's opinion and will determine its next steps prior to the proposed April 2013 effective date for the market-based authority revocation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market-based rates allow power traders like JPMorgan to sell electricity at whatever prices the market will bear. If electricity traders lose the authority to trade at market-based rates, they must trade at much lower cost-based or other rates, hurting their trading profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The punishment against JP Morgan brought back memories of the Enron-driven California energy crisis of 2001 for some consumer advocates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first time I can remember, since Enron, that a major market player has had its market-based rate authority removed," said Tyson Slocum, director of the energy program at Public Citizen, a Washington DC-based consumer advocacy group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC gained expanded powers to tackle market manipulation in 2005 thanks largely to the fallout from Enron's meltdown. It has since used that power to pursue market manipulation charges against companies, including BP, Barclays PLC and Deutsche Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC's order against JPMorgan does not find the bank committed fraud. The bank apologized to FERC in October and said it had simply made an inadvertent mistake in not providing certain information to the commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Slocum lauded the decision, saying "this is going to send a clear signal that lying and cheating cannot be tolerated in electricity markets".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DISSENTING OPINION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all five FERC commissioners were in agreement to reduce the JPMorgan's ability to trade power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a dissent, FERC Commissioner Cheryl LaFleur said JPMorgan's alleged misrepresentations do not relate to its conduct in the market, but are instead litigation positions that pertain to whether it had the obligation to provide documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I believe the statements should be addressed as part of the ongoing investigation into JPMorgan's bidding activities, either as separate counts of obstruction, or as aggravating circumstances that factor into the determination of any civil penalty," LaFleur said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission's decision to proceed with the suspension represents a novel use of its authority over market-based rates, and is unsupported by its own regulations, she added - words echoed by JPMorgan in its objection to the punishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LaFleur also said the Commission was establishing a new and potentially dangerous precedent: "An entity can lose its market-based rate authority for litigation positions it takes before the Commission or Commission Staff, even if those positions do not relate to its activity or honesty in the market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JP Morgan may well face the loss of its market-based rate authority as a consequence of the pending investigation. But if so, it should be because of its conduct in the market, not because of a dispute over document production," she concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OTHER BANKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Norman Bay joined FERC as it enforcement chief in June 2009, the agency has accused several big banks of manipulating power markets, mostly in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late October, the commission demanded British bank Barclays demonstrate why it should not pay a $435 million civil penalty, plus $34.9 million to repay ill-gotten gains, for manipulation of California power markets between 2006 and 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays has said it will vigorously fight the FERC charges, likely setting the stage for a landmark court battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a month earlier, FERC staff asked Deutsche Bank to explain why the commission should not fine the German bank's trading arm $1.5 million and give up $123,198 in profits for allegedly manipulating the California power market in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank said in a response in November it would fight the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* JPMorgan penalty to last 6 months starting April 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* One Commissioner dissents, says FERC starts new precedent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* FERC alleges market manipulation by other banks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Cezary Podkul and Scott DiSavino&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Nov 15 (Reuters) - U.S. federal regulators
temporarily banned JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's energy trading
arm from a segment of the domestic power market, the first time

punishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's ability to trade derivatives, futures, natural
gas and other commodities will not be impacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision came just months after a major derivatives
trading scandal rocked JPMorgan and left it with some $6.2
billion in losses from bad bets on corporate debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC dealt the punishment to JPMorgan after a months-long
investigation into complaints that JPMorgan traders may have
manipulated electricity prices in California and the Midwest by
some $73 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In investigating the complaint, FERC said the JPMorgan unit,
JP Morgan Ventures Energy Corp, "made factual misrepresentations
and omitted material information" in filings to the commission
and statements to California power authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That, alone, was enough to take away the company's right to
trade electricity at so-called market-based rates, FERC said,
because "the Commission grants market-based rate authority to
companies on the presumption that they will not engage in fraud,
deception or misrepresentation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan disagreed with the decision, which drew one
dissenting vote on the commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As the dissenting Commissioner stated, this is a novel use
of FERC's authority over market-based rates and is unsupported
by FERC's own regulations," JPMorgan spokeswoman Jennifer
Zuccarelli said in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that the bank is reviewing FERC's opinion and will
determine its next steps prior to the proposed April 2013
effective date for the market-based authority revocation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market-based rates allow power traders like JPMorgan to sell
electricity at whatever prices the market will bear. If
electricity traders lose the authority to trade at market-based
rates, they must trade at much lower cost-based or other rates,
hurting their trading profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The punishment against JP Morgan brought back memories of
the Enron-driven California energy crisis of 2001 for some
consumer advocates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first time I can remember, since Enron, that a
major market player has had its market-based rate authority
removed," said Tyson Slocum, director of the energy program at
Public Citizen, a Washington DC-based consumer advocacy group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC gained expanded powers to tackle market manipulation in
2005 thanks largely to the fallout from Enron's meltdown. It has
since used that power to pursue market manipulation charges
against companies, including BP, Barclays PLC 
and Deutsche Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC's order against JPMorgan does not find the bank
committed fraud. The bank apologized to FERC in October and said
it had simply made an inadvertent mistake in not providing
certain information to the commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Slocum lauded the decision, saying "this is going to
send a clear signal that lying and cheating cannot be tolerated
in electricity markets".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DISSENTING OPINION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all five FERC commissioners were in agreement to reduce
the JPMorgan's ability to trade power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a dissent, FERC Commissioner Cheryl LaFleur said
JPMorgan's alleged misrepresentations do not relate to its
conduct in the market, but are instead litigation positions that
pertain to whether it had the obligation to provide documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I believe the statements should be addressed as part of the
ongoing investigation into JPMorgan's b idding activities, either
as separate counts of obstruction, or as aggravating
circumstances that factor into the determination of any civil
penalty," LaFleur said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission's decision to proceed with the suspension
represents a novel use of its authority over market-based rates,
and is unsupported by its own regulations, she added - words
echoed by JPMorgan in its objection to the punishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LaFleur also said the Commission was establishing a new and
potentially dangerous precedent: "An entity can lose its
market-based rate authority for litigation positions it takes
before the Commission or Commission Staff, even if those
positions do not relate to its activity or honesty in the
market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JP Morgan may well face the loss of its market-based rate
authority as a consequence of the pending investigation. But if
so, it should be because of its conduct in the market, not
because of a dispute over document production," she concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OTHER BANKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Norman Bay joined FERC as it enforcement chief in June
2009, the agency has accused several big banks of manipulating
power markets, mostly in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late October, the commission demanded British bank
Barclays demonstrate why it should not pay a $435 million civil
penalty, plus $34.9 million to repay ill-gotten gains, for
manipulation of California power markets between 2006 and 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays has said it will vigorously fight the FERC charges,
likely setting the stage for a landmark court battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a month earlier, FERC staff asked Deutsche Bank to
explain why the commission should not fine the German bank's
trading arm $1.5 million and give up $123,198 in profits for
allegedly manipulating the California power market in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank said in a response in November it would fight
the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EL ALTO, Bolivia (Reuters) - A chaotic sprawl high in the Andes, the Bolivian city of El Alto has a fearsome reputation for altitude sickness, poverty and violent uprisings that topple governments. No wonder many businesses stayed away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But years of economic growth and relative stability are changing attitudes as well as fortunes in one of Latin America's poorest and most volatile nations. Entrepreneurs are even waking up to El Alto's potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its first supermarkets, shopping centers and cinemas are planned -- multimillion-dollar private sector investments that would have been unthinkable almost anywhere in Bolivia a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks and pizza delivery stores have set up shop in the city's stark, traffic-choked streets and its bare brick buildings are climbing higher into the thin air as local commerce thrives 4,050 meters (13,300 feet) above sea level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People hardly bought anything in the past. With this government there's business," said Alicia Villalba, 33, selling Brazilian-made aluminum pans at a twice-weekly market where everything from livestock to second-hand cars is on sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just hope the economy keeps on growing so I'm able to look after my family," she said as a woman wearing the traditional dress of a wide pleated skirt and bowler hat bought a full set of pots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About $2 million changes hands at the market every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SIGNS OF CHANGE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven years since they helped elect leftist coca farmer Evo Morales as Bolivia's first president of indigenous descent, there are subtle signs of change among El Alto's mainly Aymara Indian population too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"El Alto was always where conflicts kicked off. Why? Because people had nothing to lose. That's not the case today," said Alejandro Yaffar, a prominent businessman who owns a new fast-food court in El Alto and has two more retail projects planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People have opened their eyes to a new way of life," he said in his office in the adjoining city of La Paz, Bolivia's administrative capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much remains to be done, however. Heaps of garbage and packs of stray dogs blight the bleak urban landscape. Water and drainage are inadequate, and local businesses complain about rising crime and scant policing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public infrastructure projects have struggled to meet the fast-growing city's needs or the expectations of residents and some are disappointed with Morales and the pace of change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Here in El Alto we all voted for him, myself included," said Nora Villeros, 65, her long braids streaked with gray, as she sat in front of her busy store selling colorful bathroom tiles and fittings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He promised us miracles but the first couple of years went by and then he forgot about us," she said, complaining that Morales had favored members of his Movement Toward Socialism party (MAS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of El Alto's residents are self-employed and resist efforts by authorities to increase tax revenue by cracking down on contraband goods. That means protests and roadblocks are still a regular occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'MORE WORK, MORE MONEY'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Alto is not the only place that is changing in Bolivia, a landlocked country of about 10 million that sits on South America's second-biggest natural gas reserves and rich deposits of silver, tin, zinc and other metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In La Paz, which lies in a crater-like valley below El Alto, low unemployment and affordable credit are fueling a construction boom and consumers feel unusually well off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's more work and more money around. I think people are living better than they were six years ago," said Marco Arkaza, 33, a bank employee as he strolled in one of two new cinema and shopping complexes in La Paz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People have greater purchasing power. Young people and the middle class have enough money to come to places likes this now," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After seven years of economic growth averaging 4.7 percent a year, Bolivia joined the World Bank's list of lower middle-income countries in 2010. The ranking allows more credit access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government officials say up to a million Bolivians have entered middle-class ranks under Morales. They credit policies such as welfare payments for school children and pensioners for lifting almost a million more out of extreme poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, 38 percent of Bolivians lived in extreme poverty, data from the state-run INE national statistics shows. That has fallen to about 25 percent though nearly half of Bolivians are still poor, according to the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some sectors have done better than others. Critics say a disproportionate amount of public money has been poured into the steamy Chapare region that is home to much of Bolivia's illegal coca crops and a stronghold of Morales support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mining cooperatives have won significant political concessions from Morales and a few have grown rich due to soaring global metals prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mining cities like Oruro and Potosi, famous for the Cerro Rico (Rich Mountain) of colonial times, newspapers carry stories of miners-turned-millionaires and fantastic earnings luring fortune seekers from other parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most of the cooperative miners scrape a living working in dangerous and precarious conditions, a few have become wealthy enough to buy expensive cars and invest in real estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This amazing mining boom has helped develop markets in places no one ever would have imagined," said Christian Eduardo, president of the CADECO construction industry chamber in La Paz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Construction activity has been growing at an average of about 10 percent per year since 2007, forcing the over-stretched local cement industry to meet demand with Peruvian imports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FISCAL CONSERVATIVE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the surprise of his detractors, Morales -- an ally of Venezuela's Hugo Chavez who shares his penchant for fiery leftist rhetoric -- has proved a fiscal conservative. The country is expected to register its seventh-straight annual fiscal surplus in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morales, 53, has nationalized areas of the economy from the vital natural gas industry to telecommunications companies and tin smelters, but he has also let the central bank's foreign reserves swell to record levels and warded off the scourge of high inflation that battered Bolivia in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economy is expected to grow more quickly than many of its wealthier neighbors this year and should maintain a healthy 5 percent expansion in 2013, according to the latest International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bolivia is no longer a country with a weak economy," Economy Minister Luis Arce said last month after the nation sold its first global bonds in almost a century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most analysts said the interest rate of less than 5 percent was low considering Morales' record of nationalizing companies, often without prior notice or paying compensation, and it has proved an unlikely public relations success for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The interesting thing is that Bolivia sold the bonds at half the rate paid by Venezuela. That's an important message to the world," said Horst Grebe, director of La Paz-based research institute, Prisma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The problem is that Bolivia's biggest growth is in its macroeconomic numbers. What we're not seeing is a transformation of the productive economy that is sustainable in the long term."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bolivia remains acutely dependent on exports of non-renewable raw materials. Natural gas and metals accounted for 87 percent of last year's record $9.1 billion export earnings, said Gary Rodriguez of the Bolivian Foreign Trade Institute (IBCE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'DRUNK ON POWER'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as Wall Street economists laud Morales' macroeconomic policies as prudent, critics at home say he betrayed supporters by watering down policy pledges and pandering to big business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since the Spanish arrived 500 years ago we'd never had an Indian president. It was the people's dream and we thought things would be different. But six years on, he's dishonored us," said long-time indigenous activist Felipe Quispe, known as El Mallku, the "Condor" or "authority" in Aymara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With six years and 10 months in the job, Morales has held Bolivia's presidency for the longest unbroken period of any elected leader. An opinion poll conducted last month by Ipsos Bolivia put his approval rating at 53 percent in urban areas and 69 percent in the countryside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite his continuing domination of the political scene, Morales has lost his initial aura of invincibility since some allies turned against him over an Amazon highway plan and a fuel price hike two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government critics from the left and the right would like to see strong challengers emerge in time for a 2014 presidential election in which Morales has hinted he may seek a third term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The government's made a lot of mistakes ... they've got drunk on power," Quispe said, accusing Morales of seeking to stifle media criticism and control the judiciary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In El Alto, several large state infrastructure projects, such as a $234 million cable car system and a double-lane highway to Oruro, should be ready in time for the election. They are unlikely to satisfy growing expectations, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's been a lot of investment in the city but it hasn't been enough yet," said Javier Ajno, president of the powerful FEJUVE neighborhood federation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FEJUVE was a protagonist in the so-called Gas War that led to the ouster of former President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada in 2003 and the protests that drove Carlos Mesa from office two years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ajno said El Alto's rebellious spirit was still very much alive, but that for now there is broad support for Morales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"El Alto has been the cradle of this process of change ... we've carried an Indian to the presidency and people still believe in this process," he said. "We've definitely still got a long way to go, but in five or 10 years this will be the city of the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Kieran Murray and Lisa Shumaker)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SANTA CLARA, California Nov 14 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's
 chief executive said his company would look at more
opportunities to build its own devices, after the launch of its
Surface tablet last month, potentially bringing the software
giant into competition with its hardware partners and opening
the door to a Microsoft-branded phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Do I anticipate that partners of ours will build the lion's
share of all Windows devices over the next five years? The
answer is, absolutely," Steve Ballmer said at a tech industry
event in Santa Clara, California, on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With that said, it is absolutely clear that there is an
innovation opportunity on the scene between hardware and
software and that is a scene that must not go unexploited at all
by Microsoft," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Xbox game console and now the Surface tablet --
designed to take on Apple Inc's iPad -- Ballmer has
been moving Microsoft toward being a "devices and services"
company that would develop its own hardware where it made sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports surfaced two weeks ago that Microsoft was already
testing a design for its own phone, but the company has not
confirmed anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's new Surface tablet is the company's first foray
into building its own PCs and has raised questions in the tech
industry about how aggressively it plans to move into marketing
more of its own personal computing devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking to Apple's success with its iPads and iPhones,
Microsoft believes tightly controlling the design of both
hardware and software can lead to superior consumer products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But building its own tablets and "hybrid" PCs puts Microsoft
into direct competition against manufacturers like
Hewlett-Packard, Acer and Lenovo,
who for years have been customers of Microsoft's Windows
operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) and Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.VX) will pay a combined $416.9 million to settle U.S. civil charges that they misled investors in the sale of risky mortgage bonds prior to the 2008 financial crisis, regulators said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will pay $296.9 million, while Credit Suisse will pay $120 million in a separate case, with the money going to harmed investors, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both settlements addressed alleged negligence or other wrongdoing in the packaging and sale of risky residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), including at the former Bear Stearns Cos which JPMorgan bought in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banks settled without admitting wrongdoing, and in separate statements said they were pleased to settle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In many ways, mortgage products such as RMBS were ground zero in the financial crisis," SEC enforcement chief Robert Khuzami said in a statement. "Misrepresentations in connection with the creation and sale of mortgage securities contributed greatly to the tremendous losses suffered by investors once the U.S. housing market collapsed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO INDIVIDUALS CHARGED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each settlement is significantly less than the $550 million that Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) agreed to pay in 2010, also without admitting wrongdoing, to settle SEC charges that it misled investors in a complex mortgage bond transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are also the latest SEC settlements not to punish individuals. In July, the SEC lost its first financial crisis-related trial against an individual when a Manhattan federal jury cleared former Citigroup Inc (C.N) mid-tier executive Brian Stoker of wrongdoing in the sale of a mortgage bond transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a conference call with reporters, Khuzami said it is hard to bring cases against individuals over "structured" financial transactions because different people work on different aspects, making it hard to pin blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We by no means are shying away from charging individuals where we find we can identify them as being responsible," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enforcement actions are the second and third from a "working group" of federal and state agencies created this year by President Barack Obama to investigate misconduct related to RMBS that contributed to the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who like Khuzami is a co-chair of the group, filed a still-pending civil fraud lawsuit against JPMorgan over Bear's packaging and sale of mortgage securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khuzami told reporters on the conference call that the working group is probing other RMBS transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares closed up 14 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $39.53 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The JPMorgan accord requires approval by a federal judge in Washington, D.C., while Credit Suisse's case was resolved in an SEC administrative proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had in June 2011 agreed to pay $153.6 million to settle a separate SEC fraud case over its sale of mortgage securities to investors, also without admitting wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Freedland, a spokesman for Schneiderman, said Friday's SEC accords help provide "accountability" for misconduct linked to the housing market's collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Citigroup case, that bank had agreed last year to pay $285 million to settle with the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan rejected that accord, saying he could not tell if it was fair because the bank did not have to admit or deny liability. The SEC and Citigroup have asked a federal appeals court to overturn his decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases are SEC v.

by President Barack Obama to investigate misconduct related to
RMBS that contributed to the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who

Suisse's case was resolved in an SEC administrative proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had in June 2011 agreed to pay $153.6 million to
settle a separate SEC fraud case over its sale of mortgage
securities to investors, also without admitting wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Freedland, a spokesman for Schneiderman, said Friday's
SEC accords help provide "accountability" for misconduct linked
to the housing market's collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Citigroup case, that bank had agreed last year to pay
$285 million to settle with the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan rejected that
accord, saying he could not tell if it was fair because the bank
did not have to admit or deny liability. The SEC and Citigroup
have asked a federal appeals court to overturn his decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases are SEC v. JPMorgan Securities LLC et al, U.S.
District Court, District of Columbia, No. 12-01862; and In re:

&lt;p&gt;EL ALTO, Bolivia (Reuters) - A chaotic sprawl high in the Andes, the Bolivian city of El Alto has a fearsome reputation for altitude sickness, poverty and violent uprisings that topple governments. No wonder many businesses stayed away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But years of economic growth and relative stability are changing attitudes as well as fortunes in one of Latin America's poorest and most volatile nations. Entrepreneurs are even waking up to El Alto's potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its first supermarkets, shopping centers and cinemas are planned -- multimillion-dollar private sector investments that would have been unthinkable almost anywhere in Bolivia a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks and pizza delivery stores have set up shop in the city's stark, traffic-choked streets and its bare brick buildings are climbing higher into the thin air as local commerce thrives 4,050 meters (13,300 feet) above sea level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People hardly bought anything in the past. With this government there's business," said Alicia Villalba, 33, selling Brazilian-made aluminum pans at a twice-weekly market where everything from livestock to second-hand cars is on sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just hope the economy keeps on growing so I'm able to look after my family," she said as a woman wearing the traditional dress of a wide pleated skirt and bowler hat bought a full set of pots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About $2 million changes hands at the market every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SIGNS OF CHANGE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven years since they helped elect leftist coca farmer Evo Morales as Bolivia's first president of indigenous descent, there are subtle signs of change among El Alto's mainly Aymara Indian population too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"El Alto was always where conflicts kicked off. Why? Because people had nothing to lose. That's not the case today," said Alejandro Yaffar, a prominent businessman who owns a new fast-food court in El Alto and has two more retail projects planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People have opened their eyes to a new way of life," he said in his office in the adjoining city of La Paz, Bolivia's administrative capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much remains to be done, however. Heaps of garbage and packs of stray dogs blight the bleak urban landscape. Water and drainage are inadequate, and local businesses complain about rising crime and scant policing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public infrastructure projects have struggled to meet the fast-growing city's needs or the expectations of residents and some are disappointed with Morales and the pace of change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Here in El Alto we all voted for him, myself included," said Nora Villeros, 65, her long braids streaked with gray, as she sat in front of her busy store selling colorful bathroom tiles and fittings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He promised us miracles but the first couple of years went by and then he forgot about us," she said, complaining that Morales had favored members of his Movement Toward Socialism party (MAS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of El Alto's residents are self-employed and resist efforts by authorities to increase tax revenue by cracking down on contraband goods. That means protests and roadblocks are still a regular occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'MORE WORK, MORE MONEY'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Alto is not the only place that is changing in Bolivia, a landlocked country of about 10 million that sits on South America's second-biggest natural gas reserves and rich deposits of silver, tin, zinc and other metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In La Paz, which lies in a crater-like valley below El Alto, low unemployment and affordable credit are fueling a construction boom and consumers feel unusually well off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's more work and more money around. I think people are living better than they were six years ago," said Marco Arkaza, 33, a bank employee as he strolled in one of two new cinema and shopping complexes in La Paz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People have greater purchasing power. Young people and the middle class have enough money to come to places likes this now," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After seven years of economic growth averaging 4.7 percent a year, Bolivia joined the World Bank's list of lower middle-income countries in 2010. The ranking allows more credit access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government officials say up to a million Bolivians have entered middle-class ranks under Morales. They credit policies such as welfare payments for school children and pensioners for lifting almost a million more out of extreme poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, 38 percent of Bolivians lived in extreme poverty, data from the state-run INE national statistics shows. That has fallen to about 25 percent though nearly half of Bolivians are still poor, according to the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some sectors have done better than others. Critics say a disproportionate amount of public money has been poured into the steamy Chapare region that is home to much of Bolivia's illegal coca crops and a stronghold of Morales support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mining cooperatives have won significant political concessions from Morales and a few have grown rich due to soaring global metals prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mining cities like Oruro and Potosi, famous for the Cerro Rico (Rich Mountain) of colonial times, newspapers carry stories of miners-turned-millionaires and fantastic earnings luring fortune seekers from other parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most of the cooperative miners scrape a living working in dangerous and precarious conditions, a few have become wealthy enough to buy expensive cars and invest in real estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This amazing mining boom has helped develop markets in places no one ever would have imagined," said Christian Eduardo, president of the CADECO construction industry chamber in La Paz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Construction activity has been growing at an average of about 10 percent per year since 2007, forcing the over-stretched local cement industry to meet demand with Peruvian imports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FISCAL CONSERVATIVE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the surprise of his detractors, Morales -- an ally of Venezuela's Hugo Chavez who shares his penchant for fiery leftist rhetoric -- has proved a fiscal conservative. The country is expected to register its seventh-straight annual fiscal surplus in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morales, 53, has nationalized areas of the economy from the vital natural gas industry to telecommunications companies and tin smelters, but he has also let the central bank's foreign reserves swell to record levels and warded off the scourge of high inflation that battered Bolivia in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economy is expected to grow more quickly than many of its wealthier neighbors this year and should maintain a healthy 5 percent expansion in 2013, according to the latest International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bolivia is no longer a country with a weak economy," Economy Minister Luis Arce said last month after the nation sold its first global bonds in almost a century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most analysts said the interest rate of less than 5 percent was low considering Morales' record of nationalizing companies, often without prior notice or paying compensation, and it has proved an unlikely public relations success for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The interesting thing is that Bolivia sold the bonds at half the rate paid by Venezuela. That's an important message to the world," said Horst Grebe, director of La Paz-based research institute, Prisma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The problem is that Bolivia's biggest growth is in its macroeconomic numbers. What we're not seeing is a transformation of the productive economy that is sustainable in the long term."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bolivia remains acutely dependent on exports of non-renewable raw materials. Natural gas and metals accounted for 87 percent of last year's record $9.1 billion export earnings, said Gary Rodriguez of the Bolivian Foreign Trade Institute (IBCE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'DRUNK ON POWER'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as Wall Street economists laud Morales' macroeconomic policies as prudent, critics at home say he betrayed supporters by watering down policy pledges and pandering to big business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since the Spanish arrived 500 years ago we'd never had an Indian president. It was the people's dream and we thought things would be different. But six years on, he's dishonored us," said long-time indigenous activist Felipe Quispe, known as El Mallku, the "Condor" or "authority" in Aymara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With six years and 10 months in the job, Morales has held Bolivia's presidency for the longest unbroken period of any elected leader. An opinion poll conducted last month by Ipsos Bolivia put his approval rating at 53 percent in urban areas and 69 percent in the countryside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite his continuing domination of the political scene, Morales has lost his initial aura of invincibility since some allies turned against him over an Amazon highway plan and a fuel price hike two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government critics from the left and the right would like to see strong challengers emerge in time for a 2014 presidential election in which Morales has hinted he may seek a third term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The government's made a lot of mistakes ... they've got drunk on power," Quispe said, accusing Morales of seeking to stifle media criticism and control the judiciary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In El Alto, several large state infrastructure projects, such as a $234 million cable car system and a double-lane highway to Oruro, should be ready in time for the election. They are unlikely to satisfy growing expectations, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's been a lot of investment in the city but it hasn't been enough yet," said Javier Ajno, president of the powerful FEJUVE neighborhood federation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FEJUVE was a protagonist in the so-called Gas War that led to the ouster of former President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada in 2003 and the protests that drove Carlos Mesa from office two years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ajno said El Alto's rebellious spirit was still very much alive, but that for now there is broad support for Morales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"El Alto has been the cradle of this process of change ... we've carried an Indian to the presidency and people still believe in this process," he said. "We've definitely still got a long way to go, but in five or 10 years this will be the city of the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Kieran Murray and Lisa Shumaker)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq would favor bids by Russia's Lukoil (LKOH.MM) and China's CNPC if they decided to buy Exxon Mobil's (XOM.N) stake in the super-giant West Qurna-1 oilfield, a senior oil ministry official said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

already developing West Qurna-2, had previously said West
Qurna-1 was "too big for it to swallow", but last week said it

another company, possibly CNPC, to develop the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Lukoil confirmed the company had received an

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A dozen large investors have sued Pfizer Inc for securities fraud, distancing themselves from a long-running shareholder class action over allegations the company misled them about the safety of the pain relievers Celebrex and Bextra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs in the new case, filed late Thursday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, include the California Public Employees' Retirement System (Calpers), the biggest U.S. public pension fund, the California State Teachers' Retirement System (Calstrs), and several mutual funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Opting out" of securities class actions has become a growing trend, as some plaintiffs gamble they can do better by suing solo or in a small group instead of joining a larger case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs in the new case said in September that they would not be part of the pending class action. The class action, led by the Teachers' Retirement System of Louisiana, grew out of lawsuits that started in 2004 following a study on the cardiovascular risks of Celebrex and Bextra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it will fight the new case, as well as another opt-out case and the larger class action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The company believes these cases and the original class action lawsuit have no merit based on the undisputed facts in the record and the governing federal securities law," said Pfizer spokesman Chris Loder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said both drugs "were rigorously studied and tested" by the company and independent experts, and that the U.S. government, doctors, patients, and investors received accurate information on the risks and benefits of the medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenues from Celebrex and Bextra dropped by over $2 billion in the first nine months of 2005 after the safety concerns were made public, while Pfizer saw a $68.4 billion loss in stock market value between October 2004 and October 2005, according to allegations by investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 2009, Pfizer agreed to pay $2.3 billion to settle a U.S. Department of Justice probe into the marketing of drugs including Bextra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs have opted out of past securities fraud class actions, including cases involving Countrywide Financial Corp and stemming from the collapse of WorldCom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Opt-outs are a major trend, probably reflecting the increased competition within the plaintiff's bar," said John Coffee, a law professor and securities law expert at Columbia University Law School.

&lt;p&gt;* Lawsuit contends drug company misled investors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Big investors sue separately from class action case&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Nate Raymond&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Nov 16 (Reuters) - A dozen large investors have
sued Pfizer Inc for securities fraud, distancing
themselves from a long-running shareholder class action over
allegations the company misled them about the safety of the pain

led by the Teachers' Retirement System of Louisiana, grew out of
lawsuits that started in 2004 following a study on the
cardiovascular risks of Celebrex and Bextra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it will fight the new case, as well as another
opt-out case and the larger class action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The company believes these cases and the original class
action lawsuit have no merit based on the undisputed facts in
the record and the governing federal securities law," said
Pfizer spokesman Chris Loder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said both drugs "were rigorously studied and tested" by
the company and independent experts, and that the U.S.

		&lt;p&gt;
			JPMorgan Chase Reaches Settlement with SEC Regarding Bear Stearns and 
      JPM Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE: JPM) announced today an agreement with the 
      U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) to settle SEC inquiries 
      regarding disclosures in certain residential mortgage-backed securities 
      (&#8220;RMBS&#8221;) offerings issued by Bear Stearns and one issued by J.P. Morgan. 
      The agreement is subject to court approval.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of the agreement, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and the other 
      settling entities consented to the filing of a complaint, without 
      admitting or denying its allegations, and will pay disgorgement and 
      penalties totaling approximately $297 million. More than two-thirds of 
      these payments relate to securities issued by Bear Stearns and are 
      slated for return to the trusts Bear sponsored or the investors in those 
      trusts. The SEC&#8217;s complaint makes allegations under the negligence-based 
      provisions of the federal securities laws and does not include charges 
      of intentional misconduct. J.P. Morgan is pleased to have reached 
      agreement with the SEC to put these matters concerning RMBS behind it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The SEC&#8217;s claims relate primarily to Bear Stearns&#8217; alleged failure to 
      disclose settlements entered into by a Bear Stearns affiliate with 
      originators of loans that had been securitized into RMBS trusts. The 
      settlement provides a mechanism for J.P. Morgan Securities to disgorge 
      the proceeds from the settlements to the SEC for eventual payment into 
      the relevant RMBS trusts, without impacting the Real Estate Mortgage 
      Investment Conduit status of the trusts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The settlement also resolves SEC claims concerning the delinquency 
      disclosures in an RMBS offering by a J.P. Morgan affiliate in 2006. The 
      SEC&#8217;s complaint alleges that J.P. Morgan Securities failed to include in 
      the RMBS prospectus supplement&#8217;s delinquency disclosures approximately 
      620 loans that the SEC asserts were more than 30 days delinquent at the 
      cut-off date for the offering. By the time of the first remittance 
      report after the offering, however, only 346 loans were reported as 
      delinquent to investors and J.P. Morgan Securities repurchased 259 of 
      these 346 loans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While we have received no assurances from the SEC that additional claims 
      will not be filed in the future, we are unaware of any active SEC 
      investigations into JPMorgan's RMBS activities beyond those we are 
      resolving today.

&lt;p&gt;  CELINA, TX, Nov 16 (Marketwire) -- 
In Celina on Thursday, J. P. King Auction Company sold the Collin County
Ranch Estate at a real estate auction. With no minimums and no reserves,
the auction brought 14 registered bidders from Texas and Wyoming to
compete for the home. 

    Dr. Steve Watson began looking into the auction process to sell his home
after it had been on the market for four years. Last listed at $1.2
million, Thursday's auction brought 85 percent of his last ask price with
a marketing campaign that included 34 property tours and over 13,000
website hits. 

    "J. P. King did great," Dr. Watson said. "They prepared us for the
turnout we would have and delivered the results they promised. After four
years of trying to sell our home, we wish we had found J. P. King sooner
to help us with the process. We're very pleased."

    The Collin County Ranch Estate is a three-bedroom, 3.5-bath home situated
on 80 acres on one of the highest elevations in Celina. Its panoramic
views and swimming pool, along with the area's award-winning school
districts and athletic programs were draws for potential buyers. 

    Nearly 100 potential bidders went through the due diligence process
through J. P. King before the final 14 registered bidders arrived for
auction day. Interest came from Louisiana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Texas
and Wyoming. 

    "Being able to reassure a seller that, even after four years of trying to
sell a home, there's still a large market of interested buyers ready to
not only buy, but to also compete for their home is gratifying," said
Craig King, president and CEO of J. P. King Auction Company. "A national
marketing campaign brought 34 property tours through the home in 10 days
and ultimately brought a price at auction that our seller was very
pleased with."

    J. P. King will conduct an additional auction in the Dallas metro area on
December 6, where two penthouse units in the Lonestar Tower, which
overlooks the Texas Motorspeedway Racetrack, will sell at an absolute
auction with no minimums and no reserves. Both units have two bedrooms
and views of the track and grandstands. For more information, visit

properties such as luxury homes, condominiums, land and ranches. The

      Research and Markets: Global Tuberculosis Drugs Market 2011-2015 with 
      Eli Lilly and Co. GlaxoSmithKline plc. Pfizer Inc. and Sanofi SA 
      Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/l8sxhx/global) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Tuberculosis Drugs Market 2011-2015" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      TechNavio's analysts forecast the Global Tuberculosis Drugs market to 
      grow at a CAGR of 6.75 percent over the period 2011-2015. One of the key 
      factors contributing to this market growth is the increase in the 
      outbreak of TB-HIV co-infections. The Global Tuberculosis Drugs market 
      has also been witnessing the trend of increased focus on TB vaccine 
      development. However, insufficient demand in developed countries could 
      pose a challenge to the growth of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      TechNavio's report, the Global Tuberculosis Drugs market 2011-2015, has 
      been prepared based on an in-depth analysis of the market with inputs 
      from industry experts. The report covers the Americas, and the EMEA and 
      APAC regions; it also covers the Global Tuberculosis Drugs market 
      landscape and its growth prospects in the coming years. The report also 
      includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from TechNavio's Healthcare team 
      said: ''Currently, the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is the only 
      vaccine for Tuberculosis (TB). It is inconsistent in protecting against 
      the adolescent or adult form of TB, particularly pulmonary or lung TB. 
      Furthermore, the World Health Organization (WHO) is no longer 
      recommending it for the treatment of TB in HIV-infected infants. A rich 
      pipeline of new vaccines has emerged over the years with almost 15 TB 
      vaccines entering clinical trials. Companies are more focused on 
      developing effective vaccines against the spread of the TB infection. In 
      developing countries, there is an increased focus on improving vaccine 
      production capacity to address needs.''
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, the emergence of multidrug-resistant TB 
      (MDR-TB) and extensive drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) strains along with 
      increase in the number of other mutant and antibiotic-resistant TB 
      strains is propelling the growth of the Global Tuberculosis Drugs market.

			Coca-Cola System to Invest US$1.3 billion in 
      Chile from 2012 to 2016
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Investment Plan Announced During Opening of New State-of-the-Art 
      Coca-Cola Andina Bottling Plant in Renca, Chile
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company has announced a new five-year system investment of 
      US$1.3 billion in Chile from 2012 to 2016, including $200 million 
      recently invested to construct a new Coca-Cola Andina bottling plant in 
      Renca, which officially opened yesterday.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Muhtar Kent, Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company, made the 
      announcement at the new plant alongside Felipe Larra&#237;n, Finance Minister 
      of the Republic of Chile, representatives of the Chilean Congress, and 
      other private sector and civil society representatives.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "The Coca-Cola Company and our bottling partners share a deep commitment 
      to the continued development of Chile,&#8221; Kent said. &#8220;For more than 66 
      years we have contributed to the progress of the country and will 
      continue to do so with enthusiasm and conviction. We are devoting 
      resources to innovation and productivity, creating jobs for Chileans, 
      and helping thousands of small- and medium-size entrepreneurs throughout 
      the country to grow their businesses sustainably.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola system&#8217;s local investment in Chile will not only be 
      dedicated to infrastructure, equipment, technology and marketing, but 
      also to sustainability initiatives to return water back to nature, 
      reduce the use of energy in production, develop recycling programs and 
      promote physical activity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Andina President Juan Claro expressed his pride for the fact 
      that the new Renca plant is the most modern in the Coca-Cola system in 
      Latin America and a model for the Coca-Cola system throughout the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "This new plant is aligned with the vision we have at Coca-Cola Andina 
      to be a benchmark of sustainability &#8211; a very attractive company with 
      sustainable development and innovation. We want to make a difference as 
      a company that cares about providing a quality work environment, cares 
      about the environment, contributes to the country and to the community, 
      and focuses on efficiency in the growth of our production, marketing and 
      logistics," Claro said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Executive Vice President of Coca-Cola Andina, Miguel Angel Peirano, also 
      emphasized the stringent environmental criteria under which the new 
      plant was built. "We are very pleased to have obtained LEED 
      certification that sets international standards of quality in the use of 
      soil, water, energy, indoor air quality, the use of building materials 
      and innovation in architectural design. It is a very challenging 
      certification to be achieved in any part of the world,&#8221; he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Located in the town of Renca, the new Coca-Cola Andina plant covers 
      243,000 square meters and houses 10 production lines, which can be 
      expanded to 12. Ninety percent of the building materials used in 
      construction of the facility can be recycled at the end of their life 
      cycle. The plant&#8217;s design also optimizes the use of water and energy.

&lt;p&gt;Nov 16 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Friday a
late-stage trial of a once-a-day formulation of its drug
pregabalin did not significantly reduce the frequency of some
types of seizures in patients with epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug, sold under the brand name Lyrica, is currently
used to treat epilepsy when given several times a day in
combination with other drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said the lack of a statistically significant
improvement may have been due to a higher-than-expected response
among patients taking the placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial was the first of three trials testing the drug as
a once-a-day therapy. The company is also testing it in patients
with fibromyalgia and some types of nerve pain, for which it is
also approved in its immediate-release formulation.&lt;/p&gt;

			Pfizer Reports Top-Line Results Of A Phase 3 Study Evaluating 
      Pregabalin Controlled-Release Formulation As Adjunctive Treatment In 
      Adult Patients With Partial Onset Seizures
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced top-line results of a 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study evaluating both the 165 
      mg dose and the 330 mg dose of pregabalin controlled-release (CR) 
      formulation in adult patients with partial onset seizures with epilepsy. 
      These study results indicate pregabalin CR did not meet its primary 
      endpoint comparing the change in seizure frequency to placebo, although 
      both doses were well-tolerated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This study is one of three Phase 3 studies of the pregabalin CR 
      formulation, which will ascertain the potential use of pregabalin as a 
      once-a-day therapy. The other two studies are evaluating the pregabalin 
      CR formulation in fibromyalgia and post-herpetic neuralgia. Pfizer will 
      continue to further analyze these top-line results as well as the 
      top-line results of the other two studies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "While the study showed an observed improvement, it did not show a 
      statistically significant difference in seizure frequency, which we 
      believe may have been due to a higher-than-expected placebo response," 
      said Steven J. Romano, M.D., senior vice president, head, Medicines 
      Development Group, Global Primary Care Business Unit, Pfizer Inc. 
      "Lyrica immediate-release has a proven success record in patients with 
      epilepsy, and we look forward to understanding further the potential 
      role of a once-a-day pregabalin formulation."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Epilepsy is a chronic disorder in which seizures occur intermittently. 
      Partial onset seizures (simple, complex, and secondarily generalized 
      tonic-clonic) are the most common. In the U.S., the immediate-release 
      formulation &#8211; Lyrica&#174; (pregabalin) capsules CV has been used 
      as adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures since its approval in 
      June 2005.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About the Study
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The objective of the double-blind, randomized, parallel group, 
      multi-center study was to assess the efficacy and safety of pregabalin 
      CR as adjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures in adult patients 
      with epilepsy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The study was conducted in a total of 18 countries at 66 sites. The 
      study included four phases: Phase 1 - an 8 week baseline phase during 
      which the baseline seizure rate was recorded; Phase 2 - a 2 week 
      double-blind dose escalation phase; Phase 3 - a 12 week double blind 
      maintenance phase where the dosage of study medication was fixed; and 
      Phase 4 - a 1 week taper phase at the conclusion of the study. Treatment 
      groups included pregabalin CR 165 mg/day, pregabalin CR 330 mg/day or 
      placebo at a 1:1:1 ratio. These pregabalin CR dose levels provided 
      exposure similar to 150 mg and 300 mg daily doses of currently available 
      Lyrica (pregabalin) immediate-release formulations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The primary endpoint was the loge-transformed 28 day seizure 
      rate for all partial onset seizures collected during the double-blind 
      treatment phase compared to the 8 week baseline (screening) seizure 
      period.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysis of the primary endpoint, loge (28-days seizure 
      rate + 1), showed a non-significant result between pregabalin and 
      placebo for the pregabalin CR 330 mg group (p=0.0907). Responder rates, 
      defined as the percentage of patients with a &#8805; 50% reduction in seizure 
      frequency from baseline, were 45.9%, 37.8% and 35.8% for the CR 330 mg, 
      CR 165 mg, and placebo groups, respectively, and highlight the high 
      placebo response observed in this study.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Both pregabalin CR 330 mg and pregabalin CR 165 mg were well tolerated 
      in this population. The tolerability and safety findings are consistent 
      with past pregabalin findings for patients with epilepsy, with 
      dizziness, weight increased and somnolence as the most frequently 
      reported adverse events in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Lyrica
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lyrica&#174; is currently approved for various indications in 120 
      countries and regions globally. Since its first approval from the FDA in 
      2004, Lyrica has been approved for five indications in the U.S., of 
      which four are in the therapeutic area of pain. These indications 
      include neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, 
      post-herpetic neuralgia (pain after shingles), neuropathic pain 
      associated with spinal cord injury, fibromyalgia and partial onset 
      seizures in adults with epilepsy who take one or more drugs for 
      seizures. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) including Lyrica increase the risk 
      of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking AEDs for any 
      indication.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There have been post-marketing reports of angioedema and 
      hypersensitivity with Lyrica. Treatment with Lyrica may cause dizziness, 
      somnolence, dry mouth, edema and blurred vision. Other most common 
      adverse reactions include weight gain, constipation, euphoric mood, 
      balance disorder, increased appetite and thinking abnormal (primarily 
      difficulty with concentration/attention).

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The sudden departure of powerful Windows boss Steven Sinofsky this week is the first step in a plan by CEO Steve Ballmer to remodel Microsoft Corp as a much more integrated operation in an attempt to take on Apple Inc and Google Inc at their own game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After nearly 13 years at the helm of the world's largest software maker, which just launched its first own-brand computer, sources inside the company say Sinofsky's departure signals Ballmer's new-found focus on co-operation between its self-sufficient - and sometimes warring - units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What I'm hearing over and over is collaboration and horizontal integration is the new mantra," said one Microsoft insider, who asked not to be named. "They (top management) understand that, if they don't move to a model where devices and software are more integrated across the entire Microsoft system, they are in a weak position."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After floundering for most of the last decade, Microsoft is trying emulate the way Apple's software and hardware - such as iTunes and the iPhone - work perfectly together; or how Google's online suite from Web search to YouTube and Gmail are seamlessly joined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft - which Ballmer rechristened as a "devices and services company" last month - has all the parts, analysts say, but has failed to put them together. Now Ballmer looks set to reshape the company to try to make that a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I certainly expect the org chart to look a lot different six months from now," said Brad Silverberg, who ran the Windows unit during its massive growth spurt in the 1990s. "There will be attrition from Steven's (Sinofsky's) people and Steve Ballmer will have a chance to create a more harmonious organization."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer replaced Sinofsky with two executives with a reputation for co-operation. The move marks the third time in the last few years that Ballmer has replaced a single unit head with two leaders sharing responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sinofsky really centralized all the power under himself. We'll see how it shakes out from here," said one manager in the Windows unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More fundamental organizational shifts could be in the cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of things are up for grabs," said David Smith at tech research firm Gartner. "How the management is structured - there could be more changes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO ROOM FOR AN EMPIRE BUILDER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinofsky, a 23-year Microsoft veteran, built up a walled empire around his Windows unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His hard-charging but methodical style, which took on the name "Sinofskyization," alienated other groups in the company, especially the Office unit, the other financial pillar of Microsoft's success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Steven is a brilliant guy who made tremendous contributions to Microsoft," said Silverberg. "But he was also a polarizing guy and the antibodies ultimately caught up with him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision not to share the latest internal test versions of Windows 8 and keep the Surface tablet a secret until just before its announcement especially upset the Office group, which insiders say accounts for the lack of a fully featured Office suite on the Surface RT tablet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All good leaders create friction, but my guess is the cost of doing business with Sinofsky ended up outweighing the benefits," said a former Microsoft staffer who saw Sinofsky operate at close quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you work in Steven's team, you love him," said a former colleague who now works for a financial technology firm in Seattle. "If he's outside of your team? That's where his reputation of being hard to work with came from."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer has made it clear that executives have to work together better. Next year, top managers will get bonuses based on company-wide performance, not just their own unit, which Ballmer hopes will lead to "deeper cross-organization collaboration."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is no guarantee Ballmer can radically redirect almost four decades of culture at Microsoft - which he is partly responsible for - that gave Windows primacy and intentionally pitted teams against one another to get the best results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing will change without new leaders from outside the company, said Trip Chowdhry, managing director at Global Equities Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is clinging to the past and they keep bringing in the people from the past. This is a fundamental flaw in the logic," Chowdhry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO THRONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite urging collaboration, Ballmer - a 32-year Microsoft veteran who took over as CEO from Bill Gates in 2000 - does not let any junior executive get too close to challenging his authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinofsky, widely touted as Ballmer's successor for the past three years, was just the latest in a line of would-be CEOs. Over the last five years alone, Ballmer has seen off a clutch of rising stars that were discussed as potential leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows and online head Kevin Johnson went to run Juniper Networks Inc, Office chief Stephen Elop went to lead phone maker Nokia, while Ray Ozzie - the software guru Bill Gates designated as Microsoft's big-picture thinker - left to start his own project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They've gone through quite a bit of senior management talent in the past few years. The bench is not what it used to be," said Smith at Gartner. "The overall management structure, career path, replacements, succession planning - a lot of that is an issue for Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer's promotion of Julie Larson-Green and Tami Reller to jointly fill Sinofsky's role may only be temporary, Microsoft-watchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The question is what comes after, like in the next three years," said Rob Helm at Directions on Microsoft, an independent firm that advises business customers on how to deal with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Bill Rigby in Seattle and Alexei Oreskovic in San Francisco.; Editing by Edward Tobin, Martin Howell and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 16 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are expected to serve a
formal notice to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co accusing the
nation's biggest bank of having weaknesses in its anti
money-laundering systems, the Wall Street Journal reported,
citing people close to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's (OCC's)
cease-and-desist order to JPMorgan is part of a broader
crackdown on the nation's largest banks, the people told the
paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OCC is expected to require JPMorgan to beef up its
procedures and examine past transactions, the Journal said. ()&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators and regulators are examining risk controls
surrounding a multi-billion dollar trading loss within the
company's Chief Investment Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authorities are also probing whether a JPMorgan energy

&lt;p&gt;DUBAI (Reuters) - The United States has denied visas to Iranian officials hoping to attend a U.N. meeting in New York, Iran's state news agency reported on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Iranian judiciary's Human Rights Headquarters said in a statement that the United States denied visas to members of an Iranian delegation that planned to travel to a meeting of the United Nations' Third Committee, which focuses on social issues and human rights, state news agency IRNA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The U.S. government, by not issuing visas to the members of the delegation, wants to ruin the possibility of the presence of the delegation, and prevent its members from conducting their mission of interacting and cooperating with the United Nations," said the statement, according to IRNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judiciary body urged U.N. officials to warn the United States against such decisions and remind it of its obligations as U.N. host country, IRNA reported. It did not say how many Iranian officials had applied for visas from the United States or when they wanted to travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Swiss embassy, which handles U.S. consular services in Iran, did not respond immediately to a request from comment. A U.S. State Department spokesperson said it did not comment on visa cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As U.N. host country, the United States has a policy of issuing visas for members of delegations, in line with a 1947 pact with the United Nations, regardless of disputes with individual countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it does sometimes refuse entry to government officials and professionals from Iran with which it has had no diplomatic ties since 1979 and which it accuses of seeking nuclear weapons, a charge Tehran denies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, Iran's Fars news agency reported that the U.S. had denied visas to about 20 government officials hoping to attend the U.N. General Assembly, including two ministers, although President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad did attend and addressed the assembly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, a U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity, said: "Visas for foreign officials to attend U.N. meetings in the U.N. headquarters district are adjudicated in accordance with all applicable laws and procedures including both U.S. law and the U.N. Headquarters Agreement, however, visa records are confidential."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, as Iranian authorities were crushing protests against the re-election of Ahmadinejad, Iran said a delegation headed by its first vice president had been refused visas to attend a U.N. conference on the global financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Yeganeh Torbati; Editing by Alison Williams)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) named little-known executive Marianne Lake as its chief financial officer on Monday, making her one of the most powerful women on Wall Street and the top ambassador to investors for the largest U.S. bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lake, 43, will replace Doug Braunstein as CFO early next year and join only a handful of other women in top Wall Street roles, such as Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Morgan Stanley (MS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lake will answer directly to CEO Jamie Dimon in her new role, reestablishing a reporting line taken away from the CFO post this summer after a massive $6.2 billion trading loss hurt the company's credibility with securities analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She will also join the bank's powerful operating committee, which has about a dozen members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I hope to be described as a great partner and someone who helped drive and develop the business," Lake said in a interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braunstein, 51, a long-time investment banker, will become a vice chairman at JPMorgan and "focus on serving top clients," according to an announcement from the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His move could mark the last exit from the public spotlight of JPMorgan executives linked to the trading loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braunstein, like Dimon, had insisted to analysts in April that press reports were wrong about risks the bank's Chief Investment Office faced from positions taken by Bruno Iksil, who was known to hedge funds as the "London Whale" for the size of his trades in derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When talk of Braunstein's possible move surfaced last month, a person familiar with the matter said giving up the CFO post would be Braunstein's decision and unrelated to the bad credit trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change also comes as Dimon grooms a younger group of executives at the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a reshuffle over the summer, Dimon named Michael Cavanagh and Daniel Pinto - both in their late 40s at the time - co-chiefs of commercial and investment banking. Both Cavanagh and Pinto are seen as prime candidates to succeed Dimon, 56, when he is ready to retire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIGH-PROFILE ROLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lake was far removed from the derivatives debacle.

&lt;p&gt;* Marianne Lake to replace Doug Braunstein as CFO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Lake to join operating committee, report to Dimon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Braunstein to become a vice chairman, focus on clients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By David Henry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nov 19 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co named
little-known executive Marianne Lake as its chief financial
officer on Monday, making her one of the most powerful women on
Wall Street and the top ambassador to investors for the largest
U.S. bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lake, 43, will replace Doug Braunstein as CFO early next
year and join only a handful of other women in top Wall Street
roles, such as Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Morgan
Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lake will answer directly to CEO Jamie Dimon in her new
role, reestablishing a reporting line taken away from the CFO
post this summer after a massive $6.2 billion trading loss hurt
the company's credibility with securities analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She will also join the bank's powerful operating committee,
which has about a dozen members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I hope to be described as a great partner and someone who
helped drive and develop the business," Lake said in a
interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braunstein, 51, a long-time investment banker, will become a
vice chairman at JPMorgan and "focus on serving top clients,"
according to an announcement from the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His move could mark the last exit from the public spotlight
of JPMorgan executives linked to the trading loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braunstein, like Dimon, had insisted to analysts in April
that press reports were wrong about risks the bank's Chief
Investment Office faced from positions taken by Bruno Iksil, who
was known to hedge funds as the "London Whale" for the size of
his trades in derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When talk of Braunstein's possible move surfaced last month,
a person familiar with the matter said giving up the CFO post
would be Braunstein's decision and unrelated to the bad credit
trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change also comes as Dimon grooms a younger group of
executives at the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a reshuffle over the summer, Dimon named Michael Cavanagh
and Daniel Pinto - both in their late 40s at the time -
co-chiefs of commercial and investment banking. Both Cavanagh
and Pinto are seen as prime candidates to succeed Dimon, 56,
when he is ready to retire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIGH-PROFILE ROLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lake was far removed from the derivatives debacle. Though
she has been the CFO for JPMorgan's retail branch systems since
2009, she has had a relatively low profile outside the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has not been a member of the company's Executive
Committee, whose roughly 50 members are listed in JPMorgan's
annual report and who meet quarterly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lake has had some experience in the last five years meeting
with Wall Street securities analysts, whom she will address in
future quarterly conference calls after earnings reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her previous roles, she saw the financial crisis up close
as JPMorgan acquired investment bank Bear Stearns and then as
the U.S. housing crisis battered JPMorgan's mortgage
investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2007-09, she worked in JPMorgan's investment bank as
global controller in finance and business management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lake first met Dimon when he came to the bank in 2004.
Dimon, in the company's statement, said Lake "has developed an
impressive breadth of knowledge and experience in finance across
both our wholesale and our consumer businesses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lake, a chartered accountant, managed global finance
infrastructure and control functions in JPMorgan's corporate
finance group from 2004 to 2007. Before that, she was a senior
financial officer for the company in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also worked for PriceWaterhouseCoopers in London and
Sydney before joining JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lake is a citizen of both the United States and the United
Kingdom, having been born to an American mother and a British
father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MANAGEMENT RESHUFFLES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon took Braunstein out of his line of direct reports in
July, assigning him to answer first to Matt Zames, a top
mortgage markets executive whom he had just named co-chief
operating officer of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, in testimony before a congressional committee in
Washington in June, cited Braunstein as being among top
lieutenants whom he had relied upon to check the London Whale
reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others he cited were company risk officers. In October,

services business with its investment bank and that Cavanagh
would become co-head of the new unit, with Pinto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Dimon named Jes Staley to take over the investment

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Downgrades Two Classes of JP Morgan 2007-FL1
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has downgraded two classes from the pooled portion of J.P. 
      Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp. Series 2007-1. A 
      detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The downgrade of class A-2 to 'A' from 'AA' is based on interest 
      shortfalls affecting the class. According to Fitch's criteria, ratings 
      at 'AAA' and 'AA' should not incur interest shortfalls. The interest 
      shortfalls began in October 2012, primarily due to the claw back of 
      interest advances to the Resort International loan. Class K has been 
      downgraded to 'D' from 'C' as a result of incurred losses. The Negative 
      Rating Outlooks reflect the possibility of further negative credit 
      migration of the underlying collateral.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirmed the remainder of the pooled transaction and the 
      non-pooled junior component certificates were also affirmed based on 
      Fitch's loss expectations on the Resorts International loan. Fitch's 
      performance expectation incorporates prospective views regarding 
      commercial real estate values and cash flow declines.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rating action reflects Fitch's base case loss expectation of 11.5%. 
      Under Fitch's updated analysis, 100% of the pooled and non-pooled 
      components are modeled to default in the base case stress scenario, 
      defined as the 'B' stress. Fitch estimates that average recoveries on 
      the pooled loans will be approximately 88.5% in the base case. In its 
      review, Fitch analyzed servicer reported operating statements, STR 
      reports and rent rolls, updated property valuations, and recent lease 
      and sales comparisons.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the November 2012 distribution report, the transaction is 
      collateralized by eight loans, including six that are secured by hotels 
      (75.3%), one by casino (18.7%), and one by office (6%). All eight loans 
      are currently in special servicing, including two (24.5%) real estate 
      owned (REO) assets, four (57.7%) in delinquency and two (17.8%) in 
      forbearance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      All eight remaining loans have been identified as Fitch Loans of 
      Concern. Fitch's analysis resulted in loss expectations for three 
      A-notes, and each of the B-note non-pooled components in the 'B' stress 
      scenario. The three pooled contributors to losses in the 'B' stress 
      scenario are: PHOV Portfolio (19.3%), Resorts International (13.5%) and 
      Sofitel Minneapolis (2.8%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The PHOV Portfolio loan is secured by 11 full-service hotels (following 
      the previous release of the Hilton Rockville), located in FL, CA, SC, IL 
      and NJ. Flags include Hilton, Doubletree, Courtyard by Marriott, 
      Sheraton and two non-flagged hotels. The loan was transferred to special 
      servicing in January 2012 due to imminent maturity default. The loan has 
      passed its final maturity date in May 2012 and the special servicer is 
      working with the borrower for a loan modification.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Four of the 11 properties were severely impacted by Hurricane Katrina 
      and Wilma in 2005, with the hotels coming back on line in late 2006 and 
      mid 2007. While year-end (YE) 2011 net operating income improved 
      significantly over YE 2010 and YE 2009, it remains below issuance 
      expectations. For YE 2011, the revenue per available room (RevPAR) was 
      $80.26, compared to $74.3 at YE 2010, $67.58 at YE 2009 and $87.58 at

      The Resorts International loan was originally collateralized by four 
      casino/hotel properties located in Atlantic City, NJ, East Chicago, IN, 
      Robinsonville, MS and Tunica, MS. The Resorts East Chicago property was 
      released from the portfolio in September 2007, paying down the senior 
      trust component by approximately 47%. The loan was foreclosed in 
      November 2011 and the Atlantic City Hilton property was released to the 
      borrower due to negative property value. The remaining two properties 
      became REO assets. The loan secures two additional non-trust pari passu 
      A notes of $32.4 million each, an $87.7 million non-pooled senior 
      participation included in the transaction and a $233 million junior 
      participation held outside the trust. The current appraisal value 
      obtained by the special servicer indicated losses upon liquidation of 
      the assets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Sofitel Minneapolis loan is secured by a 282 room Sofitel Hotel in 
      Bloomington, MN. The loan transferred to the special servicer in 
      February 2012 due to payment default. The loan matured in July 2012. 
      Borrower indicated that occupancy is insufficient to meet debt 
      obligation. The borrower reported September 2012 trailing 12 month (TTM) 
      occupancy, ADR and RevPar are 65.2%, $113.22, and $73.85, respectively. 
      The special servicer is pursuing foreclosure and the appointment of a 
      receiver. The current appraisal value obtained by the special servicer 
      indicated losses upon liquidation of the assets.

&lt;p&gt;Nov 19 - Fitch Ratings has downgraded two classes from the pooled portion of
J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp. Series 2007-1. A detailed
list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.

The downgrade of class A-2 to 'A' from 'AA' is based on interest shortfalls 
affecting the class.  According to Fitch's criteria, ratings at 'AAA' and 'AA' 
should not incur interest shortfalls. The interest shortfalls began in October 
2012, primarily due to the claw back of interest advances to the Resort 
International loan. Class K has been downgraded to 'D' from 'C' as a result of 
incurred losses. The Negative Rating Outlooks reflect the possibility of further
negative credit migration of the underlying collateral.

Fitch affirmed the remainder of the pooled transaction and the non-pooled junior
component certificates were also affirmed based on Fitch's loss expectations on 
the Resorts International loan. Fitch's performance expectation incorporates 
prospective views regarding commercial real estate values and cash flow 
declines. 

The rating action reflects Fitch's base case loss expectation of 11.5%. Under 
Fitch's updated analysis, 100% of the pooled and non-pooled components are 
modeled to default in the base case stress scenario, defined as the 'B' stress. 
Fitch estimates that average recoveries on the pooled loans will be 
approximately 88.5% in the base case.  In its review, Fitch analyzed servicer 
reported operating statements, STR reports and rent rolls, updated property 
valuations, and recent lease and sales comparisons. 

As of the November 2012 distribution report, the transaction is collateralized 
by eight loans, including six that are secured by hotels (75.3%), one by casino 
(18.7%), and one by office (6%). All eight loans are currently in special 
servicing, including two (24.5%) real estate owned (REO) assets, four (57.7%) in
delinquency and two (17.8%) in forbearance. 

All eight remaining loans have been identified as Fitch Loans of Concern. 
Fitch's analysis resulted in loss expectations for three A-notes, and each of 
the B-note non-pooled components in the 'B' stress scenario. The three pooled 
contributors to losses in the 'B' stress scenario are: PHOV Portfolio (19.3%), 
Resorts International (13.5%) and Sofitel Minneapolis (2.8%). 

 

The PHOV Portfolio loan is secured by 11 full-service hotels (following the 
previous release of the Hilton Rockville), located in FL, CA, SC, IL and NJ.  
Flags include Hilton, Doubletree, Courtyard by Marriott, Sheraton and two 
non-flagged hotels.  The loan was transferred to special servicing in January 
2012 due to imminent maturity default. The loan has passed its final maturity 
date in May 2012 and the special servicer is working with the borrower for a 
loan modification.

  

Four of the 11 properties were severely impacted by Hurricane Katrina and Wilma 
in 2005, with the hotels coming back on line in late 2006 and mid 2007.  While 
year-end (YE) 2011 net operating income improved significantly over YE 2010 and 
YE 2009, it remains below issuance expectations. For YE 2011, the revenue per 
available room (RevPAR) was $80.26, compared to $74.3 at YE 2010, $67.58 at YE 
2009 and $87.58 at issuance.

The Resorts International loan was originally collateralized by four 
casino/hotel properties located in Atlantic City, NJ, East Chicago, IN, 
Robinsonville, MS and Tunica, MS. The Resorts East Chicago property was released
from the portfolio in September 2007, paying down the senior trust component by 
approximately 47%. The loan was foreclosed in November 2011 and the Atlantic 
City Hilton property was released to the borrower due to negative property 
value. The remaining two properties became REO assets. The loan secures two 
additional non-trust pari passu A notes of $32.4 million each, an $87.7 million 
non-pooled senior participation included in the transaction and a $233 million 
junior participation held outside the trust. The current appraisal value 
obtained by the special servicer indicated losses upon liquidation of the 
assets.  

The Sofitel Minneapolis loan is secured by a 282 room Sofitel Hotel in 
Bloomington, MN.  The loan transferred to the special servicer in February 2012 
due to payment default. The loan matured in July 2012. Borrower indicated that 
occupancy is insufficient to meet debt obligation. The borrower reported 
September 2012 trailing 12 month (TTM) occupancy, ADR and RevPar are 65.2%, 
$113.22, and $73.85, respectively. The special servicer is pursuing foreclosure 
and the appointment of a receiver. The current appraisal value obtained by the 
special servicer indicated losses upon liquidation of the assets.

Fitch downgrades the following classes and revises Rating Outlooks as indicated:

--$243.1 million class A-2 to 'Asf' from 'AAsf'; Outlook to Negative from 
Stable;

--$15 million class K to 'Dsf' from 'Csf'; RE0%.

&lt;p&gt;By Robert Cyran and Richard Beales
The authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists. The opinions expressed are their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Apple becomes Microsoft, investors should cheer. At least, that is, for their wallets. Middle age for technology stocks can hurt as shareholders looking for rapid growth lose interest and value-oriented owners await stability. But Apple has already made the transition  before its growth has slowed much. Even if its next decade echoes Microsoft&#8217;s last, the company is worth over $1 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, consider Microsoft, worth $220 billion as of Friday&#8217;s market close. The software behemoth churns out more than twice as much profit as it did a decade ago. The company traded at 30 times estimated earnings in 2002. As investors realized its future was more Clark Kent than Superman, they paid less and less for the prospect of future expansion. Annual percentage revenue increases of late have at best been in single digits. Strip out its $67 billion of cash, and the business trades at about 6.5 times estimated earnings, according to Thomson Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now look at Apple. In the fiscal year to September, its top line surged 45 percent. That was less than the year before, and there are reasons to expect a more pedestrian future: the company lost part of its creative soul when Steve Jobs died in October 2011; it&#8217;s a big ask for Apple to come up with another product like the iPod, iPhone or iPad; and competition in mobile devices is becoming tough. But analysts still expect revenue to increase 24 percent this year. And after taking out Apple&#8217;s whopping $121 billion cash pile, the underlying business on Friday traded at a price-to-expected earnings ratio of some 7.9 times, scarcely richer than Microsoft&#8217;s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook turns out to match his Microsoft counterpart Steve Ballmer, and that Apple&#8217;s earnings increase at an 8 percent annual rate for the next 10 years, roughly what Ballmer has coaxed out of Microsoft since 2002. Apple&#8217;s profit would then be about $90 billion in 2022. On the software company&#8217;s multiple, that would make Apple&#8217;s business, excluding cash, worth $585 billion. Start with last fiscal year&#8217;s cash accumulation of about $40 billion and assume the same rate of growth, and in a decade the company will have added another $625 billion to its cash pile or to dividends. Add back all the cash, and the iPhone maker would be worth $1.3 trillion  approaching three times more than now, or a 10 percent annual gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the technology industry is littered with fallen tech giants. Competition, for instance, could depress Apple&#8217;s margins, though in fact they have widened in recent years  and Microsoft&#8217;s have held up. But if Apple turning into a sluggish Microsoft lookalike is all that it takes to more than double investors&#8217; money, that seems a safe bet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  LOS ANGELES, CA, Nov 19 (Marketwire) -- 
Swinerton Builders in partnership with IDG Parkitects have been selected
for award of subcontract as the design-build team for Jet Propulsion
Laboratory's West Arroyo Parking Structure in Pasadena, California. 

    The $17.5 million project consists of a 4.5-story, 1,436-stall,
cast-in-place concrete parking structure. It also includes significant
ancillary roadway and surrounding hardscape improvements, as well as the
demolition of existing buildings and the City of Pasadena-owned East
Arroyo Parking Lot. The project also provides the structural capability
for a future support grid for photovoltaic panels over the upper parking
level.

Flight Project Center and the NASA Ames Research Center's Sustainability
Base. Swinerton and JPL have a shared commitment to minimizing impact to
the surrounding community, which will be evident through the innovative
design of the new parking structure. 

    Groundbreaking occurred on November 7th, and construction on the parking
structure will begin in March 2013; estimated completion is set for March
2014. Additional design-build members include: Structural Engineer
Jessen-Wright, Civil Engineer Land Design Consultants, Inc., and Traffic
Consultant LSA Associates.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Three primary school age children in one English city reaped more than the usual harvest of sweets and chocolates on Halloween when they emptied their trick-or-treat goody bags and found several bags of cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the man who had mistakenly handed out his cocaine stash to the children instead of candy was given a community service sentence in court, the Press Association reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apprentice panel-beater Donald Junior Green fished in his pockets for a bag of chewy sweets to give to the youngsters at his door on Halloween, but instead pulled out a plastic pack containing eight bags of cocaine he had bought for 200 pounds ($320) earlier that day, Oldham Magistrates' Court heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He dropped the drugs into the goody bags carried by the three children, aged eight, six and five, who were out trick-or-treating escorted by their father, an off-duty policeman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 23-year-old defendant then closed the door, went back inside the house and put his hand in his pockets to get out his drugs - but instead pulled out the sweets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green immediately realized what had happened and went on foot, then by car, scouring the streets of Oldham in northern England to find the youngsters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the officer, Pc Simon Fowell, had taken his children home and, as they emptied their bags to share the spoils, he spotted the drugs, and made a swift call to on-duty colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green was given a 12 month community order, ordered to do 130 hours community work and told he must pay court costs totaling 145 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Stephen Addison, editing by Paul Casciato)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Case designed to protect Repsol interest in Argentina&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Repsol hopes for deal with Argentina over YPF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MADRID Nov 19 (Reuters) - A Spanish court has agreed to
consider a lawsuit by Repsol against U.S.-based Chevron
Corp over its cooperation agreement with Argentina's YPF
.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repsol had threatened legal action against companies that
invest in YPF after Argentina seized control of the Spanish
firm's majority stake in the energy company in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Repsol will continue to take all legal action necessary to
protect its interests" in YPF, a Repsol spokesman said on
Monday, confirming a Reuters report that a Madrid court was
studying a case brought by the Spanish company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one was immediately available to comment at Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YPF announced a deal in September with Chevron to jointly
explore for share oil and natural gas in the South America's
Vaca Muerta field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repsol also sued Argentina in May through a U.S. court as
part of an effort to recover more than $10 billion from the
country in a case that could drag on for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's chairman Antonio Brufau said in an interview
on Sunday he hoped to reach an agreement with Argentina over
compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repsol had said it would seek arbitration at the World
Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes (ICSID). Six months must pass before ICSID will
consider arbitration in any dispute, to allow negotiations
between the two parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those six months have now expired and it is up to Repsol to
request arbitration in a process that experts say could take
more than a year.&lt;/p&gt;

      The Notes are subject to a maximum issuance limitation of 129,000,000

      incur significant losses if that investor sells its Notes at a time when 
      some or all of the premium is no longer present. We issued the final

      Die Procter  Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) hat am 12. November 2012 ihren 
      14. Nachhaltigkeitsbericht vorgestellt. Der j&#228;hrlich ver&#246;ffentlichte 
      Bericht zeugt von dem Engagement des Unternehmens, die Lebensqualit&#228;t 
      von Menschen in aller Welt zu verbessern &#8211; mit einem ganzheitlichen 
      Ansatz. Der Bericht fasst die Nachhaltigkeitsergebnisse des Unternehmens 
      f&#252;r das vergangene Gesch&#228;ftsjahr zusammen; in den letzten f&#252;nf Jahren 
      konnte PG eine absolute Reduzierung des Energie- und Wasserverbrauchs, 
      M&#252;llaufkommens und CO2-Aussto&#223; erzielen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8222;Das Engagement von PG f&#252;r &#246;kologische und soziale Nachhaltigkeit ist 
      ungebrochen&#8220;, sagt Bob McDonald, Vorsitzender, Pr&#228;sident und CEO von 
      PG. &#8222;Seit unserer Gr&#252;ndung haben wir in die Gemeinschaften investiert, 
      wo wir unsere Produkte verkaufen, und die Verantwortung f&#252;r ethisches 
      und nachhaltiges Handeln angenommen. Wenn wir noch weitere 175 Jahre 
      wachsen und erfolgreich sein wollen, m&#252;ssen wir die Schaffung 
      nachhaltiger Innovationen und den effizienten Umgang mit Ressourcen 
      beschleunigen und so die negativen Auswirkungen auf die Umwelt 
      reduzieren. Gleichzeitig m&#252;ssen wir auch weiterhin zum Wohl der 
      Gemeinschaften beitragen, um die Voraussetzungen f&#252;r zuk&#252;nftiges 
      Wachstum zu schaffen.&#8220;

      Der Bericht gibt einen &#220;berblick &#252;ber konkrete Fortschritte, die PG in 
      den Hauptbereichen seiner Nachhaltigkeitsbem&#252;hungen &#8211; Produkte, 
      Produktion und soziale Verantwortung &#8211; erzielen konnte. Zu den 
      wichtigsten Projekten und Ergebnissen des diesj&#228;hrigen Berichts z&#228;hlen:

			Pilotprojekt auf den Philippinen zur Bek&#228;mpfung des globalen

		&lt;p&gt;
      Nach einer umfassenden Studie auf den Philippinen, die in Zusammenarbeit 
      mit &#246;rtlichen Regierungsvertretern durchgef&#252;hrt wurde, hat PG ein 
      integriertes, nutzbringendes und reproduzierbares Gesch&#228;ftsmodell zur 
      Verwertung von Materialien entwickelt, die ansonsten auf der Deponie 
      landen w&#252;rden. PG arbeitet gemeinsam mit der Asian Development Bank an 
      diesem Pilotprojekt, das die Einf&#252;hrung dieses selbsttragenden Modells 
      auf den Philippinen f&#252;r Anfang 2013 vorsieht.

			Eliminierung von Tetanus bei Neugeborenen und M&#252;ttern in sechs L&#228;ndern
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mit der Aktion &#8222;1 Packung = 1 lebensrettende Impfdosis&#8220; unterst&#252;tzt 
      Pampers seit f&#252;nf Jahren das Impfprogramm von UNICEF, um Tetanus bei 
      Neugeborenen und M&#252;ttern zu bek&#228;mpfen. Alle neun Minuten stirbt ein 
      Neugeborenes an Tetanus &#8211; dabei l&#228;sst sich die Krankheit leicht durch 
      eine entsprechende Impfung vermeiden. Mithilfe von Pampers haben bereits 
      sechs afrikanische L&#228;nder den Status der Tetanus-Eliminierung durch die 
      WHO erhalten: Burkina Faso, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Liberia, Senegal und 
      Uganda.

      Als Mitglied des Consumer Goods Forum setzt sich PG gemeinsam mit 
      anderen Mitgliedsunternehmen daf&#252;r ein, die Netto-Entwaldung bis 2020 
      auf Null zu reduzieren. Zu diesem Zweck hat PG zwei neue Ziele 
      formuliert: Zum einen sollen bis 2015 s&#228;mtliche Frischholzfasern in 
      seinen Papiert&#252;chern und absorbierenden Hygieneprodukten aus unabh&#228;ngig 
      zertifizierten Quellen stammen. Zum anderen sollen bis 2020 alle 
      Papierverpackungen entweder recycelte oder unabh&#228;ngig zertifizierte 
      Neumaterialien enthalten. Damit erg&#228;nzt PG das bereits bestehende Ziel, 
      bis 2015 eine nachhaltige Beschaffung von Palm&#246;l sicherzustellen, und 
      setzt ein starkes Zeichen auf dem Weg zur Null Netto-Entwaldung bis 2020.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Das PG Werk im Baden-W&#252;rttembergischen Crailsheim ist eines von vielen 
      Beispielen wie das M&#252;llaufkommen reduziert werden kann.&#8220;Dazu mussten wir 
      umdenken&#8220;, sagt Michael Hagemeyer, Abfallbeauftragter im Werk 
      Crailsheim. &#8222;Unsere Mitarbeiter k&#246;nnen sich nun interaktiv dar&#252;ber 
      informieren, die passende Methode f&#252;r die Entsorgung verschiedener Arten 
      von Abfall zu finden. Es gibt einen zentralen Sammelpunkt, der es 
      erm&#246;glicht 45 verschiedene Arten von Material einer Wiederverwendung 
      zuzuf&#252;hren. Heute werden 13.000 Tonnen Abfall wiederverwendet, 
      rezykliert oder zur Energiegewinnung genutzt. Auf der M&#252;llhalde landet 
      nichts mehr!&#8220;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mit diesen Ergebnissen demonstriert PG messbare Fortschritte bei der 
      Umsetzung seiner langfristigen Nachhaltigkeitsvision, die im September 
      2010 formuliert wurde. Die Vision umfasst den Betrieb seiner Anlagen mit 
      100&#160;% erneuerbarer Energie, die Verwendung von 100&#160;% erneuerbaren oder 
      wiederverwerteten Materialien f&#252;r s&#228;mtliche Produkte und Verpackungen, 
      null Verbraucher- und Herstellungsabfall f&#252;r M&#252;lldeponien sowie die 
      Entwicklung von Produkten, die das Leben von Menschen verbessern und 
      gleichzeitig Ressourcen schonen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8222;Wir freuen uns, bedeutende Fortschritte bei der Umsetzung unserer 
      langfristigen Vision aufzeigen zu k&#246;nnen &#8211; und werden weiterhin auf 
      &#246;kologische Herausforderungen eingehen und diese als Chance zur 
      Innovation nutzen&#8220;, so Len Sauers, Globaler Vizepr&#228;sident f&#252;r 
      Nachhaltigkeit bei PG. &#8222;Die Probleme, die sich uns allen heute stellen, 
      erfordern eine enge Zusammenarbeit und gemeinschaftliche &#220;bernahme von 
      Verantwortung. Wir setzen uns daf&#252;r ein, gemeinsam L&#246;sungen zu 
      erarbeiten und damit sicherzustellen, dass Verbesserungen auf 
      wirtschaftlich nachhaltige Weise umgesetzt werden.&#8220;

			J.P. Morgan Achieves Major Milestone in Tri-Party Repo Market Reforms
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			More than one-third of intraday unwind credit eliminated by stopping 
      non-maturing term repo unwind and providing new collateral 
      reoptimization tools
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan today announced that it has achieved another major milestone 
      in U.S. Tri-Party Repo Market Reform, completely eliminating more than a 
      third of its intraday credit exposure related to the unwind of Tri-Party 
      Repos. J.P. Morgan has become the first tri-party agent to offer new 
      collateral optimization functionality in the US Fixed Income Repo 
      marketplace; this functionality gives dealers new options to adjust 
      their collateral allocation without requiring credit from the clearing 
      bank.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Once again, we have delivered on our promise to provide clients with 
      innovative tools that achieve market reforms and reduce their 
      operational burden," notes Mark Trivedi, Managing Director at J.P. 
      Morgan. New features for clients include the ability to reoptimize 
      collateral in term repos during the settlement window, additional 
      intraday security-for-security substitution tools, and the ability to 
      adjust their collateral mix of new repos after the transaction has 
      settled, up to 6:30 p.m.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Our new infrastructure that supports reoptimization forms the 
      foundation for the rolling settlement and simultaneous exchange modules 
      we will introduce next year," says Trivedi. J.P. Morgan remains on track 
      to deliver these capabilities during the second half of 2013, achieving 
      the Target End State in keeping with the commitments the firm has made 
      to its clients, the markets and the NY Federal Reserve Bank.
    &lt;/p&gt;

				Microsoft's Data Center Research Project in Cheyenne, Wyoming to be powered by fuel cell power plant &#160;
			
				Renewable biogas to be used to generate carbon neutral electricity that is virtually free of pollutants
		&lt;p&gt;
	DANBURY, Conn., Nov. 19, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FuelCell Energy, Inc. (Nasdaq:FCEL), a global leader in the design, manufacture and service of ultra-clean, efficient and reliable fuel cell power plants, today announced a project utilizing a stationary fuel cell power plant to support Microsoft's latest data center research project. The power plant will utilize renewable biogas generated by a wastewater treatment facility as the fuel source to generate ultra-clean and carbon-neutral electricity to power Microsoft's Data Plant project in Cheyenne, Wyoming. This sub-megawatt power plant project enables Microsoft to evaluate the effectiveness of using FuelCell Energy power plants to efficiently use on-site biogas to power future sustainable data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"With the demand for renewable energy resources outstripping available power supplies today, Microsoft is researching new methods to help our operations become more efficient and environmentally sustainable," said Gregg McKnight, general manager, Data Center Advanced Development at Microsoft. "We're excited by the potential for using stationary fuel cells to capture and recycle natural byproducts like biogas. This project will study methods to provide an economical and reliable power supply for data centers that is also scalable and economical for use by other industries."&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The sub-megawatt Direct FuelCell&#174; (DFC&#174;) power plant will be installed at the Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility in Cheyenne, Wyoming by Spring 2013. The fuel cell plant will provide 200 kilowatts of power for Microsoft's Data Plant which will be housed in a modular IT pre-assembled component (ITPAC) that will house servers to recreate a data center environment. Excess power not used by the data center will be provided to the water reclamation facility to offset their electric costs. &#160;In the event of a grid outage, the Data Plant project and fuel cell plant will be configured to operate independently to provide continuous power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Our fuel cell technology is uniquely positioned to provide what other megawatt-class power generation products can't, which is efficiently converting renewable biogas into continuous baseload power right where the biogas is generated and in a manner that is virtually absent of pollutants," said Chip Bottone, President and Chief Executive Officer, FuelCell Energy, Inc.&#160;"The economics of our on-site power generation solutions are well suited for data centers, including the ability to use renewable biogas as a fuel source to provide carbon neutral power."&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	A diverse coalition of entities is participating in bringing the project to fruition, including the Cheyenne Board of Public Utilities, Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power Company, Western Research Institute, the University of Wyoming, the Wyoming Business Council, and Cheyenne LEADS, the economic development organization for Cheyenne and Laramie County, Wyoming.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The city of Cheyenne applied for a $1,500,000 Community Readiness grant through the Wyoming Business Council's Business Ready Communities program earlier this year to fund the needed infrastructure to support the Data Plant project. The application has been recommended by the Business Council board at its November 6, 2012 meeting and is on the December 6, 2012 agenda for the Wyoming State Loan and Investment Board (SLIB) for a final decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Although still in the application phase and the final decision has yet to be made, this is a great project and an example of our broad efforts in advanced energy technologies and clean carbon conversion in Wyoming," said Bob Jensen, Chief Executive Officer, Wyoming Business Council. "Our board approved this application and it will be voted on by the State Loan and Investment Board December 6 for its final decision."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	In May 2012, Microsoft announced their commitment to become carbon neutral beginning in 2013.&#160;Reliable on-site power generation that is environmentally-friendly is a key consideration for Microsoft as they evaluate clean and renewable energy generation for their data centers which power the company's cloud services and support more than 1 billion customers and 20 million businesses globally.&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Stationary DFC power plants convert a fuel source into ultra-clean electricity and usable high temperature heat suitable for making steam.&#160;DFC plants are fuel flexible, capable of operating on clean and abundant natural gas, renewable biogas, directed biogas and other fuels including propane.&#160;The fuel cell generates electricity and heat electrochemically. Due to the absence of combustion, virtually no pollutants are emitted. The almost complete absence of nitrogen oxide (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SOx) and particulate matter is why DFC plants are termed ultra-clean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	DFC plants can be located where biogas is generated and directly use the biogas with only minimal cleaning of the gas. Biogas contains humidity, sulfur and carbon dioxide (CO2). Prior to being used as a fuel source for the Direct FuelCell, the humidity and sulfur must be removed, but the DFC technology does not require the removal of the CO2. This is a cost advantage as pipeline quality biogas, also termed directed biogas, must have the CO2 removed prior to being injected in the gas pipeline, which is an energy-intensive process and adds cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Generating both clean electricity and usable heat from the same unit of fuel enhances efficiency and reduces emissions. &#160;DFC power plants designed and manufactured by FuelCell Energy, Inc. have the highest electrical efficiency of any similar-sized baseload power generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The combination of near-zero pollutants, modest land-use needs, avoidance of supporting transmission and distribution power lines, and quiet operating nature of DFC plants facilitates their siting in populated areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	&#160;About FuelCell Energy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Direct FuelCell&#174; power plants are generating ultra-clean, efficient and reliable power at more than 50 locations worldwide.&#160;With approximately 300 megawatts of power generation capacity installed or in backlog, FuelCell Energy is a global leader in providing ultra-clean baseload distributed generation to utilities, industrial operations, universities, municipal water treatment facilities, government installations and other customers around the world.&#160;The Company's power plants have generated more than one billion kilowatt hours of ultra-clean power using a variety of fuels including renewable biogas from wastewater treatment and food processing, as well as clean natural gas.&#160;For more information please visit our website at www.fuelcellenergy.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

			Pfizer Reports Top-Line Results Of A Phase 3 Study Evaluating 
      Pregabalin Controlled-Release As Treatment For Patients With Fibromyalgia
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced that top-line results of a 
      double-blind, Phase 3 study evaluating pregabalin controlled-release 
      (CR) formulation in patients with fibromyalgia indicate that pregabalin 
      CR had a statistically significant positive effect compared to placebo 
      in the primary endpoint, time to loss of therapeutic response (LTR). 
      Fibromyalgia is a common pain condition in the United States, affecting 
      more than five million Americans. It is characterized by chronic 
      widespread pain and tenderness lasting for three or more months.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This study is the second of three Phase 3 studies of the pregabalin CR 
      formulation to report top-line findings, which will ascertain the 
      potential use of pregabalin as a once-a-day therapy. The top-line 
      results of the first study in adults with partial onset seizures with 
      epilepsy did not meet its primary endpoint. The final study in 
      post-herpetic neuralgia is ongoing. Pfizer will analyze further results 
      of all three studies once data are available.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Collectively, the results of these controlled release studies will 
      allow us to better understand the potential of a once-a-day pregabalin 
      treatment regimen,&#8221; said Steven J. Romano, M.D., senior vice president, 
      head, Medicines Development Group, Global Primary Care Business Unit, 
      Pfizer Inc. &#8220;Reducing the number of times patients need to take their 
      medicine per day while maintaining the same efficacy and safety profile 
      could potentially provide a greater convenience and the potential to 
      enhance treatment adherence and outcomes.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About the Study
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The objective of the double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, 
      randomized withdrawal study was to assess the efficacy and safety of 
      pregabalin CR as treatment for patients with fibromyalgia.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The study was composed of 4 phases: baseline (1 week), single-blind (SB) 
      treatment (6 weeks), double-blind (DB) treatment (13 weeks), and a 
      1-week double-blind taper. Study medication was administered once daily 
      (QD) immediately following the evening meal. During the SB phase, an 
      optimal dose of pregabalin CR (between 300 mg/day to 495 mg/day) was 
      determined. In the DB phase, patients were randomized to continued 
      pregabalin CR treatment at the optimized dose or to matching placebo.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A total of 441 subjects were enrolled into the SB phase from 49 sites in 
      4 countries (U.S., Canada, India, and Taiwan). Of the 441 subjects, 122 
      (28%) completed SB, had &#8805;50% pain response (i.e., &#8805;50% reduction in pain 
      compared to baseline) and were randomized into DB. 122 subjects 
      completed the single-blind phase and were randomized to the double-blind 
      phase. One subject discontinued following randomization without 
      receiving double-blind study medication, so 121 subjects received 
      double-blind study medication and are included in the full analysis set.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The primary endpoint, defined as the time to loss of therapeutic pain 
      response during DB (LTR; 30% pain response relative to the SB baseline 
      mean pain or withdrawal due to lack of efficacy or adverse events), 
      occurred in 34 of 63 (54.0%) patients in the pregabalin group as 
      compared with 41 of 58 (70.7%) subjects in the placebo group. The median 
      time from randomization to LTR was 58 days in the pregabalin group and 
      22 days in the placebo group. The difference between the treatments was 
      statistically significant (log-rank p-value=0.021).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pregabalin CR was well tolerated and the safety profile was consistent 
      with the known profile for pregabalin (immediate release) in 
      fibromyalgia patients. Adverse events reported in 5 percent or more of 
      subjects included dizziness, somnolence, peripheral edema, insomnia, 
      headache, fatigue, nausea, weight increased, vision blurred, dry mouth, 
      and disturbance in attention.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Lyrica
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lyrica&#174; is currently approved for various indications in 120 
      countries and regions globally. Since its first approval from the FDA in 
      2004, Lyrica has been approved for five indications in the U.S., of 
      which four are in the therapeutic area of pain. These indications 
      include neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, 
      post-herpetic neuralgia (pain after shingles), neuropathic pain 
      associated with spinal cord injury, fibromyalgia and partial onset 
      seizures in adults with epilepsy who take one or more drugs for 
      seizures. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) including Lyrica increase the risk 
      of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking AEDs for any 
      indication.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There have been post-marketing reports of angioedema and 
      hypersensitivity with Lyrica. Treatment with Lyrica may cause dizziness, 
      somnolence, dry mouth, edema and blurred vision. Other most common 
      adverse reactions include weight gain, constipation, euphoric mood, 
      balance disorder, increased appetite and thinking abnormal (primarily 
      difficulty with concentration/attention).

&lt;p&gt;  PALM SPRINGS, CA, Nov 19 (Marketwire) -- 
The 9th Annual Clean-Tech Investor Summit, presented by International
Business Forum and chaired by Technology Partners' Ira Ehrenpreis, taking
place February 6-7 in Palm Springs, California, announced today that
attendees of the conference will have the rare opportunity to hear from
two luminaries in the energy industry -- the current Vice President and
Chief Technology Officer of Chevron John W. McDonald and former Chevron
Chief Technology Officer Donald Paul.

    The two CTOs will participate in a keynote conversation titled, "The
Power of Human Energy: Finding Newer, Cleaner Ways to Power the World,"
offering a lively view of an energy company's roadmap to and through the
21st century with an eye towards the integration of new technology, new
infrastructure and needed intelligence for the modern electrical grid. 

    Issues discussed to include: 


--  How does a major energy company address the needs for upgrading
    infrastructure while incorporating the latest intelligence platforms?
--  How will that be translated into costs or savings in both energy and
    economics to the consumer?
--  In a world dominated by headlines of domestic energy finds (natural
    gas and oil) how do the energy companies reflect those assets in their
    long term planning, as well as in any short term economics?
--  Do renewables continue to accelerate as a percentage of the overall
    energy mix and how do Chevron and major energy companies plan on
    participating in that mix of energy feedstocks?

    

As in past years, the 9th annual Clean-Tech Investor Summit is
expected to be another sold-out event bringing together the "who's-who"
of the clean tech sector including leading investors, Fortune 500
executives, and entrepreneurs for two days of high-level presentations,
conversations, and networking. Year after year, the most important people
in the clean tech ecosystem return to the conference, recognizing the
importance of convening the key players of the clean tech industry and
staying on top of the sector's most important trends. 

    Please be sure to reserve your spot at the Summit ASAP, as attendance is
limited to the first 500 delegates. Those interested in attending the
event should visit: www.cleantechsummit.com

			Research and Markets: 2012 Report on the $250 Billion US Computer 
      Software Market Featuring Microsoft, Oracle, IBM Software, Symantec, and 
      Cognizant
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/2zqm2f/computer_software) 
      has announced the addition of the "Computer 
      Software" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The US computer software industry involves about 60,000 companies with 
      combined annual revenue of about $250 billion. About 60 percent of 
      industry revenue comes from software publishing; custom programming 
      accounts for the remainder. Large companies include Microsoft, Oracle, 
      IBM Software, Symantec, and Cognizant Technology Solutions. The US 
      packaged software segment is concentrated: the 50 largest companies 
      generate about 70 percent of revenue. The US custom programming segment 
      is highly fragmented.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A significant majority of computer software is developed overseas, 
      particularly in fast-growing countries throughout the Asia/Pacific 
      region. Major companies based outside the US include Nintendo (Japan), 
      Infosys Technologies (India), and SAP (Germany).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Competitive Landscape:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The US economy heavily influences business spending for software 
      products. The success of programming companies depends heavily on strong 
      technical expertise. The success of packaged-software companies depends 
      on technical expertise and good marketing. Small software companies 
      compete mainly by developing packaged products in small niches or 
      producing custom products for individuals. Many small companies form 
      alliances with larger ones to market their products.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The packaged software industry is capital-intensive: average annual 
      revenue per worker is about $560,000.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Products, Operations  Technology:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Packaged software products are generally programs that can be installed 
      and operated by the customer with little or no assistance, such as an 
      operating system. Custom programming either creates a new software 
      product from scratch, or, more typically, customizes an existing 
      software product for customer use.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Key Topics Covered:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      1. Industry Overview
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      2. Quarterly Industry Update
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE Nov 20 (Reuters) - A Google expert witness
testified on Tuesday that Microsoft will make roughly $94
billion in revenue through 2017 from its Xbox game console and
Surface tablet that use Google's patented wireless technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Dansky, an expert for Google's Motorola Mobility
unit, testified on the last day of a high stakes trial over
patents between Microsoft and Google in Seattle. The $94 billion
figure he cited also includes a wireless adapter that Microsoft
no longer sells. It was not clear how far back he was counting
past revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined comment on the figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The week-long trial in a Seattle federal court examined how
much of a royalty Microsoft Corp should pay Google Inc
 for a license to some of Motorola's patents. Google
bought Motorola earlier this year for $12.5 billion, partly for
its library of communications patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motorola had sought up to $4 billion a year for its wireless
and video patents, while Microsoft argues its rival deserves
just over $1 million a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If U.S. District Judge James Robart decides Google deserves
only a small royalty, then its Motorola patents would be a
weaker bargaining chip for Google to negotiate licensing deals
with rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rapid rise of smartphones has sparked an explosion of
litigation between major players disputing ownership of the
underlying technology and the design of handsets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc and Microsoft have been litigating in
courts around the world against Google and partners like Samsung
Electronics Co Ltd, which use the Android operating
system on their mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple contends that Android is basically a copy of its iOS
smartphone software, and Microsoft holds patents that it
contends cover a number of Android features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In return, Motorola and some other Android hardware makers
launched countering legal action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before trial, Robart said testimony about patent license
agreements between Microsoft, Motorola and other tech companies
could be disclosed to the public, along with other sensitive
financial information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the judge reversed himself this week and said he
was bound by appellate precedent to keep that information
secret. On Tuesday he cleared the courtroom and heard two hours
of testimony in secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the open session, Dansky said Motorola's video
patents are crucial to Microsoft and other tech companies, and
deserve a high royalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You will have a difficult time selling smart phones or
tablets," Dansky said, without Motorola's technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robart is not expected to release a ruling for several weeks
as both companies must file further legal briefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case in U.S. District Court, Western District of
Washington is Microsoft Corp. vs. Motorola Inc., 10-cv-1823.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Chevron Corp sought to open an investigation on Tuesday into New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, claiming he pressured the oil company to settle environmental litigation in Ecuador in exchange for campaign contributions from supporters of the lawsuit's plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron said it filed a complaint before the New York State Joint Commission on Public Ethics, seeking a probe of DiNapoli and current and past members of his staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Chevron said the plaintiffs' supporters have contributed more than $60,000 to DiNapoli's campaign, as well as "other political benefits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complaint alleges that Steven Donziger, the plaintiffs' U.S. legal adviser, and his associates wooed DiNapoli into applying pressure on Chevron through campaign donations and an offer to meet with the rock musician Sting and his wife, Trudie Styler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said DiNapoli and Donziger and his associates engaged in "an apparent quid pro quo exchange."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DiNapoli oversees the New York State Common Retirement Fund, which owns more than $800 million of Chevron stock, the company said, citing U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a baseless attempt by big oil to intimidate me," DiNapoli said in a statement. "The allegations are without merit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for DiNapoli, Jennifer Freeman, said the comptroller has never met Sting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having failed at derailing the lawsuit, (Chevron) now seeks to discredit anyone associated with it," a spokeswoman for Donziger, Karen Hinton, said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specific actions Chevron objected to by DiNapoli include sponsoring shareholder resolutions "and making public statements against Chevron that were explicitly intended to pressure the company to settle" the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, DiNapoli said his call on Chevron to settle the Ecuador litigation "is about protecting shareholder value and fulfilling my fiduciary responsibility to the New York State Common Retirement Fund."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has been locked in an almost two-decade conflict with residents of Ecuador's Lago Agrio region over claims that Texaco, which Chevron bought in 2001, contaminated the area from 1964 to 1992. The plaintiffs from the villages in the oil-rich Amazon won an $18.2 billion judgment from an Ecuadorean court against Chevron. The company claims the judgment was fraudulent and unenforceable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graham Erion, an attorney representing the Ecuadorians, said in a statement that DiNapoli "has every right to question Chevron's actions... Turning on its own shareholders shows how desperate Chevron has become. Chevron needs to listen to its investors instead of attacking them and own up to its responsibilities in Ecuador."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, has not settled the litigation in Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Chevron has few assets in Ecuador that can be taken as compensation, the plaintiffs are trying to get the ruling enforced in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, DiNapoli sponsored a shareholder resolution that would have required Chevron to appoint an independent director with environmental expertise. At the time, he and 39 other Chevron investors also called on the company to settle the protracted legal battle. DiNapoli made a similar appeal last year and in previous years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. trial has been set for next fall in the Chevron lawsuit that accuses Ecuadorean residents, their lawyers and advisers of fraud in obtaining the pollution award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Nichola Groom; editing by Andrew Hay, Leslie Adler, Bernard Orr and Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

contributed more than $60,000 to DiNapoli's campaign, as well as
"other political benefits."
    The complaint alleges that Steven Donziger, the plaintiffs'
U.S. legal adviser, and his associates wooed DiNapoli into
applying pressure on Chevron through campaign donations and an
offer to meet with the rock musician Sting and his wife, Trudie
Styler.  
    The company said DiNapoli and Donziger and his associates
engaged in "an apparent quid pro quo exchange."
    DiNapoli oversees the New York State Common Retirement Fund,
which owns more than $800 million of Chevron stock, the company
said, citing U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
    "This is a baseless attempt by big oil to intimidate me,"
DiNapoli said in a statement. "The allegations are without
merit."
    A spokeswoman for DiNapoli, Jennifer Freeman, said the
comptroller has never met Sting.
    "Having failed at derailing the lawsuit, (Chevron) now seeks
to discredit anyone associated with it," a spokeswoman for
Donziger, Karen Hinton, said in an email.
    The specific actions Chevron objected to by DiNapoli include
sponsoring shareholder resolutions "and making public statements
against Chevron that were explicitly intended to pressure the
company to settle" the lawsuit.
    In a statement, DiNapoli said his call on Chevron to settle
the Ecuador litigation "is about protecting shareholder value
and fulfilling my fiduciary responsibility to the New York State
Common Retirement Fund."
    Chevron has been locked in an almost two-decade conflict
with residents of Ecuador's Lago Agrio region over claims that
Texaco, which Chevron bought in 2001, contaminated the area from
1964 to 1992. The plaintiffs from the villages in the oil-rich
Amazon won an $18.2 billion judgment from an Ecuadorean court
against Chevron. The company claims the judgment was fraudulent
and unenforceable.
    Graham Erion, an attorney representing the Ecuadorians, said
in a statement that DiNapoli "has every right to question
Chevron's actions... Turning on its own shareholders shows how
desperate Chevron has become. Chevron needs to listen to its
investors instead of attacking them and own up to its
responsibilities in Ecuador." 
    Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, has not settled the
litigation in Ecuador.
    Because Chevron has few assets in Ecuador that can be taken
as compensation, the plaintiffs are trying to get the ruling
enforced in other countries.
    Earlier this year, DiNapoli sponsored a shareholder
resolution that would have required Chevron to appoint an
independent director with environmental expertise. At the time,
he and 39 other Chevron investors also called on the company to
settle the protracted legal battle. DiNapoli made a similar
appeal last year and in previous years.  
    A U.S. trial has been set for next fall in the Chevron
lawsuit that accuses Ecuadorean residents, their lawyers and
advisers of fraud in obtaining the pollution award.

      Fitch Assigns IDRs of 'A/F1'to Goldman Sachs International Bank
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has assigned Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of 'A/F1'to 
      Goldman Sachs International Bank (GSIB), a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
      The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Goldman). The Rating Outlook for GSIB is 
      Stable, in line with Fitch's Rating Outlook of Goldman.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING RATIONALE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IDRs of GSIB are equalized with Goldman's IDRs reflecting Fitch's view 
      that GSIB is core to Goldman's business strategy and operations. Fitch 
      believes Goldman would fully support GSIB in the event of need.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      GSIB is a key part of Goldman's international operations acting as a 
      primary European bond dealer; originating, trading and syndicating 
      loans; conducting securities borrowing/lending activities; and offering 
      multi-currency deposits. GSIB is a core part of Goldman's international 
      expansion efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch believes there is a high level of management/operational 
      integration between GSIB and other core Goldman operations. GSIB 
      maintains prudent liquidity and capitalization which are augmented by 
      the capacity to tap liquidity and additional capital from Goldman.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Given Fitch's view that GSIB is a core subsidiary of Goldman, IDRs of 
      GSIB would change in conjunction with any changes to Goldman's IDRs. In 
      the event that Fitch no longer considers GSIB as a core part of 
      Goldman's operations, ratings of GSIB could be negatively affected.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman's IDRs were affirmed on Oct. 10, 2012 with a Stable Outlook as 
      part of Fitch's Global Trading and Universal Bank (GTUB) periodic 
      review. IDRs continue to be supported by Goldman's leading investment 
      banking franchise, strong risk management, solid liquidity position, and 
      better-than-average capital position. These factors are reflected in 
      Goldman's Viability rating of 'a'. Goldman's IDRs are further 
      underpinned by the prospect of U.S. government support in the event of 
      need.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman's IDRs have limited upward potential, given Goldman's business 
      focus on the capital markets. Goldman's IDRs could be negatively 
      pressured if both its financial profile deteriorates and Fitch's view of 
      support changes. Please see the press commentary 'Fitch Affirms Goldman 
      Sachs' IDRs at 'A/F1'; Outlook Stable' dated Oct. 10, 2012 available at www.fitchratings.com

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - European health regulators on Tuesday approved an eagerly anticipated blood thinner developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Pfizer Inc for preventing strokes and blood clots in patients with an irregular heartbeat known as atrial fibrillation, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug Eliquis, also known as apixaban, is widely considered one of the most important new products for the two U.S. drugmakers, with multibillion-dollar annual sales potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European approval was expected after an advisory panel this year recommended it for atrial fibrillation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not unexpected, but it's positive to finally get an afib approval under the belt for Eliquis," said MKM Partners analyst Jon Lecroy, who sees annual sales reaching $2 billion by about 2017. "We're looking for a March approval or earlier in the U.S. for the same indication," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to decide on the proposed use of the drug in the world's biggest market by March 17, after delaying a decision in June to review more information from clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Commission approval marks the first regulatory approval for Eliquis for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation patients in any market, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliquis belongs to a new class of medicines designed to replace decades old warfarin for preventing blood clots in heart patients and after hip or knee replacement surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It already was approved in 27 European Union countries for prevention of certain blood clots called venous thromboembelisms following elective hip or knee replacement surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But atrial fibrillation, which greatly raises the risk of strokes, is considered by far the largest and most important use for the new drugs, that include Xarelto from Bayer and Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Pradaxa from privately held Boehringer Ingelheim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliquis, like Xarelto, works by inhibiting a protein called Factor Xa that plays a critical role in blood clotting. Pradaxa has a slightly different mechanism of action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 6 million people in Europe and another 5.8 million in the United States suffer from atrial fibrillation, the most common form of heart arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In clinical trials, Eliquis demonstrated superiority over warfarin in reducing the risk of strokes, major bleeding and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warfarin, widely used for more than half a century, is inexpensive and works well, but requires close and regular patient monitoring as well as lifestyle and dietary changes that are not necessary with the newer medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Patients with atrial fibrillation have a five times greater risk of stroke and there remains a critical public health need for improved treatment options to reduce this risk," Lars Wallentin, director of cardiology at Uppsala Clinical Research Centre and University Hospital in Sweden, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He called Eliquis "an important new treatment option for health care professionals, who now have an oral anticoagulant with superior outcomes versus warfarin."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street analysts have said that, based on clinical efficacy and safety data, they believe Eliquis will become the dominant player in an estimated $10 billion market for the new blood thinners once it receives U.S. approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read, in a statement, said he believes Eliquis "has the potential to transform the standard of care in stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares were up 5 cents at $24.19 and Bristol-Myers shares were up 2 cents at $32.05, in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;* Drug awaiting U.S. approval decision by March 17&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Eliquis seen as future multibillion-dollar seller&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Pfizer, Bristol-Myers shares up slightly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Bill Berkrot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nov 20 (Reuters) - European health regulators on Tuesday
approved an eagerly anticipated blood thinner developed by
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Pfizer Inc for
preventing strokes and blood clots in patients with an irregular
heartbeat known as atrial fibrillation, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug Eliquis, also known as apixaban, is widely
considered one of the most important new products for the two
U.S. drugmakers, with multibillion-dollar annual sales

this year recommended it for atrial fibrillation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not unexpected, but it's positive to finally get an

on the proposed use of the drug in the world's biggest market by
March 17, after delaying a decision in June to review more
information from clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Commission approval marks the first regulatory
approval for Eliquis for stroke prevention in atrial
fibrillation patients in any market, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliquis belongs to a new class of medicines designed to
replace decades old warfarin for preventing blood clots in heart
patients and after hip or knee replacement surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It already was approved in 27 European Union countries for
prevention of certain blood clots called venous thromboembelisms
following elective hip or knee replacement surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But atrial fibrillation, which greatly raises the risk of
strokes, is considered by far the largest and most important use
for the new drugs, that include Xarelto from Bayer 
and Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Pradaxa from privately held
Boehringer Ingelheim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliquis, like Xarelto, works by inhibiting a protein called
Factor Xa that plays a critical role in blood clotting. Pradaxa
has a slightly different mechanism of action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 6 million people in Europe and another 5.8 million in
the United States suffer from atrial fibrillation, the most
common form of heart arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In clinical trials, Eliquis demonstrated superiority over
warfarin in reducing the risk of strokes, major bleeding and
death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warfarin, widely used for more than half a century, is
inexpensive and works well, but requires close and regular
patient monitoring as well as lifestyle and dietary changes that
are not necessary with the newer medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Patients with atrial fibrillation have a five times greater
risk of stroke and there remains a critical public health need
for improved treatment options to reduce this risk," Lars
Wallentin, director of cardiology at Uppsala Clinical Research
Centre and University Hospital in Sweden, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He called Eliquis "an important new treatment option for
health care professionals, who now have an oral anticoagulant
with superior outcomes versus warfarin."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street analysts have said that, based on clinical
efficacy and safety data, they believe Eliquis will become the
dominant player in an estimated $10 billion market for the new
blood thinners once it receives U.S. approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read, in a statement, said he
believes Eliquis "has the potential to transform the standard of
care in stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares were up 5 cents at $24.19 and Bristol-Myers
shares were up 2 cents at $32.05, in afternoon trading on the

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COSTA MESA, Calif., Nov. 20, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Walter Ledda, CEO and Chairman of Morgan Drexen Integrated Systems, has been appointed to serve on the marketing committee of Pacific Symphony in Orange County, CA. In his capacity, Ledda will assist in developing and implementing marketing strategies for the award-winning Symphony.&#160; A classically-trained concert violinist, Ledda is thrilled to join such a prestigious and talented group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"My parents were both passionate musicians who nurtured my love of the violin and classical music in general," says Ledda.&#160; "I will bring this passion with me to the marketing committee of Pacific Symphony.&#160; I look forward to helping the Symphony further blossom and expand its already impressive reach."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Officials with Pacific Symphony, the largest orchestra formed in the United States in the last 40 years, say they are excited to have Ledda on board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Walter Ledda will be a valued addition to our marketing committee," says Pacific Symphony's executive vice chairman Mike Kerr. "We look forward to learning from his marketing expertise as well as his deep musical knowledge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Earlier this year, Ledda was appointed to the Development Committee of Make A Wish&#174; Orange County and the Inland Empire.&#160; He has been an ardent supporter of the Make A Wish&#174; program for many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Ledda's volunteer service with the Symphony and Make A Wish&#174; comes as Morgan Drexen continues to expand its charitable contributions in the local community.&#160; So far in 2012, Morgan Drexen and its employees have donated to the listed non-profit groups:&lt;/p&gt;
			
		Make-A-Wish&#174;
			
		American Heart Association
			
		Children's Hospital Orange County (CHOC)
			
		PureGame
			
		American Cancer Society

	Morgan Drexen employees also teamed up to collect hundreds of pounds of food as well as clothing and other household items for the Orange County Rescue Mission.&#160; Mr. Ledda has personally donated to CHOC, as well as significant amounts to other non-profit groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Morgan Drexen is founded on the principles of helping people in need," explains Ledda.&#160; "The attorneys we support are dedicated to assisting Americans who are facing tremendous challenges.&#160; We take that same approach with our charitable efforts:&#160; let's support groups which dedicate themselves to helping those who are struggling or are sick or have nowhere to turn.&#160; I have been very fortunate in my life and I know the inherent value of giving back.&#160; Our employees know it too.&#160; They have proven time and time again how generous they can be and I have no doubt that pattern will continue well into the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Morgan Drexen provides advanced automated software and back-office paraprofessional support services to attorneys across the United States.&#160; The company, based in Costa Mesa, CA, employs more than 340-people and recently celebrated its fifth anniversary.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      Jersey Community Capital
			(NJCC), who will partner with 
      other organizations to help microenterprises in New York and New 
      Jersey stay in business. Accion and NJCC will each receive $250,000 
      to provide select grants and bridge loans at discounted rates with 
      generous repayment options and grace periods. Funds will be used to 
      repair facilities, repair or replace equipment, replenish business 
      supplies, provide temporary transportation and storage needs, and pay 
      employees. Microenterprises are sole proprietors or small businesses 
      with fewer than 10 employees and revenues below $250,000 annually. 
      Accion and NJCC will also work with other partners to help identify 
      businesses in need of emergency assistance with continuity and 
      restoration. Accion and NJCC are nonprofit, community development 
      financial institutions that provide financing and technical assistance 
      to organizations that support development in low- to moderate-income 
      communities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			All 
      Hands Volunteers will receive $200,000 to assist with relief and 
      recovery efforts in Staten Island
			and the Rockaways. In 
      addition, JPMorgan Chase employees are volunteering with All Hands 
      Volunteers. All Hands Volunteers is a nonprofit organization that 
      provides hands-on assistance to communities in need and those suffering 
      in the wake of natural disasters.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Feeding 
      America will receive $200,000 to meet the increasing needs of 
      food banks in New Jersey. The funding will enable the Community 
      FoodBank of New Jersey and The Food Bank of Monmouth and Ocean Counties 
      to purchase food and hire staff in the near term. Feeding America is the 
      largest US-based hunger-relief charity. It consists of a network of more 
      than 200 food banks and food rescue organizations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The 
      Brooklyn Community Foundation will receive $100,000 to 
      capitalize local nonprofit organizations to continue their grassroots 
      operations and restore their capacity to serve the Red Hook 
      community in Brooklyn, which is one of the most severely impacted areas 
      of the borough. The Brooklyn Community Foundation is a public charity 
      that aims to strengthen communities in Brooklyn through local giving, 
      grant-making and community service.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Convoy 
      of Hope will receive $100,000 to continue its recovery efforts 
      in Staten Island, Long Island, Newark, Bayonne, and Lower Manhattan. 
      In response to the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, Convoy of Hope has 
      brought more than 50 truckloads of materials and supplies to affected 
      areas in New Jersey and New York, established a network for distribution 
      of materials and developed a continuing pipeline of suppliers. The 
      organization has committed to working in both the near term and longer 
      term in affected areas. They are also deploying debris removal teams to 
      affected areas as needed. Convoy of Hope is a nonprofit that serves 
      communities by providing food to children, disaster response and 
      community outreach initiatives.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;There are four reasons why JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s response to Superstorm 
      Sandy is an absolute &#8216;quadfecta&#8217; for microbusinesses,&#8221; said Paul 
      Quintero, CEO of Accion East and Online. &#8220;First, the effort is a 
      tri-state response, matching the wake left by Superstorm Sandy; second, 
      the response is focused on microbusinesses, which make up over 85% of 
      all firms; third, the grant provides Accion the ability to reach 
      Sandy-impacted businesses with increased underwriting flexibility and 
      favorable repayment terms; and finally, the program includes grant 
      support to adversely affected but viable microbusinesses.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, JPMorgan Chase was one of the 
      first companies to announce it would offer disaster relief, with up to 
      $5 billion of support for small businesses and $5 million in charitable 
      relief. It also dispatched food trucks into the hardest hit areas of New 
      York City and launched food drives to get food to the hungry, brought 
      ATMs into severely affected areas to help residents access funds, waived 
      fees for customers, reopened branches quickly and allowed anyone to 
      charge their electronic devices, and accepted donations to the American 
      Red Cross through its Rewards program and ATMs. The firm also organized 
      programs for employees to volunteer in hard-hit communities, as well as 
      relief efforts to help its own employees.

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      La denuncia de Chevron est&#225; relacionada con el litigio que actualmente 
      se ventila en el Ecuador y demuestra c&#243;mo el contralor DiNapoli, quien 
      supervisa el Fondo de Pensiones del estado de Nueva York y quien seg&#250;n 
      informaci&#243;n provista por la SEC (Comisi&#243;n de Valores) es due&#241;o de m&#225;s de 
      800 millones de d&#243;lares en acciones de Chevron, aparentemente incumpli&#243; 
      con sus obligaciones &#233;ticas y fiduciarias. Bajo la Ley de Funcionarios 
      P&#250;blicos de Nueva York, est&#225; prohibido que dichos funcionarios tengan

      conflicto sustancial con el fiel desempe&#241;o de sus funciones en beneficio 
      del inter&#233;s p&#250;blico&#8221;. La evidencia demuestra que el Contralor DiNapoli 
      utiliz&#243; su oficina para apoyar la maniobra de los abogados de los 
      demandantes ecuatorianos para presionar a Chevron a forzar un acuerdo, a 
      cambio de beneficios recibidos de parte de los representantes de los 
      demandantes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Quienes apoyan a los demandantes, entre otras cosas, han realizado 
      contribuciones financieras directas a la campa&#241;a de DiNapoli, las que 
      superan los 60.000 d&#243;lares y le han otorgado otros beneficios pol&#237;ticos. 
      En un aparente intercambio de compensaciones, DiNapoli ha dado su firme 
      apoyo y ha usado su oficina p&#250;blica para ejercer acciones en nombre de 
      los demandantes, tales como patrocinar resoluciones de los accionistas y 
      emitir declaraciones p&#250;blicas en contra de Chevron, las que estaban 
      expl&#237;citamente dirigidas a presionar a la compa&#241;&#237;a a llegar a un arreglo 
      en la fraudulenta demanda.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;La persistente defensa del Contralor se ha dado pese a las reiteradas 
      conclusiones a las que han llegado distintas cortes federales en los 
      Estados Unidos, en relaci&#243;n a que el proceso en el Ecuador est&#225; 
      contaminado por el fraude&#8221;, afirm&#243; Hewitt Pate, vicepresidente y 
      consejero general de Chevron. &#8220;Las acciones del se&#241;or DiNapoli sirven 
      s&#243;lo a sus promotores pol&#237;ticos, no as&#237; a los ciudadanos del Estado de 
      Nueva York o los beneficiarios del Fondo de pensiones. Este tipo de 
      conducta en b&#250;squeda de retribuciones constituye una aparente violaci&#243;n 
      de sus responsabilidades &#233;ticas y legales que merece una investigaci&#243;n&#8221;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      El controlador DiNapoli asumi&#243; sus funciones en el 2007, luego de que su 
      predecesor, Alan Hevesi, abandonara el cargo bajo acusaciones de 
      conducta indebida, que incluyeron un esc&#225;ndalo por pagos ilegales que

			Chevron Files Ethics Complaint against New York State Comptroller 
      Thomas DiNapoli
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Complaint details apparent breaches of ethical duties to the citizens 
      of the State of New York
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) filed a complaint 
      before the New York State Joint Commission on Public Ethics today, 
      seeking an investigation of New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli 
      as well as current and past members of his staff for multiple violations 
      of New York Public Officers Law.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron&#8217;s complaint relates to ongoing litigation in Ecuador and 
      demonstrates how Comptroller DiNapoli, who oversees the New York State 
      Common Retirement Fund, which, according to SEC filings, owns more than 
      $800 million of Chevron stock, apparently breached his ethical and 
      fiduciary duties. Under New York Public 
      Officers Law, public officials are prohibited from having &#8220;any 
      interest, financial or otherwise&#8230;which is in substantial conflict with 
      the proper discharge of his duties in the public interest.&#8221; Evidence 
      shows that Comptroller DiNapoli used his office to support the 
      Ecuadorian plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers&#8217; scheme to pressure Chevron into settling 
      the lawsuit in exchange for benefits received from the plaintiffs&#8217; 
      representatives.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The plaintiffs&#8217; supporters, amongst other things, have made direct 
      financial contributions to DiNapoli&#8217;s campaign in excess of $60,000 
      and have given him other political benefits. In an apparent quid pro 
      quo exchange, DiNapoli has given his unwavering support and used his 
      public office to take actions on behalf of the plaintiffs, such as 
      sponsoring shareholder resolutions and making public statements against 
      Chevron that were explicitly intended to pressure the company to settle 
      the fraudulent lawsuit.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Comptroller&#8217;s continued advocacy has come despite repeated findings 
      by U.S. federal courts that the Ecuador litigation is tainted by fraud,&#8221; 
      said Hewitt Pate, Chevron vice president and general counsel. &#8220;Mr. 
      DiNapoli&#8217;s actions serve only his political patrons, not the citizens of 
      the State of New York or the beneficiaries of the Common Retirement 
      Fund. This type of quid pro quo behavior is an apparent breach of 
      ethical and legal responsibilities that warrants investigation.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Comptroller DiNapoli took office in 2007 after his predecessor, Alan 
      Hevesi, left office under allegations of misconduct, including a 
      pay-for-play scandal that ultimately resulted in prison time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Note to Editors:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron is defending itself against false allegations that it is 
      responsible for alleged environmental and social harms in the Oriente 
      region of Ecuador. Chevron never conducted oil production operations in 
      Ecuador, and its subsidiary Texaco Petroleum Co. (&#8220;TexPet&#8221;) fully 
      remediated its share of environmental impacts arising from oil 
      production operations, before leaving Ecuador in 1992. After the 
      remediation was certified by all agencies of the Ecuadorian government 
      responsible for oversight, TexPet received a complete release from 
      Ecuador's national, provincial, and municipal governments that 
      extinguished all claims before Chevron acquired TexPet in 2001. All 
      legitimate scientific evidence exonerates Chevron and proves that the 
      remediated sites pose no significant risks to human health or the 
      environment.

      Ecuador, and its subsidiary Texaco Petroleum Co. (&#8220;TexPet&#8221;) fully 
      remediated its share of environmental impacts arising from oil 
      production operations, before leaving Ecuador in 1992. After the 
      remediation was certified by all agencies of the Ecuadorian government 
      responsible for oversight, TexPet received a complete release from 
      Ecuador's national, provincial, and municipal governments that 
      extinguished all claims before Chevron acquired TexPet in 2001. All 
      legitimate scientific evidence exonerates Chevron and proves that the 
      remediated sites pose no significant risks to human health or the 
      environment.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cupertino, Calif., Nov. 20, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ForeScout Technologies,
Inc., a leading provider of automated security control solutions
for Fortune 1000 enterprises and government organizations, today
announced that it has been certified by Q1 Labs, an IBM company and
global provider of security intelligence solutions, for its

Security Intelligence Partner Program (SIPP). This partnership
will allow joint customers to greatly improve real-time visibility,
security intelligence and automated control while delivering
real-time monitoring and enterprise risk assessment of
non-compliant managed and unmanaged network devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, security threats are originating from unmanaged
devices such as smartphones and tablets, a problem solved by
integrating ForeScout CounterACT Network Access Control (NAC) with
the IBM QRadar Security Intelligence Platform. The joint solution
provides customers with a real-time view of enterprise-wide threats
that can originate from non-compliant devices and rapid remediation
of them to reduce overall business risk. CounterACT
identifies all network devices in real-time, assesses whether or
not it is compliant, and if necessary blocks the device or
redirects it to a secure guest access network, and attempts to
remediate the issue - all from a single management console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through this integration, QRadar captures, retains and analyzes
events generated from ForeScout CounterACT, including network
access incidents and policy violations for endpoints and mobile
devices. As a member of Q1 Labs' Security Intelligence Program,
ForeScout leverages Q1 Labs' open protocols, including LEEF (Log
Event Enhanced Format) to enhance correlation of security and
application layer event data. Furthermore, QRadar can be configured
to send action response commands to CounterACT to mitigate
QRadar-correlated threats and violations. This level of network
access control (NAC), log management and security event
management integration enables security professionals to further
streamline incident response, forensics and compliance
processes.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any unmanaged, unknown or insecure devices, including personal
mobile devices, on a corporate network present serious security
risks and potential operational impact to IT," said Avi Zelovich,
director of product management for ForeScout. "Our alliance with
IBM Security helps to alleviate this challenge by giving
enterprises visibility into every single device on their network,
which greatly improves their overall security posture and GRC
compliance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By integrating ForeScout CounterACT with IBM's QRadar,
customers can better see and manage access and endpoint compliance
policies and controls for all users and devices, whether using
managed or unmanaged BYOD personal mobile devices, as well as take
directed action on eminent threats and known violations," said Matt
Ward, senior product manager, IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information about the Security Intelligence Partner
Program, please visit&#160;http://q1labs.com/partners/security-intelligence-partner-program.aspx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

ForeScout is a fully integrated NAC solution that delivers hybrid
802.1X and agentless NAC functionality making it the easiest and
most flexible to deploy, administer and scale. CounterACT lets
organizations see and control everything connected to their
network, no matter the device or user. The platform employs 802.1X,
RADIUS and multi-factor authentication, identity and endpoint
assessment technologies to grant, limit or block access, as well as
manage guests and mobile devices in real-time. Advanced policy
enforcement capabilities allow administrators to set rules that can
dynamically find and fix endpoint configuration and security issues
with little or no intervention, or to automatically quarantine or
remove devices in compliance violation or exhibiting malicious
behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      49% interest in the joint venture. VISA Steel will hold the remaining 
      51%. The joint venture, which will be unlevered at closing, will be 
      comprised of VISA Steel&#8217;s existing 400,000 MT per annum heat recovery 
      coke plant and associated steam generation units at Kalinganagar in

&lt;p&gt;* Federal ban on market-based rates will not apply in ERCOT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Market players cite importance of JPMorgan unit in West
Texas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Nov 21 (Reuters) - A federal regulator's order
penalizing JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's energy trading arm will
not affect the unit's business activity in the Texas wholesale
power market, state and federal agencies said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)
said it would revoke JP Morgan Ventures Energy Corp's ability to
charge competitive prices for physical power it sells for six
months starting in April 2013 after it made factual
misrepresentations during an investigation into market
manipulation in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The order created uncertainty in the Texas wholesale power
market, according to industry sources, because JP Morgan
operates in Texas and has a significant presence in the West
Texas market which is less liquid than other regions of the
state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which
oversees the $34 billion wholesale power market for most of the
state, said the ruling would have no direct impact on JP
Morgan's business in Texas because ERCOT is not subject to FERC
jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ruling is based on FERC authority that does not apply
in ERCOT, so it has no direct effect on JP Morgan's market
activities here," according to a statement from the grid
operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ERCOT expects that all market participants, including JP
Morgan, will comply with all relevant laws, regulations and
market rules, and we have no indication at this time that JP
Morgan is not compliant with its obligations as a market
participant in this region," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC officials concurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The order "does not suspend JP Morgan's ability to make
sales at market-based rates within ERCOT, because sales within
ERCOT are not subject to the commission's jurisdiction under
section 205 of the Federal Power Act," said FERC spokesman Craig
Cano in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market-based rates allow power traders like JP Morgan to
sell electricity at whatever price the market will bear. If
electricity traders lose the authority to trade at market-based
rates, they must trade at much lower cost-based or other rates,
hurting their trading profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ERCOT said the agency and Texas regulators will continue to
perform market oversight activity and "will address any
compliance issues that arise by any market participant."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies that buy power in West Texas said the loss of
participation by the JPMorgan unit, even for six months, could
hurt the ability to buy power for longer periods of time, a
market that is fairly illiquid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan did not respond to a request for comment. FERC's
order does not affect its ability to trade derivatives, futures,
natural gas and other commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Section 205 of the Federal Power Act grants FERC the
authority to determine the reasonableness of rates charged by
public utilities that transmit or sell power in interstate
commerce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike other U.S. power markets, ERCOT operates outside of
direct FERC jurisdiction due to its historical status as a
"power island," with limited ability to import or export power
across state lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - A Google expert witness testified on Tuesday that Microsoft will make roughly $94 billion in revenue through 2017 from its Xbox game console and Surface tablet that use Google's patented wireless technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Dansky, an expert for Google's Motorola Mobility unit, testified on the last day of a high stakes trial over patents between Microsoft and Google in Seattle. The $94 billion figure he cited also includes a wireless adapter that Microsoft no longer sells. It was not clear how far back he was counting past revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined comment on the figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The week-long trial in a Seattle federal court examined how much of a royalty Microsoft Corp should pay Google Inc for a license to some of Motorola's patents. Google bought Motorola earlier this year for $12.5 billion, partly for its library of communications patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motorola had sought up to $4 billion a year for its wireless and video patents, while Microsoft argues its rival deserves just over $1 million a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If U.S. District Judge James Robart decides Google deserves only a small royalty, then its Motorola patents would be a weaker bargaining chip for Google to negotiate licensing deals with rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rapid rise of smartphones has sparked an explosion of litigation between major players disputing ownership of the underlying technology and the design of handsets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc and Microsoft have been litigating in courts around the world against Google and partners like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, which use the Android operating system on their mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple contends that Android is basically a copy of its iOS smartphone software, and Microsoft holds patents that it contends cover a number of Android features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In return, Motorola and some other Android hardware makers launched countering legal action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before trial, Robart said testimony about patent license agreements between Microsoft, Motorola and other tech companies could be disclosed to the public, along with other sensitive financial information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the judge reversed himself this week and said he was bound by appellate precedent to keep that information secret. On Tuesday he cleared the courtroom and heard two hours of testimony in secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the open session, Dansky said Motorola's video patents are crucial to Microsoft and other tech companies, and deserve a high royalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You will have a difficult time selling smart phones or tablets," Dansky said, without Motorola's technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robart is not expected to release a ruling for several weeks as both companies must file further legal briefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case in U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington is Microsoft Corp. vs. Motorola Inc., 10-cv-1823.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lisa Dembiczak; Writing by Dan Levine; Editing by Richard Pullin)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Nov 21 (Reuters) - A federal regulator's order
penalizing JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co's energy trading arm
will not affect the unit's business activity in the Texas
wholesale power market, state and federal agencies said on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)
said it would suspend the ability of JP Morgan Ventures Energy
Corp to receive competitive market prices for physical power it
sells for six months starting in April 2013, after it made
factual misrepresentations during an investigation into market
manipulation in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The order created uncertainty in the Texas wholesale power
market, according to industry sources, because JP Morgan
operates in Texas and has a significant presence in the West
Texas market which is less liquid than other regions in the
state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which
oversees the $34 billion wholesale power market for most of the
state, said the ruling would have no direct impact on JP
Morgan's business because ERCOT is not subject to FERC
jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ruling is based on FERC authority that does not apply
in ERCOT, so it has no direct effect on JP Morgan's market
activities here," according to a statement from the grid
operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ERCOT expects that all market participants, including JP
Morgan, will comply with all relevant laws, regulations and
market rules, and we have no indication at this time that JP
Morgan is not compliant with its obligations as a market
participant in this region," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC officials concurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The order "does not suspend JP Morgan's ability to make
sales at market-based rates within ERCOT, because sales within
ERCOT are not subject to the commission's jurisdiction under
section 205 of the Federal Power Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FERC order comes amid an investigation of JP Morgan's
bidding activity and its communications with the California
Independent System Operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ERCOT said the agency and Texas regulators will continue to
perform market oversight activity and "will address any
compliance issues that arise by any market participant."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan's ability to trade derivatives, futures, natural
gas and other commodities will not be impacted by the FERC
order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan did not immediately respond to a request for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Jeffrey Goldfarb
The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rupert Murdoch makes an unlikely fairy godfather. The News Corp boss is more often portrayed as a cartoonish evil villain, especially inside rivals like Disney. But by paying a punchy price for a big piece of the Yankees Entertainment and Sports Network, Murdoch is implying an even richer valuation for ESPN than is already attached to the coveted Disney sports brand. That in turn makes the whole Magic Kingdom look worth more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ESPN&#8217;s model is what has Murdoch twiddling his metaphorical mustache, or maybe the real one of Chase Carey, his right-hand man. Buying 49 percent of YES, with an option to increase the stake to 80 percent in three years, advances what&#8217;s probably a larger plan to build a national, if not international, sports network to compete with Disney&#8217;s market leader. Adding 30 years of broadcast rights for the New York Yankees, arguably the number one brand in U.S. sports, intensifies Murdoch&#8217;s battle with Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will not be easy for Murdoch. NBC, under Comcast, and CBS are also trying to build ESPN-killers. And he is paying for the privilege. News Corp&#8217;s investment values YES at $3.8 billion, if the company takes control in 2015. Murdoch&#8217;s multiple is about 15 times the $250 million EBITDA that analysts at SNL Kagan estimate the network will earn this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That makes ESPN look underappreciated. Research firm Sanford Bernstein, which performed a similar comparison, reckons the network that commands the highest fees from cable operators generated as much as $3.5 billion of EBITDA in the fiscal year ended Sept. 29. At the same multiple as YES, ESPN&#8217;s suite of channels would be worth some $53 billion. Disney&#8217;s enterprise value is about $104 billion. That would mean the rest of the company fetches a multiple of only about seven times EBITDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might be reasonable for Disney&#8217;s film and TV studio, ABC broadcast network and consumer products divisions. It wouldn&#8217;t, however, give full credit to the other cable networks or theme parks. So while Iger and Disney owners need to be wary of a fiendish Murdoch plot in sports broadcasting, they can also enjoy the magic dust he may just have sprinkled over their company&#8217;s valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch Affirms Walt Disney Family Museum's (California) Rev Bonds at 'A'; 
      Outlook Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'A' rating on $56.1 million of California 
      Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank revenue bonds issued on 
      behalf of the Walt Disney Family Museum (WDFM).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rating Outlook is Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SECURITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The bonds are an absolute and unconditional obligation of the Walt and 
      Lilly Disney Foundation (the Disney Foundation), under a guaranty 
      agreement with the museum.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RESOURCES OF THE FOUNDATION: The Disney Foundation's robust balance 
      sheet resources continue to provide a solid cushion relative to both the 
      operating expenditures and outstanding debt of the museum, for which the 
      foundation provides its guaranty.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IMPROVED MUSEUM ATTENDANCE: Museum attendance and operations both 
      improved year-to-date 2012 (fiscal year end Dec. 31) following modest 
      attendance after the museum's opening in 2009 that was below initial 
      projections. However, it is not envisioned that the museum's financial 
      performance alone will ever be sufficient to cover debt service on the 
      bonds.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      STRATEGIC PLAN IMPLEMENTED: The museum's engaged board of directors and 
      experienced management team have implemented a five-year strategic plan 
      aimed at increasing attendance, growing revenues, and reducing reliance 
      on the Disney Foundation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CREDIT PROFILE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The strength of the Disney Foundation's balance sheet remains the 
      primary rating driver, although the market value of its investment 
      portfolio has yet to fully recover from the decline experienced during 
      the financial markets downturn in 2008 and 2009. The foundation's 
      available funds (defined by Fitch as cash and investments not 
      permanently restricted) totaled $156.6 million as of Dec. 31, 2011. 
      Available funds provided solid 2.2 times (x) coverage of total debt 
      ($71.9 million), including the series 2008 bonds and a non-cancellable 
      operating lease between the museum and the Presidio Trust for about $15 
      million. Available funds coverage of operations remains strong at 13.8x 
      the foundation's fiscal 2011 operating expenses of $11.3 million (or a 
      still healthy 5.9x when also including the museum's operating 
      expenditures). Available funds improved slightly to $159.9 million as of 
      Sept. 30, 2012 (unaudited), though remain below the level prior to the 
      financial crisis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As expected, the museum remains dependent on grants from the Disney 
      Foundation to support operations. Following initial attendance that was 
      below projected levels, this operating subsidy from the foundation was 
      about $8m per year in fiscal 2010 and 2011. In response to lower 
      revenues, the museum's management started to trim costs, cultivate 
      additional philanthropic support, and strengthen attendance-based 
      revenues through more targeted marketing and exhibits. These budgetary 
      measures began to show some progress in fiscal 2012, with attendance and 
      revenues both slightly ahead of plan through the nine months ended Sept. 
      30, 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The museum's five-year strategic plan calls for doubling annual 
      attendance to 200,000 over the next five years and reducing reliance on 
      the foundation by $2.8 million annually beginning in fiscal 2013. While 
      Fitch has never expected the museum to become entirely self-supported, 
      the ability to reduce dependence on the Disney Foundation will be viewed 
      positively as it will help to preserve the foundation's financial 
      resource base; the underpinning of the 'A' rating and ultimate security 
      for the bonds.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Disney Foundation's only revenue sources are investment income and 
      realized gains on investments. As was under consideration at the time of 
      Fitch's last review in 2010, the foundation replaced its former 
      investment managers during 2012 with a single manager. This decision was 
      made in part based on the foundation's disappointment with its 
      investment performance and the ability to work more closely with its new 
      manager to make strategic investment decisions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Alternative investments comprised 17.6% of the total portfolio at the 
      end of 2011, which Fitch views as moderate and not uncommon for 
      foundations with like-size endowments. Despite this exposure, 2011 
      adjusted available funds (adjusted to exclude alternative assets) 
      covered a still solid 1.79x of total debt and 11.4x of operating 
      expenses. In addition to assets under management, the Disney Foundation 
      also separately dedicates a small portion of its portfolio to a 
      fixed-income mutual fund and stock in the Walt Disney Company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Opened in October 2009, the museum is dedicated to the life and work of 
      Walt Disney and is located in three historic buildings in the Presidio 
      of San Francisco. The Walt Disney Family Foundation is the sole 
      corporate member of the museum and shares two of its three board members 
      with the Disney Foundation. The bylaws of both foundations require that 
      all board members be descendants of Walt Disney, reflecting their 
      commitment to the museum's mission.

not envisioned that the museum's financial performance alone will ever be
sufficient to cover debt service on the bonds.

STRATEGIC PLAN IMPLEMENTED: The museum's engaged board of directors and
experienced management team have implemented a five-year strategic plan aimed at
increasing attendance, growing revenues, and reducing reliance on the Disney
Foundation.

CREDIT PROFILE

The strength of the Disney Foundation's balance sheet remains the primary rating
driver, although the market value of its investment portfolio has yet to fully
recover from the decline experienced during the financial markets downturn in
2008 and 2009. The foundation's available funds (defined by Fitch as cash and
investments not permanently restricted) totaled $156.6 million as of Dec. 31,
2011. Available funds provided solid 2.2 times (x) coverage of total debt ($71.9
million), including the series 2008 bonds and a non-cancellable operating lease
between the museum and the Presidio Trust for about $15 million. Available funds
coverage of operations remains strong at 13.8x the foundation's fiscal 2011
operating expenses of $11.3 million (or a still healthy 5.9x when also including
the museum's operating expenditures). Available funds improved slightly to
$159.9 million as of Sept. 30, 2012 (unaudited), though remain below the level
prior to the financial crisis.

As expected, the museum remains dependent on grants from the Disney Foundation
to support operations. Following initial attendance that was below projected
levels, this operating subsidy from the foundation was about $8m per year in
fiscal 2010 and 2011. In response to lower revenues, the museum's management
started to trim costs, cultivate additional philanthropic support, and
strengthen attendance-based revenues through more targeted marketing and
exhibits. These budgetary measures began to show some progress in fiscal 2012,
with attendance and revenues both slightly ahead of plan through the nine months
ended Sept. 30, 2012.

The museum's five-year strategic plan calls for doubling annual attendance to
200,000 over the next five years and reducing reliance on the foundation by $2.8
million annually beginning in fiscal 2013. While Fitch has never expected the
museum to become entirely self-supported, the ability to reduce dependence on
the Disney Foundation will be viewed positively as it will help to preserve the
foundation's financial resource base; the underpinning of the 'A' rating and
ultimate security for the bonds.

The Disney Foundation's only revenue sources are investment income and realized
gains on investments. As was under consideration at the time of Fitch's last
review in 2010, the foundation replaced its former investment managers during
2012 with a single manager. This decision was made in part based on the
foundation's disappointment with its investment performance and the ability to
work more closely with its new manager to make strategic investment decisions.

Alternative investments comprised 17.6% of the total portfolio at the end of
2011, which Fitch views as moderate and not uncommon for foundations with
like-size endowments. Despite this exposure, 2011 adjusted available funds
(adjusted to exclude alternative assets) covered a still solid 1.79x of total
debt and 11.4x of operating expenses. In addition to assets under management,
the Disney Foundation also separately dedicates a small portion of its portfolio
to a fixed-income mutual fund and stock in the Walt Disney Company.

Opened in October 2009, the museum is dedicated to the life and work of Walt
Disney and is located in three historic buildings in the Presidio of San
Francisco. The Walt Disney Family Foundation is the sole corporate member of the
museum and shares two of its three board members with the Disney Foundation. The
bylaws of both foundations require that all board members be descendants of Walt
Disney, reflecting their commitment to the museum's mission.

      Research and Markets: Managed Security Service Providers Market in the 
      UK 2011-2015 with BT Global Services, Computacenter plc. and IBM Corp. 
      Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/ckf4t6/managed_security) 
      has announced the addition of the "Managed 
      Security Service Providers Market in the UK 2011-2015" report 
      to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      TechNavio's analysts forecast the Managed Security Service Providers 
      market in the UK to grow at a CAGR of 17.7 percent over the period 
      2011-2015. One of the key factors contributing to this market growth is 
      the increasing need to reduce the cost of IT security. The Managed 
      Security Service Providers market in the UK has also been witnessing the 
      growing popularity of cloud-based service offerings. However, the issues 
      related to security service offerings could pose a challenge to the 
      growth of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Other vendors mentioned in the report are Atos S.A., Dell SecureWorks 
      Information Security Services, Hewlett-Packard Co., Integralis Ltd., 
      Orange Business Services, Symantec Corp. Telefonica S.A., and Verizon 
      Communications Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from TechNavio's IT Security team 
      said: ''The popularity of cloud-based services is increasing because of 
      their advantages such as low cost, easy installation, and low 
      maintenance. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) prefer cloud-based 
      security services to other security services. Therefore, many vendors in 
      the Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs) market in the UK have 
      started offering cloud-based services.''
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, companies are investing in IT security to 
      protect their network from the rising security threats. To make optimum 
      use of IT security and reduce investments in IT security, companies are 
      approaching MSSPs. The demand for MSSPs is increasing as they help 
      companies reduce IT expenditure and operational expenditure. 
      Furthermore, companies are outsourcing certain parts of their security 
      needs to MSSPs in order to focus on core business requirements and 
      reduce their overhead costs. MSSPs have security experts who can help in 
      improving the security against complex threats.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report discusses that one of the major challenges faced by 
      the MSSPs is the issues relating to security services offerings such as 
      professional security services.

&lt;p&gt;ABUJA/GENEVA (Reuters) - ExxonMobil on Wednesday became the fourth oil major in a month to warn customers over delays to Nigerian oil and gas exports, adding to a raft of problems for Africa's biggest energy producer caused by oil spills, theft and flooding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell lifted on Wednesday its force majeure on Nigeria's benchmark Bonny Light crude oil exports, easing some of the supply concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But three of Nigeria main oil grades; Qua Iboe, Brass River and Forcados are still under force majeure. These oil streams together account for around 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) or around a third of total Nigerian exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;France's Total and Italian oil firm Eni have also declared force majeure, on gas and oil supplies, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nigeria is among the world's top 10 crude oil exporters and usually ships around 2 million bpd, but a major fire caused by oil theft, Exxon's spill and flooding have severely hit output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil traders said that loading delays are worsening and are now up to two weeks for some cargoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's Nigerian unit declared force majeure on Qua Iboe crude oil exports on Wednesday due to outages caused by a pipeline oil spill on November 9, which witnesses said had spread 20 miles down the coastline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are issues with two areas in a pipeline resulting in hydrocarbon release offshore," an oil trader said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Ward, the managing director of Exxon Mobil's local unit, has said a clean up had been mobilized, and he apologized to affected communities for the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shell's outages were prompted by a huge fire on an oil tanker being used to steal oil last month. The Anglo-Dutch major shut another pipeline in Imo River on October 31 due to theft damage and deferred 25,000 bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil theft is a major problem in the winding creeks and waterways of the Niger Delta, where it is easy to conceal boats and illegal refineries in the dense mangroves. Nigeria estimates around 150,000 bpd is stolen, much of which is sold abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total last week restarted production from its 90,000 bpd OML 58 block, which was shut down a month ago due to severe flooding in the Delta swamplands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eni declared force majeure earlier this month on Brass River oil loadings due to floods, causing cargo delays of eight to 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Joe Brock; Editing by Tim Cocks and William Hardy)&lt;/p&gt;

			Walton Westphalia Development Corporation Reports Third Quarter 2012 
      Results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Westphalia Development Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) 
      announced today the Corporation&#8217;s results for the third quarter of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Third Quarter Financial Results
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the third quarter of 2012, the Corporation generated total 
      revenues of $2,890,492, total expenses of $3,116,874 and a net loss and 
      comprehensive loss of $226,382. The revenues earned by the Corporation 
      were comprised of the proceeds from the land sale to Walton Westphalia 
      Europe, LP (&#8220;WWE&#8221;) of $2,882,119 and interest earned on the 
      Corporation&#8217;s cash on hand. The expenses during the third quarter 
      primarily consisted of $2,882,119 in cost of land sales related to the 
      sale to WWE, $41,978 in costs incurred for the private placement and 
      $113,703 in costs incurred for the management of the Corporation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On a year-to-date basis, the Corporation generated total revenues of 
      $2,906,277, total expenses of $3,654,489, and a net loss and 
      comprehensive loss of $748,212. The revenues earned by the Corporation 
      during the period from January 4, 2012, to September 30, 2012, were 
      comprised of the proceeds from the land sale to WWE of $2,882,119 and 
      interest earned on the Corporation&#8217;s cash on hand. The expenses for the 
      year-to-date period primarily consisted of $2,882,119 in cost of land 
      sales related to the sale to WWE, $394,111 in costs incurred for the 
      preparation of the Initial Public Offering (IPO) and Private Placement 
      and $201,528 in costs for the management of the Corporation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The nature and amount of the expenses incurred by the Corporation for 
      the year-to-date period were consistent with management&#8217;s expectations 
      for the period. The net loss incurred by the Corporation for the 
      year-to-date period was also consistent with management&#8217;s expectations 
      because the Corporation is not expected to generate significant revenue, 
      except during periods when the sale of lots is completed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Highlights For The Third Quarter
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the third quarter of 2012, the main priority of the Corporation 
      was to raise capital through the Private Placement to help the 
      Corporation carry out its investment strategy. In working towards this 
      objective, the Corporation completed several private placements during 
      the third quarter, which resulted in the issuance of a total of 279,852 
      Units for gross proceeds of $2,798,520. As at September 30, 2012, the 
      Corporation issued a total of 2,627,407 units for gross proceeds of 
      $26,274,070. Subsequently, in October the Corporation held its fifteenth 
      and final closing of its Private Placement. In the aggregate, it issued 
      1,574,870 units for gross proceeds of $15,748,700.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Corporation has now terminated its private placement offering. As a 
      result, since and including its prospectus offering, which was completed 
      on March 20, 2012, the Corporation has issued an aggregate 3,017,170 
      shares and $15,085,850 principal amount of Debentures for aggregate 
      proceeds raised of $30,171,700.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third quarter also saw the following achievements:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        In July, the Corporation announced that it had refined and updated its 
        preliminary development plan for the Property to better align the 
        development plan with current and future market opportunities;
      
			
        The significant changes to the Phase 1 development plan were as 
        follows:

        
					
            increased the number of townhomes from 300 units to 347 units;
          
					
            approximately 250,000 square feet of retail will be accelerated 
            from Phase 2 to Phase 1; and
          
					
            the Phase 1 portion of the office component will be shifted to 
            Phase 2.
          
				
			
		
		
			
        The submission of additional drawings to support a detailed site plan 
        for Phase 1 infrastructure. Subsequently, on October 18, the 
        Corporation received approval of its Detailed Site Plan for 
        infrastructure from the Prince George&#8217;s County Planning Board. The 
        approval is the first of the Corporation&#8217;s key critical path approvals 
        required for obtaining a grading permit in February 2013;
      
			
        Submissions of additional information to support the hydraulic 
        planning and analysis amendment to the Washington Suburban Sanitary 
        Commission;
      
			
        Continued meetings with county officials and agencies to ensure 
        continual progress towards the end goal of issuing permits for the 
        project; and
      
			
        In August, the Corporation sold approximately 11.4% or approximately 
        35 acres of the Property to WWE as part of a planned joint operation 
        to develop the Property. Subsequently in October, WWE acquired an 
        additional 3.1% bringing its aggregate ownership interest to 14.4%.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      The project is proceeding as anticipated and management expects that the 
      project will be completed within the approximate seven-year time frame 
      and achieve a net internal rate of return of 15% as disclosed in the 
      Prospectus and Offering Memorandum.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additional Information
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Walton Ontario Land L.P. 1 Reports Third Quarter 2012 Results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Ontario Land L.P. 1 (the &#8220;Partnership&#8221;) and its general 
      partner, Walton Ontario Land 1 Corporation (the &#8220;General Partner&#8221;), 
      announced today the Partnership&#8217;s results for the third quarter of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Third Quarter Financial Results
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the third quarter of 2012, the Partnership generated total 
      revenues of $13,520, total expenses of $246,234 and a net loss of 
      $232,714. On a year-to-date basis, the Partnership generated total 
      revenues of $46,702, total expenses of $736,902 and a net loss of 
      $690,200.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The total revenues, expenses and net loss generated by the Partnership, 
      both during the third quarter of 2012 and on a year-to-date basis, was 
      comparable to the comparative period in the 2011 year. This was 
      consistent with management&#8217;s expectations because the Partnership is not 
      expected to generate significant revenues, except during periods when 
      property is sold. The Partnership&#8217;s expenses are also expected to remain 
      fairly constant throughout the life of the Partnership because the most 
      significant expenses of the Partnership, being the management fees, 
      servicing fees and director fees, are fixed over the life of their 
      respective contracts. The net loss incurred by the Partnership was also 
      consistent with management&#8217;s expectations because the Partnership is not 
      expected to generate significant revenue, except during periods when 
      property is sold.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Overall, the Partnership is performing as expected by management and 
      consistent with the Partnership&#8217;s intention of holding its interest in 
      properties as an investment and to eventually dispose of its interest 
      prior to the physical development of the properties. The announced sale 
      of the Alliston Property and the subsequent closing of the transaction 
      on October 12, 2012, are consistent with the Partnership&#8217;s intention to 
      hold its interest in the properties and sell its interest prior to the 
      physical development of the properties.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Highlights For The Third Quarter
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Partnership&#8217;s holdings consist of two properties, the Alliston 
      Property, which was subsequently sold in October, near the Toronto area 
      in Alliston, Ontario, and the Ottawa Property in the southwest quadrant 
      Ottawa, Ontario.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Alliston Property
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the third quarter, the purchaser completed its due diligence and 
      waived conditions on the previously announced sale of the Alliston 
      Property. Subsequently, on October 12, 2012, the sale was closed and the 
      Partnership announced that unitholders would receive their first 
      distribution of $6.00 per unit. Subsequent to the third quarter, the 
      Partnership paid the distribution on November 15, 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Ottawa Property
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Ontario Municipal Board (&#8220;OMB&#8221;) hearing regarding the City of 
      Ottawa&#8217;s Official Plan Amendment No. 76 has concluded. The first stage 
      of the OMB hearing, which dealt with how much land was included in 
      Ottawa&#8217;s urban area boundary, delivered its decision in June 2011, to 
      expand the urban area boundary from 230 hectares (568 acres) by 850 
      hectares (2,100 acres). The second stage of the hearing which opened in 
      January 2012 has determined the specific location of the additional 620 
      hectares (1,532 acres). A revised Urban Policy Plan has been updated in 
      the City of Ottawa&#8217;s Official Plan delineating the city&#8217;s expanded urban 
      area. The Ottawa Property is not included in the expanded urban area 
      boundary. The Partnership will continue to focus its efforts on 
      participating in the 2014 Official Plan review process to support and 
      position the Ottawa Property in future expansions to Ottawa&#8217;s urban 
      boundary. The exclusion of the Ottawa Property from the urban area 
      boundary is not anticipated to impact investment objectives and 
      management assumptions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additional Information
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Launched in January 2010, the Partnership&#8217;s objective is to maximize 
      returns to limited partners through the acquisition, management, concept 
      planning, and eventual sale of two properties in Ontario; the Alliston 
      Property, which prior to its sale consisted of two parcels totaling 
      154.93 acres near the Toronto area in Alliston, and the Ottawa Property, 
      which consists of 300 acres in the southwest quadrant of the City of 
      Ottawa.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Partnership is managed by Walton International Group Inc., part of 
      the Walton Group.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Walton Group is a multinational group of real estate investment and 
      development companies headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. 
      Walton&#8217;s expertise is the research, acquisition, management and 
      development of strategically located land in major North American growth 
      corridors. With more than 70,000 acres of land under management, the 
      Walton Group is one of North America&#8217;s premier land asset managers. 
      Walton manages and/or owns land assets in Phoenix, Austin, Dallas, 
      Atlanta, Charlotte, the Washington D.C. region, Ottawa, Toronto,

			Walton Big Lake Development L.P. Reports Third Quarter 2012 Results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Big Lake Development L.P. (the &#8220;Partnership&#8221;), and its 
      general partner Walton Big Lake Development Corporation announced today 
      the Partnership&#8217;s results for the third quarter of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Third Quarter Financial Results
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the third quarter of 2012, the Partnership recognized revenue 
      from the sale of lots of $14,639,728, cost of sales of $12,726,508, 
      other expenses of $204,625, and a net income and comprehensive income of 
      $1,708,595.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Revenue was recognized on the sale of 107 of the 162 Phase 1 lots during 
      the third quarter of 2012. This was triggered by the completion of 
      onsite roads for the committed lots and payment of second deposits for 
      those lots. The marketing expenses incurred during the third quarter of 
      2012 were consistent with the marketing expenses anticipated by 
      management for the work completed during the third quarter of 2012, and 
      were primarily attributed to the marketing efforts for the Hawks Ridge 
      at Big Lake community.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On a year-to-date basis, the Partnership recognized revenue from the 
      sale of lots of $14,639,728, cost of sales of $12,726,508, other 
      expenses of $532,394, and net income and comprehensive income of 
      $1,380,826. Similar to the increase in other expenses during the three 
      months ended September 30, 2012, the increase in other expenses during 
      the nine months ended September 30, 2012, was primarily attributed to an 
      increase in marketing expenses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third quarter of 2012 marked the first period that the Partnership 
      generated positive net income. This was driven by recognizing the 
      revenue from the sale of lots during the third quarter of 2012. The 
      Partnership anticipates to generate an overall positive net income over 
      the life of the project because the total revenues generated by 
      Partnership are expected to exceed its total expenses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Highlights For The Third Quarter
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the third quarter the following milestones were reached:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        In July, the Partnership completed offsite utilities, including the 
        waterline and sanitary sewer;
      
			
        In August the Partnership submitted the Phase 2 zoning and subdivision 
        applications to the City of Edmonton;
      
			
        In September, the Partnership completed paving of onsite roadways in 
        Phase 1 and paving of offsite roadways.
      
			
        The third quarter marked the first period that the Partnership has 
        generated positive net income. This was driven by recognizing the 
        revenue from the sale of lots during the quarter; and
      
			
        Subsequent to the third quarter, single-family and semi-detached show 
        homes were opened to public viewing in November 2012.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Overall, the Partnership expects that it will be able to complete the 
      project within the approximate five-year time frame disclosed in the 
      Partnership&#8217;s prospectus and remains on track for achieving an internal 
      rate of return of 13.5%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

			Walton Yellowhead Development Corporation Reports Third Quarter 2012 
      Results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Yellowhead Development Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) 
      announced today the Corporation&#8217;s results for the third quarter of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Third Quarter Financial Results
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the third quarter of 2012, the Corporation generated total 
      revenues of $2,148 and incurred total expenses of $201,788, which 
      translated into a net loss before tax of $199,640. The revenues 
      generated by the Corporation consisted of interest income earned on the 
      cash held by the Corporation. The total expenses primarily consisted of 
      $135,448 in costs for the management of the Corporation and $32,816 in 
      servicing fees. The nature and amount of expenses incurred during the 
      third quarter of 2012 were consistent with management&#8217;s expectations. 
      The net loss before tax of $199,640 was partially offset by a deferred 
      tax recovery of $49,910, resulting in an overall net loss of $149,730.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On a year-to-date basis, the Corporation generated total revenues of 
      $10,749 and incurred total expenses of $591,976 which translated into a 
      net loss before tax of $581,227. The revenues generated by the 
      Corporation consisted of interest income earned on the cash held by the 
      Corporation. The total expenses primarily consisted of $403,399 in costs 
      for the management of the Corporation and $97,734 in servicing fees. The 
      nature and amount of expenses incurred during the year-to-date period 
      were consistent with management&#8217;s expectations for the period. The net 
      loss before tax of $581,227 was partially offset by a deferred tax 
      recovery of $280,402, resulting in an overall net loss of $300,825.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The net loss incurred for the third quarter and for the year-to-date 
      period was consistent with management&#8217;s expectations because the 
      Corporation is not expected to generate significant revenue, except 
      during periods when the sale of lots is completed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Highlights For The Third Quarter
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        In July, the Corporation received approval from Edmonton&#8217;s City 
        Council for the rezoning of Phase 1 to allow development for business 
        and light industrial uses, and the construction of a storm water 
        management facility;
      
			
        Management has been in discussions with senior administration from the 
        City of Edmonton to ensure the most efficient and cost effective 
        servicing solution is reached to address the servicing requirements 
        for the Winterburn Industrial Area, in accordance with the Winterburn 
        Industrial Area Master Plan (&#8220;AMP&#8221;); and
      
			
        In August, the Corporation submitted a technical background and cost 
        analysis for a proposed servicing solution which was accepted in 
        principle in September.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Due to the seasonal nature of construction in Edmonton and the longer 
      than anticipated time to obtain approvals, no further construction is 
      expected to commence in 2012 due to unfavorable weather conditions. As a 
      result, the projected completion dates for the Phase 1 milestones are 
      behind the anticipated completion dates reported for the second quarter 
      of 2012. Construction will commence in spring 2013 when weather 
      conditions permit. Notwithstanding these delays for Phase 1, the 
      Corporation expects that it will be able to complete the overall project 
      within the approximate three-year time frame disclosed in the 
      Corporation&#8217;s prospectus, and remains on track for achieving an internal 
      rate or return of 13%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additional Information
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Launched in 2011, the Corporation owns a two-phase industrial 131.4-acre 
      development in northwest Edmonton, Alberta, within the Winterburn 
      Industrial Park.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Walton Edgemont Development Corporation Reports Third Quarter 2012 
      Results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Edgemont Development Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) 
      announced today the Corporation&#8217;s results for the third quarter of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Third Quarter Financial Results
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the third quarter of 2012, the Corporation generated total 
      revenues of $15,654 and incurred total expenses of $246,057, which 
      translated into a net loss before tax of $230,403. The revenues 
      generated by the Corporation consisted of interest income earned on the 
      cash held by the Corporation. The total expenses primarily consisted of 
      $146,059 in costs for the management of the Corporation, $35,107 in 
      servicing fees, and $33,906 in marketing expenses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On a year-to-date basis, the Corporation generated total revenues of 
      $38,243 and incurred total expenses of $701,088, which translated into a 
      net loss before tax of $662,845. The revenues generated by the 
      Corporation consisted of interest income earned on the cash held by the 
      Corporation. The total expenses primarily consisted of $435,002 in costs 
      for the management of the Corporation, $104,557 in servicing fees, and 
      $70,707 in marketing expenses. The increase in management fees, 
      servicing fees and marketing expense was offset by a $450,000 decrease 
      in organizational expenses, which were incurred during the comparative 
      period in relation to the Corporation&#8217;s prospectus and private placement 
      offerings. The nature and amount of expenses incurred during the 
      year-to-date period were consistent with management&#8217;s expectations for 
      the period. The overall net loss incurred during the third quarter of 
      2012 was consistent with management&#8217;s expectations because the 
      Corporation is not expected to generate significant revenue, except 
      during periods when the sale of lots is completed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Highlights For The Third Quarter
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the third quarter, the following milestones were achieved:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        In August, the Corporation executed a draft of the development 
        servicing agreement (&#8220;Development Servicing Agreement&#8221;) for the Phase 
        1 of the project with the City of Edmonton. This agreement allows the 
        Corporation to commence underground utility construction for Phase 1 
        of the project while the Development Servicing Agreement is being 
        finalized by the City; and
      
			
        During September, the Corporation commenced installation of the 
        underground utilities for Phase 1 of the project.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      In comparison to the anticipated completion dates for the Phase 1 
      milestones as reported for the second quarter of 2012, the anticipated 
      completion dates for some of the remaining Phase 1 milestones are 
      slightly behind schedule. These delays are not, however, expected to 
      affect the ability of the Corporation to complete the project within the 
      approximate six-year time frame disclosed in the Corporation&#8217;s 
      prospectus and offering memorandum, and remains on track for achieving 
      an internal rate of return of 13.5%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additional Information
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OTTAWA (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc has cut the Canadian price of its Viagra erectile dysfunction drug after the Supreme Court of Canada opened the door to sales of generic versions of the drug, the company said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are lowering original Viagra's price to be in line with generic versions because we are committed to ensuring that Viagra patients continue to have access to the original - made by Pfizer, and at a competitive price," Scott Wilks from Pfizer's Canadian subsidiary said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patent on Viagra had been due to expire in 2014 in Canada. The Supreme Court threw the door open to generics immediately on November 8 when it ruled that Pfizer had not provided enough details when it filed its patent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That challenge had been mounted by Israeli-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, the world's largest drug maker, which said it expected to offer a generic version at a substantially lower price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said cheaper generic entries had already arrived in Canadian stores. It did not identify the suppliers, but said it had now cut its typical pack of four 100 mg pills to about C$37 ($37) from C$49, effective immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Viagra patent in the United States is still valid. Viagra is not available over the counter, so Americans cannot simply to go into a Canadian pharmacy to buy the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Randall Palmer; Editing by Janet Guttsman and Andrew Hay)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Price cut about 25 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Patent still holds in U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OTTAWA, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc has cut the
Canadian price of its Viagra erectile dysfunction drug after the
Supreme Court of Canada opened the door to sales of generic
versions of the drug, the company said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are lowering original Viagra's price to be in line with
generic versions because we are committed to ensuring that
Viagra patients continue to have access to the original - made
by Pfizer, and at a competitive price," Scott Wilks from
Pfizer's Canadian subsidiary said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patent on Viagra had been due to expire in 2014 in
Canada. The Supreme Court threw the door open to generics
immediately on Nov. 8 when it ruled that Pfizer had not provided
enough details when it filed its patent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That challenge had been mounted by Israeli-based Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, the world's largest
drug maker, which said it expected to offer a generic version at
a substantially lower price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said cheaper generic entries had already arrived in
Canadian stores. It did not identify the suppliers, but said it
had now cut its typical pack of four 100 mg pills to about C$37
($37) from C$49, effective immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Viagra patent in the United States is still valid.
Viagra is not available over the counter, so Americans can not
simply to go into a Canadian pharmacy to buy the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			Research and Markets: Global Skin Care Market 2011-2015 with L'Oreal 
      S.A., Beiersdorf AG, Unilever Group, and Procter and Gamble Co. 
      Dominating
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/ggh22g/global_skin_care) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Skin Care Market 2011-2015" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      TechNavio's analysts forecast the Global Skin Care market to grow at a 
      CAGR of 4.4 percent over the period 2011-2015. One of the key factors 
      contributing to this market growth is the increase in the aging 
      population. The Global Skin Care market has also been witnessing the 
      growing popularity of natural and organic skin care products. However, 
      the intense competition among vendors could pose a challenge to the 
      growth of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Some vendors mentioned in the report are Estee Lauder Companies Inc., 
      Johnson and Johnson, Avon Products Inc., and Shiseido Co.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from TechNavio's Healthcare team 
      said: ''The increasing awareness about health and wellness has 
      significantly impacted consumers in developed and developing nations. A 
      number of factors have led to increasing awareness of health and 
      wellness. Nowadays, consumers are raising concerns about the safety of 
      products. The awareness about harmful chemicals and their effect on the 
      skin is increasing. Consumers are refraining from using personal care 
      products that contain traces of pesticides, growth hormones, 
      preservatives, additives, artificial colors, etc. This has 
      simultaneously led to the growth of skin care products made of natural 
      ingredients.''
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, the growth of the Global Skin Care market is 
      proportional to the increase in the aging population. This is because 
      the increase in the aging population boosts the market for anti-aging 
      products. Nowadays, increased lifespan and better personal appearance 
      are the key requirements of consumers. Consumers wish to feel younger 
      than their biological age, and they want their appearance to reflect 
      their inner youthfulness. The worldwide acceptance of cosmetic 
      procedures, which are less invasive, faster, and cheaper, is increasing 
      the demand for skin care products. The increase in the aging population 
      will drive the market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report reveals that intense competition among vendors is a 
      major challenge faced by the market.

&lt;p&gt;* Schapiro to step down Dec. 14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Commissioner Elisse Walter to serve as chairman-designate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* White House to nominate full-term replacement soon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Aruna Viswanatha&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - The head of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, Mary Schapiro, will step
down next month after a tumultuous four years spent
rehabilitating the agency's battered reputation, handing the
reins temporarily to a close ally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEC Commissioner Elisse Walter, a career regulator who has
sided with Schapiro on most of the critical issues before the
agency, was named chairman-designate and could serve until
December 2013, buying time for President Barack Obama to win
Senate approval for a long-term replacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama plans to nominate someone soon, a White House official
said. Walter is among the candidates likely to be considered, as
is Treasury official Mary Miller, who spent nearly three decades
at T. Rowe Price and has been outspoken about the need to make
money markets safer for investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new SEC chair will need to finish Schapiro's task of
resurrecting the agency's reputation, which was badly tarnished
by the 2007-2009 financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC is considering money market reforms, additional
market structure safeguards, and still needs to write a number
of major rules dictated by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform
law, including a final version of the Volcker rule to ban banks
from trading for their own accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Elisse has been viewed as being in tune with Mary
Schapiro's agenda," said Barry Barbash, a former director of the
SEC's division of investment management, now an asset management
lawyer at Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher LLP in Washington. "If the
idea is to keep the SEC running the way it's been running with
the same policies, Elisse would seem an appropriate choice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speculation has swirled for months that Schapiro would leave
soon after the Nov. 6 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her departure leaves the commission split 2-2 between
Democrats and Republicans, which could make it harder for the
commission to come to agreement. Obama could move to appoint a
fifth commissioner before naming a new chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Schapiro took over in 2009, the agency was under heavy
fire for regulatory blindspots that critics said helped fuel the
crisis. It was also lambasted for failing to catch now-convicted
Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff, whose fraud cost investors an
estimated $65 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to shoring up the agency's name, Schapiro had to
fight numerous other fires - from the 2010 "flash crash" that
sent the Dow Jones industrial average tumbling 700 points within
minutes to high-profile court losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've gotten a lot done, I'm really proud of where the
agency is today, so it seemed like a good time," Schapiro said
in an interview on Monday after announcing her departure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNFINISHED BUSINESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other possible replacements for Schapiro include Sallie
Krawcheck, a former top executive at Bank of America and
Citigroup, and Richard Ketchum, chairman of FINRA, Wall
Street's self-funded regulator. SEC enforcement director Robert
Khuzami, a Republican, is considered a long shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Walter is also a possibility, she has already been at
the SEC for more than four years and served as acting chairman
before Schapiro's confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many ways, Walter and Schapiro have been joined at the
hip in their career experience and orientations. They both spent
years as attorneys at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
and at the SEC, with stints in top positions at FINRA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She is a strong advocate of disclosure, of regulation and
of consumer protection," former SEC Commissioner Edward
Fleischman said of Walter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCHAPIRO's LEGACY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schapiro's time at the SEC was marked by some controversy
and her departure leaves uncertainty around major initiatives.
But former SEC officials said Schapiro helped revive a moribund
agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think she saved the SEC, which was close to extinction
when she took over," former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt told
Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schapiro said in the interview that steering the agency out
of that period in its history was one of the highlights of her
tenure there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She streamlined the SEC enforcement process, hired new types
of employees and created a new tips database and a whistleblower
office. In the past two years, the agency logged a record number
of enforcement actions and brought major financial crisis cases,
including a record $550 million settlement in 2010 with Goldman
Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has also implemented reforms to protect markets against
major swings caused by errant technology - as was the case with
the flash crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The SEC is stronger, and our financial system is safer and
better able to serve the American people - thanks in large part
to Mary's hard work," Obama said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the agency has also been bogged down with major rules 
the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulation law required it to
write, many of which are still in process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business groups have challenged much of the SEC's recent
rule-making efforts and won major battles, including convincing
a federal appeals court to throw out the agency's "proxy access"
rule, which would have empowered shareholders to nominate
directors to corporate boards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schapiro did not say what she planned to do next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Canadian private equity firm Onex Corp (OCX.TO) will buy U.S.-based insurance brokerage USI from Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) private equity fund for $2.3 billion to expand its financial services footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurance brokers have seen strong revenue growth over the past few quarters as insurers have raised prices on their offerings to offset big catastrophe losses last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The U.S. property and casualty insurance industry seems a lot more attractive now because the business could generate good cash flow and that is important for private equity players," analyst Scott Chan of Canaccord Genuity said, adding that the deal is a "positive".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USI, founded in 1994 and taken private in 2007, offers property, casualty, employee benefit and retirement consulting services. The company says it is the ninth largest insurance broker in the United States.

 will buy U.S.-based insurance brokerage USI from
Goldman Sachs Group Inc's private equity fund for $2.3
billion to expand its financial services footprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insurance brokers have seen strong revenue growth over the
past few quarters as insurers have raised prices on their
offerings to offset big catastrophe losses last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The U.S. property and casualty insurance industry seems a
lot more attractive now because the business could generate good
cash flow and that is important for private equity players,"
analyst Scott Chan of Canaccord Genuity said, adding that the
deal is a "positive".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USI, founded in 1994 and taken private in 2007, offers
property, casualty, employee benefit and retirement consulting
services. The company says it is the ninth largest insurance
broker in the United States. It bought TD Insurance Inc, the US
insurance unit of Toronto-Dominion Bank in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Onex, with about $14 billion of assets under management, has

signed this year, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Onex, whose businesses generate annual revenue of $34
billion, said in September it would buy German plastics
machinery maker KraussMaffei AG and packaging graphics services
provider SGS International Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect Onex to continue to pursue acquisitions as it
looks to deploy high levels of uncalled third-party capital
commitments and its own excess cash," Scotiabank's Hardie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Onex Partners III, Onex's $4.7 billion private equity fund,
will make an equity investment of about $700 million. Onex is a

&lt;p&gt;  ANN ARBOR, MI, Nov 26 (Marketwire) -- 
TSRL, Inc. is a privately-owned specialty pharmaceutical company focused
on the discovery and development of orally available antiviral and
anticancer therapeutics based on its proprietary prodrug technology. 

    The company announced today that it entered into a collaborative research
and development agreement (CRADA) with the Walter Reed Army Institute of
Research. TSRL's proprietary drug candidates, TSR-087 and TSR-505, have
demonstrated significant broad-spectrum antiviral activity in
non-clinical studies. The purpose of this Agreement is to conduct
additional in vitro studies to further evaluate the activity of these
compounds against contemporary, clinically important adenovirus strains.

    TSR-087 and TSR-505 have been developed to date through SBIR funding from
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part
of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

      This press release contains forward-looking statements within the 
      meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual

      Gaming, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the &#8220;Company&#8221; or 
      &#8220;PENN&#8221;) believe that our expectations are based on reasonable 
      assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and

      differ materially from our expectations. Meaningful factors that could 
      cause actual results to differ from expectations include, but are not 
      limited to, risks related to the following: the proposed separation of 
      PropCo from PENN, including our ability to receive, or delays in 
      obtaining, all necessary consents and approvals, the anticipated timing 
      of the proposed separation, the expected tax treatment of the proposed 
      transaction, the ability of each of the Company (post-spin) and PropCo 
      to conduct and expand their respective businesses following the proposed 
      spin-off, and the diversion of management&#8217;s attention from regular 
      business concerns; our ability to receive, or delays in obtaining, the 
      regulatory approvals required to own, develop and/or operate our 
      facilities, or other delays or impediments to completing our planned 
      acquisitions or projects, including favorable resolution of any related 
      litigation, including the recent appeal by the Ohio Roundtable 
      addressing the legality of video lottery terminals in Ohio; our ability 
      to secure state and local permits and approvals necessary for 
      construction; construction factors, including delays, unexpected 
      remediation costs, local opposition and increased cost of labor and 
      materials; our ability to successfully integrate Harrah&#8217;s St. Louis into 
      our existing business; our ability to reach agreements with the 
      thoroughbred and harness horseman in Ohio and to otherwise maintain 
      agreements with our horseman, pari-mutuel clerks and other organized 
      labor groups; the passage of state, federal or local legislation 
      (including referenda) that would expand, restrict, further tax, prevent 
      or negatively impact operations in or adjacent to the jurisdictions in 
      which we do or seek to do business (such as a smoking ban at any of our 
      facilities); the effects of local and national economic, credit, capital 
      market, housing, and energy conditions on the economy in general and on 
      the gaming and lodging industries in particular; the activities of our 
      competitors and the emergence of new competitors (traditional and 
      internet based); increases in the effective rate of taxation at any of 
      our properties or at the corporate level; our ability to identify 
      attractive acquisition and development opportunities and to agree to 
      terms with partners for such transactions; the costs and risks involved 
      in the pursuit of such opportunities and our ability to complete the 
      acquisition or development of, and achieve the expected returns from, 
      such opportunities; our expectations for the continued availability and 
      cost of capital; the outcome of pending legal proceedings; changes in 
      accounting standards; our dependence on key personnel; the impact of 
      terrorism and other international hostilities; the impact of weather;

		&lt;p&gt;
			The Coca-Cola Company Expands 5by20 Women's 
      Economic Empowerment Initiative
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Expansion Triples the Number of Countries; UN Women Partnership 
      Drives Three New Programs
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company today announced strong progress toward its goal to 
      enable the economic empowerment of 5 million women entrepreneurs across 
      the Coca-Cola value chain by 2020. The initiative, known as 5by20, is 
      expanding beyond its pilot programs in four countries to launch and 
      scale programs across a total of 12 countries: Brazil, China, Costa 
      Rica, Egypt, Haiti, India, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, the Philippines, 
      South Africa and Thailand. 5by20 is on track to reach 300,000 women by 
      the end of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      By providing access to business skills, financial services, assets and 
      support networks of peers and mentors, 5by20 is helping women succeed as 
      entrepreneurs, while also creating thriving, sustainable communities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Working with and investing in women is one of the most powerful ways to 
      spur sustainable economic growth and development,&#8221; said Muhtar Kent, 
      Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company. &#8220;I&#8217;m excited by the progress 
      we&#8217;re making toward our goal to empower 5 million women. We are 
      transforming lives and communities, making a profound and lasting impact 
      on global issues and also growing our business.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Initially focused on four pilot countries &#8211; Brazil, India, South Africa 
      and the Philippines &#8211; the expansion of 5by20 into additional countries 
      demonstrates The Coca-Cola Company&#8217;s continued commitment to testing, 
      learning and scaling programs in order to reach its ambitious women&#8217;s 
      economic empowerment goal.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This expansion includes the launch of 5by20 in China in partnership with 
      All China Women&#8217;s Federation to provide business skills to female 
      retailers, with the initial pilot program underway in Guangxi Province. 
      In Kenya, young women entrepreneurs are receiving business skills 
      training and retail assets to establish new enterprises in partnership 
      with TechnoServe. In Mexico, young women are receiving business skills 
      training and being trained for their first job.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition several new 5by20 programs are a result of the partnership 
      The Coca-Cola Company and UN Women announced in September 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Women need more opportunities to participate fully and equally in the 
      workforce. Countless studies point to the fact that companies with a 
      higher share of women have improved results&#8212;higher levels of innovation, 
      productivity and profit margins,&#8221; said Michelle Bachelet, UN Women 
      Executive Director. &#8220;UN Women supports women&#8217;s economic empowerment as a 
      key priority to advance gender equality and improve the lives of women 
      around the world.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company and UN Women&#8217;s US$4 million partnership will 
      economically empower 40,000 women over three years in South Africa, 
      Brazil and Egypt. The two organizations are collaborating to provide 
      women with business skills training, leadership training and access to 
      financial assets. UN Women is the UN organization established as a 
      global champion for women and girls.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We know that women&#8217;s income goes directly to their children&#8217;s education 
      and other family needs,&#8221; adds Kristin Hetle, Director of UN Women&#8217;s 
      Strategic Partnerships Division. &#8220;The collaboration between The 
      Coca-Cola Company and UN Women will benefit communities at large and 
      future generations.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In Egypt, The Coca-Cola Company and UN Women are providing women 
      entrepreneurs with retail kiosks, business skills training and access to 
      mentors. In Brazil, the partnership is focused on reaching women 
      recyclers, artisans and community leaders throughout Coca-Cola&#8217;s value 
      chain to provide leadership skill development and business skills 
      training. In South Africa, the two organizations are providing retailers 
      with business skills training, mentoring and guidance on networking with 
      peers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Women entrepreneurs around the world are faced with numerous barriers 
      to success,&#8221; said Charlotte Oades, Global Director, Women&#8217;s Economic 
      Empowerment, The Coca-Cola Company. &#8220;We believe providing access to 
      training, finance and support networks are the best ways to help women 
      overcome barriers, unlock their untapped potential and build their 
      business in a sustainable way.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the 5by20 initiative, The Coca-Cola Company supports 
      other women&#8217;s economic empowerment efforts around the world. In June, as 
      part of our re-entry into Myanmar, the Company announced a US$3 million 
      grant from The Coca-Cola Foundation, the Company's charitable giving 
      arm, to Pact. The Company will work with Pact, a non-governmental

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Nov 26 (Marketwire) -- 
OpTier, the leader in Application Performance Management (APM) and
providing end-to-end Contextual Transaction Data, analyzing billions of
transactions and capturing over 250 billion metrics per day, today
announced it has achieved a silver Microsoft Independent Software Vendor
(ISV) competency, demonstrating its ability to meet Microsoft Corp.
customers' evolving needs in today's dynamic business environment. To
earn a Microsoft silver competency, partners must successfully
demonstrate expertise through rigorous exams, culminating in Microsoft
certifications. And to ensure the highest quality of services, Microsoft
requires customer references for successful implementation and customer
satisfaction.

    OpTier's unique ability to provide production-ready, low-overhead
tracking using its patented ACT(TM) (Active Context Tracking) technology
enables customers to track each transaction across the entire
infrastructure. Using OpTier APM, customers can monitor .NET applications
and gain deep visibility into their .NET environment, so they can
understand their .NET environment and pinpoint any performance and
availability issues in production quickly. Monitoring .NET applications
with OpTier APM entails tracking of transactions as they pass through
.NET tiers, either as standalone web applications, or as part of larger
heterogeneous environments. It also includes deep dive capabilities,
including method and SQL-level visibility into the time-contributing
components of the application.

    "This Microsoft Silver ISV competency demonstrates OpTier's expertise in
today's technology market with a proven, certified solution for
monitoring .NET applications with OpTier APM," said Andy Wild, President
of OpTier. "OpTier's horizontal business transaction monitoring combined
with its vertical deep dive means that customers can get a clear picture
of their .NET environment no matter which tier and how complex the
application."

    "By achieving a silver competency, organizations have proven their
expertise in specific technology areas, placing them among the top 5
percent of Microsoft partners worldwide," said Jon Roskill, corporate
vice president, Worldwide Partner Group at Microsoft Corp. "When
customers look for an IT partner to meet their business challenges,
choosing a company that has attained Microsoft competencies is a smart
move. These are highly qualified professionals with access to Microsoft
technical support and product teams."

    Attaining the Microsoft Independent Software Vendor (ISV)/Software
competency demonstrates partner expertise in developing applications
based on Microsoft solutions. Equipped with exclusive training, the
latest software, and support on Microsoft SQL Server, Windows Server,
Windows 7 and Microsoft cloud services, these partners are equipped to
develop innovative solutions to meet their customers' needs.

    The Microsoft Partner Network helps partners strengthen their
capabilities to showcase leadership in the marketplace on the latest
technology, to better serve customers and, with 640,000 Microsoft
partners in their ecosystem, to easily connect with one of the most
active, diverse networks in the world.

			Visa and NetHope Partner to Help Modernize Delivery of Humanitarian 
      Aid
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New Visa Innovation Grants to help humanitarian and development 
      organizations electronify payments to increase speed, safety and 
      long-term impact of health, food security and poverty-alleviation 
      programs
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), the leading global payments technology company, and 
      NetHope, a consortium of 37 humanitarian organizations, today announced 
      the Visa Innovation Grants program to help modernize humanitarian aid 
      payments. Through this program, Visa is making available $500,000 in 
      grants to humanitarian and development nongovernmental organizations 
      (NGOs) to increase the speed, security and long-term impact of aid 
      through the innovation and adoption of electronic payments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Every year, humanitarian, development and government organizations 
      distribute billions of dollars of cash payments to people in need 
      through benefit stipends, emergency relief payments and other 
      development initiatives. Driven by the need to ensure faster delivery, 
      greater transparency and increased security, these organizations are 
      beginning to shift from distributing physical cash to electronic 
      payments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      However, research 
      by the Cash Learning Partnership has revealed significant obstacles 
      facing organizations trying to make the transition to electronic 
      payments, including technological, operational and attitudinal barriers. 
      While some of these barriers are being overcome through greater 
      knowledge-sharing and an increase in public-private partnerships, the 
      report calls for greater investment in overcoming internal barriers and 
      additional funding for adoption of new technologies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We have a tremendous opportunity to use innovation to improve the 
      speed, security and long-term impact of humanitarian and development 
      aid,&#8221; said Douglas Sabo, Head of Corporate Responsibility at Visa Inc. 
      &#8220;Through the Visa Innovation Grants program, we will support 
      organizations&#8217; efforts to electronify their payments to help improve the 
      lives of those they serve, and we will use the opportunity to bring a 
      more formalized financial service &#8211; electronic payments &#8211; to the 
      financially underserved.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      An Expert Advisory Committee of distinguished leaders with public and 
      private sector experience will assist in the review of applications. The 
      committee includes:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Nabeeha Mujeeb Kazi, Managing Director, Humanitas Global Development

      &#8220;NetHope empowers humanitarian organizations to better serve the 
      developing world through smarter use of technology,&#8221; said Dr. William 
      Brindley, NetHope Executive Director and CEO. &#8220;The Visa Innovation 
      Grants provide a unique opportunity for NGOs to think creatively and 
      push the technological envelope to explore new approaches to electronify 
      payments and transfers. We are proud to work with a leader like Visa on 
      this effort.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Pfizer Subsidiary, Wyeth LLC, to Redeem 5.500% Notes Due March 15, 
      2013
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced that Wyeth LLC, its wholly-owned 
      subsidiary, has notified The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee under 
      the applicable indenture, of its election to fully redeem all of its 
      outstanding 5.500% Notes due March 15, 2013 (after giving effect to a 
      December 4, 2003 upward interest rate adjustment of 0.25%) (CUSIP No. 
      983024AA8) (the &#8220;Notes&#8221;). The aggregate principal amount of Notes 
      currently outstanding is $1.5 billion. The redemption date for the Notes 
      will be December 26, 2012 (the &#8220;Redemption Date&#8221;).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The redemption price (&#8220;Redemption Price&#8221;) for the Notes will be a price 
      equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, 
      or (ii) the sum, as determined by the Quotation Agent (as defined in the 
      Global Note, the form of which was filed with the Securities and 
      Exchange Commission as part of Exhibit 4.4 to Wyeth&#8217;s Annual Report on 
      Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 (File No. 
      001-01225) (the &#8220;Global Note&#8221;)), of the present value of the principal 
      amount of the Notes and the remaining scheduled payments of interest on 
      the Notes from the Redemption Date to the maturity date of the Notes, 
      exclusive of interest accrued to the Redemption Date, discounted from 
      their respective scheduled payment dates to the Redemption Date on a 
      semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months) at 
      the Treasury Rate (as defined in the Global Note) plus 25 basis points, 
      in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount 
      being redeemed to (but excluding) the Redemption Date.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On and after the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price will become due 
      and payable in respect of the Notes, and interest on the Notes will 
      cease to accrue on and after such date.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Notice of the redemption of the Notes (the &#8220;Notice of Redemption&#8221;) is 
      expected to be mailed on November 26, 2012. The redemption will be 
      effected in accordance with the applicable terms of the indenture under 
      which the Notes were issued.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The paying agent for the redemption is The Bank of New York Mellon. The 
      relevant contact information for The Bank of New York Mellon is set 
      forth in the Notice of Redemption.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an 
      offer to buy any of the Notes and shall not constitute an offer, 
      solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, 
      solicitation or sale is unlawful.

			NextGen Healthcare and Microsoft Corp. Join to Deliver Consumer-Based 
      Healthcare Information Technology Solution
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New Mobile Application Designed for Windows 8 Platform
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			NextGen 
      Healthcare Information Systems, LLC., a wholly owned subsidiary of Quality 
      Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: QSII) and a leading provider of healthcare 
      information systems and connectivity solutions, announced today it has 
      joined with Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) to develop and launch the NextGen&#174; 
      MedicineCabinet application. This is the first joint consumer-based 
      mobile healthcare information technology solution designed for the 
      Windows 8 platform by NextGen Healthcare and Microsoft.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The NextGen MedicineCabinet allows customers to create, store, track and 
      share personal medication records. With a goal to drive patient 
      engagement, NextGen Healthcare and Microsoft collaborated to leverage 
      the recent launch of the Microsoft Windows 8 platform by creating a 
      consumer-based mobile healthcare IT solution. The end result is an 
      advanced healthcare IT application that enables customers to take an 
      active role in care collaboration, setting the stage for future 
      consumer-based healthcare IT solutions, anywhere and anytime across any 
      mobile network.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The free NextGen MedicineCabinet application, available through the Microsoft 
      app store, enables patients to create and update a list of 
      medications, including dosing and schedule information, thus creating 
      their own &#8220;personal&#8221; medication record. Users can simply add a 
      medication to the list, enter in dosing requirements and let the 
      application run. Notifications are then sent for each medication and 
      user can confirm compliance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A personal medication record helps physicians and patients avoid 
      inadvertent inconsistencies across transitions in care by reviewing the 
      patient's complete medication regimen at the time of admission, transfer 
      and discharge and comparing it with the regimen being considered for the 
      new setting of care.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Leveraging the NextGen MedicineCabinet Application provides a readily 
      accessible, accurate and complete medication record, allowing providers 
      to:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Identify potential drug-on-drug interactions
      
			
        Recognize potentially inappropriate medications
      
			
        Reduce duplication of therapies or unnecessary medication
      
			
        Ensure appropriate monitoring of medication
      
			
        Improve adherence and proper use of medication
      
			
        Enhance patients&#8217; understanding of how to properly take their 
        medication and to recognize adverse reactions
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Windows 8 is providing new ways for healthcare IT developers like 
      NextGen to enable consumers to use one device to take charge of their 
      own healthcare and well-being. With the MedicineCabinet app, patients 
      can easily and seamlessly tap, type, or swipe to share and stay 
      connected,&#8221; said Dennis Schmuland, M.D., FAAFP, chief health strategy 
      officer of US Health  Life Sciences Microsoft Corporation. &#8220;NextGen is 
      leading the way for a new generation of Windows 8 apps that will make it 
      easier for people to proactively manage their health and be in tune with 
      their health risks.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Mobile patient engagement is at the forefront of today&#8217;s changing 
      healthcare environment providing consumer technology that encourages 
      members to control and lead healthier lifestyles is a key factor in 
      improving outcomes," explained Ike Ellison executive vice president of 
      business development for NextGen Healthcare. &#8220;By leveraging the power 
      and flexibility of the Microsoft Windows 8 platform, we can now provide 
      our customers and patients with an easy online tool that allows them to 
      actively engage in their well-being, ultimately enhancing care delivery 
      and results.&#8221;

      forecasts, however, undue reliance should not be placed on such 
      statements that speak only as of the date hereof. Moreover, these

      actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such 
      forward-looking statements are: volume and timing of systems sales and 
      installations; length of sales cycles and installation process; the

      product liability; changing economic, political or regulatory influences 
      in the health-care industry; changes in product-pricing policies; 
      availability of third-party products and components; competitive 
      pressures including product offerings, pricing and promotional 
      activities; the Company's ability or inability to attract and retain 
      qualified personnel; possible regulation of the Company's software by 
      the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; uncertainties concerning 
      threatened, pending and new litigation against the Company including 
      related professional services fees; uncertainties concerning the amount 
      and timing of professional fees incurred by the Company generally; 
      changes of accounting estimates and assumptions used to prepare the 
      prior periods' financial statements; general economic conditions; and 
      the risk factors detailed from time to time in Quality Systems' periodic 
      reports and registration statements filed with the Securities and 
      Exchange Commission. A significant portion of the Company's quarterly 
      sales of software product licenses and computer hardware is concluded in 
      the last month of the fiscal quarter, generally with a concentration of 
      such revenues earned in the final ten business days of that month. Due 
      to these and other factors, the Company's revenues and operating results 
      are very difficult to forecast. A major portion of the Company's costs 
      and expenses, such as personnel and facilities, are of a fixed nature 
      and, accordingly, a shortfall or decline in quarterly and/or annual 
      revenues typically results in lower profitability or losses. As a 
      result, comparison of the Company's period-to-period financial 
      performance is not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon 
      as an indicator of future performance. The Company undertakes no

      a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

responsibilities included supervision of underground and open pit mining
at the world's largest primary molybdenum producing property. He also had
responsibility for production crews and administrative functions

of molybdenum and copper byproducts and had annual revenues of $180
million.

Inc., Greenwich CT. where he was responsible for operations at Amax's
existing worldwide molybdenum properties, and where he was additionally

original gold rush period and was noted for its very high-grade ore - 1.0
au ounce/ton - and for the specimen quality of its gold ore. The mine was
eventually sold to Transwestern Mining Co., a subsidiary of New Mexico
Power of Albuquerque, NM.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - For the past four years, Elisse Walter stood out at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for her deep loyalty to SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the veteran regulator and SEC commissioner - one of two Democrats on the SEC - is moving to the fore at the powerful agency, taking over the chairmanship after Schapiro steps down next month. The promotion is prompting regulatory watchers to talk about whether Walter will blaze her own path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She has been very loyal to Mary Schapiro, and there are times when I thought she prioritized her loyalty to Mary over sometimes even her own positions on an issue," said Barbara Roper, the director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will be interesting to see what she is like when she comes out of Mary's shadow. Will it be more of the same? Or ... will her own style and views become more apparent?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter's and Schapiro's strong working relationship has carried through their closely intertwined career paths to their nearly uniform agreement on controversial regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two women first worked together at the SEC, when Schapiro started there as a commissioner in 1988 and Walter worked as a deputy director in the Corporation Finance Division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They later worked together at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority before returning to the SEC, where they served side by side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With just one exception, Walter has publicly voted for all of the regulations championed by Schapiro - from the controversial "proxy access" rule later overturned by a U.S. appeals court to rules that force companies to disclose if their products contain certain African conflict minerals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter's only public dissent was over a rule creating a central database that stores every trade order, execution and cancellation. Walter argued that the rule was too weak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the most part, the financial services sector and the legal community are not expecting many surprises when Walter takes over the agency's reins next month after Schapiro steps down from her post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She will pursue the agenda that Schapiro started," said Thomas Sporkin, a former top SEC enforcement attorney now with Buckley Sandler, a financial services law firm. "Essentially you are handing off the mantle to somebody who has the same agenda."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would probably mean moving full steam ahead with finalizing Wall Street reforms required by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, including adding transparency to the derivatives market and revamping oversight of credit rating firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could also mean trying to advance Schapiro's own initiatives, including reworking the structure of U.S. markets to ensure that high-frequency traders don't get an unfair edge over ordinary investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Walter is facing a challenge that Schapiro did not for most of her tenure - trying to win support for reforms from an SEC split between two Democrats and two Republicans. Even if President Barack Obama moves quickly to nominate another commissioner, it is expected to take months to secure Senate confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The SEC chairmanship is a difficult job any way you cut it, and at least as it stands right now, she is dealing with a four-person instead of a five-person commission," said David Tittsworth, the executive director of the Investment Adviser Association. "I don't think her job was made any easier by the fact that you lose Schapiro."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMART AND TOUGH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter, 62, is a Brooklyn-born Democrat who has spent most of her career as a financial regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an undergraduate degree from Yale and a law degree from Harvard, Walter has a reputation as a smart and accomplished attorney with a deep knowledge of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is well respected in SEC circles, including by those who tend not to agree with her liberal-leaning regulatory philosophy, and many say she's been accessible to interest groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Republican SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins, who has known Walter for 22 years, said her deep SEC background will be an asset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a lot of promise there," Atkins said. "If she draws on all of that, I think she can do a great job."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter joined the SEC as a commissioner in July 2008, a tumultuous time in both the agency's history and her personal life. About a month into her tenure, Walter was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. It was the second time in her life she had fought cancer. She had successfully beaten breast cancer during her career at the CFTC in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter underwent treatments at the same time as the SEC was dealing with the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers and acute criticism for not uncovering Bernard Madoff's decades-long $65 billion Ponzi scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Walter is in good health, with no signs of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though her SEC term technically expired in June, she will be able to continue serving at least until the end of December 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter has been coy about whether she wants a longer appointment as the head of the SEC, and the White House is said to be looking at other replacements with potentially more name recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those names are Sallie Krawcheck, a former top executive at Bank of America and Citigroup, and Treasury official Mary Miller, who spent 26 years at T. Rowe Price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FAVORS MORE MUNI DISCLOSURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Walter's policy positions have mostly been in lockstep with Schapiro's, Walter found her niche at the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is probably best known for championing potential reforms for the U.S. municipal market. Earlier this year, she played a leading role in the rollout of a new report by the SEC calling for new measures to bolster investor protection, such as forcing states and cities to disclose more financial information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott Lilienthal, a partner in Hogan Lovells and president of the National Association of Bond Lawyers, said Walter has demonstrated a willingness to be flexible on new rules for the muni market. He described her as "pragmatic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POSSIBLE FIDUCIARY FIGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another area in which she's been vocal is the oversight of investment advisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, Walter dissented on a key SEC study that laid out three potential ways to enhance the oversight of investment advisers because of a lack of resources at the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter said the study lacked balance and failed to address the many benefits of self-regulation - an option staunchly opposed by investment advisers, who believe it would add an onerous layer of regulation by a brokerage watchdog that doesn't intimately understand the advisory industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her views on the issue have made "a lot of advisers nervous," said Knut Rostad, the president of the Institute for the Fiduciary Standard, a group designed to promote and protect the investment advisory fiduciary standard that already exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given what she has done on the SRO (self-regulatory organization) issue might lead one to believe she may be more aggressive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sarah N.

are handing off the mantle to somebody who has the same agenda."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would probably mean moving full steam ahead with
finalizing Wall Street reforms required by the Dodd-Frank Act of
2010, including adding transparency to the derivatives market
and revamping oversight of credit rating firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could also mean trying to advance Schapiro's own
initiatives, including reworking the structure of U.S. markets
to ensure that high-frequency traders don't get an unfair edge
over ordinary investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Walter is facing a challenge that Schapiro did not for
most of her tenure - trying to win support for reforms from an
SEC split between two Democrats and two Republicans. Even if
President Barack Obama moves quickly to nominate another
commissioner, it is expected to take months to secure Senate
confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The SEC chairmanship is a difficult job any way you cut it,
and at least as it stands right now, she is dealing with a
four-person instead of a five-person commission," said David
Tittsworth, the executive director of the Investment Adviser
Association. "I don't think her job was made any easier by the
fact that you lose Schapiro."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMART AND TOUGH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter, 62, is a Brooklyn-born Democrat who has spent most
of her career as a financial regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an undergraduate degree from Yale and a law degree from
Harvard, Walter has a reputation as a smart and accomplished
attorney with a deep knowledge of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is well respected in SEC circles, including by those who
tend not to agree with her liberal-leaning regulatory
philosophy, and many say she's been accessible to interest
groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Republican SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins, who has
known Walter for 22 years, said her deep SEC background will be
an asset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a lot of promise there," Atkins said. "If she
draws on all of that, I think she can do a great job."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter joined the SEC as a commissioner in July 2008, a
tumultuous time in both the agency's history and her personal
life. About a month into her tenure, Walter was diagnosed with
ovarian cancer. It was the second time in her life she had
fought can c er. She had successfully beaten breast cancer during
her career at the CFTC in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter underwent treatments at the same time as the SEC was
dealing with the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers and
acute criticism for not uncovering Bernard Madoff's decades-long
$65 billion Ponzi scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Walter is in good health, with no signs of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though her SEC term technically expired in June, she will be
able to continue serving at least until the end of December
2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter has been coy about whether she wants a longer
appointment as the head of the SEC, and the White House is said
to be looking at other replacements with potentially more name
recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those names are Sallie Krawcheck, a former top
executive at Bank of America and Citigroup, and
Treasury official Mary Miller, who spent 26 years at T. Rowe
Price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FAVORS MORE MUNI DISCLOSURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Walter's policy positions have mostly been in
lockstep with Schapiro's, Walter found her niche at the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is probably best known for championing potential reforms
for the U.S. municipal market. Earlier this year, she played a
leading role in the rollout of a new report by the SEC calling
for new measures to bolster investor protection, such as forcing
states and cities to disclose more financial information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott Lilienthal, a partner in Hogan Lovells and president
of the National Association of Bond Lawyers, said Walter has
demonstrated a willingness to be flexible on new rules for the
muni market. He described her as "pragmatic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POSSIBLE FIDUCIARY FIGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another area in which she's been vocal is the oversight of
investment advisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, Walter dissented on a key SEC study that laid
out three potential ways to enhance the oversight of investment
advisers because of a lack of resources at the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter said the study lacked balance and failed to address
the many benefits of self-regulation - an option staunchly
opposed by investment advisers, who believe it would add an
onerous layer of regulation by a brokerage watchdog that doesn't
intimately understand the advisory industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her views on the issue have made "a lot of advisers
nervous," said Knut Rostad, the president of the Institute for
the Fiduciary Standard, a group designed to promote and protect
the investment advisory fiduciary standard that already exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given what she has done on the SRO (self-regulatory
organization) issue might lead one to believe she may be more
aggressive."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has sold 40 million Windows 8 licenses in the month since the launch, according to one of the new co-heads of the Windows unit, setting a faster pace than Windows 7 three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

			Directed Capital Announces Closing of Sixth Investment Fund with $50 
      Million in Equity and its Receipt of $84 Million Credit Facility in 
      August from Goldman Sachs Bank USA
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Capital Structure will Support Directed Capital&#8217;s Ongoing 
      Acquisition, Management and Repositioning of Distressed Commercial 
      Mortgage Loans Nationwide in the $1 Million to $10 Million Range
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Directed 
      Capital, a national distressed asset workout specialist firm that 
      opportunistically acquires, manages and resolves distressed commercial 
      mortgage loans in the $1 million to $10 million range, today announced 
      the closing of its sixth investment fund with $50 million in equity, 
      which will be paired with a $50 million revolving credit facility the 
      firm received in August from Goldman Sachs Bank USA (GS Bank).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This capital structure, including a $34 million term loan that Directed 
      Capital received from Goldman Sachs in August, will be used to finance 
      Directed Capital&#8217;s new acquisitions during the next three years. 
      Specifically, the $34 million term loan will be used to refinance assets 
      that Directed Capital currently owns in a prior fund. In addition to 
      this, GS Bank will have the first option to increase the revolving line 
      by $20 million for other new acquisitions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since Directed Capital was established in 2001, the company has 
      successfully closed six funds, raising more than $140 million in equity, 
      and has acquired more than $650 million in assets. Directed Capital is 
      known for generating superior returns that outperform the market by 
      operating in a niche space and using a customized investment process 
      that involves deploying capital into well-diversified asset classes and 
      geographies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;At Directed Capital, we solve a critical problem that exists in the 
      market. Our work helps the many Americans who own small- to mid-sized 
      businesses &#8211; which are the backbone of our nation&#8217;s economy &#8211; and may be 
      struggling to avoid foreclosure from lenders who are not able to 
      effectively work through their problems,&#8221; said Directed Capital&#8217;s CEO Chris 
      Moench, who has specialized for almost 20 years in buying distressed 
      debt. &#8220;Many borrowers say we&#8217;re the best thing that has happened to them 
      because we provide the solutions during their difficult situation that 
      others cannot offer. We take pride that our work at Directed Capital is 
      not only lucrative for our investors &#8211; it truly serves a greater good.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Operating in the alternative investment space, Directed Capital has 
      consistently provided its investors with superior returns that are 
      traditionally uncorrelated with the market. Unlike most banks and other 
      lenders that typically sell or foreclose on loans when borrowers hit a 
      rough patch, Directed Capital acquires these distressed loans and works 
      closely with the borrowers to help them get their loans back on track. 
      The firm has a dedicated team of 20 experienced professionals at its 
      offices in St. Petersburg, Fla., and San Diego who manage all aspects of 
      the process in-house.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Specifically, here&#8217;s how Directed Capital&#8217;s process works: The firm 
      leverages its extensive network of professional contacts to identify 
      unique opportunities, focusing exclusively on assets that have solid 
      collateral with strong cash flows and favorable collateral values versus 
      loan balances. Its experienced mortgage and real estate investment 
      professionals act nimbly, without obstruction from the bureaucratic 
      procedures that limit banks and other lenders. Its portfolio managers 
      develop practical, effective loan workout solutions, build solid 
      relationships with borrowers, and develop plans to reposition the loans 
      so they can re-access traditional financing channels. As a responsible 
      market participant, Directed Capital contributes to the health of the 
      financial system.

&lt;p&gt;Nov 27 - Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services said today that it assigned
Burbank, Calif.-based entertainment conglomerate The Walt Disney Co.'s 
proposed benchmark issuance of three-, five-, 10-, and 30-year debt its 'A'
issue-level rating. The company will use the proceeds of the issuance for
general corporate purposes, which could include the repayment of near-term debt
maturities including commercial paper or to be able to finance the purchase of
Lucasfilm. We estimate the impact of this issuance on Disney's leverage metrics
will be about 0.2x, even assuming the entire amount of debt is incremental. This
would bring the company's fully adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio to about 1.9x from
1.6x as of Sept 30, 2012, pro forma for the Lucasfilm acquisition. While still
within our 2x adjusted leverage threshold for Disney at an 'A' rating, the
company currently has limited room for economy-related underperformance,
operational missteps, or further large debt-financed acquisitions.

Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services' A/Stable/A-1 corporate credit rating on 
Walt Disney Co. incorporates Disney's leading, wide-ranging creative 
franchises and distribution capability, underpinning our assessment of its 
business risk profile as "strong," based on our criteria. Disney's financial 
risk profile is "modest," based on a fully adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 
less than our 2.0x threshold for the 'A' rating, good cash-flow generating 
ability, exceptional liquidity, and a financial policy balancing conservative 
credit metrics with shareholder-friendly initiatives and acquisitions. The 
stable rating outlook reflects our view that Disney's business performance 
will remain strong, particularly at the cable networks,  that management will 
maintain its current financial policy, and there will no further large 
debt-financed acquisitions.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Rates Disney's Proposed Offering 'A'; Outlook Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to The Walt Disney Company's 
      (Disney) proposed offering of benchmark 3-, 5-, 10-, and 30-year senior 
      unsecured notes. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full rating list is 
      shown below.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The notes will be issued under Disney's existing indenture dated Sept. 
      24, 2001, and will be pari passu with all existing debt. Similar to 
      existing bonds, there are no financial covenants. Proceeds will be used 
      for general corporate purposes. Fitch expects the company to use the 
      proceeds of this issuance to term-out commercial paper (CP) outstanding, 
      which totaled $2.05 billion at Sept. 29, 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings and Outlook reflect Disney's ample financial flexibility, 
      underpinned by strong free cash flow (FCF) generation that Fitch expects 
      to exceed $3.5 billion beginning fiscal 2013, and total leverage around 
      1.3x. Ratings incorporate Fitch's expectations that the company will 
      deploy all of its FCF for share repurchases and MA, as well as moderate 
      activity in excess of FCF, given strong liquidity and current credit 
      profile. The company's recent announcement that it would acquire film 
      production company Lucasfilm Limited for $2 billion in cash and $2 
      billion of equity, with the equity repurchased over the subsequent 24 
      months, is within Fitch's expectations for the company's financial 
      policy and within the current ratings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company's maturity schedule over the next several years ($750 
      million of maturities through calendar year end (CYE) 2012, 
      approximately $1 billion of maturities in CY 2013, and $1.45 billion in 
      CY 2014) will be easily manageable with FCF and access to the capital 
      markets. Fitch does not expect debt reduction going forward.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ratings incorporate the cyclicality of Disney's businesses, particularly 
      Parks  Resorts (31% of revenue), Consumer Products (8%), and the 
      advertising portion of Broadcast and Cable Networks (18%). These 
      businesses have exhibited a degree of resiliency in the recent sluggish 
      macroeconomic backdrop but remain at risk in the event of a more severe 
      economic downturn. Should macroeconomic volatility return, Fitch expects 
      these cyclical businesses to be under renewed pressure but that the 
      company's credit and financial profile will likely remain within current 
      ratings. Ratings incorporate Fitch's expectation that the Studio 
      Entertainment business, similar to that of its peers, will remain 
      volatile and low margin, given the hit-driven nature. The decline of DVD 
      sales, which is the window in which many films become profitable, is 
      becoming less of a concern amid the growth of higher-margin digital 
      distribution, and should be accommodated within current ratings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Disney's liquidity at Sept. 29, 2012 was strong and consisted of $3.4 
      billion of cash ($548 million of which was held at the International 
      Theme Parks), as well as $4.5 billion available under two revolving 
      credit facilities (RCF) of $2.25 billion each; the first matures in 
      February 2015 and the second in June 2017. These facilities backstop 
      Disney's CP program. Liquidity is further supported by the company's 
      aforementioned strong annual FCF generation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total debt at Sept. 29, 2012 was $14.3 billion and consisted of:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$2.05 billion of CP;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$10.1 billion of notes and debentures, with maturities ranging from 
      December 2012-2093;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$267 million of debt related to Hong Kong Disneyland (Disneyland Paris 
      debt is no longer outstanding after Disney refinanced it with 
      intercompany debt in September 2012), which is non-recourse back to 
      Disney but which Fitch consolidates under the assumption that the 
      company would back the loan payments;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Approximately $1.3 billion of foreign currency-denominated debt, 
      including approximately $300 million of debt assumed in the February 
      2012 acquisition of UTV, which was refinanced in September 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch notes the company's pension was 70% funded at Sept. 29, 2012 (the 
      last reported date). While annual pension funding obligations of several 
      hundred million dollars should continue over the next few years, they 
      will be more than covered by FCF.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Positive: Upward momentum to the ratings is unlikely over the 
      intermediate term. However, a compelling rationale for, and an explicit 
      public commitment to more conservative leverage thresholds could result 
      in upgrade consideration.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Negative: Rating pressure is less likely to be driven by operating 
      performance than by discretionary actions (debt-funded acquisitions) on 
      the part of management.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch rates Disney as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Walt Disney Company
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior unsecured debt 'A';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Short-term IDR 'F1';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Commercial paper 'F1'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ABC Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --IDR 'A';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior unsecured debt 'A'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Disney Enterprises, Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --IDR 'A';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior unsecured debt 'A'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch links the IDRs of the issuing entities (predominantly based on the 
      lack of any material restrictions on movements of cash between the 
      entities) and treats the unsecured debt of the entire company as pari 
      passu. Fitch recognizes the absence of upstream guarantees from the 
      operating assets and that debt at Disney Enterprises is structurally 
      senior to the holding company debt. However, Fitch does not distinguish 
      the issue ratings at the two entities due to the strong 'A' category 
      investment-grade IDR, Fitch's expectations of stable financial policies, 
      and the anticipation that future debt will be issued by Walt Disney 
      Company. Fitch would consider distinguishing between the ratings if 
      there appeared to be heightened risk of the company's IDR falling to 
      non-investment grade (where Disney Enterprises' enhanced recovery 
      prospects would be more relevant).
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'. 
      The ratings above were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and 
      therefore, Fitch has been compensated for the provision of the ratings.

&lt;p&gt;Nov 27 - Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to The Walt Disney
Company's (Disney) proposed offering of benchmark 3-, 5-, 10-, and
30-year senior unsecured notes. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full rating list
is shown below.

The notes will be issued under Disney's existing indenture dated Sept. 24, 2001,
and will be pari passu with all existing debt. Similar to existing bonds, there
are no financial covenants. Proceeds will be used for general corporate
purposes. Fitch expects the company to use the proceeds of this issuance to
term-out commercial paper (CP) outstanding, which totaled $2.05 billion at Sept.
29, 2012.

The ratings and Outlook reflect Disney's ample financial flexibility,
underpinned by strong free cash flow (FCF) generation that Fitch expects to
exceed $3.5 billion beginning fiscal 2013, and total leverage around 1.3x.
Ratings incorporate Fitch's expectations that the company will deploy all of its
FCF for share repurchases and M, as well as moderate activity in excess of
FCF, given strong liquidity and current credit profile. The company's recent
announcement that it would acquire film production company Lucasfilm Limited for
$2 billion in cash and $2 billion of equity, with the equity repurchased over
the subsequent 24 months, is within Fitch's expectations for the company's
financial policy and within the current ratings.

The company's maturity schedule over the next several years ($750 million of
maturities through calendar year end (CYE) 2012, approximately $1 billion of
maturities in CY 2013, and $1.45 billion in CY 2014) will be easily manageable
with FCF and access to the capital markets. Fitch does not expect debt reduction
going forward.

Ratings incorporate the cyclicality of Disney's businesses, particularly Parks &amp;
Resorts (31% of revenue), Consumer Products (8%), and the advertising portion of
Broadcast and Cable Networks (18%). These businesses have exhibited a degree of
resiliency in the recent sluggish macroeconomic backdrop but remain at risk in
the event of a more severe economic downturn. Should macroeconomic volatility
return, Fitch expects these cyclical businesses to be under renewed pressure but
that the company's credit and financial profile will likely remain within
current ratings. Ratings incorporate Fitch's expectation that the Studio
Entertainment business, similar to that of its peers, will remain volatile and
low margin, given the hit-driven nature. The decline of DVD sales, which is the
window in which many films become profitable, is becoming less of a concern amid
the growth of higher-margin digital distribution, and should be accommodated
within current ratings.

Disney's liquidity at Sept. 29, 2012 was strong and consisted of $3.4 billion of
cash ($548 million of which was held at the International Theme Parks), as well
as $4.5 billion available under two revolving credit facilities (RCF) of $2.25
billion each; the first matures in February 2015 and the second in June 2017.
These facilities backstop Disney's CP program. Liquidity is further supported by
the company's aforementioned strong annual FCF generation.

Total debt at Sept. 29, 2012 was $14.3 billion and consisted of:

--$2.05 billion of CP;
--$10.1 billion of notes and debentures, with maturities ranging from December
2012-2093;
--$267 million of debt related to Hong Kong Disneyland (Disneyland Paris debt is
no longer outstanding after Disney refinanced it with intercompany debt in
September 2012), which is non-recourse back to Disney but which Fitch
consolidates under the assumption that the company would back the loan payments;
--Approximately $1.3 billion of foreign currency-denominated debt, including
approximately $300 million of debt assumed in the February 2012 acquisition of
UTV, which was refinanced in September 2012.

Fitch notes the company's pension was 70% funded at Sept. 29, 2012 (the last
reported date). While annual pension funding obligations of several hundred
million dollars should continue over the next few years, they will be more than
covered by FCF.

KEY RATING DRIVERS
Positive: Upward momentum to the ratings is unlikely over the intermediate term.
However, a compelling rationale for, and an explicit public commitment to more
conservative leverage thresholds could result in upgrade consideration.

Negative: Rating pressure is less likely to be driven by operating performance
than by discretionary actions (debt-funded acquisitions) on the part of
management.

Fitch rates Disney as follows:

The Walt Disney Company
--Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A';
--Senior unsecured debt 'A';
--Short-term IDR 'F1';
--Commercial paper 'F1'.

ABC Inc.
--IDR 'A';
--Senior unsecured debt 'A'.

Disney Enterprises, Inc.
--IDR 'A';
--Senior unsecured debt 'A'.

Fitch links the IDRs of the issuing entities (predominantly based on the lack of
any material restrictions on movements of cash between the entities) and treats
the unsecured debt of the entire company as pari passu. Fitch recognizes the
absence of upstream guarantees from the operating assets and that debt at Disney
Enterprises is structurally senior to the holding company debt. However, Fitch
does not distinguish the issue ratings at the two entities due to the strong 'A'
category investment-grade IDR, Fitch's expectations of stable financial
policies, and the anticipation that future debt will be issued by Walt Disney
Company. Fitch would consider distinguishing between the ratings if there
appeared to be heightened risk of the company's IDR falling to non-investment
grade (where Disney Enterprises' enhanced recovery prospects would be more
relevant).

Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'. The ratings above
were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and therefore, Fitch has been
compensated for the provision of the ratings.

&lt;p&gt;  OAKLAND, CA and WASHINGTON, DC, Nov 27 (Marketwire) --

We're living in an era where anyone can weigh in, tune out, embrace or
reject a message. Consumers have now become editors and broadcasters
choosing the messages they spread.

    "Today, 'broadcast' traditions -- one-way communications -- are
crumbling. But too many marketers still believe the old modes of top-down
message delivery can be preserved. They think intelligent machines and
software will come to the rescue to let them micro-target messages and
sell anything they want using digital platforms like Facebook. They think
these platforms will be as powerful as a 30-second advertising spot on
the Super Bowl once was. They won't be," says Jonah Sachs,
internationally recognized story analyst and CEO of Free Range Studios. 

    "This is a time of peril for marketers, but there's also great
opportunity for those who understand that only truthful and empowering
messages -- like the great myths of the ancient world -- will break
through today's message overload," he says.

    In his recently published book, Winning the Story Wars: Why Those Who
Tell -- and Live -- the Best Stories Will Rule the Future (Harvard
Business Review Press, July 2012), Sachs explains how the "Digitoral Era"
has returned us the oral traditions of the past, where information was
passed from peer to peer rather than consumed through broadcast. 

    "Telling a great story is the only way to get a message heard or to build
an iconic brand," Sachs argues. "And while a great story may seem like
magic, thousands of years of natural selection teach us all that we need
to know."


--  Tell the truth. Great stories have always revealed the deepest truths
    about human nature, reminding audiences of their cherished values and
    encouraging their pursuits. While traditional marketing labels
    audiences as "consumers," iconic brands see the audience as the
    emerging hero, Sachs says.

    

--  Be interesting. Stories speak to the heart, not just the head, and
    favor magic and metaphor over claims and data. That's how they capture
    the audience's imagination and get spread virally.

    

--  Live the truth. It's not enough to call on your audience to reach for
    their higher values. Great storytellers, and storytelling brands, must
    also become mentors -- role models who deeply live out the values they
    espouse.

    

"In our Digitoral Era, the value and lifespan of an idea or product
will be built through a broad chain of perception, recognition and
affinity. None of us with an idea to promote will ever be successful
without getting people to take up the message and make it their own --
and pass it along. Sharing the story is a key part of the oral tradition,
and one that is indispensable in the modern era of digital
communications," Sachs says.

    Glimpses of "Broadcast"-Style Marketing's Failure -- and Empowerment
Marketing's Success

    Examples abound of the perils of inauthentic story telling or
"inadequacy" marketing (where the intention is make you feel small unless
you buy) and the success potential of empowerment marketing.

    "Remember that Kenneth Cole and Groupon both got into hot water after
callous campaigns mocking important political events in Egypt and Tibet,
encouraging shopping instead. Fiji Water tried to use social media
marketing to promote the idea that its carbon-offset program made the
product carbon-neutral. That claim was quickly debunked, and the company
received severe criticism for what many viewed as a cynical green-washing
campaign," Sachs says.

    "On the other side of the coin there's Chipotle's YouTube video, 'Back to
the Start.' It's a little story about a farmer who turns his farm over to
the industrial machine and then decides he's miserable. So he turns it
back to what he had before, to create a better world. Then at the end,
the Chipotle truck drives up and takes the food away. It doesn't say
anything about the product, doesn't say anything about what Chipotle
does. But it does put Chipotle behind this very uplifting message of a
farmer taking back control. The company didn't broadcast it anywhere;
they just put it up on the Internet. People liked it so much that it got
passed around, and it was so popular it was shown as content at the
Grammy's. 'Back to the Start' required no distribution budget -- but got
visibility that was certainly worth a lot more than it would cost to buy
a 60-second spot on the Grammy's."

    Marketers must enable the audience to embrace and share stories that
resonate with them. Those that master storytelling will be able to engage
people's innate quest for meaning, values and ritual, and their story
will be spread long after the message has been delivered, according to
Sachs and Winning the Story Wars.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Mary Schapiro, will step down next month after a tumultuous four years spent rehabilitating the agency's battered reputation, handing the reins temporarily to a close ally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Commissioner Elisse Walter, a career regulator who has sided with Schapiro on most of the critical issues before the agency, was named chairman-designate and could serve until December 2013, buying time for President Barack Obama to win Senate approval for a long-term replacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama plans to nominate someone soon, a White House official said. Walter is among the candidates likely to be considered, as is Treasury official Mary Miller, who spent nearly three decades at T. Rowe Price and has been outspoken about the need to make money markets safer for investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new SEC chair will need to finish Schapiro's task of resurrecting the agency's reputation, which was badly tarnished by the 2007-2009 financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC is considering money market reforms, additional market structure safeguards, and still needs to write a number of major rules dictated by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, including a final version of the Volcker rule to ban banks from trading for their own accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Elisse has been viewed as being in tune with Mary Schapiro's agenda," said Barry Barbash, a former director of the SEC's division of investment management, now an asset management lawyer at Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher LLP in Washington. "If the idea is to keep the SEC running the way it's been running with the same policies, Elisse would seem an appropriate choice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speculation has swirled for months that Schapiro would leave soon after the November 6 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her departure leaves the commission split 2-2 between Democrats and Republicans, which could make it harder for the commission to come to agreement. Obama could move to appoint a fifth commissioner before naming a new chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Schapiro took over in 2009, the agency was under heavy fire for regulatory blindspots that critics said helped fuel the crisis. It was also lambasted for failing to catch now-convicted Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff, whose fraud cost investors an estimated $65 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to shoring up the agency's name, Schapiro had to fight numerous other fires - from the 2010 "flash crash" that sent the Dow Jones industrial average tumbling 700 points within minutes to high-profile court losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've gotten a lot done, I'm really proud of where the agency is today, so it seemed like a good time," Schapiro said in an interview on Monday after announcing her departure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNFINISHED BUSINESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other possible replacements for Schapiro include Sallie Krawcheck, a former top executive at Bank of America and Citigroup, and Richard Ketchum, chairman of FINRA, Wall Street's self-funded regulator. SEC enforcement director Robert Khuzami, a Republican, is considered a long shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Walter is also a possibility, she has already been at the SEC for more than four years and served as acting chairman before Schapiro's confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many ways, Walter and Schapiro have been joined at the hip in their career experience and orientations. They both spent years as attorneys at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and at the SEC, with stints in top positions at FINRA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She is a strong advocate of disclosure, of regulation and of consumer protection," former SEC Commissioner Edward Fleischman said of Walter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCHAPIRO's LEGACY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schapiro's time at the SEC was marked by some controversy and her departure leaves uncertainty around major initiatives. But former SEC officials said Schapiro helped revive a moribund agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think she saved the SEC, which was close to extinction when she took over," former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schapiro said in the interview that steering the agency out of that period in its history was one of the highlights of her tenure there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She streamlined the SEC enforcement process, hired new types of employees and created a new tips database and a whistleblower office. In the past two years, the agency logged a record number of enforcement actions and brought major financial crisis cases, including a record $550 million settlement in 2010 with Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has also implemented reforms to protect markets against major swings caused by errant technology - as was the case with the flash crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The SEC is stronger, and our financial system is safer and better able to serve the American people - thanks in large part to Mary's hard work," Obama said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the agency has also been bogged down with major rules the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulation law required it to write, many of which are still in process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business groups have challenged much of the SEC's recent rule-making efforts and won major battles, including convincing a federal appeals court to throw out the agency's "proxy access" rule, which would have empowered shareholders to nominate directors to corporate boards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schapiro did not say what she planned to do next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Sarah Lynch, Mark Felsenthal and Rachelle Younglai in Washington and Suzanne Barlyn in New York; Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;  AUSTIN, TX, Nov 27 (Marketwire) -- 
Managing IP infrastructure is a critical component of ensuring network
availability and performance, and with the proliferation of BYOD devices
on the network as well as the transition to IPv6, the problem is more
complicated than ever before. SolarWinds (NYSE: SWI), a leading provider
of powerful and affordable IT management software, today announced the
upcoming release of SolarWinds IP Address Manager (IPAM) with feature
enhancements positioned to give IT professionals a powerful new choice in
the DDI market. 

    SolarWinds' latest version of IPAM combines feature-rich IP address
management capabilities, support for Microsoft DHCP and DNS management,
Cisco DHCP management and Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA), and
integration with key SolarWinds IT management products.

    By tightly integrating IP address management with DHCP/DNS management and
monitoring, IT pros achieve better manageability of their IP
infrastructure through a centralized view. As a result, users will gain
improved network security, decreased network downtime due to IP address
conflicts, increased efficiency by eliminating duplicate efforts in IP
administration, and improved regulatory compliance through historical
tracking and event recording of all IP-related activities.

    "Appliance-based DDI solutions like Infoblox are costly, time-intensive
and require a 'rip and replace' approach to existing infrastructure that
budget-conscious enterprises are just not willing to undertake," said
Sanjay Castelino, VP and market leader, SolarWinds. "SolarWinds is
delivering IT pros a better DDI management option -- an extension of
best-in-class IP infrastructure plus centralized management at a fraction
of the price."

    SolarWinds IPAM Highlights:


--  Manage the entire IP infrastructure from a single, intuitive Web
    console
--  Get integrated Microsoft DHCP and DNS and Cisco DHCP management and
    monitoring
--  Gain detailed visibility into IP address space usage through real-time
    views and historical tracking
--  Quickly troubleshoot IP address problems with a unified, at-a-glance
    dashboard
--  Deploy as a standalone application or extend the IPAM view with
    SolarWinds' product integration, including performance monitoring,
    configuration management and device/port tracking

    

Pricing and Availability

    Pricing for SolarWinds IP Address Manager starts at $1,995 USD and
includes one year of maintenance. For more information on SolarWinds IPAM

			CertiVox Strengthens Board with the Appointment of Former Microsoft 
      and RSA Executives
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CertiVox, a leading provider of web 2.0 security services, today 
      announced that it has expanded and strengthened its Board, with the 
      appointment of two new Non-Executive Directors, each with extensive 
      experience in accelerating small business growth, Pieter Knook and 
      Richard Turner.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pieter Knook brings a wealth of technical, commercial and 
      academic expertise to the Board. He holds Chairman, advisory and 
      non-executive positions with a number of innovative businesses in the 
      internet and mobile space. These include Pulsant, a hosting and cloud 
      provider; Better Generation, a green technology startup; the 
      Institution, a Swedish mobile device management company; and public 
      companies InterDigital and Monitise.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Knook also has extensive enterprise experience, having been a member of 
      seven different Boards at Vodafone, where he led the Vodafone Internet 
      Services unit. Before Vodafone, Knook spent 18 years at Microsoft, 
      becoming one of its top 25 executives, in an unusual career spanning 
      technical, sales, marketing and business management roles. In his most 
      recent role, he drove an embryonic startup to grow its revenues by more 
      than 40% a year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Multilingual, Cambridge-educated Knook is also a Visiting Professor in 
      Innovation at the Engineering Department in that University.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Richard Turner comes to CertiVox after nearly a decade of 
      Board-level appointments in Europe, Asia, the Pacific Region and the 
      United States. These included an extensive career at RSA, where he held 
      positions including Vice President EMEA  Asia Pacific and Vice 
      President Worldwide Channels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Most recently, Richard spent four years as Chief Executive of Clearswift 
      Ltd, one of the largest Security Software firms in the UK. Under his 
      leadership, Clearswift was transformed into a profitable business with 
      strong recurring revenues and high customer retention rates. He 
      delivered successive years of increased earnings and significant revenue 
      growth from the company&#8217;s line of Secure Gateway products.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Richard&#8217;s particular areas of expertise are in business 
      transformation/acceleration, distribution strategy and geographic market 
      expansion/entry. His skills were publicly recognised in 2011, when he 
      was awarded &#8220;Highly Commended&#8221; status in the CEO of the Year Category at 
      that year&#8217;s SC Magazine Awards.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Brian Spector, CEO of CertiVox, said: &#8220;I can&#8217;t express how excited and 
      proud I am that Pieter and Richard, with their proven expertise, have 
      decided to join our already dynamic and innovative Board. As CertiVox&#8217;s 
      renown grows, our revenue opportunities grow with it; Pieter and Richard 
      are absolutely the right guys to help us drive our strategy, product 
      offerings and customer development to ensure that we deliver on these 
      opportunities. I can&#8217;t think of anyone who would be a better fit for 
      this role.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Al Sisto, Executive Chairman, said: &#8220;The expansion and strengthening of 
      our Board is an important move for a ground-breaking business. CertiVox 
      is moving forward into its next stage of development and Pieter and 
      Richard bring the incremental expertise that we will leverage to make 
      the leap. I am looking forward to working with them.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;BELLEVUE, Washington (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp Chief Executive Steve Ballmer defended his company's record on innovation and financial performance at the annual shareholders' meeting, but conceded that he should have moved faster to get into the booming tablet market dominated by Apple Inc's iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Gates, co-founder and now chairman of the world's largest software company, was one of the first to champion tablet-sized devices more than 10 years ago, but Microsoft failed to come up with a product that worked as well as the iPad. Gates was silent throughout the meeting, attended by about 450 shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're innovating on the seam between software and hardware," said Ballmer, asked why his company had fallen behind rival Apple. "Maybe we should have done that earlier."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A month ago, Microsoft launched the Surface tablet - its first own-brand computer - but has not revealed sales figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the tablet market, "we see nothing but a sea of upside," Ballmer said, an acknowledgement that until now Microsoft has effectively had zero presence in the tablet market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I feel pretty good about our level of innovation," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said smartphones running Microsoft's new Windows software were selling four times as much as they did at this time last year. Microsoft has never given sales numbers of Windows phones, primarily made by Nokia, Samsung and HTC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows currently has 2 to 4 percent of the global smartphone market, according to various independent data providers. Its overall market share will not likely grow in proportion to its own sales, given that sales of other smartphones - mostly running Google's Android system - are also growing quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, flanked by Gates and Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein, was asked by several shareholders to explain Microsoft's lackluster share price, which has been stuck for a decade, and has been outperformed by Apple and Google Inc stock in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I understand your comment," he told one shareholder. He went on to explain that Microsoft had "done a phenomenal job of driving product volumes" and was focusing on profiting from that growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He suggested that whether investors recognized that value at any given time was out of his hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The stock market's kind of a funny thing," he said, adding that Microsoft had handed back $10 billion in dividends and share buybacks to investors in the last fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several shareholders at the meeting in Bellevue, an upscale suburb of Seattle, complimented the executives on how they had grown and managed the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's shares rose almost 18 percent during fiscal 2012, which ended in June of this year, compared with a 3 percent rise in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite such fluctuations, Microsoft's shares stand around the same level they did 10 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see a graphic on U.S. tech share price performance, 1990 to present, click on link.reuters.com/rug53t&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Kristen Hays&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Nov 28 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp submitted
the highest bid on Wednesday in an auction for drilling rights
in the western Gulf of Mexico, while BP Plc decided not
to participate even before the U.S. government temporarily
banned it from new federal contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's highest bid of $17.2 million was for a tract about
140 miles (225.3 km) south of Galveston, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tommy Beaudreau, director of the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management, which approves leases for oil and gas producers to
operate in the Gulf, said BP was not among the 13 companies that
submitted $157.7 million in bids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If BP had joined in, BOEM would not have awarded it any
leases, he said, citing the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency's ban over BP's "lack of business integrity" in the
Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If BP had bid in this lease sale, which they didn't, but if
they had, we wouldn't have awarded the leases in light of the
suspension," Beaudreau said after the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BP spokesman Brett Clanton said Wednesday that BP decided
not to participate in the lease sale "prior to and independent
of" the EPA's ban announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beaudreau noted the ban does not affect BP's existing leases
and permits. BP is the second-largest oil producer in the Gulf
behind Royal Dutch Shell, according to government
rankings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron also submitted the top sum of high bids at $56
million, followed by ConocoPhillips at $51.7 million,
BHP Billiton at $14.5 million and Exxon Mobil Corp
 at $5.9 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simmons &amp; Company International said in a note to investors
on Wednesday that the 116 tracts that received bids were 3
percent of those offered. The last western Gulf lease sale in
December 2011 garnered bids on 5 percent of tracts offered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simmons also noted that 20 companies submitted bids in the
last western Gulf sale, seven more than on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON Nov 28 (Reuters) - Security firm FireEye Inc named
former McAfee executive Dave DeWalt as its new chief executive,
who said he intends to take the fast-growing company public as
soon as next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeWalt, 48, resigned as president of McAfee last year after
engineering the sale of the company to chipmaker Intel Corp
 for $7.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FireEye sells technology that enables businesses to protect
themselves against malicious software that is able to get past
traditional anti-virus programs offered by companies such as
McAfee and Symantec Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview, DeWalt declined to say how much revenue
FireEye pulls in or to comment on profitability. He said the
firm has about 400 employees and more than 700 customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he intends to focus on growth over profitability,
spending to hire sales and marketing staff around the globe as
he moves to take the company public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It has a high chance of going public in 2013," DeWalt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was named chairman of FireEye last June. Analysts had
speculated that he might be named to a top position at a much
bigger company, such as Cisco Systems Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He sits on several boards, including Delta Air Lines Inc
, and previously worked for EMC Corp and Oracle

&lt;p&gt; The analyst community of Interactive Buyside has issued an initiation report on Walt Disney Co. (DIS) with a "Value" rating and a $60 price target within 12 months.  &lt;p&gt;Part of the independent analyst's thesis summary on the company is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"Shares of Walt Disney Co (DIS) traded off about 6% earlier this month after the company released earnings, as the market considered near-term headwinds in the coming quarter (specifically in DIS's Network and Studio businesses) as a reason to sell down the stock. We view this as a short-term hiccup in the face of some powerful trends over the next 1-3 years that DIS will begin to benefit from. We think DIS shares will grind higher over the next 12 months driven by:&#160; (1) Best-in-class cable assets that continue to be treated as such as a result of large market transactions (e.g., the recent News Corp / YES Network deal); (2) Achievement of returns after a number of years of heavy investing in its domestic and Asian parks  resorts; (3) Realization of Lucasfilm monetization opportunities ahead of the next 2015 planned Star Wars film release; and (4) Continued solid cash flow growth fueled by lower capex spend and used to repurchase shares which management considers to be trading "below intrinsic value".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Ballmer says maybe should have moved quicker on tablet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Says sales of Windows phones four times year-ago level&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Gates attends shareholders' meeting but is silent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BELLEVUE, Wash., Nov 28 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp 
Chief Executive Steve Ballmer defended his company's record on
innovation and financial performance at the annual shareholders'
meeting, but conceded that he should have moved faster to get
into the booming tablet market dominated by Apple Inc's 
iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Gates, co-founder and now chairman of the world's
largest software company, was one of the first to champion
tablet-sized devices more than 10 years ago, but Microsoft
failed to come up with a product that worked as well as the
iPad. Gates was silent throughout the meeting, attended by about
450 shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're innovating on the seam between software and
hardware," said Ballmer, asked why his company had fallen behind
rival Apple. "Maybe we should have done that earlier."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A month ago, Microsoft launched the Surface tablet - its
first own-brand computer - but has not revealed sales figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the tablet market, "we see nothing but a sea of upside,"
Ballmer said, an acknowledgement that until now Microsoft has
effectively had zero presence in the tablet market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I feel pretty good about our level of innovation," he
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said smartphones running Microsoft's new Windows
software were selling four times as much as they did at this
time last year. Microsoft has never given sales numbers of
Windows phones, primarily made by Nokia, Samsung
 and HTC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows currently has 2 to 4 percent of the global
smartphone market, according to various independent data
providers. Its overall market share will not likely grow in
proportion to its own sales, given that sales of other
smartphones - mostly running Google's Android system - are also
growing quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, flanked by Gates and Chief Financial Officer Peter
Klein, was asked by several shareholders to explain Microsoft's
lackluster share price, which has been stuck for a decade, and
has been outperformed by Apple and Google Inc stock in
recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I understand your comment," he told one shareholder. He
went on to explain that Microsoft had "done a phenomenal job of
driving product volumes" and was focusing on profiting from that
growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He suggested that whether investors recognized that value at
any given time was out of his hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The stock market's kind of a funny thing," he said, adding
that Microsoft had handed back $10 billion in dividends and
share buybacks to investors in the last fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several shareholders at the meeting in Bellevue, an upscale
suburb of Seattle, complimented the executives on how they had
grown and managed the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's shares rose almost 18 percent during fiscal
2012, which ended in June of this year, compared with a 3
percent rise in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite such fluctuations, Microsoft's shares stand around
the same level they did 10 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see a graphic on U.S. tech share price performance, 1990

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Nov 28 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp submitted
the highest bid on Wednesday in an auction for drilling rights
in the western Gulf of Mexico, while BP Plc sat out of
the race after the U.S. government temporarily banned it from
new federal contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron's highest bid of $17.2 million was for a tract about
140 miles (225.3 km) south of Galveston, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tommy Beaudreau, director of the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management, which approves leases for oil and gas producers to
operate in the Gulf, said BP was not among the 13 companies that
submitted $157.7 million in bids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If BP had joined in, he said, BOEM would not have awarded it
any leases in light of the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency's ban over BP's "lack of business integrity" in the
Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If BP had bid in this lease sale, which they didn't, but if
they had, we wouldn't have awarded the leases in light of the
suspension," he said after the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boudreau noted that the ban does not affect BP's existing
leases and permits. BP is the second-largest oil producer in the
Gulf behind Royal Dutch Shell, according to government
rankings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron also submitted the top sum of high bids at $56
million, followed by ConocoPhillips at $51.7 million,
BHP Billiton at $14.5 million and Exxon Mobil Corp
 at $5.9 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simmons &amp; Company International said in a note to investors
on Wednesday that the 116 tracts that received bids were 3
percent of those offered. The last western Gulf lease sale in
December 2011 garnered bids on 5 percent of tracts offered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simmons also noted that 20 companies submitted bids in the
last western Gulf sale, seven more than on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

			D23 Unlocks the Magic of Disney with a Year of Spectacular Events 
      across the Country
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			In 2013, The Official Disney Fan Club Will Travel to Boston, Newark, 
      Seattle, San Diego, Chicago, San Francisco, Phoenix, Washington, D.C., 
      and Los Angeles as Well as Disneyland and Walt Disney World Resorts

      In 2013, D23: The Official Disney Fan Club will reach out to fans across 
      the country through an exciting roster of uniquely magical Disney 
      experiences.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Starting in March, D23 takes the party on the road once again with our 
      second D23&#8217;S DISNEY FANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION. The event, 
      which played to crowds of enthusiastic fans across the U.S. earlier this 
      year, will commemorate dozens of magical milestones, each celebrating an 
      anniversary in 2013. Said The Hollywood Reporter of the 2012 
      event, &#8220;It&#8217;s a must for Disney fanatics and a fascinating look at Disney 
      history.&#8221; Hosted by Disney Archivists and D23 Team Members, D23&#8217;s 
      Disney Fanniversary Celebration events will be held in Boston, 
      Chicago, Los Angeles, Newark, Orlando, Phoenix, San Diego, San 
      Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C., and will revisit some of the

      series, and nearly 90 years of Disney history. Fanniversary 
      events will be open to the public, with special admission and surprises 
      created especially for D23 Members in attendance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      members access to advance screenings of the latest Disney animated and 
      live-action feature films. In 2012, D23 Members were among the first to 
      see Wreck-It Ralph, Frankenweenie, and Brave.

      April 13 and Saturday, June 8. Members will have an opportunity to 
      purchase limited-edition merchandise and view the park-like grounds at 
      Walt Disney Parks  Resorts' creative &#8220;think tank.&#8221; Additionally, in

      exclusive and one-of-a-kind events for our D23 Members.

      Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) announced today that Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has 
      agreed to offer Visa&#8217;s digital wallet service called V.me and has begun 
      piloting it to its online banking customers. This service gives 
      customers the ability to make simple and secure online payments without 
      the hassle of constantly entering card account number, bill-to and 
      ship-to information.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We look at everything through the lens of the customer and continue to 
      prioritize security, privacy, and fraud protection&#160;above all else,&#8221; said 
      David Godsman, Online and Mobile Solutions executive, Bank of America.
			&#8220;We believe our customers shouldn&#8217;t have to forgo security for 
      convenience when using a digital wallet. V.me offers customers a greatly 
      simplified and secure checkout process when shopping online without 
      sharing their financial information.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Bank of America customers can enroll in Visa&#8217;s V.me service through 
      online banking. Once enrolled, customers can shop with comfort knowing 
      they are protected by layers of security within Visa&#8217;s industry leading 
      network. Customers will also be able to check out with a few clicks, 
      eliminating the need to enter card, billing and shipping information for 
      each purchase.&#160;The service will work on websites of participating 
      merchants.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Visa is committed to delivering a new dimension of convenience and 
      security, one where consumers are no longer required to share personal 
      information at checkout,&#8221; said Jennifer Schulz (@Jen_Schulz), Global 
      Head of eCommerce, Visa Inc. &#8220;We believe that Bank of America&#8217;s decision 
      to offer V.me to its vast customer base will accelerate merchant 
      adoption and make this digital wallet even more valuable to consumers. 
      In the end, the most successful payment platforms will be the ones with 
      the greatest focus on security and the most benefit to consumers and 
      merchants.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			J.P. Morgan Survey Indicates Investor Confidence in Latin American 
      IPOs
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to a survey released today by J.P. Morgan&#8217;s Depositary 
      Receipts (DR) business, 70 percent of institutional investors in North 
      America and Europe who responded to the survey recommend that a Latin 
      American company pursue an initial public offering in today&#8217;s capital 
      markets. Survey participants, who were interviewed in September 2012, 
      believe that despite significant macroeconomic headwinds in Europe and 
      China, Latin America is a region with steadfast domestic markets and 
      attractively-valued companies that demonstrate significant growth 
      potential.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Each year we survey North American and European institutional 
      investors, with the aim of helping our Latin American clients better 
      understand investor sentiment toward companies in the region,&#8221; said 
      Candice Teruszkin, Latin America Regional DR Head of J.P. Morgan. &#8220;The 
      findings from this year&#8217;s survey may help Latin American issuers 
      identify ways to improve their market valuations over time and to better 
      compete for and attract capital needed to fund their growth.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The survey, 
      gathered the opinions of 40 institutional investors based in North 
      America and Europe. These investors held, as of June 30 2012, a combined 
      (approximately) $43 billion, or 16 percent, of actively managed equity 
      in Latin American companies1.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Other notable findings from the survey include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        The majority of the study&#8217;s participants believe that the Consumer 
        Goods (65%) and Consumer Services (60%) sectors offer the most 
        attractive investment opportunities, given Latin America&#8217;s growing 
        middle class, rising income levels and low domestic unemployment.
      
			
				Government intervention and trading liquidity are the two greatest 
        challenges Latin American companies face with respect to 
        maintaining a fair market valuation, according to 38% and 28% of 
        survey participants, respectively.
      
			
				A majority of the study&#8217;s respondents (55%) believe that an ADR 
        program can help a Latin American issuer maintain a fair market 
        valuation, citing the benefits of improved trading liquidity and 
        free float as well as increased exposure to a greater number of 
        potential new investors.
      
			
				More than one-third of the investors surveyed (35%) recommend that 
        Latin American companies that do not adhere to international reporting 
        standards do so, as a means to maintain fair market valuation.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On behalf of J.P. Morgan&#8217;s Depositary Receipts Group, Ipreo conducted a 
      telephone survey of global institutional investors from the United 
      States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and several other European countries 
      (Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland) in 
      September 2012. In total, Ipreo received feedback from 40 participants 
      who invest in Latin America. As of June 30, 2012, these participants&#8217; 
      firms managed a combined $807.6 billion in equity assets, $43.0 billion 
      of which represented holdings in Latin American companies, or 16% of all 
      Latin American equities held by active investment managers outside of 
      Latin America.

&lt;p&gt;  MILPITAS, CA, Nov 28 (Marketwire) -- 
FireEye(R), Inc., the leader in stopping advanced cyber attacks,
announced today that David DeWalt, chairman of the board of directors,
has been appointed chief executive officer (CEO). DeWalt has served as
the company's board chairman since June 2012. Ashar Aziz, FireEye founder
and CEO, will become the company's new vice chairman and chief strategy
officer as well as continue to serve as the company's CTO. 

    "FireEye addresses a very critical security gap plaguing businesses today
-- the lack of sufficient protection against this next generation of
cyber attacks. As more and more companies fall prey to cybercriminals
targeting their corporate data and proprietary IP, it becomes glaringly
apparent that the current approach to security is fundamentally broken.
FireEye has emerged as the clear leader in combatting these advanced
cyber attacks with its unique technology and platform," said DeWalt. "The
company has demonstrated tremendous growth and I'm excited to work side
by side with Ashar, one of the world's foremost technologists and
security thought leaders, and the entire executive team to further
innovate and expand FireEye's reach."

    DeWalt has over 25 years of experience leading innovative technology
companies and is a well-known authority on cyber security. He is the
former president, CEO, and director of McAfee, Inc. In addition to his
extensive executive resume, DeWalt is a frequent speaker at the World
Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland and was appointed by President Obama
to serve on the National Security Technology Advisory Council.

    "Dave has an incredible track record of leading and growing successful
technology companies, and his guidance on our board of directors has been
invaluable," said Aziz. "The combination of his leadership, operational
experience, and industry expertise will without a doubt help usher
FireEye into the next stage of its growth and expansion on a global
scale. We welcome him to the leadership team."

    FireEye has seen significant expansion in the past year, experiencing
explosive revenue growth and adding hundreds of new customers. In
addition:


--  Over 800 enterprise and government organizations use FireEye for
    next-generation threat protection, including almost a third of the
    Fortune 100 and 40 percent of the top ten companies in the top ten
    industries.
--  FireEye was just named the fourth fastest growing technology company
    in North America on the Deloitte 2012 Technology Fast 500(TM) list
    based on revenue growth between 2007 and 2011.
--  FireEye was awarded The Wall Street Journal 2012 Technology Innovation
    Award and was inducted into the JP Morgan Chase Hall of Innovation.
--  FireEye announced a number of industry partnerships with companies
    such as HP, Splunk, Blue Coat, McAfee, and RSA.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Nov 28 (Marketwire) -- 
Riverbed Technology (NASDAQ: RVBD), the performance company, today
announced that Riverbed(R) Stingray(TM) Traffic Manager, a software and
virtual edition application delivery controller (ADC), is now a certified
load balancer for Microsoft(R) Lync(R) 2010. The software was tested by
Riverbed and certified by Microsoft to meet Lync Server 2010 load
balancer requirements. This certification brings Stingray Traffic Manager
software's performance benefits to Microsoft Lync 2010, enabling
enterprise employees to be more productive and better collaborate whether
by phone, instant message or web conference. 

    Stingray Traffic Manager software optimizes performance and delivers
scalability to Lync by load balancing between pooled servers, increasing
Lync's ability to deliver highly-available and reliable communications
services for enterprise users. Lync can also be deployed with Domain Name
System (DNS) load balancing, a cost-effective form of application-level
load balancing that manages inbound traffic within the network. Stingray
Traffic Manager software works in conjunction with DNS load balancing by
managing all HTTP/HTTPS traffic, reducing the workload for DNS load
balancing to further optimize Lync performance.

    Lync enables Microsoft Exchange 2010 and SharePoint 2010 enterprise users
to keep track of their contacts' availability; send instant messages;
start or join an audio, video, or web conference; or make phone calls --
all through a consistent and familiar interface. As networks struggle to
manage large amounts of data between many users, enterprise applications
face increasing performance challenges. Lync accommodates this increase
in network traffic and helps scale to a large numbers of users by using
multiple front end and edge servers as a single pool of resource that
creates a set of reusable server connections, which is then managed from
a single interface.

    "Riverbed and Microsoft continue to work together on many key areas to
cost-efficiently improve the performance and reliability of platforms
used by businesses around the world," said Apurva Dave, vice president of
products and marketing, Stingray Business Unit at Riverbed. "The latest
testing and certification for Lync reaffirms the commitment from
Microsoft and Riverbed to integrate the leading communications and
performance platforms, guaranteeing end users an improved experience, and
enhanced ability to effectively communicate in the workplace." 

    The qualification program for Microsoft Lync load balancer partners
includes specific requirements for interoperability with Lync Server
2010, including scenario testing, comprehensive documentation and
support, and enterprise-class reliability and scalability. A
comprehensive guide for deploying Stingray Traffic Manager software as a
load balancer for Microsoft Lync 2010 is available at
http://www.riverbed.com/assets/media/documents/deployment_guides/stingray_traffi
_manager_deploy_microsoft_lync_2010.pdf.

      The condition often lasts into adulthood, with adult ADHD affecting an 
      estimated 4 percent of Americans.2 ADHD is characterized by 
      symptoms that include difficulty paying attention, impulsive behaviors 
      and, in some cases, patients being overly active.3

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Elisse Walter known for aligning with Schapiro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Observers wonder how she will distinguish herself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Veteran regulator, two-time cancer survivor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Favors muni reforms and SRO for investment advisers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Sarah N. Lynch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - For the past four years,
Elisse Walter stood out at the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission for her deep loyalty to SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the veteran regulator and SEC commissioner - one of two
Democrats on the SEC - is m oving to the fore at the powerful
agency, taking over the chairmanship after Schapiro steps down
next month. The promotion is prompting regulatory watchers to
talk about whether Walter will blaze her own path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She has been very loyal to Mary Schapiro, and there are
times when I thought she prioritized her loyalty to Mary over
sometimes even her own positions on an issue," said Barbara
Roper, the director of investor protection for the Consumer
Federation of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will be interesting to see what she is like when she
comes out of Mary's shadow. Will it be more of the same? Or ...
will her own style and views become more apparent?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter's and Schapiro's strong working relationship has
carried through their closely intertwined career paths to their
nearly uniform agreement on controversial regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two women first worked together at the SEC, when
Schapiro started there as a commissioner in 1988 and Walter
worked as a deputy director in the Corporation Finance Division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They later worked together at the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
before returning to the SEC, where they served side by side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With just one exception, Walter has publicly voted for all
of the regulations championed by Schapiro - from the
controversial "proxy access" rule later overturned by a U.S.
appeals court to rules that force companies to disclose if their
products contain certain African conflict minerals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter's only public dissent was over a rule creating a
central database that stores every trade order, execution and
cancellation. Walter argued that the rule was too weak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the most part, the financial services sector and the
legal community are not expecting many surprises when Walter
takes over the agency's reins next month after Schapiro steps
down from her post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She will pursue the agenda that Schapiro started," said
Thomas Sporkin, a former top SEC enforcement attorney now with
Buckley Sandler, a financial services law firm. "Essentially you
are handing off the mantle to somebody who has the same agenda."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would probably mean moving full steam ahead with
finalizing Wall Street reforms required by the Dodd-Frank Act of
2010, including adding transparency to the derivatives market
and revamping oversight of credit rating firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could also mean trying to advance Schapiro's own
initiatives, including reworking the structure of U.S. markets
to ensure that high-frequency traders don't get an unfair edge
over ordinary investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Walter is facing a challenge that Schapiro did not for
most of her tenure - trying to win support for reforms from an
SEC split between two Democrats and two Republicans. Even if
President Barack Obama moves quickly to nominate another
commissioner, it is expected to take months to secure Senate
confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The SEC chairmanship is a difficult job any way you cut it,
and at least as it stands right now, she is dealing with a
four-person instead of a five-person commission," said David
Tittsworth, the executive director of the Investment Adviser
Association. "I don't think her job was made any easier by the
fact that you lose Schapiro."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMART AND TOUGH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter, 62, is a Brooklyn-born Democrat who has spent most
of her career as a financial regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an undergraduate degree from Yale and a law degree from
Harvard, Walter has a reputation as a smart and accomplished
attorney with a deep knowledge of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is well respected in SEC circles, including by those who
tend not to agree with her liberal-leaning regulatory
philosophy, and many say she's been accessible to interest
groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Republican SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins, who has
known Walter for 22 years, said her deep SEC background will be
an asset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a lot of promise there," Atkins said. "If she
draws on all of that, I think she can do a great job."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter joined the SEC as a commissioner in July 2008, a
tumultuous time in both the agency's history and her personal
life. About a month into her tenure, Walter was diagnosed with
ovarian cancer. It was the second time in her life she had
fought can c er. She had successfully beaten breast cancer during
her career at the CFTC in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter underwent treatments at the same time as the SEC was
dealing with the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers and
acute criticism for not uncovering Bernard Madoff's decades-long
$65 billion Ponzi scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Walter is in good health, with no signs of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though her SEC term technically expired in June, she will be
able to continue serving at least until the end of December
2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter has been coy about whether she wants a longer
appointment as the head of the SEC, and the White House is said
to be looking at other replacements with potentially more name
recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those names are Sallie Krawcheck, a former top
executive at Bank of America and Citigroup, and
Treasury official Mary Miller, who spent 26 years at T. Rowe
Price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FAVORS MORE MUNI DISCLOSURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Walter's policy positions have mostly been in
lockstep with Schapiro's, Walter found her niche at the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is probably best known for championing potential reforms
for the U.S. municipal market. Earlier this year, she played a
leading role in the rollout of a new report by the SEC calling
for new measures to bolster investor protection, such as forcing
states and cities to disclose more financial information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott Lilienthal, a partner in Hogan Lovells and president
of the National Association of Bond Lawyers, said Walter has
demonstrated a willingness to be flexible on new rules for the
muni market. He described her as "pragmatic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POSSIBLE FIDUCIARY FIGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another area in which she's been vocal is the oversight of
investment advisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, Walter dissented on a key SEC study that laid
out three potential ways to enhance the oversight of investment
advisers because of a lack of resources at the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter said the study lacked balance and failed to address
the many benefits of self-regulation - an option staunchly
opposed by investment advisers, who believe it would add an
onerous layer of regulation by a brokerage watchdog that doesn't
intimately understand the advisory industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her views on the issue have made "a lot of advisers
nervous," said Knut Rostad, the president of the Institute for
the Fiduciary Standard, a group designed to promote and protect
the investment advisory fiduciary standard that already exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given what she has done on the SRO (self-regulatory
organization) issue might lead one to believe she may be more
aggressive."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Research and Markets: 2012 Report on the $75 Billion US Computer 
      Manufacturing Industry Featuring Dell, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/htszv5/computer) 
      has announced the addition of the "Computer 
      Manufacturing" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The US computer manufacturing industry includes about 1,200 companies 
      with combined annual revenue of about $75 billion. Major companies 
      include Dell, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM. The industry is highly 
      concentrated: the top 50 companies generate about 90 percent of revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Globally, computer manufacturing generates about $300 billion in annual 
      revenue, according to Computer Industry Almanac. Manufacturing is 
      concentrated in the Asia/Pacific region, home to industry leaders such 
      as Toshiba Corporation (Japan), Lenovo (China), and Foxconn (a division 
      of Taiwan-based Hon Hai Precision Industry).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Demand is tied to consumer and business income. The profitability of 
      individual computer companies depends on purchasing and production 
      efficiencies, and on technological expertise. Large companies have 
      economies of scale in purchasing and production. Small companies can 
      compete successfully by specializing in certain products or by 
      developing superior technology. The industry is capital-intensive: 
      annual revenue per employee is about $460,000.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      US imports of computer equipment amount to nearly $100 billion, more 
      than half from China. Exports are about $45 billion, with more than a 
      third going collectively to Mexico and Canada.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PRODUCTS, OPERATIONS  TECHNOLOGY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Major products include PCs, printers, monitors, mainframes, servers, and 
      disk drives. Personal computers account for about 40 percent of industry 
      revenue; mainframes and servers, 13 percent; and storage devices, about 
      10 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The manufacturing process for PCs consists of integrating circuit 
      boards, disk drives, and input/output devices into a final product. 
      Companies typically assemble PCs from components bought from other 
      manufacturers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Villagers want Ecuador ruling enforced in Canada&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Chevron says Canada court does not have jurisdiction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Company disputes $19 bln judgment against it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Julie Gordon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TORONTO, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Lawyers for Chevron Corp 
asked an Ontario judge on Thursday to toss out a bid by Amazon
villagers to seize its Canadian assets to help pay a $19 billion
award granted by an Ecuadorean court in decades-old pollution
case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hearing marks the first time the plaintiffs, 47 Amazon
villagers, have sought to persuade a foreign court to collect
damages awarded to them for environmental contamination in the
South American country dating back to the 1960s. Chevron
Canada's assets are worth more than $12 billion, the plaintiffs
say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the No. 2 U.S. oil company, has steadfastly refused
to pay the award, saying the February 2011 ruling by the
Ecuadorean court was influenced by fraud and bribery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the hearing in Toronto, lawyers told an Ontario
provincial court that the Canadian subsidiary - rather than the
California-based parent - owns all of Chevron's assets in
Canada. The company also argued that there is no tangible
connection between Chevron Canada and the Ecuadorean villagers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is simply no suggestion, let alone evidence, that
Chevron Canada ... had anything to do with what did or did not
happen in Ecuador," said Clarke Hunter, lawyer for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the plaintiffs were not immediately for comment.
They will present their case to the court on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The action is the latest skirmish in an two-decade conflict
between Chevron and residents of Ecuador's Lago Agrio region
over claims that Texaco, which Chevron acquired in 2001,
contaminated the area from 1964 to 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dispute has spawned litigation in numerous courts both
inside and outside the United States. The oil industry is
watching the case closely because the outcome may affect other
cases accusing companies of polluting the areas where they
operate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JUDGE'S QUESTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early in the proceedings on Thursday, the Ontario Superior
Court judge hearing the case questioned whether he should even
be considering the issue, as the Ecuadorean decision is now the
subject of an appeal in the Andean nation's constitutional
court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is there a final order from the Ecuadorean courts that this
court can consider," Justice David Brown asked Chevron's
attorney. "We don't look at stuff unless there is a final
order."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, Chevron lost a U.S. Supreme Court bid to block
the Ecuadorean judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled the country's courts
can recognize and enforce foreign judgments in cases where there
is a "reasonable and substantial connection" between the cause
of the action and the foreign court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs are seeking remedies in Brazil and Argentina
in addition to Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron Canada's assets include interests in offshore oil
projects in the North Atlantic, including Hibernia and Hebron, a
20 percent interest in the Shell-operated Athabasca Oil
Sands Project. The company also has a lubricants business in
Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Chevron rose 0.2 percent to $105.79 on Thursday in
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proceedings in the case - Chevron v Ecuador CV-12-454778 -
are expected to wrap up on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Downgrades 7 Classes of JPM 2006-LDP7
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has downgraded seven classes and affirmed 12 classes of JP 
      Morgan Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp pass-through certificates 
      series 2006-LDP7. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end 
      of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch modeled losses of 7.3% of the remaining pool; expected losses on 
      the original pool balance total 9.3%, including losses already incurred. 
      The pool has experienced $125.2 million (3.2% of the original pool 
      balance) in realized losses to date. Fitch has designated 55 loans 
      (23.6%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes 22 specially serviced 
      assets (14.4%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the November 2012 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been reduced by 15.4% to $3.33 billion from $3.94 
      billion at issuance. Per the servicer reporting, four loans (1.2% of the 
      pool) have defeased since issuance. Interest shortfalls are currently 
      affecting classes H through NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to expected losses is the Westfield Centro 
      Portfolio loan (7.2% of the pool), which is secured by a portfolio of 
      four regional malls and one anchored retail center totaling 2.4 million 
      square feet (sf) (1.7 million sf of collateral) located in OH, CT, MO, 
      CA, and CO. The decline in performance is mainly attributed to the 
      Midway Mall property located in Elyria, OH, which continues to struggle 
      with low occupancy in a weak market. The mall is currently 61.8% 
      occupied. Three of the remaining properties have current occupancies 
      above 95% and one is 73% occupied. The trailing twelve month (TTM) June 
      2012, debt-service coverage ratio (DSCR) for the portfolio remained 
      stable at 1.09x.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The next largest contributor to expected losses is the 
      specially-serviced 552,927 sf office property (1.6%) located in 
      Shoreview, MN, approximately 12 miles north of the Minneapolis CBD. The 
      collateral consists of five buildings built in 1973 and renovated in 
      2005. The loan was transferred to special servicing in October 2009 due 
      to imminent default resulting from the largest tenant, (41%) net 
      rentable area (NRA), vacating at lease expiration. Tenants include: Land 
      O'Lakes, Inc. (22.2%), expiring August 2013, American Biosystems, Inc. 
      (18.1%), expiring February 2013. The property is currently real estate 
      owned (REO) as of March 2012. CB Richard Ellis has been retained as 
      property manager and leasing agent. The property is currently 54% 
      occupied. The special servicer is currently evaluating possible 
      disposition alternatives.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest contributor to expected losses is the 
      specially-serviced, 197,097 sf retail center (0.9%) built in 1980 and 
      renovated in 2003, located in Jupiter, FL. The loan was transferred to 
      special servicing in August 2012 for imminent default. Leases at the 
      property include: Cobb's Theatre (35.5%), expiration June 2013; Beall's, 
      (18.3%), expiration April 2017 and Staples (10.9%) expiration Feb 2017. 
      As of June 2012, the property is 92.93% occupied. The special servicer 
      engaged legal counsel in September 2012. The special servicer continues 
      negotiations with the borrower while dual tracking foreclosure action.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two former stock brokers at a Connecticut financial services company were charged with insider trading on Thursday over a 2009 acquisition by computer giant IBM Corp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities said Thomas Conradt, David Weishaus and three unnamed colleagues made more than $1 million in illicit gains by trading in shares of SPSS Inc before IBM agreed on July 28, 2009, to buy the Chicago-based software company for $1.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said the alleged scheme started with a tip from an associate at the New York law firm that represented IBM in the transaction. Prosecutors did not name the law firm, but regulatory documents listed Cravath Swaine &amp; Moore as counsel to IBM in the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thomas Conradt, David Weishaus and their co-conspirators engaged in a chain of illegal tipping simply because they wanted to get rich quick," U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conradt, 34, is a lawyer living in Denver, while Weishaus, 32, lives in Baltimore. Both were formerly employed at Euro Pacific Capital Inc, a Westport, Connecticut-based firm, according to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharon Feldman, a lawyer for Conradt, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Michael Grudberg, a lawyer for Weishaus, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evan Chesler, presiding partner of Cravath, declined comment.

&lt;p&gt;* Ex-stock brokers indicted on fraud charges&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Trades said to be made before IBM deal for SPSS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Two former stock brokers at a
Connecticut financial services company were charged with insider
trading on Thursday over a 2009 acquisition by computer giant
IBM Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities said Thomas Conradt, David Weishaus and
three unnamed colleagues made more than $1 million in illicit
gains by trading in shares of SPSS Inc before IBM agreed on July
28, 2009, to buy the Chicago-based software company for $1.2
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said the alleged scheme started with a tip from

IBM in the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thomas Conradt, David Weishaus and their co-conspirators

&lt;p&gt;UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Cocaine trafficking through drug hub Guinea Bissau is spreading unabated amid turmoil sparked by an April military coup that has slashed the West African country's key cashew crop and almost halved its economic growth, the United Nations said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coup has set back Western efforts to combat drug cartels using Guinea Bissau, which has become a major transshipment point for Latin American cocaine headed to Europe. The United States and others have said army officials are implicated in the trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a report to the Security Council that weak law enforcement allowed organized crime groups to use Guinea Bissau unchallenged "as a transit point for international drug trafficking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This has led to the unabated spread of cocaine trafficking in Guinea Bissau," Ban said. "International intelligence suggests cocaine trafficking is taking place on a weekly or bi-weekly basis, without interference from government officials."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is believed that hundreds of kilograms of cocaine are trafficked in each single attempt," he said. "Organized criminal activities in the country constitute an additional threat to the rule of law, internal stability and the full restoration of constitutional order."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guinea Bissau has been in turmoil since soldiers seized power, derailing a presidential election in the latest of a string of military interventions in the country's politics since independence from Portugal in 1974. The military junta announced in late May that it had handed power back to civilian leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.N. Security Council in May imposed a travel ban on leaders of the April 12 military coup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PARALYZED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, six people were killed in a gun battle at an air force base near the country's capital, Bissau, in what diplomatic sources described as an apparent failed counter-coup attempt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I remain deeply concerned over the continued lack of progress in the restoration of constitutional order in Guinea Bissau and the deterioration of the security situation following the attack against a military base in Bissau," Ban said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The country has remained paralyzed, with dire consequences for the population and a worsening economic situation," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guinea Bissau, wedged between Guinea and Senegal on West Africa's coast with a population of about 1.6 million, is among the world's poorest countries and has struggled to combat the growing drug trafficking problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Nations said the country's economic growth for 2012 was estimated to be less than 2.5 percent at the end of July, down from an initial forecast of 4.5 percent made earlier in the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is mainly due to a decrease in the level of production and export of cashew nuts and a decline in public investments," Ban said. Cashews are the top revenue earner for Guinea Bissau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the economic decline could "jeopardize the ability of national institutions to ensure the minimum functioning of public administration and basic social services, especially in the areas of education, health and water and sanitation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Nations said in July, citing the Guinea Bissau Farmers Association, that Guinea Bissau's cashew production will drop by half in 2012 to about 100,000 tonnes. The United Nations said cashew production accounts for 90 percent of the country's income and employs almost 80 percent of the workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michelle Nichols, editing by Stacey Joyce)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Thomas Conradt, David Weishaus charged with fraud&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Trades said to be made before IBM bought SPSS in 2009&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Two former stock brokers at a

involving the men about their activity, some of which refer to
other insider-trading cases involving homemaking doyenne Martha
Stewart and the billionaire Mark Cuban.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said the scheme got its start with a tip from an

&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) sees a strong government presence in Brazil as a source for new business leads, a senior banker said on Thursday, highlighting the growing clout of the nation's public sector as an investment-banking client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decline in interest rates to record lows will create room for states and municipalities to access the debt capital markets in a way unheard of in the country, Aod Cunha, who heads the bank's public sector corporate banking unit, told Reuters. Government presence in the economy accounts for about 40 percent of Brazil's gross domestic product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under President Dilma Rousseff, measures such as interest-rates, tax reductions and regulatory changes have gained the upper hand - a sign JPMorgan bankers say is proof that state presence will stay significant in the long run. Efforts to boost investment will increase demand for specialized financial advisers among government agencies, Cunha added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our opinion is that the government will continue to have a relevant participation in the economy," Cunha said in an interview at the bank's S&#227;o Paulo offices. "Of all these developments, the drop in borrowing costs is probably the one that opens the most exciting business opportunities for us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The division underscores efforts by Chief Executive Jamie Dimon to expand in Brazil by offering a complete wholesale banking platform for clients. Since the end of 2010, JPMorgan has tripled assets and doubled its headcount in Brazil. It is now the largest foreign non-retail lender in the country, according to central bank data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank set up the Brazil unit almost two years ago to tap opportunities advising federal and regional governments and state pension funds on treasury management, debt underwriting and sovereign wealth fund management. JPMorgan has public sector clients in 128 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEALS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years in Brazil, high interest rates, a complex tax system and frequent boom-and-bust cycles crimped development of a local bond market. A recent surge in demand for corporate debt has pushed investors and government officials to look for new frontiers in fixed-income markets - such as structured finance products for states, cities and state-owned companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's public sector corporate banking unit is advising S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil's largest city, in the sale of up to 600 million reais ($286 million) of notes backed by tax liens. The unit also helped manage the sale of $275 million in subordinated notes by Banco do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul SA (BRSR5.SA), known as Banrisul, in a reopening this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;S&#227;o Paulo, also Brazil's most indebted city, is tapping growing demand for fixed-income investments as the central bank signaled on Wednesday that it will keep borrowing costs at a record low for a prolonged time. Rates in Brazil were for years the highest among the world's 20 biggest economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have engaged in various discussions with the states of S&#227;o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul and Minas Gerais," Cunha, a former finance secretary for Rio Grande do Sul state, said. "It's a market with terrific opportunities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;States and municipalities are legally forbidden from selling debt because of federal government-imposed curbs. But analysts have said some of those curbs, which form part of the Fiscal Responsibility Law enacted in 2000, could be eased in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The law has been a pillar of the government's financial stability in recent years, also helping regional government straighten up their finances since its implementation, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Cunha, the stock of regional debt nears about 360 billion reais - much of which could be refinanced so it alleviates the cost of debt-servicing for states and cities. JPMorgan's expertise structuring fixed-income products could help attract deals, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 2.10 Brazilian reais)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Guillermo Parra-Bernal and Alu&#237;sio Alves; Editing by David Gregorio and Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Consumer sales of Windows-powered personal computers fell 21 percent overall last month, figures released by a leading retail research firm showed on Thursday, indicating a lackluster debut for Microsoft Corp's Windows 8 operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many in the industry said Windows 8 might revive slack PC sales, but a report by NPD Group, which tracks computer sales weekly using data supplied by retailers, dampened those hopes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the same day, Microsoft announced pricing for its latest device designed to break Apple Inc's stranglehold on the tablet and lightweight laptop market. It is offering the Surface tablet running the full version of Windows 8 from $899, pitching it somewhere between Apple's latest iPad and MacBook Air laptop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the launch of Windows 8 on October 26, Windows laptop sales are down 24 percent, while desktop sales are down 9 percent compared with the same period last year, making an overall 21 percent dip, NPD Group said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually, a Microsoft release boosts PC sales because many consumers hold off purchases for several months so they can obtain the latest software immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the NPD's sales trends are borne out over the rest of the holiday shopping season, it would be a huge disappointment for Microsoft and PC makers such as Dell Inc, HP and Lenovo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After just four weeks on the market, it's still early to place blame on Windows 8 for the ongoing weakness in the PC market," said Stephen Baker, vice president of industry analysis at NPD. "We still have the whole holiday selling season ahead of us, but clearly Windows 8 did not prove to be the impetus for a sales turnaround some had hoped for."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NPD's data neither includes Microsoft's first Surface tablet, which is only available in its own stores, nor takes account of sales of PCs to businesses, which has recently been a much stronger market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LARGER TABLET AVAILABLE JANUARY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's first Surface tablet runs a version of Windows called RT, created to work on the low-power chips designed by ARM Holdings, which dominate smartphones and tablets but are incompatible with old Windows applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A larger, heavier tablet -- officially called 'Surface with Windows 8 Pro' -- will be on sale from January, running on an Intel Corp chip that works with all Microsoft's Windows and Office applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said on Thursday it would price the new Surface at $899 for a 64 gigabyte version and $999 for a 128 GB version. That does not include the optional cover, which doubles as a keyboard, costing $120 to $130.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company describes the wifi-only device as "a full PC and a tablet". It is priced above Apple's 64 GB wifi-only iPad at $699 and at the low end of Apple's MacBook Air line of lightweight laptops which start at $999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Intel-based Surface is thicker and heavier than both the iPad and Surface running Windows RT, but at 2 lbs (0.9 kg) is lighter than the MacBook Air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Microsoft introduced Windows 8, it has accounted for only 58 percent of Windows computing device unit sales, compared to the 83 percent Windows 7 accounted for at the same point after its launch in 2009, NPD said.

&lt;p&gt;* Windows PC retail sales down 21 pct last month&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* No sign of boost from Windows 8 launch Oct. 26&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Microsoft prices new Intel-chip Surface from $899&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Consumer sales of
Windows-powered personal computers fell 21 percent overall last
month, figures released by a leading retail research firm showed
on Thursday, indicating a lackluster debut for Microsoft Corp's
 Windows 8 operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many in the industry said Windows 8 might revive slack PC
sales, but a report by NPD Group, which tracks computer sales
weekly using data supplied by retailers, dampened those hopes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the same day, Microsoft announced pricing for its latest
device designed to break Apple Inc's stranglehold on
the tablet and lightweight laptop market. It is offering the
Surface tablet running the full version of Windows 8 from $899,
pitching it somewhere between Apple's latest iPad and MacBook
Air laptop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the launch of Windows 8 on Oct. 26, Windows laptop
sales are down 24 percent, while desktop sales are down 9
percent compared with the same period last year, making an
overall 21 percent dip, NPD Group said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually, a Microsoft release boosts PC sales because many
consumers hold off purchases for several months so they can
obtain the latest software immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the NPD's sales trends are borne out over the rest of the
holiday shopping season, it would be a huge disappointment for
Microsoft and PC makers such as Dell Inc, HP 
and Lenovo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After just four weeks on the market, it's still early to
place blame on Windows 8 for the ongoing weakness in the PC
market," said Stephen Baker, vice president of industry analysis
at NPD. "We still have the whole holiday selling season ahead of
us, but clearly Windows 8 did not prove to be the impetus for a
sales turnaround some had hoped for."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NPD's data neither includes Microsoft's first Surface
tablet, which is only available in its own stores, nor takes
account of sales of PCs to businesses, which has recently been a
much stronger market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LARGER TABLET AVAILABLE JANUARY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's first Surface tablet runs a version of Windows
called RT, created to work on the low-power chips designed by
ARM Holdings, which dominate smartphones and tablets but
are incompatible with old Windows applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A larger, heavier tablet -- officially called 'Surface with
Windows 8 Pro' -- will be on sale from January, running on an
Intel Corp chip that works with all Microsoft's Windows
and Office applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said on Thursday it would price the new Surface at
$899 for a 64 gigabyte version and $999 for a 128 GB version.
That does not include the optional cover, which doubles as a
keyboard, costing $120 to $130.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company describes the wifi-only device as "a full PC and
a tablet". It is priced above Apple's 64 GB wifi-only iPad at
$699 and at the low end of Apple's MacBook Air line of
lightweight laptops which start at $999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Intel-based Surface is thicker and heavier than both the
iPad and Surface running Windows RT, but at 2 lbs (0.9 kg) is
lighter than the MacBook Air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Microsoft introduced Windows 8, it has accounted for
only 58 percent of Windows computing device unit sales, compared
to the 83 percent Windows 7 accounted for at the same point
after its launch in 2009, NPD said. That was partly caused by
poor back-to-school sales that left many Windows 7 PCs on
retailers' shelves, NPD said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One patch of light for Microsoft is strong sales of
touchscreen Windows 8 laptops, which accounted for 6 percent of
Windows laptop sales, according to NPD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is still unclear how successful Microsoft's Windows 8
will be in the long term. The touch-optimized, tablet-friendly
system was designed to appeal to younger users with a colorful,
app-based interface, but has confused some traditional Windows
customers more used to keyboard and mouse commands. Beneath the
new interface design, it does not offer any radical new
computing power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, a top Windows executive said Microsoft had sold
40 million Windows 8 licenses in the month since the launch.
That is ahead of Windows 7 at the same stage, but it was not
clear how many of those were pre-orders, discounted upgrades, or
bulk sales to PC makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to tech research firm StatCounter, about 1 percent
of the world's 1.5 billion or so personal computers - making a
total of around 15 million - are actually running Windows 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LATHAM, N.Y., Nov. 29, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Plug Power Inc. (Nasdaq:PLUG), a leader in providing clean, reliable energy solutions, today announced that Procter  Gamble Co., (NYSE:PG) has selected its GenDrive&#174; fuel cell products to power its electric lift truck fleet in its manufacturing facility located in Mehoopany, PA. This additional facility now brings to four the number of sites converting to GenDrive fuel cells. Over 340 units will now be deployed throughout Procter  Gamble's manufacturing infrastructure. Additional PG sites using green fuel cell technology include facilities in California, North Carolina and Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Unlike the incumbent technology, GenDrive is powered by hydrogen, ensuring constant voltage to the truck and has a fueling cycle that takes just minutes. Lead-acid batteries need to be changed, charged, stored and maintained, a process that is timely and involves costly infrastructure. Since GenDrive is powered by hydrogen, an emerging clean-energy fuel, it is estimated that greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by more than 60 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Plug Power's GenDrive product is delivering increased fleet productivity, decreased facility operating costs and reduced greenhouse gas emissions at customer sites throughout North America," said Andy Marsh, CEO at Plug Power. "PG is one of six Fortune 100 companies to convert multiple facilities to GenDrive fuel cells. With this fourth site conversion, PG will lessen its environmental impact while realizing increased productivity, reduced operating costs and better predictability of its fleet performance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			About Plug Power Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The architects of modern fuel cell technology, Plug Power is revolutionizing the industry with cost-effective power solutions that increase productivity, lower operating costs and reduce carbon footprints. Long-standing relationships with industry leaders forged the path for Plug Power's key accounts, including Walmart, Sysco, PG and Mercedes. With more than 3,000 GenDrive units deployed to material handling customers, accumulating over 8.5 million hours of runtime, Plug Power manufactures tomorrow's incumbent power solutions today.

&lt;p&gt;* Follows major disruptions to exports in W. Africa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Kuito loadings resume after repair work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GENEVA Nov 29 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Chevron's Angolan
subsidiary Cabinda Gulf Oil Company lifted a month-long force
majeure at the Kuito offshore oil terminal on Nov. 27, Chevron
 said on Thursday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The end of force majeure will likely come as a relief to oil
traders active in the west African market where theft and
flooding in Nigeria has also caused disruptions to exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Chevron spokesman added that there was no impact on
production at Kuito as the necessary repair work on a mooring
line coincided with planned maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the repairs affected oil loadings at the terminal
over the past month, although these resumed this week, Chevron
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angola is Africa's second largest oil producer after Nigeria
and the Kuito platform typically loads two 920,000 barrel
tankers a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shell also lifted the last of three force majeures on its
Nigerian oil and gas exports on Thursday, declaring production
restored for Forcados crude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But force majeures, a clause that allows companies to
suspend contractual obligations in the face of unexpected
events, on Nigerian grades operated by Exxon Mobil and Eni
remain in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TORONTO (Reuters) - A wave of optimism surrounding the launch of Research In Motion's re-engineered BlackBerry line picked up momentum on Thursday with Goldman Sachs raising its rating on the smartphone maker and setting off a surge in its share price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brokerage firm joined a growing chorus of analysts who have warmed to the prospects of a successful introduction of the new BlackBerry 10 devices, which RIM hopes will let it claw back market share lost to Apple Inc's iPhone and smartphones powered by Google's Android platform. The BB10 devices are expected to hit store shelves early next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift in sentiment has been swift. A few weeks ago, most analysts believed RIM had squandered any chance it had to become a serious competitor because of repeated delays in the launch of the new smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with a launch date now set for January 30 and some positive feedback about the devices from telecom carriers and developers, some analysts now think RIM might be able turn around its fortunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a note to clients, Goldman analyst Simona Jankowski said preliminary specifications that have emerged on the BB10 devices appear impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With these devices RIM appears to finally be aiming for the leading edge hardware performance that was missing from its prior generations," Jankowski Said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN UPGRADE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jankowski said she believes more applications will be available for BB10 than had been expected because BlackBerry users typically download a relatively high number of paid apps, which is an enticement to app developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which raised its rating on RIM shares to "buy" from "neutral," also increased its price target to $16 from $9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By midday, RIM's shares had jumped up more than 6 percent on the Nasdaq to $11.78, while its Toronto-listed shares rose by a similar margin to C$11.72.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RIM shares, which have plunged about 90 percent from a 2008 high of more than $148, have risen some 75 percent in the last two months as the company moves closer to the launch of the new devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RIM promises its new devices will be faster and smoother than previous smartphones, and will have a large catalog of apps that are crucial to the success of any new line of smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Jefferies &amp; Co analyst Peter Misek, who has been one of RIM's biggest critics, raised his rating and price target on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, National Bank analyst Kris Thompson raised his price target on the shares, stating that there is more money to be made in the stock ahead of the launch of the BB10 devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RIM Chief Executive Thorsten Heins told Reuters earlier this month that he sees the new BB10 devices providing RIM with a framework for growth over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, not everyone has jumped on the bandwagon. Wedge Partners analyst Brian Blair warned on Wednesday that rising expectations for the BB10 in 2013 have provided false hope for investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe the run-up in the stock miscalculates the reality of consumer demand for BB10 next year. ... The fact is, the smartphone market has changed in the last 24 months, and RIM is not only late to the party, the party has moved to a different location and RIM is showing up at the wrong house," Blair said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Euan Rocha; Editing by Maureen Bavdek; and Peter Galloway)&lt;/p&gt;

similar margin to C$11.72.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RIM shares, which have plunged about 90 percent from a 2008
high of more than $148, have risen some 75 percent in the last
two months as the company moves closer to the launch of the new
devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RIM promises its new devices will be faster and smoother
than previous smartphones, and will have a large catalog of apps
that are crucial to the success of any new line of smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Jefferies &amp; Co analyst Peter Misek, who
has been one of RIM's biggest critics, raised his rating and
price target on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, National Bank analyst Kris Thompson raised his
price target on the shares, stating that there is more money to
be made in the stock ahead of the launch of the BB10 devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RIM Chief Executive Thorsten Heins told Reuters earlier this
month that he sees the new BB10 devices providing RIM with a
framework for growth over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, not everyone has jumped on the bandwagon. Wedge
Partners analyst Brian Blair warned on Wednesday that rising
expectations for the BB10 in 2013 have provided false hope for
investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe the run-up in the stock miscalculates the
reality of consumer demand for BB10 next year. ... The fact is,
the smartphone market has changed in the last 24 months, and RIM
is not only late to the party, the party has moved to a
different location and RIM is showing up at the wrong house,"
Blair said.

&lt;p&gt;The Argentine unit of U.S. energy company Chevron said
on Thursday its operations were being hit by a court embargo on
up to $19 billion worth of company assets, part of an
environmental lawsuit by Ecuadorean villagers. ID:nL1E8M7IVV]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're asking for this embargo to be lifted as soon as
possible in order to avert its negative impact on the country,
the government, the company and the future of Argentina's energy
industry," the company said in a statement published in
Argentine newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The judicial embargo hampers Chevron Argentina's capacity
to operate and re-invest because it affects more than 90 percent
of income from crude sales," it added. Chevron Argentina
produces about 5 percent of the country's crude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Ecuadorean court last year ordered Chevron Corp to pay
the enormous sum for contamination of watersheds over nearly 30
years that the plaintiffs say sickened indigenous tribespeople
and farmers in the Ecuadorean Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has refused to make any payments and accuses
Ecuadorean courts of fraud. Because the company has few assets
in the Andean nation, the plaintiffs are seeking enforcement of
the ruling in other countries including Brazil and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

			Data to be presented on BOSULIF&#174; (bosutinib) and Investigational 
      Antibody Drug Conjugate, Inotuzumab Ozogamicin
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Oncology will present updated data in chronic myeloid leukemia 
      (CML) for its oral Abl and Src kinase inhibitor, BOSULIF&#174;(bosutinib),12,3,4,5recently 
      approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and new data in 
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma (NHL) for 
      inotuzumab ozogamicin,6,7a CD-22 directed antibody drug 
      conjugate (ADC) that is currently being studied in two Phase 3 trials 
      (INO-VATE trials),8,9at the upcoming 54th Annual 
      Meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) in Atlanta, December 
      8-11.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The data being presented on Pfizer compounds at ASH provide important 
      new insights into marketed products like BOSULIF (bosutinib), agents in 
      late-stage clinical development like inotuzumab ozogamicin, and our 
      robust hematology pipeline. This is a reflection of Pfizer&#8217;s strong 
      commitment to bringing innovative therapies to patients with hematologic 
      cancers,&#8221; said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, senior vice president of clinical 
      development and medical affairs for Pfizer&#8217;s Oncology Business Unit.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			BOSULIF (bosutinib) Tablets
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      BOSULIF, approved by the FDA in September 2012, is indicated for the 
      treatment of adult patients with chronic, accelerated, or blast phase 
      Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myelogenous leukemia 
      (CML) with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy. Once-daily 
      BOSULIF was approved with pivotal trial data that included CML patients 
      treated with imatinib followed by a second-generation tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitor (TKI).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Despite advances made in recent years for the treatment of CML, 
      additional therapeutic options are still needed for those patients who 
      may never respond to initial treatment, may develop drug-resistant 
      disease, or may not be able to tolerate their therapy.3,4
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At ASH, Pfizer will present several analyses of Study 200, which 
      evaluated BOSULIF in this patient population. Presentations include:
    &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      A secondary analysis from the Bosutinib Efficacy and safety in chronic 
      myeloid Leukemia (BELA) study will be presented (Oral Presentation,

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Inotuzumab Ozogamicin
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Inotuzumab ozogamicin,6,7is an investigational ADC comprised 
      of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting CD22 that is linked to a 
      cytotoxic agent.10,11Linking an ADC with a cytotoxic agent 
      may allow chemotherapy to directly target the cancer cell12,13 
      and maximize its antitumor effect while minimizing its normal tissue 
      exposure, potentially resulting in an improved therapeutic index.14
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At ASH, Pfizer will present analyses of Phase 1 data of inotuzumab 
      ozogamicinin in the treatment of ALL and NHL:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Weekly Inotuzumab Ozogamicin in Adult Patients with Relapsed or

        Lymphoma: Preliminary Safety and Efficacy Data (Poster, Abstract 
        #1633, December 8)6
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Inotuzumab ozogamicin is currently being evaluated in two Phase 3 
      studies as part of the INO-VATE trials, which are currently open and 
      enrolling new patients. The first is in combination with rituximab in 
      adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive aggressive NHL 
      who are not candidates for intensive high-dose chemotherapy.8The 
      second study is in adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
      CD22-positive ALL versus investigator&#8217;s choice of chemotherapy.9
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			BOSULIF (bosutinib) Indication and Important Safety InformationBOSULIF 
      is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic, 
      accelerated, or blast phase Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to 
      prior therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Contraindication: Hypersensitivity to BOSULIF. Anaphylactic shock 
      occurred in less than 0.2% of treated patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Gastrointestinal Toxicity: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and 
      abdominal pain can occur. In the clinical trial, median time to onset 
      for diarrhea was 2 days, median duration was 1 day, and median number of 
      episodes per patient was 3 (range 1-221). Monitor and manage patients 
      using standards of care, including antidiarrheals, antiemetics, and/or 
      fluid replacement. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as 
      necessary.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Myelosuppression: Thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia can 
      occur. A complete blood count should be performed weekly for the first 
      month and then monthly or as clinically indicated. Withhold, dose 
      reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Hepatic Toxicity: Twenty percent of patients experienced an 
      increase in either alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate 
      aminotransferase (AST). Liver-enzyme elevation usually occurs early in 
      treatment. Perform monthly hepatic enzyme tests for the first 3 months 
      and as clinically indicated. In patients with transaminase elevations, 
      monitor liver enzymes more frequently. Drug-induced liver injury has 
      occurred. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Fluid Retention: Fluid retention can occur and may cause 
      pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, and/or 
      peripheral edema. Monitor and manage patients using standards of care. 
      Interrupt, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Embryofetal Toxicity: BOSULIF may cause fetal harm when 
      administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should 
      be advised of potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming 
      pregnant while receiving BOSULIF.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions observed in 
      greater than 20% of patients in the Phase 1/2 safety population (N=546) 
      were diarrhea, nausea, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, abdominal pain, rash, 
      anemia, pyrexia, and fatigue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The most common Grade 3/4 adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities 
      observed in greater than 10% of patients were thrombocytopenia, anemia, 
      and neutropenia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Drug Interactions: Avoid concurrent use with strong or moderate 
      CYP3A inhibitors or inducers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Proton Pump Inhibitors: Consider using short-acting antacids or 
      H2 blockers instead of PPIs. Separate antacid or H2 blocker dosing and 
      BOSULIF dosing by more than 2 hours.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Substrates of P-glycoprotein: BOSULIF may increase the plasma 
      concentrations of drugs that are P-gp substrates, such as digoxin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Nursing Mothers: Given the potential for serious adverse 
      reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to 
      discontinue nursing or BOSULIF.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Indian shares  
hit their highest in nearly 19 months on hopes the logjam in
parliament may end after the government agreed to a vote on
allowing foreign entry in multi-brand retail and helped by an
upgrade of Indian equities by Goldman Sachs.
    The BSE index rose to its highest since May 2, 2011 when it
hit an intraday high of 19,253.87. 
    Goldman Sachs raised Indian stocks to 'overweight' from
'market-weight', citing growth recovery and inflation moderation
ahead. 
    The NSE index also hit its highest level since April
28, 2011.

&lt;p&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp received a boost to its efforts to restart oil output in Brazil after a court overturned a ban on its operating in the country and the company agreed on a plan to improve safety procedures after an oil spill last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the moves suggest the case may be coming to a quick, negotiated resolution, said Eduardo Santos de Oliveira, the federal prosecutor from the city of Campos de Goytacazes who had first filed civil and criminal lawsuits in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the No. 2 U.S. oil company, and its drilling contractor Transocean Ltd face up to $20 billion in damages and some of their executives face jail terms of up to 31 years in the largest environmental prosecution in Brazil's history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's operational ban in Brazil was overturned by Guilherme Dienthaeler, a federal appeals court judge in Rio de Janeiro, court press officials told Reuters on Friday. Details of the ruling are unlikely until next week, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The civil case had been taken away from Oliveira and moved earlier this year to Rio de Janeiro. He believes his colleagues are seeking a quick settlement and that they have accepted regulators' arguments that his proposed penalties are too harsh for the size and nature of the spill and could scare off investment in one of the world's fastest-growing oil frontiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm disappointed. It looks like it's moving to a negotiated solution," Oliveira said in a phone interview. "I'm afraid we will lose the chance to apply a giant fine and the good that will do for preventing environmental crime."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A ban on operations in Brazil by Transocean, the world's largest offshore oil drilling rig operator, was overturned in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors had won injunctions banning Chevron and Transocean in July, seeking to assure payment of the nearly $20 billion penalties sought for alleged environmental damage from a the 3,600-barrel spill in the Frade Field northeast of Rio de Janeiro in November 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as the ban held, Brazil's oil regulator, the ANP, said it would be unable to consider a petition to restart oil output in Frade. The ban stood even though Chevron accepted a July report criticizing its drilling plan, along with fines of more than $16 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a related development, Chevron and Transocean agreed to a plan to change offshore safety and operating procedures, a spokeswoman for federal prosecutors told Reuters on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a final agreement is reached after public consultations, the plan will be presented to the federal judge hearing the suit. That could help the companies by showing their willingness to improve Brazil's oil industry, the prosecutors' office in Rio de Janeiro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONDUCT-CHANGE ACCORD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement, known as a "change-of-conduct accord," was drafted at the request of Chevron and Transocean with the same federal prosecutors handling the civil case, the prosecutors' office said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It declined to give details of the accord but said they would be presented at a public hearing on December 14 in Rio de Janeiro by federal prosecutor Gisele Porto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Porto is lead prosecutor on the civil lawsuits against Chevron and Transocean for the spill in Frade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Such negotiations usually indicate the desire of a prosecutor to resolve the case quickly," Oliveira said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's press office at its headquarters in San Ramon, California, confirmed the ban had been overturned, but gave no further details and declined to comment on the change-of-conduct accord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transocean's press officer in Houston declined to comment. Both companies say they committed no crime and acted correctly during and after the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one was hurt in the Frade accident. No oil reached shore, and there was no discernable environmental damage, according to Brazil's petroleum regulator, the ANP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Oliveira says the spill was one of the worst environmental disasters in Brazil's history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Frade field was producing 62,000 barrels of oil per day when it was shut in March to examine unexplained leaks in the area around the site of the November 2011 spill. Tests determined that the leaking oil was not from Chevron's reservoirs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frade is operated by Chevron, which also owns 52 percent of the field. Brazil's state-led Petrobras owns 30 percent, and Frade Jap&#227;o, owned by Japanese trading houses Sojitz Corp and Inpex Corp, has an 18 percent stake. Neither Petrobras nor Frade Jap&#227;o is the subject of spill-related prosecutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, Transocean and 17 of their employees and executives also face criminal charges that can carry financial penalties and jail terms of up to 31 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Frade spill was far less severe than other recent offshore accidents. More than 5 million barrels of oil were spilled in the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster in BP Plc's Macondo field in the Gulf of Mexico. Eleven people died in the accident, and beaches and fishing grounds were polluted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 15, BP agreed to pay a record $4.5 billion in penalties and plead guilty to criminal misconduct for the disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While criticizing some of Chevron's actions and levying 35.1 million reais ($16.6 million) in fines on the company, the ANP said in a July report that there was no negligence in the 2011 spill. It also said Transocean had no responsibility for the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Chevron and Transocean have said they will challenge the civil and criminal cases against them. Chevron shares fell 0.1 percent in New York on Friday to $105.69.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jeb Blount; Editing by Kieran Murray, John Wallace, Andrew Hay and Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO Nov 30 (Reuters) - A Brazilian lawsuit
seeking about $20 billion in damages from Chevron Corp 
and Transocean Ltd for alleged environmental damage from
a November 2011 oil spill appears to be heading to a quick
negotiated solution, the case's original prosecutor told Reuters
on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eduardo Santos de Oliveira, a federal prosecutor from
Campos, Brazil, said moves to negotiate a solution to the case
by colleagues in Rio de Janeiro could deprive Brazil of a
multi-billion-dollar fine. The case was moved to Rio from Campos
earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oliveira, who is still prosecuting a criminal case against
the companies and 17 of their employees for the spill, said he
was "disappointed" by the development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bill to create a permanent visa program for foreigners with advanced science and technical degrees cleared the House of Representatives on Friday, the latest salvo in the broader fight over U.S. immigration reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Republican-backed measure proposes reserving 55,000 permanent residence visas for foreign graduates of U.S. universities with master's and doctoral degrees in the "STEM" disciplines of science, technology, engineering and math.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Democrats argue that the plan unfairly pits lower-skilled immigrants against those with more education in the battle for visas as the new law would eliminate an existing program, often called the green card lottery, that provides visas to 55,000 people from countries with lower rates of immigration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Democrats, including President Barack Obama, oppose the Republican bill as it moves ahead a narrow measure instead of focusing attention on a comprehensive immigration reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill on Friday passed 245-139 in the Republican-controlled House, largely along party lines. But the legislation has little chance passing in the Democrat-controlled Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats, emboldened by strong support from Hispanics and other minorities in the November 6 election, are pushing for a large immigration overhaul that would put 11.5 million immigrants who are now in the country illegally on a path to citizenship - a major point of contention between the two parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadly, both parties agree on the benefits of helping science and technology experts stay in the United States. U.S. law already gives foreign students in STEM fields extra time to legally stay in the country after graduation to find work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas Republican Representative Lamar Smith, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee who had introduced the "STEM Jobs Act," said the high-tech visa program would help retain U.S.-trained workers to spur innovation and job creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In a global economy, we cannot afford to educate these foreign graduates in the U.S. and then send them back home to work for our competitors," Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STEM jobs, including teaching positions, account for roughly 6 percent of the U.S. economy, according to Nicole Smith, a senior economist who studies the issue at the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know some of the best schools in the world in those areas are found in the United States...

lower-skilled immigrants against those with more education in
the battle for visas as the new law would eliminate an existing
program, often called the green card lottery, that provides
visas to 55,000 people from countries with lower rates of
immigration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Democrats, including President Barack Obama, oppose the
Republican bill as it moves ahead a narrow measure instead of
focusing attention on a comprehensive immigration reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill on Friday passed 245-139 in the

      Walton Yellowhead Development Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;)

      Interest Debentures are 8% unsecured, subordinated, convertible, 
      extendable debentures of the Corporation and have substantially the same 
      terms as the Offering Debentures. The issuance of the Interest 
      Debentures will be in accordance with the terms of the Trust Indenture 
      governing the Offering Debentures which was disclosed in the 
      Corporation's October 2011 prospectus (the "Prospectus").

      The Offering Debentures were issued as part of the Corporation&#8217;s 
      Prospectus offering. The Offering Debentures are unsecured and bear 
      interest at a rate of 8% per annum. Interest on the debentures is 
      calculated each September 30, and is payable annually on or before 
      December 31. For this payment, interest is calculated from the date of 
      issuance up to September 30, 2012 for total interest of $1,496,021.18 
      due on or before December 31, 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The decision to pay the interest with the issuance of Interest 
      Debentures is primarily a result of an approval delay on the Servicing 
      Agreement from the City of Edmonton (&#8220;City&#8221;) which has caused 
      project delays and thus cash flow deviations from the original business 
      model. Notwithstanding these delays, the Corporation anticipates that it 
      will be able to complete the overall project within the approximate 
      three-year time frame and achieve the net internal rate of return of 13% 
      disclosed in the Prospectus.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Yellowhead Project has obtained sufficient letters of intent for 
      Phase 1 lots, and secured a construction loan for Phase 1 of the 
      Yellowhead Property (the "Construction Loan"). Once the 
      Servicing Agreement is entered into, the Construction Loan can be drawn 
      down by the Corporation. The Servicing Agreement is expected to be 
      completed by March 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The delay in approval from the City has impacted the milestones for 
      Phase 1 of the Yellowhead Project and the timelines are behind the 
      schedule disclosed in the Prospectus. These delays resulted from an 
      unanticipated amendment in the Winterburn Industrial Area Master Plan 
      servicing design by the City, a longer than anticipated time to obtain 
      subdivision comments from the City, and unfavourable weather conditions 
      during 2012.
			These events resulted in deferring the execution of 
      the proposed Servicing Agreement with the City, which is a condition to 
      drawing on the Construction Loan. As a result, the Corporation currently 
      does not have sufficient funds to pay the interest amount referred to 
      above and will issue the Interest Debentures instead.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Corporation&#8217;s development manager, Walton Development and Management 
      L.P. (&#8220;WDM&#8221;), proposed a servicing solution which has been 
      accepted by the City. WDM has also provided alternative designs for 
      offsite roadways to the City so that final subdivision comments can be 
      obtained. These actions will allow WDM to submit the detailed 
      engineering drawings to the City, and request preparation of the 
      Servicing Agreement which, when approved by the City, will allow the 
      Corporation to commence underground utility construction activities for 
      the Yellowhead Property.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Corporation has signed letters of interest for 43 of the 100 acres 
      in Phase 1 of the development, which satisfies the pre-sale condition to 
      draw on the Construction Loan. Once the Servicing Agreement with the 
      City is entered into, the Corporation will be able to draw on the 
      Construction Loan to replenish working capital that was used for 
      construction costs incurred and also to fund future construction costs 
      that are expected to be incurred for Phase 1 of the development.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In March of 2013, each investor will receive, by mail, a T5 from the 
      Corporation&#8217;s transfer agent or the shareholder&#8217;s brokerage firm. The T5 
      will indicate the amount of interest that the Offering Debenture holder 
      is required to report as a result of the issuance of the Interest 
      Debentures.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Launched in 2011, the Corporation owns a two-phase, 131.4 acres 
      industrial development in northwest Edmonton, Alberta, within the 
      Winterburn Industrial area.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Corporation is managed by Walton Asset Management L.P. and the 
      development of the property is managed by WDM, both of which are members 
      of the Walton Group.

			Walton Big Lake Development L.P. Approves Second Cash Distribution
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Big Lake Development L.P. (the &#8220;Partnership&#8221;) and its 
      general partner, Walton Big Lake Development Corporation (the &#8220;General 
      Partner&#8220;) announce that the board of directors of the General 
      Partner has approved a cash distribution on the limited partnership 
      units (the &#8220;Units&#8221;) in the amount of $2.29 per Unit.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This payment is the second cash distribution to limited partners in the 
      Partnership. Payment will be made on December 14, 2012 to Unitholders of 
      record as of the close of business on December 5, 2012. This 
      distribution follows a cash distribution of $1.00 per Unit made in 2011. 
      Pursuant to the terms of the Limited Partnership Agreement of the 
      Partnership, immediately after the distribution, the Units will be 
      consolidated automatically such that each Unit prior to the distribution 
      will become 0.8005 of a Unit after the distribution, resulting in a 
      total of 1,680,124 Units outstanding. Replacement certificates will not 
      be issued by the Partnership to reflect this consolidation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Milestones for Phase 1 of the development are behind management&#8217;s 
      original schedule as set out in the Partnership's October, 2010 
      prospectus. These delays were primarily caused by late regulatory 
      approvals and poor weather conditions. As a result of these delays, the 
      closing of Phase 1 committed lots by homebuilders is anticipated to 
      occur in 2013, thus deferring the receipt of homebuilders&#8217; payments to 
      next year. To ensure that limited partners receive their cash 
      distribution and to meet the prospectus' objective to provide annual 
      cash distributions, the board of directors of the General Partner 
      approved the Partnership entering into a loan agreement with a company 
      affiliated with Walton Global Investments Ltd. ("Walton Global"), 
      to borrow funds to make the above-referenced distribution to limited 
      partners in 2012. Notwithstanding the delays referred to above, 
      management is of the view that the overall net internal rate of return (&#8220;IRR&#8221;) 
      objectives and overall anticipated timing of the completion of the 
      project as provided in the prospectus remain accurate.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Partnership will borrow $5 million from an affiliate of Walton 
      Global at an annual interest rate of up to 10.5%, of which the 
      Partnership will use $4,806,114.60 to distribute to limited partners. 
      The additional $193,885.40 will be used to pay down a portion of the 
      Phase 1 construction loan.
			The loan will be a demand loan secured 
      by, among other things, a second mortgage on the Partnership's property. 
      The principal and interest thereunder will be due on December 6, 2015 
      with the option of the Partnership to extend the loan a further three 
      years provided that the Partnership has not been in default of any of 
      the terms thereof. The loan may be repaid by the Partnership prior to 
      the due date without bonus or penalty. Management anticipates that the 
      Phase 1 construction loan ($11.9 million currently outstanding as at 
      October 31, 2012) and the loan from the Walton affiliate will be repaid 
      by the Partnership by the end of the third quarter of 2013 from the 
      anticipated remaining proceeds of the current contractually committed 
      Phase 1 single family lots (approximately $11.5 million) and the 
      remaining uncommitted Phase 1 single family lots (approximately $8.3 
      million).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Given the high level of presold lots to builders in Phase 1 and the 
      ability to refinance at a rate below the anticipated net IRR from the 
      project, financing a distribution in this manner is accretive to the net 
      IRR for limited partners.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The loan from the Walton affiliate to the Partnership is a 
      "related-party transaction" under Canadian Securities Regulators 
      Multilateral Instrument 61-101 ("MI 61-101"). The 
      Partnership is exempt from the formal valuation requirements contained 
      in MI 61-101 pursuant to Section 5.5(b) thereof because the Units are 
      not listed on a stock exchange. The Partnership is exempt from the 
      minority approval requirements contained in MI 61-101 because the board 
      of directors of the General Partner has determined that, pursuant to 
      Section 5.7(1)(f) of MI 61-101, the loan from the Walton affiliate is on 
      reasonable commercial terms that are not less advantageous to the 
      Partnership than if the loan were obtained from a party dealing at arm's 
      length with the Partnership.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Each partner who is a Unitholder of record at the year-end of the 
      Partnership will receive by mail in March 2013, a T5013 from the 
      Partnership, the Partnership&#8217;s transfer agent or the Unitholder&#8217;s 
      brokerage firm. The T5013 indicates the amount and nature of the taxable 
      income the Unitholder is responsible to report.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Partnership was established in September 2010 to allow limited 
      partners to participate in the development of the Big Lake Property 
      comprising 136.5 acres of land in Edmonton, Alberta. Marketed under the 
      name &#8220;Hawks Ridge at Big Lake,&#8221; the property is a three-phase 
      residential development located in northwest Edmonton.

&lt;p&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO, Nov. 30 (Reuters) - A Brazilian appeals
court overturned an injunction barring Chevron Corp, the
No. 2 U.S. oil company, from operating in Brazil, a company
spokesman told Reuters on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The injunction was sought by Brazilian Federal prosecutors
who have launched a lawsuit against the company and its drilling
contractor, Transocean Ltd, seeking nearly $20 billion
for an offshore oil spill northeast of Rio de Janeiro in
November 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Nov 30 (Reuters) - A bill to create a permanent
visa program for foreigners with advanced science and technical
degrees cleared the House of Representatives on Friday, the
latest salvo in the broader fight over U.S. immigration reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Republican-backed measure would reserve 55,000 permanent
residence visas for foreign graduates of U.S. universities with
master's and doctoral degrees in the "STEM" disciplines of
science, technology, engineering and math.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Democrats including President Barack Obama oppose the
bill because it would eliminate an existing program, often
called the green card lottery, which provides visas to people
from countries with low rates of immigration to the United
States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill passed 245-139 in the Republican-controlled House,
largely along party lines. But Democrats control the Senate, and
a similar bill there has little chance of passing this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas Republican Representative Lamar Smith, chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee who introduced the "STEM Jobs Act,"
said the high-tech visa program would help the United States
retain U.S.-trained workers to spur innovation and job creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In a global economy, we cannot afford to educate these
foreign graduates in the U.S. and then send them back home to
work for our competitors," Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats argued that the bill unfairly pits lower-skilled
immigrants against those with more education and qualifications
in the battle for visas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Talk about picking winners and losers," said Representative
Luis Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat who chairs the Immigration
Task Force of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was no special line for PhD's and master's degree
holders at Ellis Island. There was no asterisk on the Statue of
Liberty that said your IQ must be this high to enter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats, emboldened by strong support from Hispanics and
other minorities in the Nov. 6 election, are pushing for
comprehensive immigration reform legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Transocean Ltd (RIG.N) have agreed to change offshore safety and operating procedures as part of a lawsuit seeking nearly $20 billion in damages from the companies for a November 2011 oil spill, Brazilian public prosecutors told Reuters on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement, known as a "change-of-conduct accord," was drafted at the companies' request with federal prosecutors who are handling two civil lawsuits against Chevron and Transocean, the prosecutors' press office in Rio de Janeiro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuits are the largest-ever environmental prosecutions in Brazil. The press office declined to give details of the accord but said they would be presented at a public hearing on December 14 in Rio de Janeiro by federal prosecutor Gisele Porto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron officials were not immediately available for comment. Transocean's press officer in Houston declined to comment. Both companies say they committed no crime and acted correctly during and after the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the December14 hearing and possible changes, the agreement is expected to be presented to the federal judge in Rio who is hearing the lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Porto is lead prosecutor on the civil lawsuits against Chevron, the No. 2 U.S. oil company, and Transocean, the world's largest offshore oil drilling rig operator, for the 3,600-barrel spill in the Frade field northeast of Rio de Janeiro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one was hurt in the Frade accident. No oil reached shore and there was no discernible environmental damage, according to Brazil's petroleum regulator, the ANP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Frade field was producing 62,000 barrels of oil per day when it was shut in March to examine unexplained leaks in the area near the site of the November 2011 spill. Frade is operated by Chevron, which also owns 52 percent of the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil's state-led Petrobras owns 30 percent, and Frade Jap&#227;o, owned by Japanese trading houses Sojitz Corp (1605.T) and Inpex Corp (2768.T), has an 18 percent stake. Neither Petrobras nor Frade Jap&#227;o is the subject of spill-related prosecutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, Transocean and 17 of their employees and executives also face criminal charges that can carry financial penalties and jail terms of up to 31 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spill was not as severe as other recent offshore accidents. More than 5 million barrels of oil was spilled in the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster in BP Plc's (BP.L) Macondo field in the Gulf of Mexico. Eleven people died in the accident and beaches and fishing grounds were polluted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 15, BP agreed to pay a record $4.5 billion in penalties and plead guilty to criminal misconduct for the disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While criticizing some of Chevron's actions and levying 35.1 million reais ($16.6 billion) in fines on the company, the ANP said in a July report that there was no negligence in the 2011 spill. The ANP said Transocean had no responsibility for the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both companies have said they will vigorously challenge the civil and criminal cases against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jeb Blount; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: IT Services Market in Latin America 2011-2015: 
      Accenture plc, Capgemini S.A., HP Co., and IBM Corp. Dominates
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/kps5m7/it_services) 
      has announced the addition of the "IT 
      Services Market in Latin America 2011-2015" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      TechNavio's analysts forecast the Information Technology market in Latin 
      America to grow at a CAGR of 9.93 over the period 2011-2015. One of the 
      key factors contributing to this market growth is increasing government 
      support. The IT Services market in Latin America has also been 
      witnessing the increasing adoption of cloud services. However, the 
      shortage of talent and increasing attrition rate could pose a challenge 
      to the growth of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The other vendors mentioned in the report are Fujitsu Ltd., Computer 
      Sciences Corp., Neoris Inc., Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd., Sonda S.A., 
      TCS Ltd., and Infosys Technologies Ltd.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from TechNavio's IT Services team 
      said: ''Global firms such as IBM, HP, SAP and Microsoft are increasing 
      their investment in cloud services. As a result of the recent economic 
      crisis, the adoption of cloud services and solutions such as software as 
      a service (SaaS) has been on the rise. Companies such as Microsoft and 
      SAP have been targeting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and 
      large corporations with Microsoft online services offerings and Business 
      All-in-One Fast-Start, respectively. The increasing adoption of cloud 
      computing services and solutions is also encouraging more software 
      spending by SMEs.''
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, the IT Services market in Latin America is 
      offering huge potential to IT vendors to tap into the imminent growth 
      opportunities. One of the main factors for this growth is the increasing 
      government support to improve the IT infrastructure in the region. 
      Various initiatives taken by the governments include providing policy 
      incentives, establishing high-tech zones, and providing development 
      funding.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report reveals that acquiring, retaining, and managing 
      talent is one of the most challenging factors confronting organizations.

Zacks' analyst wrote, "Maintaining its track record of delivering positive earnings surprises, JPMorgan substantially surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter. Results were largely benefited from improved revenue and lower provision for credit losses. However, these were marginally offset by still high non-interest expenses. Further, the asset quality deteriorated as a result of the implementation of new regulations. Yet, the company somewhat benefited from the gradually improving macro-economic conditions. We anticipate continued synergies from various factors like a reduction in reserves for future losses, business diversification, steadily improving retail banking performance and a strong capital position. Moreover, resumption of share buyback will boost investors' confidence in the stock. Nevertheless, pressure on net interest margin, low liquidity and a stringent regulatory environment along with various investigations might slightly mar the results in the upcoming quarters."&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank downgraded shares of Kohls Corp (KSS) from a buy rating to a hold rating.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Citigroup initiated coverage on shares of Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY). They issued a buy rating on the stock and set a $55.00 price target.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Janco Partners upgraded shares of Liberty Capital (LMCA) from an accumulate rating to a buy rating. They wrote, "The Company plans on executing the spin-off of Starz LLC by yearend or early in 2013, and is currently awaiting IRS approval. Liberty Media has also been adding to its Sirius XM stake through open markets purchases as the Company continues to wait for a key FCC decision on its efforts to gain control. The result of these restructuring efforts will highlight the inherent value of the Starz businesses while leaving Liberty Media shareholders owning a company with increased simplicity, transparency and flexibility. Due to these pending developments and the ongoing performance of Liberty's underlying investments we are updating our rating on shares of LMCA to $130 and placing a Buy rating the stock."&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Jefferies Group reiterated its hold rating on shares of Lockheed Martin Co. (LMT). They have a $88.00 price target on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;CRT Capital upgraded shares of Lockheed Martin Co. (LMT) from a sell rating to a fair value rating.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;RBC Capital initiated coverage on shares of LinnCo LLC (LNCO). They issued an outperform rating on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Wedbush initiated coverage on shares of Linkedin Co. (LNKD). They issued a neutral rating on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Zacks reiterated its neutral rating on shares of MGM Resorts (MGM). They have a $10.00 price target on the stock. Zacks' analyst wrote, "We believe MGM Resorts is ideally positioned to take advantage of both domestic and international opportunities. Limited supply in the Las Vegas market, improving trends at CityCenter and a moderate pickup in visits in some domestic properties all bode well for the company in the domestic arena. Remodels at Bellagio and MGM Grand will likely drive pricing power forward. The company's convention bookings for 2013 and 2014 also appear strong. An improving trend at CityCenter and MGM is a positive towards progress in China, marked with the official signing of the land concession contract at Cotai. However, a huge portion of debt in its balance sheet, stiff competition in Macau and overall slowdown in China remain some causes of concern. Hence, we maintain our Neutral rating on the stock."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			IBM FileNet&#174; Can Now Use Advanced Information Rights Management 
      Solution From Seclore
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Integration with Seclore FileSecure Gives FileNet&#174; Users Unparalleled 
      Information Rights Management Capabilities
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Seclore, an industry leader in the area of Information Rights Management 
      (IRM) today announced the integration of Seclore FileSecure with IBM&#8217;s 
      FileNet&#174; content management solution. The integration with FileNet&#174; 
      gives customers unparalleled control over a valuable asset, the 
      enterprise information housed within FileNet&#174;. Security policies in IBM 
      FileNet&#174; can control access to information only when it resides within 
      FileNet&#174;. However, once the information has been downloaded, native 
      FileNet&#174; capabilities do not provide a mechanism to control its usage. 
      There is also no ability to track how the information is used and who 
      else gains access to it, nor is it possible to revoke access to the 
      information.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Using Seclore&#8217;s technology enterprises can exercise full control over 
      who has access to each piece of information, what they can do with that 
      information, how long they have access to it and even control from where 
      they can access it. The controls are implemented whenever information is 
      downloaded from FileNet&#174;. The controls can not only be enforced when the 
      information is first accessed, but also altered or revoked in real time 
      at any time. All authorized and unauthorized attempts to access the 
      information can also be tracked.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Security and collaboration are usually considered mutually conflicting 
      goals, but Seclore FileSecure proves this to be a myth,&#8221; said Vishal 
      Gupta, CEO, Seclore. &#8220;The integration of Seclore FileSecure with IBM 
      FileNet&#174; makes information-centric security for all confidential content 
      an achievable aim.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In a world that relies ever more on collaboration, such control is 
      needed to mitigate the potentially disastrous consequences of 
      information breaches and protect the knowledge assets of the enterprise.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      An organization cannot function within its own walls in today&#8217;s dynamic 
      business environment. Partnerships, close collaborations with third 
      parties and outsourcing arrangements are all everyday necessities. 
      Protecting information when it is shared outside the boundaries of the 
      organization is even more critical and requires the type of 
      post-distribution access controls that Seclore FileSecure provides.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Multiple deployments of Seclore FileSecure for IBM FileNet&#174; are already 
      in production, protecting critical documents within and outside the 
      organization. Seclore FileSecure for IBM FileNet&#174; is available now, and 
      may be licensed through IBM FileNet&#174; partners or directly from Seclore.
    &lt;/p&gt;
