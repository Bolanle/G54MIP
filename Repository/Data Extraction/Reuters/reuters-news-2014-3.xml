&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The blockbuster movie "Frozen," a Walt Disney Animation Studios musical fairy tale about the bond between two royal sisters in an icy Scandinavian kingdom, won the Academy Award on Sunday for best animated feature film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The win is the first in the category for Walt Disney Animation Studios, the animation house founded by the man who pioneered the genre.

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI, March 2 (Reuters) - India's opposition Bharatiya
Janata Party will consider raising the cap on foreign investment
in the insurance sector from the current level of 26 percent if
it comes to power after elections due by May, a senior party
leader said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening up over $45 billion insurance business to greater
foreign participation is key to reviving investment in the
economy, and the ruling Congress government has repeatedly
sought parliament's approval to raise the limit to 49 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arun Jaitley, leader of the BJP in the upper house of
parliament, told a television channel that his party had
discussed with Congress leaders ways to break the deadlock over
the insurance legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have worked out various alternatives. Unfortunately,
this has (been) too close to the elections," Jaitley, considered
a potential finance minister in case of a BJP victory in the
election, told CNN-IBN in an interview broadcast on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Congress government's attempts to liberalise the sector
were repeatedly blocked by resistance from within its coalition
as well as from the opposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of employees at India's state-controlled
insurance companies and their communist party backers are
strongly opposed to foreign involvement in the insurance sector,
saying it would give them control over domestic savings and was
against the national interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Jaitley said his party would be look at the measure as a
way to revive investment in an economy that grew just 4.7
percent last year, its slowest in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a proposal on the drawing board," he said when asked
whether the party will raise the FDI limit to 49 percent if it
comes to power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BJP led by its prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi
is tipped to emerge as the single largest party in the election
and best placed to form a coalition government. The election is
expected to be called for April or May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modi is campaigning on a platform of strong government and
reforms to put Asia's third largest economy back on track and
provide jobs to millions of disaffected youth entering the
workforce each month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaitley, however, said his party remained opposed to foreign
direct investment in the retail sector, seen as threat to
millions of grocery stores and traders who form a pillar of
party support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As far as FDI in retail is concerned, the BJP has genuine
concerns against this, and I do not think it is quite likely
that policy is going to be changed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modi earlier this week said small retailers must learn to
work with large modern stores and online companies, suggesting a
softening of stand on the party's opposition to big players in
the retail sector.

		&lt;p&gt;
      The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) and DISH Network Corporation 
      (NASDAQ:DISH) today announced a groundbreaking, long-term, wide-ranging 
      distribution agreement that will provide DISH customers with access to 
      Disney&#8217;s robust line-up of top quality sports, news and entertainment 
      content across televisions, computers, smartphones, tablets, gaming 
      consoles and connected devices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The renewal agreement supports the companies&#8217; mutual goal to deliver the 
      best video content to customers across multiple platforms by 
      strengthening the value of the multichannel video subscription today and 
      by creating the opportunity for DISH to deliver new services in the 
      future.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The extensive and expanded distribution agreement grants DISH rights to 
      stream cleared linear and video-on-demand content from&#160;the ABC-owned 
      broadcast stations, ABC Family, Disney Channel, ESPN and ESPN2, as part 
      of an Internet delivered, IP-based multichannel offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additionally, for the first time, DISH customers will be able to access 
      Disney&#8217;s authenticated live and video-on-demand products, including 
      Watch ESPN, WATCH Disney, WATCH ABC Family and WATCH ABC using Internet 
      devices in the home and on the go.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The agreement will result in dismissal of all pending litigation between 
      the two companies, including disputes over PrimeTime Anytime and 
      AutoHop. As part of the accord, DISH will disable AutoHop functionality 
      for ABC content within the C3 ratings window. The deal also provides a 
      structure for other advertising models as the market evolves, including 
      dynamic ad insertion, advertising on mobile devices and extended 
      advertising measurement periods.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The creation of this agreement has really been about predicting the 
      future of television with a visionary and forward-leaning partner,&#8221; said 
      Joseph P. Clayton, DISH Chief Executive Officer and President. &#8220;Not only 
      will the exceptional Disney, ABC, ESPN entertainment portfolio continue 
      to delight our customers today, but we have a model from which to 
      deliver exciting new services tomorrow.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Anne Sweeney, Co-Chairman, Disney Media Networks, and President, 
      Disney/ABC Television Group, said, &#8220;We knew early on we had a 
      responsibility with this deal to not only do what was best for our 
      business, but to also position our industry for future growth. After 
      months of hard work and out-of-the box thinking on both sides, led by 
      Bob Iger and Charlie Ergen, this agreement, one of the most complex and 
      comprehensive we&#8217;ve ever undertaken, achieves just that. Not only were 
      innovative business solutions reached on complicated current issues, we 
      also planned for the evolution of our industry.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Added John Skipper, President, ESPN  Co-Chairman, Disney Media 
      Networks: &#8220;We worked with DISH to smartly address the future of the 
      multi-screen world on several levels. Together, we are adding value to 
      the traditional video subscription by making great content accessible 
      across platforms and delivering new products, including our WatchESPN 
      authenticated networks, the highly anticipated launch of the SEC ESPN 
      Network, expanded distribution for Longhorn Network, and a reimagined 
      ESPN Classic video-on-demand channel. At the same time, we are creating 
      opportunities to add new subscribers and introducing the value of a 
      multichannel subscription to a small subset of broadband-only consumers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This agreement allows us to bring more innovation to the customer 
      experience, including new marketing, packaging and delivery options,&#8221; 
      said Dave Shull, DISH Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial 
      Officer. &#8220;This paves the way for more customer choice and control over 
      the viewing experience.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      DISH will make available Disney Junior, Fusion, ESPN Goal Line, ESPN 
      Buzzer Beater, as well as Longhorn Network and the upcoming SEC ESPN 
      Network upon its launch. In addition, DISH, ESPN and ESPN Deportes 
      customers will have access to the live and video-on-demand channel ESPN3.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of the agreement, DISH will launch ESPNEWS, ESPNU, Disney 
      Channel and ABC Family in high definition. ESPN Classic will be 
      reintroduced as a video-on-demand channel.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The extensive and expanded rights package gives DISH customers access to 
      video-on-demand content at home, on computers and on-the-go through the 
      DISH Anywhere app for tablets and smartphones, including:

&lt;p&gt;In the newly created job of chief strategy officer, Penn's "blend of data analysis and creativity" will be applied across new product areas and strategic investments, not just marketing, new Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella told employees in a memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift for 60-year-old Penn, who made his name advising President Bill Clinton, theoretically gives him more power to sway Microsoft's direction.

"He doesn't own the advertising budget as Chris Capossela as chief marketing officer now does. But he, along with Eric Rudder, will chart the future of the company, Mark using market evidence and Eric using developer and business development."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rudder, another longtime Microsoft executive who runs the company's technology strategy, is to take over business development from Tony Bates, who Nadella said would leave the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bates was an internal rival to Nadella in the five-month race to succeed previous CEO Steve Ballmer, which was wrapped up in February with Nadella's appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCROOGLED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penn, who has advised co-founder Bill Gates for two decades and joined Microsoft full time in 2012, is best known in the company for the 'Don't Get Scroogled!' campaign, which aims to make consumers wary of Google Inc's use of personal information but has not dented the search engine leader's global dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penn, who pioneered rapid-feedback polling of voters in elections and policy setting in the 1990s, has a history of hard-hitting tactics.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, March 3 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp Chief
Executive Satya Nadella has appointed pollster and longtime
corporate adviser Mark Penn to the role of chief strategy
officer, according to a memo sent to company employees on
Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penn, who has advised co-founder Bill Gates and Microsoft
since the mid-1990s, made his name working with President Bill
Clinton between 1994 and 2000. He joined Microsoft full time in
2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella said in his memo, a copy of which was obtained by
Reuters, that Tony Bates, head of business development, would
leave the company. Bates was an internal rival in the race to
succeed previous CEO Steve Ballmer, which was concluded in
February with the appointment of Nadella.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Research and Markets: Global Complex Event Processing (CEP) Market to 
      2018: IBM, Software, SAP, Oracle  Tibco Software Dominate
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/t4g8sv/global_complex) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Complex Event Processing (CEP) Market to 2018: IBM, Software, SAP, 
      Oracle  Tibco Software Dominate" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The emergence of SaaS-based CEP software solutions has enabled 
      organizations to increase their efficiency and reduce the cost of 
      deploying valuable IT infrastructure. However, many organizations are 
      still analyzing the feasibility and relevance of such cloud computing 
      solutions in their IT operations. The SaaS-based model for CEP offers a 
      pay-per-use model, along with a one-time set-up fee for the software, 
      maintenance, upgrading, and lifetime support. Hence, the Global CEP 
      market is witnessing a trend where many vendors in the market have begun 
      to offer their solutions through the SaaS-based model to expand their 
      services and enter new markets. In addition, CEP software solutions are 
      becoming increasingly popular, as they enable organizations to track, 
      analyze, and process business data as events happen in order to make 
      decisions on all the events in microseconds. This is leading to 
      increased adoption of SaaS-based CEP software.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since the financial downturn in 2009, the importance of risk management 
      to traders and investors has increased. Therefore, investors and traders 
      are increasingly demanding fast access to trading market data. This is 
      in order to minimize risk and survive in a rapidly changing market 
      environment, and to make 'on-the-spot' decisions about buying or selling 
      the financial instruments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one such challenge is the high cost of 
      implementation. As deployment of CEP software is an expensive process, 
      its applications need a detailed and usually expensive process of 
      defining requirements. Hence, implementing a complete traditional CEP 
      solution is a time-consuming process. This increases the criticality of 
      the process as it becomes very costly to make any changes once the 
      deployment has started.

We needed to scale rapidly and implement the right business software infrastructure," said Ron Shelton, Adesto's Chief Financial Officer. "Working together with Tensoft's implementation team, we were able to implement and build a scalable system based on Tensoft's cloud-based solution to support a growing business that shipped more than 100 million units during 2013."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Adesto story is truly an amazing illustration of what can be accomplished by a talented and dedicated team of professionals. Our software is designed to support the needs of this industry -- and the Tensoft team brings years of industry experience to help. We were able to combine our capabilities with the Adesto team's vision and dedication," said Tensoft President and CEO Bob Scarborough.

			&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Mar 3, 2014) - 
				Jacqueline Fulop-Goodling, D.M.D. PC, aka Dr. Jacquie Smiles who has been an Invisalign Super Elite Provider in NY since 2002, is celebrating her 12th year as the top 1% of providers. She was asked to be Invisalign's National Spokesperson for a hygiene campaign in 2009 and became the spokesperson for Invisalign Teen, launching it on the Tyra Bank's show for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jacqueline Fulop-Goodling has treated thousands of adults, teens and children in the NY area to help them straighten their teeth with Invisalign clear braces. "I am honored to be named again as an Invisalign Elite Top 1% Provider. Using this new technology is a wonderful addition when considering orthodontic treatment. Invisalign's system is much faster for certain smiles and can be more comfortable," says Dr. Goodling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invisalign braces are a cosmetic dental treatment for the correction of crooked or misaligned teeth. They are made of transparent aligners which are custom made according to the teeth of the patient. 3-D computer technology is used to create customized clear aligners for each smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Invisalign is an absolutely perfect orthodontic solution for teens  adults. Since the average treatment time for teenagers can be 2-3 years, they desire a more discreet option like Invisalign," says Dr. Goodling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invisalign has been seeing increased success since its inception due to its discreet and removable nature. Patients are now looking for non-invasive methods of correcting the alignment of their teeth without opting for bulky metal braces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Goodling's practice anticipates seeing an increase of patients in her several clinic locations throughout Long Island, New York and New Jersey due to the increased popularity for clear braces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has also conducted a four-year double blind study on twins comparing traditional braces to Invisalign with positive results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an Invisalign Faculty member and professor, she has taught over 14,000 doctors and students in dental schools and universities throughout U.S. and Canada. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Dr. Goodling: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jacqueline Fulop-Goodling has been working in the Dental Care industry for 16 years and has become one of the premier dental care providers in New York City. She has completed her DMD degree and orthodontic residency at Boston University and after graduation became the first female and youngest Director of B.U.'s Predoctoral Orthodontic Department. She is also the national spokesperson for Invisalign and has traveled all over the world to increase awareness of the cosmetic procedure. Dr. Goodling has treated over 2,500 Invisalign patients and is ranked in the Top 10 Invisalign Providers in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* GSElevator creator spent most of banking career in Hong
Kong&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Twitter parody inspired by experience in Asian capital
markets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Book to be published later this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Steve Garton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, March 3 (IFR) - John Lefevre dialled in early to
a conference call from his desk high up in Citibank Tower in
central Hong Kong. He recorded his name as "UBS", put the line
on mute, and then dialled in again from another line, this time
correctly identifying himself as a Citigroup employee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was an important call, a discussion on the right price
for a rare offering of US dollar bonds from China Development
Bank, the state-owned Chinese policy bank. A large group of
bankers, both from Citigroup and the other managers, were on the
line, along with CDB's top financial officials, the people who
would ultimately be paying the banks to arrange the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the call, just as a senior CDB executive
was outlining his case for a better price on the deal, Lefevre
switched back to the first line and hung up. The automated voice
cut in: "Now leaving the call: UBS."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing of the prank was perfect, leaving the UBS
representatives rushing to reassure an annoyed client that they
were still on the line, and the rest of the syndicate group
laughing quietly at their rivals' misfortune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lefevre, the man behind a Twitter parody set in a Goldman
Sachs elevator, is already well-known to many in Asia's capital
markets. The former debt syndicate banker worked at Citigroup in
Hong Kong for much of his investment banking career, and now has
plans for a book detailing the excesses of Wall Street's finest
in the region's emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not have to look far for anecdotes. Lefevre built an
impressive reputation at Citigroup, earning the respect of his
colleagues and peers for his ballsy pricing calls and smooth
salesmanship, but it was his hot temper and after-hours exploits
that earned him the nickname of "Fever".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lefevre declined to comment for this article, but IFR
understands early drafts of Straight to Hell, due to be
published by Simon &amp; Schuster this October, have focused mainly
on his own experiences, both in and out of the office. One
former colleague who claims to have seen a proof describes the
stories as "electric".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A book promising to lift the lid on the extravagant and
irresponsible lifestyles of expatriate bankers in Asia's growing
capital markets will make for awkward reading at a time when the
investment banking industry is still struggling to improve its
public image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will also raise further questions over bankers' inflated
salaries and bonuses, and the corrupting influence of money on
smart and ambitious young professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOND MARKET ROOTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lefevre, 34, was born in the UK but spent his childhood near
Houston, Texas. He attended a private boarding school on the US
East Coast - Choate Rosemary Hall in Wallingford, Connecticut -
and joined Citigroup as an analyst after graduating from Babson
College, Massachusetts, in 2001. He worked in New York and
London, before moving to Hong Kong in 2004, where he worked on
the bank's Asia debt syndicate desk until leaving in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 2009, he signed up as one of the first employees of
Amias Berman, a fixed-income boutique set up by Jeremy Amias and
Charlie Berman, two ex-Salomon, ex-Citigroup veterans. The firm
positioned itself as an alternative to the bulge-bracket banks,
aiming to win a share of bond trading and advisory business at a
time when the traditional Wall Street firms were scaling back.
After changes to its business model, it was eventually sold to
commodity brokerage Marex Spectron, and subsequently to debt
broker Seaport Group in late 2013, long after its two founders
had returned to major global institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lefevre quit Amias Berman in late 2010 for a debt syndicate
job at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong, but never took up the
position. He has since relocated to Texas and started a family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The @GSElevator Twitter feed sprang from a conversation
between Lefevre and some former colleagues in a Hong Kong bar.
It offers amusing, often expletive-laden, and sexist exchanges
that it claims were overheard inside the elevators at Goldman
Sachs, and has clearly struck a chord with the social media
community's perception of investment bankers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@GSElevator has 645,000 followers. Citigroup's official
Twitter feed has 251,000, Goldman's 134,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early days, Lefevre's online alter ego stayed closer
to the Asian bond markets, as in this tweet from October 2011:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;#1: I always tell my Chinese clients, 'Being morally
bankrupt won't affect your credit rating.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesian issuers were another favourite target:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;#1: Being held accountable for selling Indonesian corporate
bonds is like getting busted for prescribing OxyContin in
Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not the conversations really happened, they often
painted a damningly realistic picture of the gulf between the

Microsoft Corp since Satya Nadella took over as its

			U.S. Court Declares Ecuador Judgment Against Chevron Corporation 
      Fraudulent, Unenforceable
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today 
      ruled that the $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron Corporation in 
      Ecuador was the product of fraud and racketeering activity, finding it 
      unenforceable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The nearly 500-page 
      ruling finds that Steven Donziger, the lead American lawyer behind 
      the Ecuadorian lawsuit against the company, violated the federal 
      Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), committing 
      extortion, money laundering, wire fraud, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
      violations, witness tampering and obstruction of justice in obtaining 
      the Ecuadorian judgment and in trying to cover up his and his 
      associates&#8217; crimes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The court found that Donziger and his team &#8220;wrote the [Ecuadorian] 
      court&#8217;s Judgment themselves and promised $500,000 to the Ecuadorian 
      judge to rule in their favor and sign their judgment.&#8221; As Judge Lewis 
      Kaplan stated in the court&#8217;s 
      ruling: &#8220;The wrongful actions of Donziger and his Ecuadorian legal 
      team would be offensive to the laws of any nation that aspires to the 
      rule of law, including Ecuador &#8211; and they knew it. Indeed, one 
      Ecuadorian legal team member, in a moment of panicky candor, admitted 
      that if documents exposing just part of what they had done were to come 
      to light, &#8216;apart from destroying the proceeding, all of us, your 
      attorneys, might go to jail.&#8217; It is time to face the facts.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Today&#8217;s decision is unequivocal: The Ecuadorian judgment against 
      Chevron is a fraud and is the result of criminal acts by a handful of 
      corrupt lawyers looking to enrich themselves,&#8221; said Hewitt Pate, Chevron 
      vice president and general counsel. &#8220;Chevron&#8217;s reputation was taken 
      hostage and held for a multibillion-dollar ransom. Rather than give in 
      and pay these criminals off, Chevron exposed the truth. Chevron is 
      pleased with today&#8217;s judgment. We are confident that any court that 
      respects the rule of law will likewise find the Ecuadorian judgment to 
      be illegitimate and unenforceable.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the seven-week RICO and fraud trial, Chevron presented unrebutted 
      evidence detailing the extent of the fraudulent acts undertaken and 
      directed by Donziger, his Ecuadorian legal team and other associates, 
      including fabricating environmental evidence, pressuring scientific 
      experts to falsify reports, plotting to intimidate judges into handing 
      down favorable rulings, bribing court-appointed experts, ghostwriting 
      court reports and even drafting the final judgment. Today&#8217;s judgment 
      made clear that Donziger and his associates resorted to fraud due to the 
      lack of evidence to support their claims against Chevron.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today&#8217;s ruling prohibits Donziger and his associates from seeking to 
      enforce the Ecuadorian judgment in the United States and further 
      prohibits them from profiting from their illegal acts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron has never operated in Ecuador. Texaco Petroleum (TexPet), which 
      became a subsidiary of Chevron in 2001, was a minority partner in an 
      oil-production consortium in Ecuador along with the state-owned oil 
      company, Petroecuador, from 1964 to 1992. After TexPet turned its 
      remaining share of the oil operations over to Petroecuador in 1992, 
      pursuant to an agreement with Ecuador, TexPet agreed to conduct a 
      remediation of selected production sites while Petroecuador committed to 
      perform any remaining cleanup. The government of Ecuador oversaw and 
      certified the successful completion of TexPet&#8217;s remediation and fully 
      released TexPet from further environmental liability. Petroecuador, 
      however, failed to conduct the cleanup it promised and has continued to 
      operate and expand oil operations in the former concession over the past 
      20 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      An international arbitration tribunal in The Hague has already ruled 
      that the Republic of Ecuador released Texaco &#8211; and therefore Chevron &#8211; 
      from liability for all public interest or collective environmental 
      claims through agreements signed in the 1990s. The Lago Agrio 
      plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers have repeatedly admitted, and the relief in the Lago 
      Agrio judgment makes clear, that their claims are exclusively collective 
      and not individual.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Chevron believes that the people of the Oriente deserve a better 
      quality of life. They lack basic infrastructure, including water and 
      sewage treatment. We hope that this ruling will prompt the government of 
      Ecuador and Petroecuador to finally take responsibility and address the 
      issues facing the region and its people,&#8221; Pate added.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron is one of the world&#8217;s leading integrated energy companies, with 
      subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company&#8217;s success is 
      driven by the ingenuity and commitment of its employees and their 
      application of the most innovative technologies in the world. Chevron is 
      involved in virtually every facet of the energy industry. The company 
      explores for, produces and transports crude oil and natural gas; 
      refines, markets and distributes transportation fuels and other energy 
      products; manufactures and sells petrochemical products; generates power 
      and produces geothermal energy; provides energy efficiency solutions; 
      and develops the energy resources of the future, including biofuels. 
      Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif. More information about Chevron is

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - An American lawyer used "corrupt means" to secure a multi-billion-dollar pollution judgment against Chevron Corp in Ecuador, a U.S. judge ruled on Tuesday, a major setback for Ecuadorean villagers hoping to collect on the award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in New York said he found "clear and convincing evidence" that attorney Steven Donziger's legal team used bribery, fraud and extortion in pursuit of an $18 billion judgment against the oil company issued in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The villagers had said Texaco, later acquired by Chevron, contaminated an oil field in northeastern Ecuador between 1964 and 1992. Ecuador's high court cut the judgment to $9.5 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But regardless of whether there is pollution at the site, Kaplan said, Donziger cannot use a "Robin Hood" defense to justify illegal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaplan's decision bars Donziger and the villagers from enforcing the Ecuadorean ruling in the United States. It may also give Chevron legal ammunition in other countries where the plaintiffs could try to go after Chevron's assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a six-week trial last year, Chevron accused Donziger of fraud and racketeering and said Texaco cleaned up the site, known as Lago Agrio, before handing it over to a state-controlled entity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger, who has repeatedly leveled accusations of bias against Kaplan and who predicted he would lose the case, called Tuesday's decision "appalling" and blamed Kaplan's "implacable hostility" toward him and his Ecuadorean clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Through this decision, we now have the spectacle of a Manhattan trial judge purporting to overrule Ecuador's Supreme Court on questions of Ecuadorean law," he said in a written statement. He vowed to appeal and said the ruling would not stop his clients from seeking to enforce the judgment in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron no longer has significant assets in Ecuador, and the villagers have tried to enforce the ruling in Canada, Argentina and Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron Chief Executive John Watson said the ruling was "a resounding victory."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is expected to use Kaplan's decision to defend itself against claims abroad. In a statement, the company said, "Any court that respects the rule of law will find the Lago Agrio judgment to be illegitimate and unenforceable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron and Ecuador also remain locked in an arbitration dispute in international court over cleanup costs at the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Washington, the Ecuadorean embassy said in a statement that the decision "does not exonerate Chevron from its own legal and moral responsibilities resulting from its decades of contamination."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'VOLUMINOUS' EVIDENCE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision caps a years-long battle in U.S. courts between Chevron and Donziger, pitting the company's vast resources against a lawyer who argued he was the victim of an unscrupulous corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kaplan found that the evidence against Donziger was "voluminous," including things like coded emails, secret payments and clandestine meetings with judges that "normally come only out of Hollywood."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaplan said Donziger began pursuing the case with intentions to improve environmental conditions in Ecuador and make a living for himself, but ultimately corrupted the case by submitting fraudulent evidence, bribing a judge, ghost-writing the judgment and covering up his wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The saga of the Lago Agrio case is sad," Kaplan wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge said Texaco, and by extension Chevron, "might bear some responsibility" for pollution at the site but that it was irrelevant to the question of whether fraud had occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Justice is not served by inflicting injustice," Kaplan wrote. "The ends do not justify the means. There is no 'Robin Hood' defense to illegal and wrongful conduct."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the non-jury trial, which ended in November, Kaplan heard from 31 witnesses and considered written testimony from 37 others. Chevron also introduced reams of documents, including Donziger's personal notebook, purporting to show that he was involved in a wide-ranging fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the witnesses was the former Ecuadorean judge who issued the 2011 judgment, Nicolas Zambrano, who testified that he had received no money and had written the opinion without outside assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kaplan agreed with Chevron that the evidence showed Zambrano did not write the ruling himself. Instead, Kaplan, said, the plaintiffs' team wrote the judgment, and Zambrano simply signed his name to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another former Ecuadorean judge, Alberto Guerra, testified that Donziger's team paid him to ghost-write Zambrano's opinion. Donziger's lawyers pointed out that Chevron had compensated him for testifying and paid for his family's living expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's lawyer, Randy Mastro of Gibson Dunn, pointed to sections of the ruling that appeared to be copied word-for-word from internal documents held by Donziger's team in Ecuador as proof, saying they were "like fingerprints."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Chevron Corp v.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Steven Donziger, the Harvard-educated lawyer who has waged a two-decade battle against Chevron Corp over pollution in the Amazon jungle in Ecuador, is not one to accept defeat quietly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hours after a federal judge in New York ruled on Tuesday that he had used bribery and fraud to secure a $9.5 billion judgment against the oil company in Ecuador in 2011, Donziger promised to appeal and said the judge had let his "implacable hostility toward me ... infect his view of the case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics, including Chevron, have painted Donziger as nothing short of a criminal, a lawyer who took advantage of a corruptible judicial system to buy a favorable judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporters see him as a hard-charging hero who has spent 20 years fighting for impoverished villagers whose home was ruined by millions of gallons of toxic sludge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who oversaw a trial last fall on racketeering allegations brought by Chevron against Donziger, made it clear he was in the former camp, writing that there was "clear and convincing evidence" that Donziger had paid a judge to ghostwrite the Ecuadorean opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no &#8216;Robin Hood' defense to illegal and wrongful conduct," Kaplan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger, who had unsuccessfully tried to get Kaplan removed from the case, had predicted for months that he would lose, mostly because of what he said was Kaplan's obvious bias. He said Kaplan exhibited clear animosity toward him and routinely ruled against him, including in a decision to oversee the trial himself rather than putting the case to a jury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial pitted the enormous resources of Chevron, represented by the powerful law firm Gibson Dunn, against Donziger's smaller team of lawyers, activists and volunteers, a contrast Donziger has noted several times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In written testimony during the trial, he accused the company of "the most well-funded corporate retaliation campaign in history."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's legal team included several top partners at the firm, and it has said in court papers it has expended millions of dollars on the litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the trial, Donziger acknowledged that he stood to earn $600 million in contingency fees if the $9.5 billion judgment were collected in full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CRUDE"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger, who is in his early 50s, first learned of the pollution in the early 1990s from a law school classmate. He traveled to northeastern Ecuador with the classmate's father, who was seeking lawyers to help him bring a case against Texaco over allegations that it had contaminated the area surrounding an oil field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He would become the driving force behind the litigation, eventually winning a judgment for $18 billion in 2011 against Chevron, which had acquired Texaco. Ecuador's highest court later cut the judgment down to $9.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger was featured in the documentary film "Crude," which chronicled the fight over pollution in Ecuador.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Joseph Ax&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 4 (Reuters) - Steven Donziger, the
Harvard-educated lawyer who has waged a two-decade battle
against Chevron Corp over pollution in the Amazon jungle
in Ecuador, is not one to accept defeat quietly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hours after a federal judge in New York ruled on Tuesday
that he had used bribery and fraud to secure a $9.5 billion
judgment against the oil company in Ecuador in 2011, Donziger
promised to appeal and said the judge had let his "implacable
hostility toward me ... infect his view of the case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics, including Chevron, have painted Donziger as nothing
short of a criminal, a lawyer who took advantage of a
corruptible judicial system to buy a favorable judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporters see him as a hard-charging hero who has spent 20
years fighting for impoverished villagers whose home was ruined
by millions of gallons of toxic sludge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who oversaw a trial last
fall on racketeering allegations brought by Chevron against
Donziger, made it clear he was in the former camp, writing that
there was "clear and convincing evidence" that Donziger had paid
a judge to ghostwrite the Ecuadorean opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no 'Robin Hood' defense to illegal and wrongful
conduct," Kaplan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger, who had unsuccessfully tried to get Kaplan removed
from the case, had predicted for months that he would lose,
mostly because of what he said was Kaplan's obvious bias. He
said Kaplan exhibited clear animosity toward him and routinely
ruled against him, including in a decision to oversee the trial
himself rather than putting the case to a jury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial pitted the enormous resources of Chevron,
represented by the powerful law firm Gibson Dunn, against
Donziger's smaller team of lawyers, activists and volunteers, a
contrast Donziger has noted several times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In written testimony during the trial, he accused the
company of "the most well-funded corporate retaliation campaign
in history."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's legal team included several top partners at the
firm, and it has said in court papers it has expended millions
of dollars on the litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the trial, Donziger acknowledged that he stood to
earn $600 million in contingency fees if the $9.5 billion
judgment were collected in full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CRUDE"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger, who is in his early 50s, first learned of the
pollution in the early 1990s from a law school classmate. He
traveled to northeastern Ecuador with the classmate's father,
who was seeking lawyers to help him bring a case against Texaco
over allegations that it had contaminated the area surrounding
an oil field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He would become the driving force behind the litigation,
eventually winning a judgment for $18 billion in 2011 against
Chevron, which had acquired Texaco. Ecuador's highest court
later cut the judgment down to $9.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger was featured in the documentary film "Crude," which
chronicled the fight over pollution in Ecuador. Chevron used
outtakes from the movie during the trial, including clips that
showed Donziger discussing what he saw as endemic corruption in
the country's judicial system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not clear whether Donziger, who is a member of the New
York bar, could face disciplinary action as a result of Kaplan's
findings. At one point in his 497-page decision, Kaplan wrote
that the "professional consequences of Donziger's behavior" may
be addressed by other bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a call with reporters on Tuesday, Randy Mastro, an
attorney for Chevron, declined to comment on whether the company
would refer Donziger to the state's attorney disciplinary
committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A foreign correspondent before attending Harvard Law School,
Donziger has a talent for self-promotion, meeting midtrial with
journalists in November in a crowded loft apartment in Manhattan
where 14 members of his team had been living and working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he testified, he had sympathizers among the audience,
including the singer Sting, who with his wife, Trudie Styler,
has offered the villagers support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standing well over 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall, with graying
temples, Donziger admitted he had made some mistakes but
adamantly denied using fraud to win the Ecuadorean judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he faced difficult questions from Chevron's Mastro,
who pointed to emails from a colleague that referred to two
judges as the "puppet" and the "puppeteer" as evidence of a
bribery scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger dismissed the references as joking nicknames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both judges testified at trial, one for Donziger and one for
Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author of the 2011 judgment, Nicolas Zambrano, said he
wrote the opinion on his own and denied taking bribes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kaplan said his story was not credible, given that he

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Chevron Corp Chief Executive John Watson said his company won a "resounding victory" on Tuesday after a U.S. district judge quashed a judgment against the company that was handed down by an Ecuadorean court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecuador has tried to fine the company as much as $18 billion, claiming Texaco, which was later acquired by Chevron, contaminated an oil field in northeastern Ecuador between 1964 and 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This ruling is a resounding victory for Chevron and its shareholders," CEO Watson told reporters attending the IHS CERAWeek conference in Houston. "Having a judgment like this from a reputable court in the United States will certainly be helpful in preventing enforcement actions elsewhere."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steven Donziger, a Harvard-educated U.S. lawyer who represented the Ecuadorean villagers in the case, characterized the ruling as "appalling" and said he would appeal the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watson said he expects a rapid ramp up in drilling in Argentina in the Vaca Muerta area, where Chevron is working in what is widely believed to be one of the world's top tight oil plays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, Spanish oil major Repsol approved a $5 billion settlement with the government of Argentina, ending a two-year dispute over the seizure of the company's operations in the country. Argentina hopes the settlement will clear the way for increased investment from foreign oil companies to develop Vaca Muerta, a formation in the country's Patagonia region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More details on Chevron's drilling plans in Argentina will be provided when the company holds its investor meeting next week, Watson told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also called on U.S. policymakers to free restrictions on U.S. crude oil exports, saying "free trade wins ... let's get on with it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watson applauded Mexico's efforts to open its energy sector to foreign investment, but said it was too early for a decision on any deals with state-owned Pemex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Anna Driver; Editing by Terry Wade and Chris Reese)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, March 4 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp Chief
Executive John Watson said his company won a "resounding
victory" on Tuesday after a U.S. district judge quashed a
judgment against the company that was handed down by an
Ecuadorean court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecuador has tried to fine the company as much as $18
billion, claiming Texaco, which was later acquired by Chevron,
contaminated an oil field in northeastern Ecuador between 1964
and 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This ruling is a resounding victory for Chevron and its
shareholders," CEO Watson told reporters attending the IHS
CERAWeek conference in Houston. "Having a judgment like this
from a reputable court in the United States will certainly be
helpful in preventing enforcement actions elsewhere."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steven Donziger, a Harvard-educated U.S. lawyer who
represented the Ecuadorean villagers in the case, characterized
the ruling as "appalling" and said he would appeal the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watson said he expects a rapid ramp up in drilling in
Argentina in the Vaca Muerta area, where Chevron is working in
what is widely believed to be one of the world's top tight oil
plays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, Spanish oil major Repsol approved a $5
billion settlement with the government of Argentina, ending a
two-year dispute over the seizure of the company's operations in
the country. Argentina hopes the settlement will clear the way
for increased investment from foreign oil companies to develop
Vaca Muerta, a formation in the country's Patagonia region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More details on Chevron's drilling plans in Argentina will 
be provided when the company holds its investor meeting next
week, Watson told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also called on U.S. policymakers to free restrictions on
U.S. crude oil exports, saying "free trade wins ... let's get on
with it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watson applauded Mexico's efforts to open its energy sector
to foreign investment, but said it was too early for a decision
on any deals with state-owned Pemex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Liana B. Baker and Varun Aggarwal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 4 (Reuters) - Dish Network Corp and Walt
Disney Co have reached a long-term programming deal,
allowing the No. 2 satellite TV provider to carry Disney-owned
networks such as ABC and ESPN and deliver the content outside of
a traditional TV subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal announced Monday marks the first time that a U.S.
pay-TV operator was given flexibility by a media company to
offer its content over the Web through smartphones, tablets and
computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, content owners had not granted cable or satellite
TV operators the digital rights to sell their shows outside of a
pay-TV subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Dish/Disney deal appears to set the stage for a new
wave of broadband-delivered video services," said BTIG analyst
Rich Greenfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies said Dish gets the right to stream "linear and
video on demand content" from channels such as ABC broadcast
stations and cable networks such as Disney Channel and ESPN as
part of an internet-delivered IP-based multichannel offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Disney comes out a winner" because its new college football
 network gets national distribution through the deal and it
settled an area of conflict regarding Dish's commercial-skipping
digital video recorder (DVR), MoffettNathanson Research analyst
Michael Nathanson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney shares rose 3.1 percent to $82.00 leading the Dow
Jones Industrial average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was "one of the most complex and comprehensive" deals it
has ever undertaken, said Anne Sweeney, co-chairwoman of Disney
Media Networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dish did not provide details on its potential TV
subscription over the Internet, but a big market is likely
waiting for such a product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North American consumers will spend $6 billion in 2014 on
entertainment from over-the-top services such as Netflix, more
than twice what they spent in 2010, according to PwC's annual
entertainment and media forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony Corp has been working on an Internet TV
service that is expected to come out this year. Intel Corp's
 efforts to launch one was recently bought by Verizon
Communications Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAWSUITS SETTLED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dish chairman Charlie Ergen has talked about the need to
suit viewer's changing habits and acknowledged that a small but
growing number of customers are "cutting the cord" or cancelling
traditional TV and just subscribing to internet service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ergen ruffled the feathers of broadcasters by rolling out a
service called AutoHop that lets viewers automatically skip
commercials on recorded programming on its DVRs, but
discontinued the service for ABC programming as part of the
deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AutoHop sparked a lawsuit between the two companies. Disney

between the two, including disputes over PrimeTime Anytime and
AutoHop, the companies said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal includes digital rights for mobile apps such as
Watch ESPN and Watch ABC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dish will carry Fusion, a new English-language news channel
aimed at young adults and the SEC Network, a college sports
network from ESPN launching later in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dish, like its larger rival DirecTV, does not offer
broadband Internet service like cable companies so it has been
experimenting with ways to adapt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DirecTV CEO Mike White has said the No. 1 satellite operator
is working on an "over-the-top" video package to suit niche

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Rates Coca-Cola's Proposed $1 Billion Issuance 'A+'; Outlook 
      Negative
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+' rating to The Coca-Cola Company's 
      (Coca-Cola) proposed issuance of $1 billion of 18-month floating rate 
      senior notes. The Rating Outlook is Negative. Coca-Cola had 
      approximately $37.1 billion of debt as of Dec. 31, 2013. A complete list 
      of ratings follows at the end of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The notes will be issued by Coca-Cola and will rank equally with the 
      company's senior unsecured obligations. Coca-Cola will use the net 
      proceeds to repay maturing commercial paper.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Negative Rating Outlook reflects Fitch's concern with Coca-Cola's 
      high gross leverage that has been elevated by substantial commercial 
      paper (CP) balances. Coca-Cola's gross leverage is weak for the rating 
      category at 2.8x on a total debt-to-operating EBITDA basis at the end of 
      2013, up from 2.4x a year ago. Coca-Cola's CP balance remains 
      substantial at $16.9 billion at the end of 2013, a slight increase of 
      $700 million in the past year. This compares to $12.9 billion in 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The growth in CP balances results from Coca-Cola's mismatch between its 
      U.S. cash outflows and its significant international cash inflows which 
      the company has not felt a need to repatriate at this time. Coca-Cola 
      maintains a comparable cash balance along with its committed bank lines 
      to provide backup to its CP borrowings. At the end of 2013, Coca-Cola's 
      liquidity position of $26.6 billion consisted of $17.1 billion of cash, 
      $3.1 billion of short-term investments, and $6.4 billion of availability 
      under its committed credit lines and revolving credit facility.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch views the significant cash balances that back Coca-Cola's CP 
      program and lower its net leverage to 1.26x as a key mitigating factor. 
      However, the vast majority of the company's cash is offshore, making it 
      costly to repatriate if necessary. Additionally, the CP mix is slightly 
      less than 50% of the firm's overall capital structure which Fitch 
      believes increases Coca-Cola's financial risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Despite the company's good liquidity and on-going market access, the 
      higher sustained levels of CP and the uncertainty of when Coca-Cola 
      would use cash to reduce CP balances remain a concern. Coca-Cola has 
      indicated that $20 billion is the upper limit for its CP program. Fitch 
      believes Coca-Cola should advance a longer-term definitive plan to 
      address its large CP balance including any reduction in cash matching 
      any corresponding reduction in CP levels resulting in lower gross debt. 
      Following its late 2013 refinancing, nearer-term debt maturities in 2014 
      were reduced. Coca-Cola also used a portion of the proceeds to term-out 
      CP as CP balances at the end of the third quarter 2013 had risen to 
      $18.8 billion. Coca-Cola's long-term debt maturities include $1 billion 
      coming due in 2014 and $3.5 billion maturing in 2015.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola ratings are supported by its position as the world's largest 
      global beverage company and the value of the Coca-Cola brand. Coca-Cola 
      has 17 $1 billion brands, including: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite, 
      Powerade, Minute Maid, and Dasani. Given the prominence of carbonated 
      soft drinks (CSDs) in Coca-Cola's beverage portfolio, the ratings 
      consider the multiyear decline in CSD volumes in the U.S., growing 
      scrutiny over artificial sweeteners, and modest CSD growth in other 
      developed countries. However, this risk is mitigated by Coca-Cola's 
      market strength in developing, higher growth geographies with low per 
      capita consumption characteristics that should provide an important 
      longer-term offset.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola's ratings reflect the company's ability to consistently 
      generate considerable cash flow from operations (CFFO) and free cash 
      flow (FCF). For 2013, Coca-Cola generated $10.5 billion and $3 billion 
      (after adjusting for dividends) of CFFO and FCF, respectively, after 
      generating $10.6 billion and $3.3 billion for the year ended Dec. 31, 
      2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola has committed to $2.5 billion to $3 billion of net share 
      repurchases in 2014, after repurchasing a net $3.5 billion in 2013. 
      Fitch expects Coca-Cola's FCF in 2014 to be at least in the $3.5 billion 
      range driven in part by reduced pension contributions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola has demonstrated good execution and resiliency in the past 
      with top-line and cash flow growth driven by increasing volume, 
      price/mix and improved operating expense leverage. Persistent global 
      macroeconomic pressure, higher taxes, negative perceptions of artificial 
      sweeteners and weather-related issues made volume growth more 
      challenging during 2013. Coca-Cola reported that global volume grew 2%, 
      below the lower end of its long-term financial targets of 3% - 4% for 
      worldwide volume growth. Reported revenue and operating income grew 3% 
      and 6%, respectively, when excluding the impact of structural changes, 
      which is at the low end of its 6% - 8% target for operating income 
      growth. As such, the global economic recovery remains challenging, 
      negatively affecting consumer spending, with pockets of volatility 
      across emerging market regions. Reflecting these challenges, Coca-Cola 
      announced an incremental $1 billion productivity savings by 2016 that 
      will be primarily redirected for increased media investments to support 
      the brand, which Fitch views favorably.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ratings also consider the potential for future acquisitions given the 
      company's transaction history. Coca-Cola has material flexibility to 
      engage in smaller acquisitions through its cash balances and free cash 
      generation. Fitch views the new 10-year agreement with Green Coffee 
      Mountain Roaster's for $1.25 billion as a positive for Coca-Cola's 
      operating profile. The shifting secular trends within the soft drink 
      industry make this investment essential to create an additional avenue 
      for growth. This provides a defensive position against at-home 
      competitive threats and enables opportunities for new consumption 
      occasions across an emerging distribution channel.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch does not make a rating distinction between Coca-Cola Company and 
      Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. (CCR) issued obligations, since default 
      risk is very low at this level on the rating scale. CCR's notes are 
      structurally superior to the notes issued by Coca-Cola.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATINGS SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, 
      lead Fitch to affirm the ratings with a Stable Outlook include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Coca-Cola develops a definitive plan to reduce CP balances and gross 
      debt.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, 
      lead to negative rating action include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --If Coca-Cola's ratings are negatively affected by a large 
      debt-financed acquisition or share repurchase program, a reduction in 
      cash and cash equivalents without a commensurate reduction in CP 
      balances, and/or the lack of a plan to reduce gross leverage over the 
      longer term.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, further negative pressure from increased declines with CSD 
      volumes in the U.S., greater than expected volatility in emerging market 
      regions, aggressive excise taxes increases in multiple regions, shift in 
      focus from pricing to volume, and margin erosion from channel mix shifts 
      could also affect ratings.

			Chevron Corporation Statement on U.S. Federal Court RICO and Fraud 
      Decision
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today 
      ruled that the $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron Corporation in 
      Ecuador was the product of fraud and racketeering, finding it 
      unenforceable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In response, Chevron issued the following statement:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This ruling is a resounding victory for Chevron and our stockholders. 
      It confirms that the Ecuadorian judgment against Chevron is a fraud and 
      the product of a criminal enterprise. Steven Donziger and his associates 
      can now be held accountable and will not be allowed to profit from their 
      illegal acts. Any court that respects the rule of law will find the Lago 
      Agrio judgment to be illegitimate and unenforceable.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron presented overwhelming evidence of fraud during the civil RICO 
      trial that concluded in November 2013. Evidence of the Ecuadorian 
      plaintiffs' and their agents&#8217; fraud includes:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        A former Ecuadorian judge has admitted 
        his role in orchestrating the fraudulent judgment against Chevron in 
        exchange for a half-million-dollar bribe from Donziger and his 
        associates.
      
			
        Stratus Consulting, the lead environmental consultant to the 
        Ecuadorian plaintiffs' lawyers, provided sworn declarations (here 
        and here), 
        highlighting its and Donziger&#8217;s role in ghostwriting the reports of a 
        purportedly &#8220;independent&#8221; Ecuadorian court expert and the lack of 
        scientific merit to the plaintiffs' environmental claims.
      
			
        Another of the plaintiffs' lawyers' environmental consultants, Dr. 
        Charles Calmbacher, has testified 
        that plaintiffs falsified environmental evidence in Ecuador.
      
			
        Litigation funder Burford Capital has provided sworn 
        testimony outlining the firm's knowledge of the plaintiffs' 
        lawyers' misconduct, testifying that the proceeding is irredeemably 
        tainted by fraud.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, March 4 (Reuters) - Chevron Chief Executive
John Watson said his company won a "resounding victory" on
Tuesday after a U.S. district judge squashed a judgment against
the company that was handed down by an Ecuadorean court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecuador has tried to fine the company as much as $18
billion, claiming Texaco, which was later acquired by Chevron,
contaminated an oil field in northeastern Ecuador between 1964
and 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Argentina, Watson said he expects a rapid ramp up in
drilling in Argentina's Vaca Muerta area, where Chevron is
working in what is widely believed to be one of the world's top
tight oil plays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also called on U.S. policymakers to free restrictions on
U.S. crude oil exports, saying "free trade wins ... let's get on
with it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 4 (Reuters) - An American lawyer used
"corrupt means" to secure a multibillion-dollar pollution
judgment against Chevron Corp in Ecuador, a U.S. judge
ruled on Tuesday, handing the oil company a major victory
following a six-week trial last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nearly 500-page decision, U.S. District Judge Lewis
Kaplan in New York said he had found "clear and convincing
evidence" that attorney Steven Donziger's legal team bribed an
Ecuadorean judge to issue an $18 billion judgment in 2011 in
favor of a group of villagers. They had claimed Texaco, later
acquired by Chevron, contaminated an oil field in northeastern
Ecuador between 1964 and 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision bars Donziger and the villagers from enforcing
the Ecuadorean ruling in the United States and freezes all
proceeds from the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron accused Donziger of fraud and said it cleaned up the
site before handing it over to a state-controlled entity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger did not immediately comment on the decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Monday put pugnacious pollster and political adviser Mark Penn in charge of strategy but left company watchers uncertain what exactly his new role will entail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the newly created job of chief strategy officer, Penn's "blend of data analysis and creativity" will be applied across new product areas and strategic investments, not just marketing, new Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella told employees in a memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift for 60-year-old Penn, who made his name advising President Bill Clinton, theoretically gives him more power to sway Microsoft's direction. But it also means he relinquishes direct control of marketing, which will be taken over by Microsoft veteran Chris Capossela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not clear if the new job is a promotion or a sideways move for Penn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would say both," said Ted Schadler, an analyst at tech research firm Forrester. "He doesn't own the advertising budget as Chris Capossela as chief marketing officer now does. But he, along with Eric Rudder, will chart the future of the company, Mark using market evidence and Eric using developer and business development."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rudder, another longtime Microsoft executive who runs the company's technology strategy, is to take over business development from Tony Bates, who Nadella said would leave the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bates was an internal rival to Nadella in the five-month race to succeed previous CEO Steve Ballmer, which was wrapped up in February with Nadella's appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCROOGLED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penn, who has advised co-founder Bill Gates for two decades and joined Microsoft full time in 2012, is best known in the company for the 'Don't Get Scroogled!' campaign, which aims to make consumers wary of Google Inc's use of personal information but has not dented the search engine leader's global dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penn, who pioneered rapid-feedback polling of voters in elections and policy setting in the 1990s, has a history of hard-hitting tactics. In 2008 he caused a stir with a doom-laden ad casting doubt on Barack Obama's ability to handle the "3 a.m. phone call," which aired in support of his Democratic presidential primary challenger, Hillary Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously CEO of public relations firm Burson-Marsteller, Penn has also advised Ford Motor Co Chairman Bill Ford, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and former Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penn will remain a member of Microsoft's 14-person senior leadership team, reporting directly to Nadella, but it is unclear exactly how his advice will be put into practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, Penn shared leadership of Microsoft's centralized advertising and media operations with marketing chief Tami Reller. Nadella said Reller is set to leave the company in the coming months after handing over the marketing group to Capossela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Meredith Mazzilli, editing by Ross Colvin)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 5 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Chemical said it will build
facilities to make premium halobutyl rubber and Escorez
hydrogenated hydrocarbon resin at its recently expanded
petrochemical complex in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineering and procurement activities have begun, with
construction expected to begin in the second half of 2014 and
completion anticipated in 2017, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil supplies halobutyl rubber to the global tire
industry. This expansion project will add production capacity of
140,000 tons per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to invest in expanding capacity at our
strategic hub in Singapore, which is an ideal location to
efficiently serve the fast growing Asia Pacific market,"    
said Steve Pryor, president of ExxonMobil Chemical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydrogenated tackifier demand is expected to double over the
next 15 years. Much of the growth is anticipated in Asia, where
packaging, woodworking and nonwovens manufacturers increasingly
use hot melt adhesives, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of cars and light trucks globally is expected to
double to 1.7 billion vehicles by 2040, supporting much of the
growth expected for halobutyl rubber, according to ExxonMobil's
energy outlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - DirecTV is in talks with Walt Disney Co to license the rights to offer Disney's broadcast and cable channels as part of an Internet-based product, mirroring a first-of-its kind agreement that Disney and satellite rival Dish Network announced earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The deal and terms are not unexpected as the Dish contract was the most recent in the Disney timeline to expire," DirecTV spokesman Darris Gringeri said on Wednesday. "The DirecTV contract is up next and we're in the process of working with Disney on a similar long-term agreement of our own."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Disney spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An agreement could give both Disney and DirecTV a new revenue source as consumers gravitate toward online video services such as Netflix and watch more television online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timing of the deal could be not be learned. DirecTV's contract with Disney expires in late December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement between Dish and Disney marked the first time that a U.S. pay TV operator was given the flexibility to offer its content over the Web through smartphones, tablets and computers outside of a pay TV subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that agreement, Disney allows for Dish to stream linear and on-demand content from ABC broadcast stations as well as cable channels, ABC Family, Disney Channel, ESPN and ESPN2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DirecTV has 20.3 million subscribers, while Dish has 14.1 million subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DirecTV Chief Executive Officer Mike White has previously said the No. 1 satellite operator is working on an "over-the-top" video package to suit niche audiences featuring Hispanic or kids programming, but has not yet given details on that offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ronald Grover in Los Angeles and Liana B.

      Fitch Affirms JPMCC 2011-C3
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed 13 classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Corp. (JPMCC) commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates series 2011-C3. A detailed list of rating actions follows 
      at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch's affirmations are based on the stable performance of the 
      underlying collateral pool. There have been no delinquent or specially 
      serviced loans since issuance. Fitch reviewed the most recently 
      available quarterly financial performance of the pool as well as updated 
      rent rolls for the top 15 loans, which represent 76.4% of the 
      transaction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the February 2014 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been reduced by 4.4% to $1.43 billion from $1.49 
      billion at issuance. No loans are defeased. Deminimus interest 
      shortfalls are currently affecting class NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest loan in the pool (14.8%) is secured by a 1,556,382 square 
      foot (sf) regional mall located in Holyoke, MA. The mall is anchored by 
      Macy's, Sears, Target, and J.C. Penney. The total collateral size is 
      1,356,382 sf, as Macy's owns both the store and land. Occupancy 
      increased to 95.2% as of Sept. 30, 2013 from 91.1% at year-end 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second largest loan (9.3%) is secured by a portfolio of 32 
      geographically diversified Alberston's grocery retail properties. The 
      properties are located across five states, primarily in the Southwest. 
      The portfolio has maintained its 100% occupancy level since issuance. No 
      lease expires until 2030.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the top 15 loans (3.5%) is secured by four office buildings 
      (390,380 sf) located in Collierville, TN, all of which are 100% leased 
      to FedEx (not rated by Fitch). Although the leases expire one year prior 
      to the maturity of the loan, the tenant has two 10-year extension 
      options. In-place rents are in line with submarket rent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      All classes maintain Stable Outlooks. Due to the recent issuance of the 
      transaction and stable performance, Fitch does not foresee positive or 
      negative ratings migration until a material economic or asset- level 
      event changes the transaction's portfolio-level metrics. Additional 
      information on rating sensitivity is available in the report 'J.P. 
      Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2011-C3' (Feb. 17,

			Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated Reports Fiscal Year and Fourth 
      Quarter 2013 Results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated (NASDAQ: COKE) today announced it 
      earned $27.7 million, or basic net income per share of $2.99, on net 
      sales of $1.6 billion for fiscal 2013, compared to net income of $27.2 
      million, or basic net income per share of $2.95, on net sales of $1.6 
      billion for fiscal 2012. The results for 2013 included $7.3 million of 
      after-tax losses due to a lump-sum pension buy-out, $0.3 million of 
      after-tax losses due to mark-to market adjustments on commodity hedges, 
      $0.9 million decrease to tax expense related to changes in reserves for 
      uncertain tax positions due to the lapse of statute of limitations, a 
      $0.4 million decrease to tax expense due to certain favorable tax items 
      associated with the American Taxpayer Relief Act (H.R.8), and a $2.3 
      million decrease to income tax expense due to recent legislation 
      requiring a change in the blended deferred state income tax rate. The 
      results for 2012 included $0.3 million of after-tax gains due to 
      mark-to-market adjustments on commodity hedges, $0.2 million decrease to 
      tax expense related to changes in reserves for uncertain tax positions 
      due to the lapse of statute of limitations, and a $2.9 million increase 
      in income tax expense due to changes in reserves for uncertain tax 
      positions, valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets and other 
      income tax changes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On a comparable basis, the Company earned $31.9 million in fiscal 2013, 
      or comparable basic net income per share of $3.44, versus $29.6 million 
      in fiscal 2012, or comparable basic net income per share of $3.21. The 
      following table reconciles reported GAAP net income and basic net income 
      per share to comparable net income and basic net income per share for 
      fiscal 2013 and 2012:

			(a) This non-GAAP financial information is provided to allow 
      investors to more clearly evaluate operating performance and business 
      trends on a comparable basis for fiscal 2013 and 2012. Management uses 
      this information to review results after excluding items that are not 
      necessarily indicative of ongoing results.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company had a net loss of $4.6 million, or basic net loss per share 
      of $0.50, on net sales of $394.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, 
      compared to net income of $1.8 million, or basic net income per share of 
      $0.20, on net sales of $386.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. The 
      fourth quarter results for 2013 included $7.3 million of after-tax 
      losses due to early settlement of certain pension obligations, and a 
      $0.3 million increase in income tax expense due to changes in reserves 
      for uncertain tax positions, valuation allowance for certain deferred 
      tax assets and other income tax changes. The fourth quarter results for 
      2012 included $0.3 million of after-tax losses due to mark-to-market 
      adjustments on commodity hedges and a $0.9 million increase in income 
      tax expense due to changes in reserves for uncertain tax positions, 
      valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets and other income tax 
      changes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On a comparable basis, the Company earned $3.1 million or comparable 
      basic net income per share of $0.33, in the fourth quarters of both 2013 
      and 2012. The following table reconciles reported GAAP net income and 
      basic net income per share to comparable net income and basic net income 
      per share for the fourth quarters of 2013 and 2012:

			(a) This non-GAAP financial information is provided to allow 
      investors to more clearly evaluate operating performance and business 
      trends on a comparable basis for the fourth quarters of 2013 and 2012. 
      Management uses this information to review results after excluding items 
      that are not necessarily indicative of ongoing results.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J. Frank Harrison, III, Chairman and CEO, said, &#8220;We remain steadfast in 
      our focus on creating value for our customers, consumers, shareholders, 
      and employees. Despite challenging industry conditions throughout the 
      year, a combination of revenue growth, more favorable raw material cost 
      trends, and lower financing costs allowed us to grow comparable net 
      income by almost eight percent. While delivering these results, we 
      continued to work on a definitive agreement to expand our franchise 
      territories, as announced in our Letter of Intent with The Coca-Cola 
      Company in April 2013.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Henry W. Flint, President and COO, added, &#8220;Importantly, our results 
      include revenue growth of almost two percent and earnings per share on a 
      comparable basis increasing 7.2% over the prior year. These results 
      include the additional costs we incurred as part of our franchise 
      territory expansion work with The Coca-Cola Company, as well as a number 
      of investments in operational capabilities for driving long-term growth 
      in revenue, operating profit, cash flow, and continued debt reduction. 
      We are pleased with our 2013 results and excited about the opportunities 
      in 2014. We are also thankful for our more than 6,000 employees and the 
      outstanding work they continue to do.&#8221;

			Cautionary Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Included in this news release and other information that we make 
      publicly available from time to time are forward-looking management 
      comments and other statements that reflect management&#8217;s current outlook 
      for future periods.
			These statements include, among others, 
      statements regarding our commitment and focus on profitably growing our 
      business and our plans for continuing to innovate and evolve packaging 
      and marketing strategies to respond to ever-changing consumer tastes. 
      They also include statements regarding proposed transactions with The 
      Coca-Cola Company that would expand the territory we serve.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			These statements and expectations are based on currently available 
      competitive, financial and economic data along with our operating plans 
      and are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause 
      anticipated events not to occur or actual results to differ materially 
      from historical or anticipated results.
			Among the events or 
      uncertainties which could adversely affect future periods are: lower 
      than expected selling pricing resulting from increased marketplace 
      competition; changes in how significant customers market or promote our 
      products; changes in our top customer relationships; changes in public 
      and consumer preferences related to nonalcoholic beverages; unfavorable 
      changes in the general economy; miscalculation of our need for 
      infrastructure investment; our inability to meet requirements under 
      current or future beverage agreements; material changes in the 
      performance requirements for marketing funding support or our inability 
      to meet such requirements; decreases from historic levels of marketing 
      funding support; changes in The Coca-Cola Company&#8217;s and other beverage 
      companies&#8217; levels of advertising, marketing and spending on brand 
      innovation; the inability of our aluminum can or plastic bottle 
      suppliers to meet our purchase requirements; our inability to offset 
      higher raw material costs with higher selling prices, increased 
      bottle/can sales volume or reduced expenses; consolidation of raw 
      material suppliers could impact our profitability; increased purchases 
      of finished goods subject us to incremental risks that could impact our 
      profitability; sustained increases in fuel costs or our inability to 
      secure adequate supplies of fuel; sustained increases in workers&#8217; 
      compensation, employment practices and vehicle accident claims costs; 
      sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits; product liability 
      claims or product recalls; technology failures; changes in interest 
      rates; the impact of debt levels on operating flexibility and access to 
      capital and credit markets; adverse changes in our credit rating 
      (whether as a result of our operations or prospects or as a result of 
      those of The Coca-Cola Company or other bottlers in the Coca-Cola 
      system); changes in legal contingencies; legislative changes affecting 
      our distribution and packaging; adoption of significant product labeling 
      or warning requirements; additional taxes resulting from tax audits; 
      natural disasters and unfavorable weather; global climate change or 
      legal or regulatory responses to such change; issues surrounding labor 
      relations; bottler system disputes; our use of estimates and 
      assumptions; changes in accounting standards; impact of obesity and 
      health concerns on product demand; public policy challenges regarding 
      the sale of soft drinks in schools; the impact of volatility in the 
      financial markets on access to the credit markets; the impact of 
      acquisitions of bottlers by their franchisors; and the concentration of 
      our capital stock ownership.
			The forward-looking statements in 
      this news release should be read in conjunction with the more detailed 
      descriptions of the above factors located in our Annual Report on Form 
      10-K for the year ended December 30, 2012 under Part I, Item 1A &#8220;Risk 
      Factors&#8221; as well as those additional factors we may describe from time 
      to time in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
			Except as required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to 
      update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this 
      release as a result of new information or future events or developments.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), the world's largest publicly traded energy company, said on Wednesday it expects oil and natural gas production to be flat this year as overall spending falls 6 percent to about $39.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors who had expected production growth sent shares down 3 percent in earlier trading. The company's current outlook for output, provided at an annual meeting with investors, was adjusted from a year-earlier to exclude some volume from Iraq and Abu Dhabi, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We took a set of low margin barrels off the base," Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson told investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evan Calio, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, noted at the meeting that oil and gas production growth has been "elusive" for Exxon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Exxon and other large oil companies have invested record amounts on exploration and production projects to boost oil and gas output. Last year, Exxon spent $42.5 billion, an amount the Irving, Texas company describes as a peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tensions between Russia and Ukraine have not yet disrupted Exxon's activity in Russia, where it is prospecting for oil and gas in Arctic waters, Tillerson told investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't see any new challenges out of the current situations," said Tillerson, noting this would change if there was government action such as sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the company has put on hold its pursuit of the Ukraine Skifska block in the Black Sea, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 2014, oil and gas production is expected to be 4 million barrels oil equivalent per day (boed), little changed from last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growth is expected to pick up from 2015 to 2017, when production is expected to grow 2 percent to 3 percent as major projects add an additional 1 million boed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Production has been down for a few years. It explains why this stock is a weak performer.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 5 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp, the
world's largest publicly traded energy company, said on
Wednesday it expects oil and natural gas production to be flat
this year as overall spending falls 6 percent to about $39.8
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors who had expected production growth sent shares
down 3 percent in earlier trading. The company's current outlook
for output, provided at an annual meeting with investors, was
adjusted from a year-earlier to exclude some volume from Iraq
and Abu Dhabi, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We took a set of low margin barrels off the base," Exxon
Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson told investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evan Calio, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, noted at the
meeting that oil and gas production growth has been "elusive"
for Exxon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Exxon and other large oil companies have
invested record amounts on exploration and production projects
to boost oil and gas output. Last year, Exxon spent $42.5
billion, an amount the Irving, Texas company describes as a
peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tensions between Russia and Ukraine have not yet disrupted
Exxon's activity in Russia, where it is prospecting for oil and
gas in Arctic waters, Tillerson told investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't see any new challenges out of the current
situations," said Tillerson, noting this would change if there
was government action such as sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the company has put on hold its pursuit of the
Ukraine Skifska block in the Black Sea, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 2014, oil and gas production is expected to be 4 million
barrels oil equivalent per day (boed), little changed from last
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growth is expected to pick up from 2015 to 2017, when
production is expected to grow 2 percent to 3 percent as major
projects add an additional 1 million boed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Production has been down for a few years. It explains why
this stock is a weak performer. They are spending a lot of
money, but they are spending to tread water," said Phil Weiss,
chief investment analyst at Baltimore-Washington Financial
Advisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, Exxon said it expects to bring 10 major projects
into production, most of them targeting more profitable crude
oil or other liquids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is going to be a big year," Mark Albers, Exxon senior
vice president told investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Exxon were down 2.75 percent at $93.88 in
afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 5 (Reuters) - Former Goldman Sachs energy
trader Jonathan Goldberg's hedge fund is up 7 percent on the
year after the winter rally in U.S. oil and gas helped it
recover from losses in the first four months after its launch
last September, industry sources said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldberg's $300 million BBL Commodities Value Fund in New
York rebounded as futures price spreads it laid out in U.S.
heating oil versus European gas oil and U.S.
crude oil versus U.K. Brent turned profitable in
January, the sources who are familiar with the fund's returns
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also made money from a long position in natural gas
options, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BBL had four straight months of losses, finishing 2013 down
6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the fund rose 7 percent in January, edged down about 0.5
percent in February and has trended higher since March began and
could be on track to a first quarter profit if energy markets
continue to experience big moves, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"BBL made money on a variety of energy themes this winter,"
said a source, familiar with the fund and speaking on conditions
of anonymity as the information was confidential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Compared to the average energy fund, its diversified
exposure to various, niche energy markets could help protect 
the downside and increase the upside," the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BBL declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worst winter in decades caused billions of dollars in
damages to the U.S. economy, as snow storms paralyzed air and
ground travel and killed more than a dozen people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was a boon to some fund managers who piled into
natural gas and oil futures for delivery by March in
anticipation of a spike in heating demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research has an 8.5 percent gain
for the average fund on its Macro-Commodity Energy Index in
January, with February data still unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldberg, who traded oil products at Goldman Sachs 
for seven years before spending another three at Glencore
 building out its U.S. oil derivatives business, has a
short-term view of the markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His strategy is exploit the relative value among different
energy components, using prices, delivery dates and location as
basis, according to sources.&lt;/p&gt;

				MINNEAPOLIS, MN--(Marketwired - March 05, 2014) - PowerTech, a division of HelpSystems, announced that their Director of Security Technologies Robin Tatam will be speaking on the topic of developing secure IBM i applications at the Wisconsin Midrange Computer Professional Association (WMCPA) Technical Conference the afternoon of March 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tatam's presentation is expected to include a step-by-step guide to building a sample IBM i application utilizing security best practices for object ownership, adopted authority, public and private authorities, command line permission and client-server considerations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tatam, who began his career as an RPG programmer 25 years ago, says the inspiration for this topic came from the security exposures he often sees on IBM i servers, such as wide-open access to critical database files and over-privileged users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sadly, many applications do not incorporate well-designed security controls. Of those that do, it's often possible for overly-powerful users to undermine the controls," Tatam said. He hopes his presentation will empower programmers to design applications that go beyond basic menu security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
				Tatam is an award-winning presenter of IBM i security content, a 
				COMMON subject-matter-expert (SME)

&lt;p&gt;March 6 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Thursday it
was recalling two lots of its Effexor XR antidepressant and
another lot of its generic version of the drug after a
pharmacist reported finding one capsule of a different medicine
in a bottle of Effexor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although Pfizer has not received any other such reports,
these three lots are being voluntarily recalled as a precaution
because they were packaged on the same line," the largest U.S.
drugmaker said in an announcement of the recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other drug found by the pharmacist was Tikosyn, which is
used to treat a common and potentially dangerous irregular
heartbeat known as atrial fibrillation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The use of Tikosyn by an Effexor XR patient, where the
contraindications and drug-drug interactions with Tikosyn have
not been considered by the prescribing physician, could cause
serious adverse health consequences that could be fatal," Pfizer
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three lots total about 104,450 bottles of the medicine,
known generically as venlafaxine, Pfizer said. Of those, about
65,800 had reached U.S. pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recalls involved one lot of 30-count bottles of Effexor
XR; one lot of 90-count bottles of the branded drug, and one lot
of venlafaxine 150 mg extended release capsules sold by
Greenstone LLC. It is a generic drugmaker owned by Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generic versions of the drug made by other manufacturers are
unaffected by the recall.&lt;/p&gt;

      software testing to cloud-based software testing. However, lack of data 
      control in outsourced services could pose a challenge to the growth of 
      this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The key vendors dominating this space include Accenture plc, Capgemini 
      SA, IBM Corp., and Wipro Ltd.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The other vendors mentioned in this report are Cognizant Technology 
      Solutions Corp., Computer Sciences Corp., Groupe Steria SA, HCL 
      Technologies Ltd., Hewlett-Packard Co., Hexaware Technologies, Infosys 
      Ltd., ITC Infotech India Ltd., Logica plc, Micro Focus International 
      plc, Software Quality Systems AG, TCS Ltd., Tech Mahindra Ltd., 
      Thinksoft Global Services Ltd., and UST Global.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from the team said: The Global 
      Software Testing Services market in the BFSI sector is characterized by 
      a lack of skilled and qualified personnel to meet the Testing industry 
      standards. Therefore, this trend has affected many businesses and their 
      efforts to deploy quality production. The biggest challenge involving 
      this trend is that financial companies are finding it difficult to 
      determine which functions of the software production should be taken 
      care of by in-house personnel and which should be outsourced to 
      third-party service providers. The challenge is aggravated in the case 
      of high-end and specific areas of industrial and specific knowledge. 
      Therefore, responsibilities that are attached to the role of a business 
      analyst are being taken care of by in-house personnel and functions 
      involving testing and quality assurance are being increasingly 
      outsourced to the independent software testing vendors.

      Fitch Affirms JPMCC 2013-C10
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed 13 classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Trust. (JPMCC) commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates series 2013-C10. A detailed list of rating actions follows 
      at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch's affirmations are based on the stable performance of the 
      underlying collateral pool. There have been no delinquent or specially 
      serviced loans since issuance. Fitch reviewed the most recently 
      available quarterly financial performance of the pool as well as updated 
      rent rolls for the top 15 loans, which represent 84.2% of the 
      transaction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the February 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been reduced by 0.5% to $1.27 billion from $1.28 
      billion at issuance. No loans are defeased. Deminimus interest 
      shortfalls are currently affecting class NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest loan in the pool (10.2%) is secured by a 771,233 square foot 
      (sf) regional mall located in Hackensack, NJ. The mall is anchored by 
      Saks Fifth Avenue (collateral) and Bloomingdales (non-collateral). 
      Approximately 30% of the total collateral (473,549 sf), including the 
      Saks Fifth Avenue lease is expiring in 2015. Fitch considered the 2015 
      tenant rollover risk in its cash flow analysis of the loan. As of nine 
      months -ended Sept. 30, 2013, occupancy and debt service coverage ratio 
      (DSCR) were a reported 93.3% and 3.17x respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second largest loan in the pool (8.8%) is secured by a 1.5 million 
      sf office complex in Pittsburg, PA. No tenant represents more than 7% of 
      the collateral, and the top three tenants' leases expire in 2018 or 
      after. As of nine months -ended Sept. 30, 2013, occupancy and DSCR were 
      a reported 85.9% and 2.23x respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      All classes maintain Stable Outlooks. Due to the recent issuance of the 
      transaction and stable performance, Fitch does not foresee positive or 
      negative ratings migration until a material economic or asset level 
      event changes the transaction's portfolio-level metrics. Additional 
      information on rating sensitivity is available in the report 'JPMCC 
      2013-C10' (May 21, 2013), available at www.fitchratings.com.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, March 6 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co said
on Thursday that it is cutting jobs in its interactive division,
which houses its video game and online properties, and a person
with knowledge of the situation said that about 700 jobs would
be eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, which announced the job cuts in a statement,
declined to comment on the number of jobs affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 700 jobs cited represents about one quarter of the
division's total workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Disney Interactive has consolidated several lines of
business as part of an effort to focus the division on a
streamlined suite of high quality digital products," the company
said in its statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has built an enviable record in producing hit movies
but has had a succession of lackluster interactive game
products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news was first reported by The New York Times on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders agreed on Thursday to suspend talks with Russia on visa and investment liberalization to enforce a call for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine's Crimea region and opening negotiations between Moscow and Kiev.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU leaders said that unless such negotiations started in the next few days and produced results "within a limited timeframe", they will impose additional sanctions including travel bans, asset freezes and the cancellation of an EU-Russia summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any further steps by the Russian federation to destabilize the situation in Ukraine would lead to severe and far-reaching consequences for relations between the European Union and its member states on the one hand and the Russian federation on the other hand, which will include a broad range of economic areas," European Council President Herman Van Rompuy told a news conference after a meeting of the European Union and Ukraine's new leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We strongly condemn Russia's unprovoked violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity. We call on Russia to immediately withdraw its armed forces and to allow immediate access for international monitors," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Barbara Lewis, Martin Santa and Jan Strupczewski)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHENZHEN (Reuters) - More than 1,000 workers at an IBM factory in southern China have gone on strike against the terms of their transfer to Chinese PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd caused by the U.S. company's $2.3 billion sale of its low-end server business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several workers gather outside gate of the International Business Machines Corp factory in Shenzhen on Thursday said production remains suspended for a fourth straight day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So far, we've heard nothing from the management or the government in response to our demands," said Hou Hongbo, a 10- year worker at the factory. "The company's attitude so far is to ignore us, but the entire production remains shut down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The workers want higher pay if they choose to transfer to Lenovo or higher severance packages if they choose to leave. Hou said they were determined to keep their action going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will definitely keep striking tomorrow," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The terms offered to workers at the International System Technology Company factory in Shenzhen are "comparable in aggregate to what they currently are receiving," IBM spokeswoman Florence Ma said in an e-mailed statement. If workers choose to leave, they will receive an "equitable severance package," Ma said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are hoping employees will decide to remain with ISTC," Ma said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workers at Chinese factories are increasingly turning to protests and factory shut-downs when they feel the terms of international takeovers are not good enough or labor conditions have worsened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of employees stopped work at a Nokia factory in Dongguan in November, complaining of changes following Nokia's sale of its mobile phone business to U.S. software giant Microsoft Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last August, 5,000 workers in eastern Shandong Province went on strike to protest Apollo Tires Ltd's proposed $2.5 billion acquisition of U.S.-based Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Venus Wu, Grace Li, James Pomfret, Donny Kwok and Clare Baldwin Editing by Jeremy Gaunt)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) - Moscow stocks fell on Thursday for the second day this week after Crimea's parliament voted to join Russia and the United States ordered an asset freeze and visa bans against those involved in Russia's military intervention in the Ukrainian region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 1338 GMT (8:35 ET), the dollar-denominated RTS index was down 2.8 percent to 1,148 points .IRTS, deepening further losses seen after the Crimean parliament's unanimous vote to annex the region to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crimea's vice premier said a referendum on the region's status would be held on March 16 and would ask whether Crimea should become part of the Russian Federation [ID:nL6N0M31S4]. A Ukrainian minister said such a referendum would be illegitimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. President Barack Obama ordered visa bans on individuals and entities involved in threatening the territorial integrity of Ukraine and said additional steps, such as sanctions were possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruble-traded MICEX  lost 2.2 percent on the news to trade at 1,321.1 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mikhail Kantolinsky, equity trader at Uralsib in Moscow, said that local traders had two concerns:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a fear of a war and there is a fear of a potential Ukraine default," Kantolinsky said. "The Crimean authorities are inclined to become part of the Russian Federation - Kiev, of course, will be against, and that means that an armed conflict may be inescapable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moves to formally bring the Crimea, which has an ethnic Russian majority and has effectively been seized by Russian forces, under Moscow's rule came as EU leaders gathered for an emergency summit to seek ways to pressure Russia to back down and accept mediation [ID:nL6N0M320U].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moody's ratings agency said on Thursday that Russia's actions in Ukraine were negative for Russia's sovereign creditworthiness [ID:nL6N0M32W0]. Moody's and the Fitch ratings agency said the crisis would weigh on Russia's economy. [ID:nFit692309]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This negative sentiment, which is likely to translate into increasing net private sector capital outflows that have already been a structural impediment to Russia's economic development, will negatively affect Russia's GDP growth," Moody's said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The threat of potential political and economic sanctions from the West could further undermine investor sentiment and affect the creditworthiness of Russian borrowers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts at ING Bank in Moscow, estimate that should the conflict in Ukraine escalate dramatically, capital outflow from Russia could reach $100-$150 billion by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In such circumstances, a fair exchange rate would be in the range of 39 rubles to 42 rubles per dollar," the analysts said in a note. For now, however, they retained their 2014-end forecast of the ruble at 35.70 rubles to the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts polled by Reuters before President Vladimir Putin declared at the weekend Russia had the right to invade Ukraine, forecast capital flight from Russia at $56 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruble was down 0.5 percent against the dollar at 36.21 at 1405 GMT and down 0.9 percent versus the euro at 50.00, increasing its early-day losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts at VTB Capital reckon that the ruble is about 8.0-8.5 percent behind the emerging-market average index so far this year, and Ukraine's political crisis has accounted for 2.0-3.0 percentage points of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Lidia Kelly; Editing by Jon Boyle)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - DirecTV is in talks with Walt Disney Co to license the rights to offer Disney's broadcast and cable channels as part of an Internet-based product, DirecTV said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal would mirror a first-of-its kind agreement that Disney and satellite rival Dish Network Corp announced earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Internet rights being discussed are part of a large-scale programming agreement that would replace a deal between the companies that expires in late December. Disney and DirectTV are in negotiations but the timing of the new deal could be not be learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The deal and terms are not unexpected as the Dish contract was the most recent in the Disney timeline to expire," DirecTV spokesman Darris Gringeri said on Wednesday. "The DirecTV contract is up next and we're in the process of working with Disney on a similar long-term agreement of our own."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Disney spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new pact could give both Disney and DirecTV, the No. 1 satellite operator, an additional revenue source as consumers gravitate toward online video services such as Netflix Inc and watch more television online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement between Dish and Disney marked the first time that a U.S. pay TV operator has been given the flexibility to offer its content over the Web through smartphones, tablets and computers outside of a pay TV subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that agreement, Disney allows for Dish to stream linear and on-demand content from ABC broadcast stations as well as cable channels, ABC Family, Disney Channel, ESPN and ESPN2. Dish has not revealed plans for its streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DirecTV, which has 20.3 million subscribers, is expected to secure better rates on programming than Dish, which has 14.1 million subscribers, because of its size. Both companies have complained about the rising cost of programming and have been involved in high-profile blackouts over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DirecTV Chief Executive Mike White has previously said the company is working on an "over-the-top" video package to suit niche audiences featuring Hispanic or kids programming, but has not yet given details on that offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ronald Grover in Los Angeles and Liana B.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, March 6 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on
Thursday ordered the freezing of U.S. assets and a ban on travel
into the United States of those involved in threatening the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama signed an executive order aimed at punishing those
Russians and Ukrainians responsible for a Russian incursion into
the Crimea region of southern Ukraine, a crisis that has raised
old-style Cold War tensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The order, the White House said in a statement, is "a
flexible tool that will allow us to sanction those who are most
directly involved in destabilizing Ukraine, including the
military intervention in Crimea, and does not preclude further
steps should the situation deteriorate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the State Department is putting in place visa
restrictions on a number of officials and individuals,
reflecting a policy decision to deny visas to those responsible
for or complicit in threatening the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, March 6 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' head of
oil and agricultural trading, Karl Robijns, is retiring from the
firm, an internal memo seen by Reuters showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London-based Robijns, who first joined Goldman as an oil
trader in 1998, has headed the bank's global oil, refined
products, and agricultural trading since last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Karl has had a substantial commercial impact on our
market-leading commodities franchise," said the memo from
Goldman's co-heads of securities - Isabelle Ealet, Ashok
Varadhan and Pablo Salame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robijns is the latest high-profile commodities executive to
leave a bank, as the industry wrestles with lower profits,
increased regulation and reduced volatility in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue for the top banks in the sector has fallen from more
than $14 billion in 2008 to just $4.5 billion last year,
according to London-based financial industry analytics firm
Coalition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior Goldman executives have said they remain committed to
the bank's J.Aron &amp; Co commodities business, where the bank's
CEO Lloyd Blankfein started his career, even as rivals scale
back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is in exclusive talks with Mercuria to sell
its physical commodities business to the Geneva-based trading
house, while Morgan Stanley is selling part of its
physical oil trading operation to Russia's Rosneft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robijns briefly left Goldman to join hedge fund Citadel, but
returned to the bank in 2007 as a managing director. He became a
partner in 2010, running the bank's commodities business in Asia
between then and 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - The private equity arm of Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Vestar Capital Partners are nearing a deal to buy Hearthside Food Solutions LLC for more than $1.1 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consortium of Goldman Sachs and Vestar is in the final stage of negotiating an agreement with Hearthside's private equity owner, Wind Point Partners, and is working toward an announcement in the coming days, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The buyout groups emerged as the winning bidder for the largest U.S. food contract manufacturer, following an auction that also attracted bids from BC Partners LLC and Oak Hill Capital Partners, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources asked not to be identified because the deal was not yet public. Representatives for Hearthside, Goldman Sachs, Vestar, Wind Point Partners, BC Partners and Oak Hill Capital did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wind Point had asked Barclays Plc to run an auction for Hearthside, hoping to fetch more than $1 billion, Reuters reported in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hearthside produces baked foods and snacks out of 20 manufacturing facilities in eight U.S. states for the world's premier food companies, employing more than 7,500 full-time workers, according to its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, based in Downers Grove, Illinois, was created in 2009 by Wind Point and Rich Scalise, a former Ralcorp Frozen Bakery Products president and veteran of ConAgra Foods Inc (CAG.N). Scalise now serves as Hearthside's chairman and chief executive officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Hearthside agreed to sell Golden Temple, its ready-to-eat cereals and granola-making business, to Post Holdings Inc (POST.N) for $158 million in cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis and Soyoung Kim in New York, additional reporting by Olivia Oran)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ecuadorean villagers who are trying to get billions of dollars from Chevron Corp for pollution in the Amazon jungle are ready to refocus their fight on pending suits in other countries after a setback in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scathing judgment issued by a U.S. judge this week against their lawyer will cast a long shadow over cases filed in Canada, Brazil and Argentina, where the plaintiffs are seeking Chevron assets as payment because the oil giant no longer has a presence in Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan handed down a 500-page decision that found American lawyer Stephen Donziger used "corrupt means" to help villagers from the Lago Agrio region win the historic $18 billion judgment against Chevron in Ecuador in 2011. The damage award was later revised down to $9.5 billion. While Kaplan's decision bars Donziger and the villagers from enforcing the Ecuadorean ruling in the United States, it is not binding in pending cases elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the three cases, the Canadian one seems to have progressed the farthest, with an appeals court there ruling in December that the province of Ontario was a proper jurisdiction for the plaintiffs to press the company to pay up. Chevron has asked for an appeal of that ruling to be heard by Canada's Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaughan Black, a professor at the Schulich School of Law in Halifax, Nova Scotia, thinks Kaplan's ruling will resonate if the Canadian case ends up being considered on its merits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Basically an Ontario court would have to look at all the evidence again and start at the beginning," Black said. "I suppose there is always the possibility that they could take a different view of which witnesses were credible, but the New York court didn't even think it was a close call. So it doesn't look very promising for the Ecuadorean plaintiffs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sprawling environmental case stretches back to the 1990s, when the villagers first tried to seek compensation for contamination in northeastern Ecuador by Texaco starting in 1964. Chevron acquired Texaco and for 20 years has been fighting the case as well as Donziger, who has spent most of his career representing the Ecuadorean plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The foreign courts will ultimately have to decide how to weigh the evidence presented against Donziger, which Kaplan said proved the judgment in Ecuador was tainted by fraud, against the underlying claims of the villagers who say they were sickened by decades of pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases in Argentina and Brazil are moving slowly. But the Ontario appeals court in December reversed a lower court decision and found Canada should be a forum to hear Ecuadoreans' claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has resisted the Ecuador plaintiffs at every turn. "We're going to fight this until hell freezes over. And then we'll fight it out in the ice," a company spokesman once said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron's wish is granted," the December 17 Ontario Court of Appeal decision said, referring to the spokesman's quote. "After all these years, the Ecuadorean plaintiffs deserve to have the recognition and enforcement of the Ecuadorean judgment heard on the merits in an appropriate jurisdiction. At this juncture, Ontario is that jurisdiction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAST A SHADOW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada's Supreme Court could decide whether to grant a hearing of the appellate decision in May, according to Canadian legal experts. If it takes up the case, the Supreme Court will likely only consider the narrow question of Canadian jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should the Supreme Court agree with the appellate decision, the entire case will go back to the original court, said Schulich's Black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's when Chevron could bring to bear reams of documents it introduced in the New York case, including Donziger's personal notebook, purporting to show he ultimately corrupted the case by submitting fraudulent evidence, bribing a judge, ghost-writing the judgment and covering up his wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Canadian case, Donziger is not representing the 47 Ecuadorean plaintiffs who are standing in for the larger community of 30,000 affected residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The U.S. court can't annul the Ecuador judgment," said Sara Seck on the Faculty of Law at Western University in London, Ontario. "It casts a shadow on it, but it's going to be up to Canadian courts to decide what to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron believes Judge Kaplan's ruling in the Southern District of New York will be a game changer for the cases being fought in foreign courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No judge in any country that respects the rule of law will entertain the enforcement of the corruption judgment," Chevron's General Counsel R. Hewitt Pate said on a call with reporters. "I think the opinion will carry great weight. ... We will share the contents of the opinion with the other judges in Argentina, Brazil and Canada."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Donziger's camp says making the ruling available will not be enough to sway the other proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRAZIL, ARGENTINA TO COME&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, Kaplan issued a decision blocking the plaintiffs from trying to enforce the Ecuadorean judgment anywhere in the world, but the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York overturned that ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his opinion on Tuesday, Kaplan carefully said his order against Donziger "does not 'disrespect the legal system ... of the country in which the judgment was issued' or those of 'other countries' in which the (Lago Agrio plaintiffs) now, or later may, seek to enforce the judgment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger's lawyer Deepak Gupta said he would appeal Kaplan's decision and the villagers would continue to battle it out abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Brazil, the villagers' case is waiting to be heard by a court, said Chevron spokesman Morgan Crinklaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Argentina, the Supreme Court reversed a freezing of Chevron's Argentine assets last year, but the enforcement case is still pending, he said. Chevron brought the case to the International Court in the Hague in 2009, claiming it was denied justice in Ecuador. That arbitration is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a confidential memo produced as part of the New York trial, Patton Boggs - the law firm that became involved in 2010 to help Donziger enforce the Ecuador judgment - suggests 24 countries where the plaintiffs could potentially study options to enforce the Ecuador judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't have a system where one single trial judge, whether they are in New York or anywhere else can appoint themselves a worldwide fact-finding commission and essentially preclude or persuade other courts not to enforce a judgment," Gupta said. He said he could not comment on the memo or on what future efforts there might be to try to enforce the judgment in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan Lenczner, the lawyer representing the Ecuadorean plaintiffs in Canada, said Kaplan's ruling has "zero" impact on the ongoing proceedings in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case still faces two jurisdictional questions before it is even heard on the merits. One is whether Canada can enforce a foreign judgment, and the other is whether a Chevron subsidiary in the country can be held responsible for the parent's action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the plaintiffs can win the court battle, they hope to recover in Canada as much of the Ecuadorean judgment as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, all the international legal wrangling has left the real victims of the legacy of environmental damage out in the cold, said Judith Kimerling, an environmental law professor at The City University of New York, Queens College. Kimerling represents a group of indigenous Ecuadoreans suing Donziger in New York state court for unjust enrichment and seeking to recover resources to clean up the polluted area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are real people with real injuries and legitimate claims behind all this," Kimerling said. "It is a very sad day for the victims and for the environment because it makes it more difficult for them to get remedies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Joseph Ax in New York and Euan Rocha in Toronto; Editing by Howard Goller and Frank McGurty)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 7 (Reuters) - Ecuadorean villagers who are
trying to get billions of dollars from Chevron Corp for
pollution in the Amazon jungle are ready to refocus their fight
on pending suits in other countries after a setback in the

it introduced in the New York case, including Donziger's
personal notebook, purporting to show he ultimately corrupted
the case by submitting fraudulent evidence, bribing a judge,
ghost-writing the judgment and covering up his wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Canadian case, Donziger is not representing the 47
Ecuadorean plaintiffs who are standing in for the larger
community of 30,000 affected residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The U.S. court can't annul the Ecuador judgment," said Sara

not be enough to sway the other proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRAZIL, ARGENTINA TO COME&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, Kaplan issued a decision blocking the plaintiffs
from trying to enforce the Ecuadorean judgment anywhere in the
world, but the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York
overturned that ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his opinion on Tuesday, Kaplan carefully said his order
against Donziger "does not 'disrespect the legal system ... of
the country in which the judgment was issued' or those of 'other
countries' in which the (Lago Agrio plaintiffs) now, or later
may, seek to enforce the judgment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger's lawyer Deepak Gupta said he would appeal Kaplan's
decision and the villagers would continue to battle it out
abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Brazil, the villagers' case is waiting to be heard by a
court, said Chevron spokesman Morgan Crinklaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Argentina, the Supreme Court reversed a freezing of
Chevron's Argentine assets last year, but the enforcement case
is still pending, he said. Chevron brought the case to the
International Court in the Hague in 2009, claiming it was denied
justice in Ecuador. That arbitration is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a confidential memo produced as part of the New York
trial, Patton Boggs - the law firm that became involved in 2010
to help Donziger enforce the Ecuador judgment - suggests 24
countries where the plaintiffs could potentially study options
to enforce the Ecuador judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't have a system where one single trial judge,
whether they are in New York or anywhere else can appoint
themselves a worldwide fact-finding commission and essentially
preclude or persuade other courts not to enforce a judgment,"
Gupta said. He said he could not comment on the memo or on what
future efforts there might be to try to enforce the judgment in
other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan Lenczner, the lawyer representing the Ecuadorean
plaintiffs in Canada, said Kaplan's ruling has "zero" impact on
the ongoing proceedings in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case still faces two jurisdictional questions before it
is even heard on the merits. One is whether Canada can enforce a
foreign judgment, and the other is whether a Chevron subsidiary
in the country can be held responsible for the parent's action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the plaintiffs can win the court battle, they hope to
recover in Canada as much of the Ecuadorean judgment as
possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, all the international legal wrangling has left
the real victims of the legacy of environmental damage out in
the cold, said Judith Kimerling, an environmental law professor
at The City University of New York, Queens College. Kimerling
represents a group of indigenous Ecuadoreans suing Donziger in
New York state court for unjust enrichment and seeking to
recover resources to clean up the polluted area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are real people with real injuries and legitimate
claims behind all this," Kimerling said. "It is a very sad day
for the victims and for the environment because it makes it more
difficult for them to get remedies."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 7 (Reuters) - A whistleblower will be paid $63.9
million for providing tips that led to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's
 agreement to pay $614 million and tighten oversight to
resolve charges that it defrauded the government into insuring
flawed home loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The payment to the whistleblower, Keith Edwards, was
disclosed on Friday in a filing with the U.S. district court in
Manhattan that formally ended the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Feb. 4 settlement, JPMorgan admitted that for more
than a decade it submitted thousands of mortgages for insurance
by the Federal Housing Administration or the Department of
Veterans Affairs that did not qualify for government guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also admitted that it had failed to tell the
agencies that its own internal reviews had turned up problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government said it ultimately had to cover millions of
dollars of losses after some of the bank's loans went sour,
resulting in evictions and foreclosures nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There were a lot of bad loans made during the financial
boom, and the United States taxpayer was left holding the bag
through the VA and FHA loan programs," Edwards' lawyer, David
Wasinger, said in a phone interview. "Hopefully the settlement

&lt;p&gt;March 7 (Reuters) - A whistleblower will be paid $63.9
million for providing tips that led to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's
 agreement to pay $614 million and tighten oversight to
resolve charges that it defrauded the government into insuring

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/z6c79j/global_orphan) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Orphan Drugs Market 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Orphan Drugs market to grow at a CAGR of 5.67 percent over 
      the period 2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The report states that one of the main challenges is the high cost of 
      drug development. The rise in the cost of drug development often tends 
      to discourage pharmaceutical innovators from developing orphan drugs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There has been increase in awareness about the potential benefits of 
      orphan drugs among patients, surgeons, and hospitals. Public awareness 
      about the use of orphan drugs is rapidly growing as a result of 
      increasing social and public exposure and more advocacy groups and 
      awareness campaigns. For instance, in 2010, the US FDA created the Rare 
      Disease Program within the Office of New Drugs with the specific focus 
      of developing the policies and procedures for the review of new drug 
      applications for orphan drug products and to ensure access to 
      appropriate training for US FDA reviewers. Similarly in 2012, the US FDA 
      hosted the first ever US FDA Rare Disease Patient Advocacy Day to 
      enhance the rare disease patient advocacy community's awareness of the 
      US FDA's roles and responsibilities in the development of products for 
      rare diseases. Thus, with the increasing awareness of orphan drugs, the 
      market is expected to witness positive growth in the near future.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the main drivers in this market is the 
      shorter development timelines. The clinical trials of orphan drugs for 
      rare diseases involve fewer patients, which contributes to a shorter 
      development process.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The report covers the Americas, and the EMEA and APAC regions; it also 
      covers the Global Orphan Drugs market landscape and its growth prospects

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, March 7 (Reuters) - Shares of Mexico's Televisa

be forced to share infrastructure with other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of the company, which has more than 60 percent of the

&lt;p&gt;Televisa, which has more than 60 percent of the TV market,
said the new watchdog Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT)
also ruled the firm cannot hold a stake in a dominant telecoms
operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, IFT said it had determined who is dominant in
the telecommunications sector, without specifiying. A spokesman
for tycoon Carlos Slim's telecoms giant America Movil 
said the company had not yet been informed of a determination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, America Movil has about 80 percent of Mexico's
fixed-line business via its Telmex unit and some 70 percent of

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New group will include broad representation from the retailing, 
      financial and equipment manufacturing industries
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MasterCard and Visa today announced the formation of a new 
      cross-industry group focused on enhancing payment system security to 
      keep pace with the expectations of consumers, retailers and financial 
      institutions. The group will initially focus on the adoption of EMV chip 
      technology in the United States, in addition to addressing other 
      security-related topics, including tokenization, point-to-point 
      encryption and broader needs of the region.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;One of the critical roles we play is to protect consumers and 
      businesses against criminals and fraudsters,&#8221; said Chris McWilton, 
      president of North American Markets, MasterCard. "Only through industry 
      collaboration and cooperation will we address the real and immediate 
      issue of security and maintain consumer confidence and trust. EMV will 
      be the next step in these efforts, alongside enhanced security solutions 
      for online and mobile channels.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This new group will include a diverse group of participants in the 
      payments systems including --- banks of all sizes, credit unions, 
      acquirers, retailers, point-of-sale device manufacturers and industry 
      trade groups. The formation of the group is a public recognition of the 
      importance of all parties to work together and will ensure all voices 
      can contribute to the strategic direction of payment security.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The recent high-profile breaches have served as a catalyst for much 
      needed collaboration between the retail and financial services industry 
      on the issue of payment security,&#8221; said Ryan McInerney, president, Visa 
      Inc. &#8220;As we have long said, no one industry or technology can solve the 
      issue of payment system fraud on its own. These conversations will serve 
      as a useful forum to share ideas, break down barriers and spur the 
      adoption of next generation security solutions for the benefit of all.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With a priority on delivering meaningful solutions that benefit 
      consumers, merchants and financial institutions of all sizes, this group 
      will focus on a broad range of security-related topics, including:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Advancing the migration to EMV in the United States. Chip 
        technology generates a unique code for every transaction, making it 
        nearly impossible for criminals to use the card for counterfeit fraud.
      
			
				Promoting additional security solutions like tokenization and point 
        to point encryption. While EMV addresses the physical point of 
        sale, the need to protect mobile and online transactions is critical. 
        In tokenization, the traditional account number will be replaced with 
        a unique digital payment code, providing an additional layer of 
        security.
      
			
				Developing an actionable roadmap for securing the future across all 
        segments of the payments industry.
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      MasterCard and Visa expect this group will complement and engage with 
      other efforts across the industry, including proprietary risk councils, 
      EMV task forces and the standard management bodies.

      Research and Markets: Global Business Process Management (BPM) PaaS 
      Market 2014-2018 with IBM Corp., OpenText Corp., and Pegasystems Inc. 
      Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/vz7vzl/global_business) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Business Process Management (BPM) PaaS Market 2014-2018" report 
      to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysts forecast the Global BPM PaaS market to grow at a CAGR of 
      21.99 percent over the period 2013-2018. One of the key factors 
      contributing to this market growth is the need to reduce the cost of 
      business processes. The Global BPM PaaS market has also been witnessing 
      increased demand for mobile BPM PaaS solutions. However, lack of 
      awareness about the potential of BPM PaaS software could pose a 
      challenge to the growth of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Key vendors dominating this market space include Appian Corp., IBM 
      Corp., OpenText Corp., and Pegasystems Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Other vendors mentioned in the report are Adeptia Inc., Adobe Systems 
      Inc., Barium AB, BizFlow Corp., BP Logix Inc., Colosa Inc., Eccentex 
      Inc., Edorasware AG, Fujitsu Ltd., Interneer Inc., Integrify, Knowesia, 
      Kofax Inc., Metasonic AG, MicroPact Inc., OpenWork, Oracle Corp., 
      Perceptive Software, PNMsoft, Progress Software Corp., Questetra Inc., 
      Rage Frameworks, Red Hat Inc., Roubroo, RunMyProcess, Software AG, Tibco 
      Software Inc., Whitestein Technologies, and XMPro Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from the team said: The increasing 
      penetration and adoption of mobile devices is a major trend emerging in 
      the Global BPM PaaS market. Currently, mobile devices, smartphones, and 
      tablets are being used extensively by consumers to check all the 
      products and services offered by the company. In addition, organizations 
      are providing work from home options to reduce costs and enhance 
      employee morale. This has resulted in an increasing number of employees 
      working from a remote location. Therefore, the growing usage of mobile 
      devices will offer new opportunities in the market. Due to the increased 
      adoption of mobile devices, a number of vendors are launching mobile 
      applications that enable users to avail themselves of high-quality 
      services on the move. Therefore, the increasing demand for mobile 
      solutions is a trend that is expected to have a significant impact on 
      the growth of the market during the forecast period.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers in this market is the 
      need to reduce the cost of business processes. In traditional on-site 
      projects, organizations waste a lot of time creating connections to all 
      existing systems in the IT infrastructure to achieve an integrated flow 
      of information. Since BPM PaaS vendors enable faster connection of IT 
      systems, the organizations' in-house IT departments are not faced with 
      the burden of implementing these applications and incurring related 
      costs.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters-peHUB) - The auction of JP Morgan Chase's private equity business, One Equity Partners, in the market since at least November, has hit an impasse, according to three people with knowledge of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two people close to potential buyers said the bank "pulled" the business off the market. Another source, active in the secondary market but not directly involved with the process, described the auction as stalled after the bank increased its asking price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The bid/ask spread has widened dramatically," the secondary professional said. "It's hard to imagine someone stretching to that level. There's a lot of disappointed buyers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources said the bank could revive an auction of One Equity at any time. "The question is, do they try and come back six months from now, or never?" one source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for JP Morgan Chase declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank announced last July it was spinning off One Equity, its last remaining private equity operation, because the unit was not core. JP Morgan Chase was not under regulatory pressure to sell: One Equity would not be affected by the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, which restricts the ability of bank holding companies to own and operate private equity groups, sister news service Reuters reported last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potential buyers were bidding for a portfolio of buyout and growth equity investments valued at more than $4 billion, according to sources. The winning bidder was also expected to contribute to a new fund the team would raise as an independent firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the deal, One Equity, which has been investing off the bank's balance sheet, wanted $1.5 billion to $2 billion in funding for new deals, Dow Jones reported in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without a deal in place, One Equity team would likely have to move forward without any new capital from the bank. One Equity is drawing from "outstanding capital commitments" from the bank until starting its next fund, which would be raised from external investors, according to One Equity's website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group is led by Dick Cashin, who founded the group in 2001. Since then, One Equity has managed $14 billion in total investments and committed capital for JP Morgan Chase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has shed its other private equity groups over the years. JP Morgan Partners spun out into independent firm CCMP Capital Partners, and Corsair Capital, which the bank formed in 1993 to invest into opportunities created by the savings and loan crisis, spun out in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(peHUB is a Thomson Reuters publication.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters) - Partners in Goldman Sachs
Group Inc exercised options and sold shares in February,
cutting their stake in the company from  11 percent to 10.2
percent, according to a company disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm's top employees held 48.2 million shares as of
February 21, down from the 52.8 million they owned on January
27, according to the company's monthly filings with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The most recent report was
filed on March 7 and covered more than 400 employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares have been on a tear, moving from under $90 in
June 2012 to close at $174.26 on Friday. Most employees whose
sales were reported in the most recent filing sold at prices
between $161 and $166 a share. A part of partner's compensation
comes in the form of shares of the company; they typically must
wait five years after receiving them to sell the shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the filing, partners also exercised more than 4
million options, netting some $175 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs spokesman was not immediately available to

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Mica Rosenberg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 7 (Reuters) - Ecuadorean villagers who are
trying to get billions of dollars from Chevron Corp for
pollution in the Amazon jungle are ready to refocus their fight
on pending suits in other countries after a setback in the
United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A scathing judgment issued by a U.S. judge this week against
their lawyer will cast a long shadow over cases filed in Canada,
Brazil and Argentina, where the plaintiffs are seeking Chevron
assets as payment because the oil giant no longer has a presence
in Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan handed down a 500-page
decision that found American lawyer Stephen Donziger used
"corrupt means" to help villagers from the Lago Agrio region win
the historic $18 billion judgment against Chevron in Ecuador in
2011. The damage award was later revised down to $9.5 billion.
While Kaplan's decision bars Donziger and the villagers from
enforcing the Ecuadorean ruling in the United States, it is not
binding in pending cases elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the three cases, the Canadian one seems to have
progressed the farthest, with an appeals court there ruling in
December that the province of Ontario was a proper jurisdiction
for the plaintiffs to press the company to pay up. Chevron has
asked for an appeal of that ruling to be heard by Canada's
Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaughan Black, a professor at the Schulich School of Law in
Halifax, Nova Scotia, thinks Kaplan's ruling will resonate if
the Canadian case ends up being considered on its merits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Basically an Ontario court would have to look at all the
evidence again and start at the beginning," Black said. "I
suppose there is always the possibility that they could take a
different view of which witnesses were credible, but the New
York court didn't even think it was a close call. So it doesn't
look very promising for the Ecuadorean plaintiffs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sprawling environmental case stretches back to the
1990s, when the villagers first tried to seek compensation for
contamination in northeastern Ecuador by Texaco starting in
1964. Chevron acquired Texaco and for 20 years has been fighting
the case as well as Donziger, who has spent most of his career
representing the Ecuadorean plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The foreign courts will ultimately have to decide how to
weigh the evidence presented against Donziger, which Kaplan said
proved the judgment in Ecuador was tainted by fraud, against the
underlying claims of the villagers who say they were sickened by
decades of pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases in Argentina and Brazil are moving slowly. But the
Ontario appeals court in December reversed a lower court
decision and found Canada should be a forum to hear Ecuadoreans'
claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has resisted the Ecuador plaintiffs at every turn.
"We're going to fight this until hell freezes over. And then
we'll fight it out in the ice," a company spokesman once said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron's wish is granted," the Dec. 17 Ontario Court of
Appeal decision said, referring to the spokesman's quote. "After
all these years, the Ecuadorean plaintiffs deserve to have the
recognition and enforcement of the Ecuadorean judgment heard on
the merits in an appropriate jurisdiction. At this juncture,
Ontario is that jurisdiction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAST A SHADOW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada's Supreme Court could decide whether to grant a
hearing of the appellate decision in May, according to Canadian
legal experts. If it takes up the case, the Supreme Court will
likely only consider the narrow question of Canadian
jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should the Supreme Court agree with the appellate decision,
the entire case will go back to the original court, said
Schulich's Black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's when Chevron could bring to bear reams of documents
it introduced in the New York case, including Donziger's
personal notebook, purporting to show he ultimately corrupted
the case by submitting fraudulent evidence, bribing a judge,
ghost-writing the judgment and covering up his wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Canadian case, Donziger is not representing the 47
Ecuadorean plaintiffs who are standing in for the larger
community of 30,000 affected residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The U.S. court can't annul the Ecuador judgment," said Sara
Seck on the Faculty of Law at Western University in London,
Ontario. "It casts a shadow on it, but it's going to be up to
Canadian courts to decide what to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron believes Judge Kaplan's ruling in the Southern
District of New York will be a game changer for the cases being
fought in foreign courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No judge in any country that respects the rule of law will
entertain the enforcement of the corruption judgment," Chevron's
General Counsel R. Hewitt Pate said on a call with reporters. "I
think the opinion will carry great weight. ... We will share the
contents of the opinion with the other judges in Argentina,
Brazil and Canada."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Donziger's camp says making the ruling available will
not be enough to sway the other proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRAZIL, ARGENTINA TO COME&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, Kaplan issued a decision blocking the plaintiffs
from trying to enforce the Ecuadorean judgment anywhere in the
world, but the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York
overturned that ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his opinion on Tuesday, Kaplan carefully said his order
against Donziger "does not 'disrespect the legal system ... of
the country in which the judgment was issued' or those of 'other
countries' in which the (Lago Agrio plaintiffs) now, or later
may, seek to enforce the judgment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger's lawyer Deepak Gupta said he would appeal Kaplan's
decision and the villagers would continue to battle it out
abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Brazil, the villagers' case is waiting to be heard by a
court, said Chevron spokesman Morgan Crinklaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Argentina, the Supreme Court reversed a freezing of
Chevron's Argentine assets last year, but the enforcement case
is still pending, he said. Chevron brought the case to the
International Court in the Hague in 2009, claiming it was denied
justice in Ecuador. That arbitration is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a confidential memo produced as part of the New York
trial, Patton Boggs - the law firm that became involved in 2010
to help Donziger enforce the Ecuador judgment - suggests 24
countries where the plaintiffs could potentially study options
to enforce the Ecuador judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't have a system where one single trial judge,
whether they are in New York or anywhere else can appoint
themselves a worldwide fact-finding commission and essentially
preclude or persuade other courts not to enforce a judgment,"
Gupta said. He said he could not comment on the memo or on what
future efforts there might be to try to enforce the judgment in
other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan Lenczner, the lawyer representing the Ecuadorean
plaintiffs in Canada, said Kaplan's ruling has "zero" impact on
the ongoing proceedings in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case still faces two jurisdictional questions before it
is even heard on the merits. One is whether Canada can enforce a
foreign judgment, and the other is whether a Chevron subsidiary
in the country can be held responsible for the parent's action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the plaintiffs can win the court battle, they hope to
recover in Canada as much of the Ecuadorean judgment as
possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, all the international legal wrangling has left
the real victims of the legacy of environmental damage out in
the cold, said Judith Kimerling, an environmental law professor
at The City University of New York, Queens College. Kimerling
represents a group of indigenous Ecuadoreans suing Donziger in
New York state court for unjust enrichment and seeking to
recover resources to clean up the polluted area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are real people with real injuries and legitimate
claims behind all this," Kimerling said. "It is a very sad day
for the victims and for the environment because it makes it more
difficult for them to get remedies."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By John Ruwitch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI, March 9 (Reuters) - A wildcat strike at an IBM
factory in southern China illustrates how tectonic shifts under
way in the country's labor market are emboldening workers to
take matters into their own hands, raising risks for
multinationals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 1,000 workers walked off the job last week at the
factory in Shenzhen, bordering Hong Kong, after managers on
March 3 announced the terms of their transfer to new ownership
under Chinese PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo agreed in January to pay $2.3 billion for
International Business Machine's low-end server
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strike, which continued into Sunday, fits a growing
pattern of industrial activism that has emerged as China's
economy has slowed. A worsening labour shortage has shifted the
balance of power in labour relations, while smartphones and
social media have helped workers organise and made them more
aware than ever of the changing environment, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chinese workers, after being exploited for so long, are now
more and more aware of their rights and united. They have more
of an idea of collective action," said labour lawyer Duan Yi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A report by the advocacy group China Labour Bulletin last
month said it had talled 1,171 strikes and protests from the
beginning of June 2011 to the end of December 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many worker protests during that time in Guangdong province,
a manufacturing hub where the IBM server factory is situated,
were sparked by the closure, merger or relocation of factories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November, hundreds of employees stopped work at a Nokia
factory in Dongguan, near Shenzhen, complaining of changes
following Nokia's sale of its mobile phone business
to U.S. software giant Microsoft Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyer Duan is seeking arbitration for a group of 70 Nokia
workers who were laid off at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last August, 5,000 workers in eastern Shandong Province went
on strike to protest Apollo Tyres Ltd's proposed $2.5
billion acquisition of U.S.-based Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Co
. The deal was eventually scuttled and Cooper reported
this month that the work stoppage in China had cut operating
profit by $29 million in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The labour shortage has pushed up wages, impelled employers
to cast a wide net to find employees and enhance benefits to
retain staff. Workers have gained leverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Workers know they have greater power," said Geoffrey
Crothall, a China labour expert with China Labour Bulletin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said last week the terms offered to the workers at the
International System Technology Company factory in Shenzhen were
"comparable in aggregate to what they currently are receiving"
and severance packages would be "equitable".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo has declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TECHNOLOGY UNITING WORKERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology has helped China's workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Nokia factory employees took to the street, they
organised through the online chat system QQ and other social
media, one worker told Reuters by telephone from Dongguan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the IBM case, the workers had all read about prior
strikes, including Nokia's, and suspected ahead of time that
they might have to make a similar stand, said a 28-year-old
worker surnamed Chen who has worked there for three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were basically prepared and expected in advance there
wouldn't be a good deal," he said by telephone from Shenzhen. He
declined to allow his full name to be published out of concern
he might face repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both cases - and many others, experts say - the impetus
for a strike was underpinned by the fact that the factory branch
of the state-backed union was seen as a farce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independent unions are banned in China. The state-backed
All-China Federation of Trade Unions and its affiliates have a
reputation for being ineffectual and often siding with
management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because there's no real channel of communication at these
workplaces just about the only thing the workers can do is go
out on strike and demand that management address their
grievances," Crothall said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In most cases the union plays no positive role and
sometimes it's even a negative role," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chen, a striking IBM factory worker, had stronger words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The union exists in name only. It's useless," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, March 10 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp 
is betting on making sci-fi combat game "Titanfall" a hit big
enough to boost sales of its Xbox One videogame device, helping
it catch up in terms of sales with rival Sony Corp's 
PlayStation 4 console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retailers are gearing up to get in on the buzz that has
built up around the release of the game, one of the most
anticipated new products for the latest version of the Xbox, by
hosting over 6,000 midnight launch events worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On sale from Tuesday exclusively for the Xbox One and
personal computers, the $60 game allows players to go toe-to-toe
as soldiers, or take control of giant robots in a war-torn urban
setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're making a big bet that 'Titanfall' is going to be a
blockbuster launch for Xbox," Yusuf Mehdi, head of marketing and
strategy for Microsoft's Xbox group, said in an email interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of its "Titanfall" campaign, Microsoft will also
promote the game at South by Southwest, the annual gathering of
tech industry experts, filmmakers and musicians now under way in
Austin, Texas. Developed by Respawn Entertainment and published
by Electronic Arts, the game will be made available for
the older Xbox 360 consoles on March 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is locked in a console battle with Japan's Sony,
which announced last week it had sold 6 million PlayStation 4
units as of March 2. The device beat the Xbox One to become the
top-selling console in the United States in January, according
market research firm NPD Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 launched in November
last year. Microsoft has not provided an update on sales since
January, when it said Xbox One sales crossed three million units
as of the end of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Priced $100 more than the $399 PlayStation 4, the Xbox One
is seemingly trailing behind in sales. In February, Microsoft
announced an Xbox One and "Titanfall" bundle for $499,
effectively offering the game for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the launch of "Titanfall" much anticipated, the games
industry is watching to see if the title can replicate the
"Halo" effect. Released exclusively for the Xbox back in 2001,
"Halo" - another sci-fi shooter game - became a blockbuster
franchise, fuelling sales of Xbox consoles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't have a sales forecast for the game to share, but
we expect it to be big for us," Mehdi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STEVENSON, Md., March 10, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brower Piven, A Professional Corporation announces that a class action lawsuit has been commenced in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida on behalf of purchasers of Walter Investment Management Corporation ("Walter Investment" or the "Company") (NYSE:WAC) securities during the period between May 9, 2012 and February 26, 2014, inclusive (the "Class Period").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	If you have suffered a net loss from investment in Walter Investment securities purchased on or after May 9, 2012 and held through the revelation of negative information on March 18, 2013 and/or February 27, 2014, as described below, you may obtain additional information about this lawsuit and your ability to become a lead plaintiff, at no cost to you, by contacting Brower Piven at www.browerpiven.com, by email at hoffman@browerpiven.com, by calling 410/415-6616, or at Brower Piven, A Professional Corporation, 1925 Old Valley Road, Stevenson, Maryland 21153. Attorneys at Brower Piven have combined experience litigating securities and class action cases of over 60 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	No class has yet been certified in the above action.&#160;Members of the Class will be represented by the lead plaintiff and counsel chosen by the lead plaintiff.&#160;If you wish to choose counsel to represent you and the Class, you must apply to be appointed lead plaintiff no later than May 6, 2014 and be selected by the Court.&#160;The lead plaintiff will direct the litigation and participate in important decisions including whether to accept a settlement and how much of a settlement to accept for the Class in the action. The lead plaintiff will be selected from among applicants claiming the largest loss from investment in Company units during the Class Period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The complaint accuses the defendants of violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by virtue of the defendants' failure to disclose during the Class Period that the Company lacked adequate internal controls over financial accounting and compliance with applicable laws and that the Company's business practices violated consumer financial protection laws, thereby jeopardizing future revenues and profits such that the Company's financials were false and misleading.&#160;According to the complaint, following the Company's March 18, 2013 disclosure that Company management identified a material weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting and the Company's February 27, 2014 announcement that the FTC issued a Civil Investigation Demand to Company subsidiary Green Tree Servicing LLC requesting information relating to the company's operations, the value of Walter Investment shares declined significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	If you choose to retain counsel, you may retain Brower Piven without financial obligation or cost to you, or you may retain other counsel of your choice.&#160;You need take no action at this time to be a member of the class.&lt;/p&gt;CONTACT: Charles J. Piven

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Research and Markets: Global Hemophilia Market Report 2014-2018 with 
      Baxter, Bayer, Novo Nordisk  Pfizer Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/tw495w/global_hemophilia) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Hemophilia Market Report 2014-2018 with Baxter, Bayer, Novo Nordisk  
      Pfizer Dominating" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Currently, most of the therapeutic hemophilia products are short acting, 
      i.e., used only for when the patient suffers from bleeding. Further, 
      many of these products exhibit immunogenic reactions resulting in a 
      reduced effect of the therapeutic. In order to mitigate these issues, 
      technologies such as PEGylation, recombinant DNA, and protein fusion 
      technology, were developed and applied in the production of new 
      therapies with a longer life span and fewer immunogenic reactions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For example, Biogen Idec is developing a next generation Hemophilia A 
      therapy. The firm's leading therapeutic product, rFVIIIFc, is a 
      recombinant - a truncated version of factor VIII, fused to the Fc domain 
      of an antibody to extend half-life in the bloodstream. The resultant 
      recombinant product is a result of Biogen's protein fusion technology. 
      Thus, increase in technological innovations is expected to drive the 
      Global Hemophilia market during the forecast period.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers in this market is the 
      increase in the development of new hemophilia therapeutics. Currently, 
      there are large number of products in the pipeline being developed by 
      vendors which are aimed at addressing Hemophilia A, Hemophilia B, and 
      von WilleBrand disease. The anticipated approval of these pipeline 
      products is expected to contribute to the growth of the market during 
      the forecast period.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges in this 
      market is the high cost of hemophilia therapeutics. The high cost is 
      attributed to the longer time taken to manufacture hemophilia 
      prophylactics and manufacturing constraints.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 10, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against Walter Investment Management Corporation ("Walter Investment" or the "Company") (NYSE:WAC) and certain of its officers. The class action, filed in United States District Court, Middle District of Florida, and docketed under 1:14-cv-20880, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Walter Investment securities between May 9, 2012 and February 26, 2014, both dates inclusive (the "Class Period"). This class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws pursuant to Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	If you are a shareholder who purchased Walter Investment securities during the Class Period, you have until May 6, 2014 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Robert S. Willoughby at rswilloughby@pomlaw.com or 888.476.6529 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll free, x237. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and number of shares purchased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Walter Investment is a loan servicer and business solutions provider focused on generating recurring, fee-based revenues from an "asset-light" platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the Company lacked adequate internal controls over financial accounting and compliance with applicable laws; (2) the Company's internal controls were not effective; (3) the Company's financial statements contained false and misleading statements; (4) the Company had failed to disclose material weaknesses in the internal controls of its recently acquired subsidiary, RMS; (5) the Company had overstated the value of its RMS acquisition; (6) the Company was in violation of applicable laws, rules and regulations; (7) the Company's business practices violated consumer financial protection laws, thereby jeopardizing future revenues and profits; and, (8) as a result of the foregoing, the Company's statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	On March 18, 2013, the Company shocked investors by disclosing that, based on an evaluation by the Company's Board of Directors and management, "our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. As a result of this material weakness, management has concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	On this news, the Company's shares fell $8.61 per share to close on March 19, 2013 at $32.98 per share, a drop of over 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	On February 27, 2014, the Company announced in a Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") Form 8-K filing that the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") issued a Civil Investigation Demand ("CID") to Green Tree Servicing LLC ("Green Tree"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, requesting information on a broad range of subjects relating to the company's operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	On this news, shares of Walter Investment fell from $28.28 to $25.90, more than 8%, on unusually heavy trading volume, on February 27, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Florida, and San Diego, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, the Pomerantz Firm pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 70 years later, the Pomerantz Firm continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members. See www.pomerantzlaw.com.&lt;/p&gt;CONTACT: Robert S. Willoughby

      SDL Super Bowl Ad Study Shows Budweiser, Cheerios and Coca-Cola Won the 
      Brand Battle By Creating Sustained Brand Impact
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SDL Releases Best Practices Playbook to Advise Brands on How to 
      Create Lasting Impact
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commercials promoting Budweiser, Cheerios and Coca-Cola from the recent 
      Super Bowl broadcast generated the highest degree of lasting brand 
      commitment that continued after the Super Bowl, according to a study 
      and infographic released today by SDL 
      (LSE: SDL).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The SDL study assembled relevant, targeted brand conversations before, 
      during and after the Super Bowl and then analyzed the impact to brand 
      awareness and sentiment in the weeks following the Super Bowl push. SDL 
      has also created a best practices playbook to advise brands on how to 
      create lasting impact on social channels. The playbook can be downloaded here.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While a popular Super Bowl commercial by insurance provider Esurance 
      generated the highest level of social engagement on game day, the Budweiser, 
      Cheerios 
      and Coca-Cola 
      ads sustained and increased their level of brand-related and advocacy 
      conversations in the week following the game, the study found.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Esurance 
      commercial, offering a $1.5 million incentive for viewers to tweet 
      the hashtag #esurancesaves30, elicited 309,992 social posts &#8211; nearly 10 
      times that of the nearest competitor. But three days after the Super 
      Bowl, conversations mentioning the brand dropped off significantly.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Meanwhile, brand-related conversations about the Coca-Cola ad campaign &#8211; 
      featuring clips of people singing &#8220;America the Beautiful&#8221; in different 
      languages &#8211; actually increased as time went on, showing a sustained 
      growth in excitement and brand commitment. Coke&#8217;s campaign generated 
      more than 6,800 posts three days after the game &#8211; more than twice the 
      amount generated by Esurance and down only 30 percent from game-day 
      volumes. During that time, sentiment actually improved, with the split 
      of positive posts increasing from 75 to 81 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      These brand insights are generated through SDL&#8217;s Customer 
      Commitment DashboardTM (CCD) which provides companies 
      with the ability to measure brand advocacy, purchase intent and 
      engagement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Considering that brands are investing so much for Super Bowl spots, 
      they want to ensure that they&#8217;re generating the right type of 
      conversations and driving positive, lasting levels of brand engagement,&#8221; 
      said Paige O&#8217;Neill, CMO at SDL. &#8220;Our analysis shows that to be 
      successful, brands must combine a strong story with a tangible link to 
      brand identity and an engaging incentive in order to transfer buzz into 
      longer lasting brand uplift. Without those combined elements, buzz might 
      spike, but it won&#8217;t be sustainable.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The SDL study revealed additional insights concerning brands&#8217; successful 
      and unsuccessful advertising strategies for the 2014 Super Bowl. Best 
      practices include the following:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask for participation: Encourage, 
        incentivize and even ask for social media sharing through the use of 
        hashtags, social icons, contests, donations to a cause, and other 
        social media calls to action. Campaigns that included social elements 
        and specific calls to action had 4 percent higher Commitment Scores 
        than those that didn&#8217;t. A cautionary note: Brands must be certain that 
        their call to action is in harmony with the brand&#8217;s overall promise, 
        because if not, sustained benefits will not accrue to the campaign.
      
			
				Take a stance: Don&#8217;t be afraid to take a stance on seemingly 
        controversial social justice topics (e.g. gay rights, civil rights, 
        military appreciation, women&#8217;s rights, etc.). Taking a stance 
        generates high buzz, media attention, and in many cases a swell of 
        support from consumers and brand fans. Campaigns that took a stance 
        had scores that were 6 percent higher than those that didn&#8217;t.
      
			
				Continuity is key: Budweiser, Bud Light, Cheerios, Chrysler, 
        Geico, and MMs built familiar campaign themes that have been seen 
        either throughout previous Super Bowls or previous years of 
        advertising. Having these consistent and familiar faces, themes, 
        songs, etc. tied to the ad increased recall and brand commitment. 
        Campaigns that built on themes from previous campaigns had scores that 
        were 9 percent higher than stand-alone commercials.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Worst practices:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Putting the Stars Above the Brand: There was a lot of positive 
        buzz about this year&#8217;s all-star commercial casts (RadioShack, Oikos, 
        Jaguar, Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, Bud Light, Subway, Time 
        Warner, Honda (Hug Fest)), but this buzz didn&#8217;t generate excitement 
        about the brands or their products. Ads with all-star casts had scores 
        that were significantly lower than those who only highlighted one 
        celebrity or no celebrities.
      
			
				Keeping Things Too Simple: Commenters criticized certain brands 
        (Dunkin&#8217; Donuts, Sprint, Kindle, Jeep, Mazda, Verizon, etc.) for 
        disappointing at the big game. They argued that every year ads get 
        bigger and better at the Super Bowl, and that these brands failed to 
        compete by providing simple commercials similar to other campaigns 
        they run all year long. Brands that were criticized for keeping things 
        &#8220;too simple&#8221; during the big game had scores that were 19 percent lower 
        than competitors.
      
			
				Striking the Wrong Tone: Consumers complained that the tone of 
        some commercials (Axe, Audi, GoDaddy, Mazda, SodaStream, Ford, 
        Chrysler, etc.) contradicted long-held beliefs about the brands, or 
        that certain celebrity endorsements that were perceived as off-brand. 
        Brands must ensure that they conduct in-depth research to ensure that 
        your ad or celebrity adds to the overall brand story or perceptions 
        about your brand. Campaigns that were criticized for deviating from 
        the brand had scores that were 4 percent lower than competitors.

			Starbucks Opens First Store in Downtown Disney District
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Creative new location to offer a first-of-its-kind Starbucks 
      Experience to millions of guests at the Disneyland Resort
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today, Starbucks Coffee Company (NASDAQ: SBUX) and the Disneyland 
      Resort&#160;announced the opening of a new company owned Starbucks location 
      at Downtown Disney in Anaheim, Calif.,&#160;for the millions of guests 
      visiting Disneyland Resort from all over the world each year. This store 
      will be the first of four to be operated by Starbucks across Disney 
      properties in the United States and will serve as a destination for 
      guests looking to relax and recharge as part of their visit.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This store is a reflection of two iconic brands coming together to 
      offer their customers the kind of high quality experience they expect in 
      a way that embodies the unique passion of each,&#8221; said Arthur Rubinfeld, 
      chief creative officer and president, global innovation for Starbucks. 
      &#8220;Collaborating with Disney offered us the opportunity to create a unique 
      moment of connection for our customers in a way that evokes the magic 
      that their guests expect.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new Downtown Disney location will bring one of Starbucks most 
      engaging experiences to customers with technology and content designed 
      specifically for this store. This includes introducing customers to the 
      story behind Starbucks coffee projected across a 10-foot video 
      installation in addition to a first-of-its-kind interactive touch screen 
      that will inspire moments of playful creativity for even the youngest 
      visitors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The store will also offer some of the rarest coffees available as part 
      of the Starbucks Reserve&#174; coffee line and Clover&#174; brewing system. This 
      sustainably built to LEED standards location will include an outdoor 
      patio designed around a native tree, reclaimed wood siding and a living, 
      green wall with more than 1,000 plants in the shape of a coffee cup that 
      serves as a backdrop to capturing memories for visiting guests.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Guests visit Disney parks and resorts around the world to share 
      experiences with their friends and families and to create memories that 
      will last a lifetime,&#8221; said Daniel Delcourt, vice president of 
      Disneyland Resort Hotels and Downtown Disney. &#8220;This new location at 
      Downtown Disney will appeal to their love of Starbucks, and provide yet 
      another memorable experience at the Disneyland Resort.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Starbucks opened its first location at a Disney resort in 2009 in Disney 
      Village at Disneyland Paris with an innovative concept store that earned 
      LEED platinum certification. The company also has worked with Disney to 
      offer Starbucks signature beverages and pastries at locations inside the 
      theme parks including Disneyland Resort&#8217;s Fiddler, Fifer and Practical 
      Caf&#233; at Disney California Adventure park and Market House at Disneyland 
      park; as well as two locations at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida &#8211; 
      Main Street Bakery at Magic Kingdom park and Fountain View at Epcot.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Starbucks and Disney will bring five more Starbucks locations to guests, 
      including: one additional Starbucks-operated location in Downtown Disney 
      at Disneyland Resort, two Starbucks-operated locations at Downtown 
      Disney at the Walt Disney World Resort and two Disney-operated locations 
      at Disney&#8217;s Animal Kingdom and Disney Hollywood Studios at the Walt

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Ernest Scheyder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 11 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp, the second-largest U.S.
oil company, cut its 2017 production forecast on Tuesday by 6 percent, citing
project delays and asset sales, while saying high prices have pushed its new
baseline for oil to north of $100 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, like many of its peers, has seen mixed results from heavy
spending to lift oil and natural gas production, and shareholders in the sector
are pushing for more cost discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron trimmed its 2017 production outlook to 3.1 million barrels of oil
equivalent per day (boepd) from a previous forecast of 3.3 million boepd, but
stuck to plans to spend $40 billion this year on capital projects, about as much
as last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our growth strategy remains intact, though some things have changed," Chief
Executive John Watson said at the company's analyst day in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the more cautious production forecast, Chevron raised the oil price
used in its planning models to $110 a barrel from $79. Exxon Mobil, the
largest U.S. oil company, is using a similar level of $109 a barrel in its
budgets, based on 2013 average prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There comes a point when some projects just won't be able to compete for
capital" below $110 per barrel, Watson told reporters after the analyst meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watson cautioned that not all price rises go to Chevron.
High crude oil prices have, paradoxically, cut Chevron's cost
reimbursement in some contracts and increased costs, Watson said. An increase in
the price of oil can entitle Chevron's partners to a higher share of production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When prices increase, it's just arithmetic at that point," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, Chevron said it expected production of 2.6 million boepd this
year, up 0.5 percent from last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOW NATURAL GAS PRICES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has slowed development of its holdings in the Marcellus shale
formation in the eastern United States due in part to low natural gas prices
, which are making it less economical to extract the fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon lowered its production outlook for 2017 by 500,000 boepd last week,
partly due to lower spending on North American natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron plans to sell about $10 billion of assets in the next three years,
an increase from the $7 billion in asset sales in the previous three years,
which will also cut production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the new asset sales will be uncompetitive assets in the company's
oil and natural gas exploration and production business, Watson and other
executives said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Chevron has insisted on keeping capital expenditures high, many of its
peers have cut spending, bowing to investor demand for reduced spending on
exploration projects and boosts to dividends and share repurchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell took the most drastic step earlier this year,
vowing to cut $9 billion from its capital spending this year and increase the
money it sends shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watson defended Chevron's capital budget, saying targeted spending is in
shareholders' best interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What underpinned the original growth estimate we talked about is still
there," Watson said. "The best investments produce strong earnings and cash
margins, which in turn sustain a strong balance sheet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's stock fell $1.33, or 1.1 percent, to close Tuesday trading at
$114.51.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Downgrades 3 Distressed Classes of JPM 2006-CIBC15
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has downgraded three distressed classes and affirmed 15 
      classes of JP Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp. 
      commercial mortgage pass-through certificates series 2006-CIBC15 (JPM 
      2006-CIBC15). A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of 
      this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch modeled losses of 15.4% of the remaining pool; expected losses on 
      the original pool balance total 22.8%, including $247.8 million (11.7% 
      of the original pool balance) in realized losses to date. Fitch has 
      designated 44 loans (50.4%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes 
      six specially serviced assets (4.8%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the February 2014 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been reduced by 28.4% to $1.52 billion from $2.12 
      billion at issuance. Per the servicer reporting, seven loans (3.8% of 
      the pool) are defeased. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting 
      classes A-J through NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to expected losses remains the Warner Building 
      (19.3% of the pool), which is secured by a 616,135 square foot (sf) 
      landmark office property located in Washington, D.C., approximately 
      three blocks from the White House. In January 2012, the property 
      experienced a significant decline in occupancy from 99% to 49% as a 
      result of the bankruptcy and vacancy of the largest tenant, Howrey Simon 
      Arnold  White (51% of NRA). As of the January 2014 rent roll, the 
      property occupancy has increased to 70%. The largest tenants are Baker 
      Botts, LLP (26%, lease expiration 2020), Cooley LLP (18%, lease 
      expiration 2028), General Electric Company (8%, lease expiration 2016), 
      and Live Nation, parent of the Warner Theater, (7%, lease expiration 
      2023 after recent extension). The borrower continues to aggressively 
      market the vacant space and discussions continue with several 
      prospective tenants. The loan has a servicer reported June 2013 
      year-to-date (YTD) debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 0.30x, however, 
      at least two tenants had significant free rent periods during the period 
      that have now burned off. The total rental income per the January 2014 
      rent roll increased by approximately 40% from the January 2013 rent 
      roll. The loan remains substantially overleveraged.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The next largest contributor to expected losses remains the Scottsdale 
      Plaza Resort (3.8% of the pool), which is secured by a 404-key hotel 
      located in Scottsdale, AZ. The property's performance continues to lag 
      its competitive set in terms of occupancy, average daily rate (ADR), and 
      revenue per available room (RevPAR). According to the December 2013 STR 
      report, the property's trailing 12 month (TTM) occupancy, ADR, and 
      RevPAR were 52.2%, $127.81, and $66.74, respectively, with only 77.1% 
      RevPAR penetration. The most recent servicer reported DSCR for YTD 
      September 2013 was 0.56x, which is in line with the prior two years' 
      performance, but significantly below the reported issuance DSCR of 
      1.93x. The loan remains current as the borrower has been funding debt 
      service shortfalls out of pocket.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest contributor to expected losses is the defaulted 4001 
      North Pine Island Road (1.3% of the pool), which is secured by a 119 
      unit corporate apartment complex located in Sunrise, FL. The loan 
      transferred into special servicing in December 2008 due to monetary 
      default. The foreclosure action was filed in December 2010; however, 
      zoning violations stalled the process. Per the Servicer, the issues have 
      been resolved and foreclosure is expected to be completed by early 
      summer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Although credit enhancement for class A-4, A-SB and A-1A remains the 
      same, class A-SB is a scheduled balance class, and is senior in priority 
      to class A-1A and A-4 with respect to its scheduled principal payments, 
      and is expected to be paid in full by September 2015, so therefore 
      retains its 'AAAsf' and Stable Outlook. Classes A-1A and A-4 may be 
      subject to further downgrade should the larger performing loans show 
      increased deterioration or if interest shortfalls become likely. It 
      should be noted that three of the top 15 loans are secured by properties 
      currently leased to single tenants. The distressed classes A-M and A-J 
      are subject to further downgrade as additional losses are realized.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch downgrades the following classes as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$164.2 million class A-J to 'Csf' from 'CCsf', RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class C to 'Dsf' from 'Csf', RE 0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirms the following classes as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$874.5 million class A-4 at 'AAsf', Outlook Negative;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Coca-Cola Goes All the Way with $50,000 Donation to Boys  Girls Clubs 
      of America&#8217;s Triple Play Program
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The first of two Big Game advertisements from Coca-Cola in 2014 told the 
      all-American tale of triumph over adversity &#8211; a young man&#8217;s 
      inspirational story to achieve unlikely greatness. As a tribute to the 
      ad, titled &#8220;Going All The Way,&#8221; Coca-Cola pledged to donate $50,000 to 
      Boys  Girls Clubs of America&#8217;s (BGCA) Triple Play program once the ad 
      was shared 10,000 times online. The ad has exceeded Coca-Cola&#8217;s goal 
      with over 40,000 online shares.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The donation will be distributed to Boys  Girls Clubs across the U.S. 
      where Triple Play program dollars are needed the most, including 
      locations in Green Bay, WI; San Juan, PR; Philadelphia, PA; San 
      Francisco, CA; Seattle, WA; Cleveland, OH; Boston, MA; Sacramento, CA; 
      Washington, DC; and Denver, CO.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Over the next month, Coca-Cola and BGCA will come together in the ten 
      recipient cities to host community-based field day events to commemorate 
      the donations and cheer the occasion with delicious, ice-cold Coca-Cola.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It has been exciting to see the success of &#8216;Going All the Way&#8217; and we 
      are honored that our Clubs in need will receive additional funds to 
      support the Triple Play program,&#8221; said Jim Clark, President and CEO for 
      Boys  Girls Clubs of America. &#8220;It is partnerships like these and the 
      strong support of our communities that enable us to provide active 
      healthy living for our kids and we are looking forward to seeing these 
      Clubs in action over the next month.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The support that &#8216;Going All The Way&#8217; received from Americans to trigger 
      Coca-Cola&#8217;s donation to BGCA is truly moving and inspirational,&#8221; said 
      Katie Bayne, President, North America Brands, Coca-Cola North America. 
      &#8220;We&#8217;re humbled by the passion and excitement that rallied behind the ad, 
      and we want to sincerely thank all those who made this donation 
      possible.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company is a founding sponsor of BGCA&#8217;s Triple Play 
      program in partnership with WellPoint Foundation, which encourages young 
      people to eat a balanced diet, become more physically active and 
      increase their ability to engage in healthy relationships.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For 127 years, Coca-Cola has been bringing people together to support 
      communities and organizations like Boys  Girls Clubs of America. Today, 
      more than 4,000 Clubs serve nearly four million young people annually

      relationships, enrichment programs and a safe and positive environment

      Fitch: IFT Rules Broadly on Mexican Telecom  Media; No Credit Impact 
      for America Movil  Televisa
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings does not expect any material negative impact on the credit 
      profiles of America Movil, S.A.B. de C.V. (AMX, 'A'/Stable) and Grupo 
      Televisa, S.A.B. (Televisa, 'BBB+'/Stable) from the recent rulings by 
      Mexican regulatory body Instituto Federal de Telecomunicaciones (IFT). 
      On March 6, 2014, IFT issued a resolution declaring AMX and Televisa as 
      'preponderant' players in their respective industries that will be 
      subject to unfavorable asymmetric regulations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      'The recent rulings by IFT and the measures it announced the 
      preponderant players would be subject to were broadly in line with our 
      expectations, and we believe the risk stemming from it should be 
      manageable by both companies,' said Alvin Lim, Fitch Latin America 
      telecom, media, and technology sector analyst.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      'We do not expect these measures to be material enough to shift the 
      competitive landscapes of these industries immediately or in the short 
      term. Competitive pressure is likely to increase in the medium to long 
      term, but any short-term significant impact on the credit profiles of 
      AMX and Televisa is unlikely,' added Lim.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new regulations imposed by IFT are designed to foster market 
      competition and dilute the market dominance of AMX and Televisa by 
      mainly providing smaller or new operators with an easier access to 
      certain operational infrastructure to be able to compete with a less 
      capital requirement. For AMX, the key regulatory measures were network 
      infrastructure sharing, including mobile virtual operators, asymmetric 
      interconnection rates, and elimination of national roaming charges. For 
      Televisa, the key regulations imposed were broadcasting infrastructure 
      sharing, free retransmission of its over-the-air broadcast signals by 
      pay-TV operators, as well as approval of public auction for two new 
      broadcasters.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch forecasts that the outright financial impact from these 
      regulations should be limited as the affected revenue segments only 
      account for a marginal portion of revenues in the consolidated 
      financials of these companies. For AMX, its interconnection fees from 
      its Mexican operations have become smaller, estimated to account for 
      less than 2.5% of total consolidated revenues. For Televisa, the company 
      already has provided free retransmission since September 2013 and guided 
      that it expects only about MXP1.4 billion revenue decline from this, 
      which is less than 2% of the total revenue Fitch forecasts in 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch believes that the competitive pressure in the Mexican telecom and 
      media industries is likely to increase over the medium to long term as 
      smaller/new players become somewhat more competitive, backed by the 
      access to the infrastructure and other regulatory benefits, and try to 
      encroach on the market shares of AMX and Televisa. This could place 
      pressure on AMX's and Televisa's profitability from their Mexico 
      operations to a certain extent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      However, Fitch does not foresee any meaningful deterioration in the 
      credit profiles of both companies. For AMX, the company's entrenched 
      market position is not likely to face any serious decline, despite the 
      regulatory benefit for smaller players, given its well-established 
      operational scale and expertise. In addition, although its operating 
      margins in Mexico could be somewhat eroded, the company's 
      well-diversified operational geographies largely mitigate this risk. For 
      Televisa, its key competitiveness lies in its in-house content 
      production, which is not affected by the regulation. As this ability 
      remains intact, Fitch believes its advertising/content sales revenue 
      will continue to remain solid. In addition, Televisa's Pay-TV and 
      Telecommunications operations could benefit from a more competitive 
      environment promoted by the regulation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Details on the terms and implementation of these new regulations will be 
      determined after the secondary laws are passed. Fitch will continue to 
      monitor the development of this regulatory issue and assess the impact 
      of credit quality for each company. Telecom secondary laws are expected 
      to be approved by the congress during the ordinary period between 
      February and April of 2014.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is betting on making sci-fi combat game "Titanfall" a hit big enough to boost sales of its Xbox One videogame device, helping it catch up in terms of sales with rival Sony Corp's PlayStation 4 console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retailers are gearing up to get in on the buzz that has built up around the release of the game, one of the most anticipated new products for the latest version of the Xbox, by hosting over 6,000 midnight launch events worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On sale from Tuesday exclusively for the Xbox One and personal computers, the $60 game allows players to go toe-to-toe as soldiers, or take control of giant robots in a war-torn urban setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're making a big bet that 'Titanfall' is going to be a blockbuster launch for Xbox," Yusuf Mehdi, head of marketing and strategy for Microsoft's Xbox group, said in an email interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of its "Titanfall" campaign, Microsoft will also promote the game at South by Southwest, the annual gathering of tech industry experts, filmmakers and musicians now under way in Austin, Texas. Developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts, the game will be made available for the older Xbox 360 consoles on March 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is locked in a console battle with Japan's Sony, which announced last week it had sold 6 million PlayStation 4 units as of March 2. The device beat the Xbox One to become the top-selling console in the United States in January, according market research firm NPD Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 launched in November last year. Microsoft has not provided an update on sales since January, when it said Xbox One sales crossed three million units as of the end of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Priced $100 more than the $399 PlayStation 4, the Xbox One is seemingly trailing behind in sales. In February, Microsoft announced an Xbox One and "Titanfall" bundle for $499, effectively offering the game for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the launch of "Titanfall" much anticipated, the games industry is watching to see if the title can replicate the "Halo" effect. Released exclusively for the Xbox back in 2001, "Halo" - another sci-fi shooter game - became a blockbuster franchise, fuelling sales of Xbox consoles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't have a sales forecast for the game to share, but we expect it to be big for us," Mehdi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Malathi Nayak; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h1&gt;Patent Litigation Defendants, MasterCard and Visa, Have Filed Their Joint Brief in the United States Federal Circuit Court in Reply to SmartMetrics' Motion Before the Court Seeking a Judgment of Infringement and a Ruling on SmartMetrics' Claim of 25% of Financial Benefits That Accrue From Infringement of the SmartMetric-Issued Patent&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Mar 11, 2014) - &#160;SmartMetric, Inc. (OTCQB: SMME) is the owner of an issued United States Patent  Trademark Office patent referred to as the "464" patent in the SmartMetric infringement law suit brought by SmartMetric, Inc. against defendants Visa Inc. and MasterCard International covering the use of cards (EMV Cards) that are used to make connections to a network after insertion into a card reader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some millions of EMV cards have already been issued in the United States as part of the ongoing EMV adoption and rollout throughout the USA, directed by the payment card organizations. In representations to the District Court, Visa Inc. and MasterCard International have denied control of the claimed EMV card technology and therefore are not infringing parties of the SmartMetric patent.&#160;This is even in the light of representations under oath by both card companies' expert witnesses during deposition that the card companies do exercise control.&#160;The question of control by the defendants is now before the Federal Circuit Court with SmartMetric filing its motions including a motion to make a&#160;finding of infringement against both Visa Inc. and MasterCard International.&#160;SmartMetric has also asked the Federal Circuit Court to rule on SmartMetric's claim of 25% of the economic benefit flowing from the claimed infringing use of EMV cards in the United States, today said SmartMetric, Inc. President  CEO Chaya Hendrick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SmartMetric is not a patent assertion entity.&#160;The company is a technology company and&#160;developer of an in-card biometric fingerprint reader that is used to activate the card's EMV chip and is pressing its patent infringement case against the defendants in order to protect its rights under its issued patent.&#160;"This is an important case of a small inventor and patent holder protecting its intellectual property rights against global corporate giants," stated Chaya Hendrick. SmartMetric in earlier court filings is seeking $13.4 Billion against the defendants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About SmartMetric
				SmartMetric, Inc. (OTCQB: SMME) is the owner of a USPTO issued patent covering the use of smart cards (EMV cards are smart cards) that connect to networks. The company develops biometric smart cards including EMV and access control cards used for payments, security and identification.&#160;For information on SmartMetric and its technology please go to www.smartmetric.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safe Harbor Statement

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 11 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil has
sought permission from regulators to restart a Texas stretch of
the Pegasus oil pipeline that it says was not affected by a line
rupture in Arkansas in March 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon plans to restart operations on a 210-mile leg, running
from Corsicana to Nederland, Texas no later than March 28, it
said in a January filing to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials
Safety Administration (PHMSA), seen by Reuters on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil spewed from the Pegasus pipeline into the middle of the
small town of Mayflower, Arkansas, 20 miles north of Little
Rock, on March 29 last year, leading to the evacuation of homes
and fouling a local creek. The line has remained shut since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company "has no reason to suspect that any pipe in this
segment was damaged by the failure in Mayflower, AR," the filing
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The line would run at 80 percent of the operating pressure
in place before the line spilled oil last year, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A PHMSA spokesman said the filing had been received but a
decision was yet to be made on the restart.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/v25kll/global_predictive) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Predictive Analytics Market 2014-2018 with IBM, SAP, SAS Institute  
      TIBCO Software Dominating" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Predictive Analytics market to grow at a CAGR of 30% for 
      2014-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The cloud is fast becoming an important option for purchasing and 
      deploying the software. Enterprises are increasingly investing in 
      cloud-based offerings for their operational systems. A cloud-based 
      deployment allows the embedding of predictive analytics in the solution. 
      The target systems can be custom or packaged solutions and can be 
      delivered in the cloud or on-premises. Cloud-based deployment is also 
      used to embed 'customer churn' predictions in cloud-customer 
      relationship management.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The solutions based on cloud-based predictive analytics are well 
      established in customer relationship management, human resources, and 
      marketing. In addition, cloud-based predictive analytics is also used in 
      the decision-making process and is known as Decision as a Service. 
      Furthermore, the cloud empowers enterprises to deliver elastic computing 
      power for building predictive analytics models.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major growth drivers in the market 
      is the increasing need of enterprises to remain competitive in the 
      market, which they achieve by implementing predictive analytics in their 
      business processes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges is lack of 
      awareness. It is often observed that enterprises are not aware of the 
      potential benefits of implementing predictive analytics in their 
      business processes.

&lt;p&gt;N'DJAMENA (Reuters) - An ExxonMobil led consortium in Chad is seeking an out-of-court settlement after the government filed a legal claim for more than $800 million in unpaid taxes, finance ministry sources said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Central African government on March 3 filed a legal claim for 396 billion CFA francs ($837.90 million) in royalties from the consortium which also includes Chevron and Petronas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A representative for the Exxon consortium in the country declined to give an immediate comment. ExxonMobil's press service in Houston could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have received a delegation from the consortium on Monday at the ministry.

		&lt;h1&gt;Compugen's Microsoft Licensing Solutions Expertise Reaffirmed&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;TORONTO, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - Mar 11, 2014) - 
				Compugen Inc. is pleased to announce that as part of Microsoft Canada's comprehensive assessment of its partners' capabilities, Compugen will continue to retain the Licensing Solutions Partner (LSP) Authorization for Canada. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This acknowledgement of Compugen as a LSP is a continuation and upgrading of the Large Account Reseller designation that Compugen has had for many years. The goal of the Microsoft LSP program is to serve customers by ensuring that those with the most demanding licensing requirements always receive excellent service from their chosen LSP (LAR). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The complexity of software licensing for larger customers makes it imperative that they have solution providers who understand their requirements and can map those requirements to a changing licensing landscape," said Michael Charter, VP, Software, Compugen Inc. "The LSP program raises the bar for licensing solution providers and narrows the field to a handful of Microsoft resellers in Canada who have proven their knowledge of Microsoft products and licensing options and have a committed track record of providing the level of services customers require." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with Compugen's capability as a national Microsoft Systems Integrator (with six Gold Competencies), Authorized Device reseller (ADR), Gold Software Asset Management Partner (SAM) and Microsoft Authorized Refurbisher (MAR), Compugen is very well positioned to offer its Canadian customers through the lifecycle of the software (acquisition, deployment and management) an unparalleled and comprehensive range of software services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LSP program was launched at the Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference in July 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Compugen 
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Canada's top IT solutions and services providers, Compugen works with mid- to large-sized Canadian organizations to help them maximize the business value of their investment in information technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporations, government organizations and business partners look to Compugen for their industry acknowledged expertise and outcome based turn-key solutions in all aspects of business computing including networking, cloud computing, data centre and desktop technologies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compugen's award-winning service quality, unequalled depth and breadth of technical expertise and national footprint have made them the partner of choice for Canadian businesses and government organizations for more than 30 years. www.compugen.com

		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) is continuing to generate 
      industry-leading operational and financial results and advancing key 
      projects to drive future growth, executives said today at the company&#8217;s 
      annual security analyst meeting in New York.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;World energy demand continues to grow and the outlook for the energy 
      business remains excellent,&#8221; said John Watson, Chevron&#8217;s chairman and 
      CEO. Watson added, &#8220;Our strategies are sound, and we&#8217;re poised to 
      deliver significant production growth through the end of the decade. We 
      believe this compelling growth profile, combined with flattening capital 
      spending levels these next few years, should serve as a strong catalyst 
      for value creation for our shareholders in the years ahead.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      George Kirkland, vice chairman and executive vice president, Upstream, 
      reviewed the performance of Chevron&#8217;s upstream business in 2013, marking 
      yet another year where the company led the industry on multiple upstream 
      financial metrics including earnings and cash unit margins, as well as 
      return on capital employed. He also discussed some of the company&#8217;s 
      portfolio management strategies and practices while highlighting key 
      attributes of the portfolio, which included a special emphasis on the 
      company&#8217;s Permian basin assets and future growth plans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our upstream portfolio leads the industry in quality, breadth and 
      depth. We have the right strategies, always adhere to a disciplined 
      investment approach, and are constantly managing the portfolio to 
      extract and maximize value for our shareholders. Our base business is 
      performing exceptionally well and provides us a substantial, longer-term 
      competitive advantage, driving continued peer-leading financial and 
      operational performance.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jay Johnson, senior vice president, Upstream, provided an overview of 
      Chevron&#8217;s queue of projects, exploration assets, and other long-term 
      opportunities. &#8220;Our plan for production growth is solid and will be 
      driven by near-term project ramp-ups as well as our larger major capital 
      projects which begin starting up later this year.&#8221; Johnson added, &#8220;These 
      projects are attractive, and when combined with profitable production 
      growth from our shale and tight resource developments, are expected to 
      add over 800,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2017. We also have 
      a deep queue of other growth opportunities which should allow us to 
      continue growing production to the end of the decade.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mike Wirth, executive vice president, Downstream and Chemicals, reviewed 
      market fundamentals while highlighting business performance and future 
      growth plans. &#8220;Our strategy is to deliver competitive returns and grow 
      earnings, including integration opportunities with our upstream 
      business.&#8221; Wirth added, &#8220;We have a focused refining and marketing 
      portfolio with strategically located and competitive assets. Our 
      petrochemicals business leads its industry, and we continue to target 
      profitable growth opportunities, primarily in chemicals and lubricants.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pat Yarrington, vice president and chief financial officer, highlighted 
      Chevron&#8217;s continued financial strength, capital spending outlook, and 
      asset divestment plans. &#8220;Our objective is to reward our shareholders 
      through both share price appreciation and higher dividends. We&#8217;ve been 
      able to sustain increasing shareholder distributions and, at the same 
      time, reinvest for future growth. We believe we&#8217;ve balanced these 
      objectives well, and that our existing portfolio and new investment 
      projects will support continued value growth for our shareholders,&#8221; 
      Yarrington said.

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd said it was up to IBM to resolve a wildcat strike at a China-based factory, as a deal to buy the U.S. company's server business had yet to be finalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 1,000 workers went on strike last week to protest over the terms of their potential transfer to Lenovo, which said in January it would buy one of the server businesses of International Business Machine (IBM) for $2.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement posted on its website late on Monday, Lenovo said the strike was an internal matter for IBM but it also pledged to maintain the salaries and benefits of all workers that chose to stay with the company after the deal is completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lenovo and IBM are two independent companies. Any integration between Lenovo and IBM's x86 server department will not be conducted until the deal is closed," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To ensure a smooth transition, Lenovo is committed to provide opportunity for all employees from IBM's x86 server department who transfer to Lenovo, without any reduction of their wages and benefits," it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 7,500 IBM employees in more than 60 countries were expected to transfer to Lenovo once the deal is completed, Lenovo said. The workforce was a "great asset" and part of the reason for the acquisition, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The striking workers also had expressed concern about their severance package if they decided to leave after the deal, which is awaiting regulatory and government approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IBM strike fits a growing pattern of industrial activism that has emerged as China's economy has slowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shortage of workers has shifted the balance of power in labor relations, while smartphones and social media have helped labourers organize and made them more aware than ever of the changing environment, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, three workers said by telephone that many colleagues had returned to work or quit, while others continued to strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by John Ruwitch and James Pomfret in HONG KONG; Editing by Miral Fahmy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI, March 11 (Reuters) - Chinese PC maker Lenovo Group

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - Pending California carbon
regulations could make it too expensive to operate refineries in
the most populous U.S. state, drastically increasing gasoline
prices and costing thousands of jobs, a senior Chevron Corp
 executive said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The No. 2 U.S. oil company, which runs California's two
largest refineries, believes a bill first passed in 2006 and
being introduced in phases, would hurt the state's economy and
have little impact on climate change, Michael Wirth, who
oversees Chevron's refining and chemical businesses, said in an
interview on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is especially opposed to a part of the bill, known
as AB 32, that starting next year would require all California
distributors of transportation fuels to purchase carbon permits
to cover emissions from automobiles, a cost the Boston
Consulting Group, in a study on behalf of the oil industry,
estimates could exceed $3.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a cost, frankly, that Chevron can't absorb," Wirth
said at the company's annual investor day. "No matter how big
and successful we are, we can't absorb that cost. We'd have to
pass that onto consumers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wirth said the rules could sharply push up gasoline price in
California, which already has the most expensive gasoline in the
United States. Some environmentalists say higher prices would
force people to use alternative fuels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California has at times introduced rules tougher than those
of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, while the Sierra
Club and other environmental groups have publicly stated a goal
to eliminate all refineries in the San Francisco area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State legislators approved AB 32 with the goal of reducing
California's greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.
The bill gave the California Air Resources Board (CARB)
authority to craft regulations that would help meet that goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CARB decided a cap-and-trade system would best accomplish
the greenhouse gas reduction goal. The first phase, for power
plants and refineries, was put into place last year. The vast
majority of carbon permits thus far have been given out freely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next year, the second phase will target transportation
fuels, which worries Chevron. Under current plans, there will be
no free carbon permits for transportation fuels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbon permits cost about $12 per tonne today in California,
which if the regulation was in effect on transportation fuels
today would translate to a roughly 12 cents per gallon increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boston Consulting Group estimated the price of California
gasoline could jump 49 cents to $1.83 per gallon by 2020 under
the new regulations. Other estimates show a lower impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global demand for oil is far more likely to cause a sudden
rise in California gasoline prices in the coming years than an
unlikely run up in carbon prices, according to analysts. But
unlike world markets, carbon is a cost that California voters
could take steps to ease or remove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is far from probable, however, that Chevron could pull
out of the California refining market entirely, said Wayne
Miller, associate director of the University of
California-Riverside's College of Engineering Center for
Environmental Research and Technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're such a large producer of fuel in California that if
they closed, it would be beyond a crisis," said Miller, who
worked for Unocal years ago before it was bought by Chevron.
"Still, I'm sure they're concerned about all the fees."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the cap-and-trade system to be amended or revoked, CARB
would have to find alternate ways to reduce emissions, or state
legislators would have to repeal the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's Wirth said that even if AB 32 is not altered, it
is unlikely to have a meaningful impact on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"California, by itself, cannot change the (global) inventory
of greenhouse gases," Wirth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron also is lobbying hard for approval to renovate its
105-year-old refinery in Richmond, northeast of San Francisco. 
California's safety regulators told Chevron to repair its
245,000 barrel per day Richmond refinery after a 2012 fire that
sent thousands to hospitals with respiratory woes but caused no
fatalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company received preliminary approval to upgrade the
refinery in 2008 before a lawsuit was filed by environmental
groups. An appeals court ruled in 2010 that Chevron did not
properly disclose the type of crude oil the upgraded refinery
would process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effectively, Chevron has proposed a simplified renovation
project to replace the refinery's hydrogen plant and smaller
parts. It is unclear whether the company will receive approval
this time from Richmond officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The reality is, these kinds of plants need to be
continually upgraded to modern standards for safety and
environmental performance," Chevron executive Wirth said. "If
you reach a point where you can't continue to do that, it's hard
for the facility to continue to be viable."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday ordered former Goldman Sachs Group Inc trader Fabrice Tourre to pay more than $825,000 after a jury found him liable for defrauding investors in a subprime mortgage product that failed during the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision by U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan came in one of the prominent Wall Street cases linked to the crisis, and one of the few in which an individual was held personally responsible for wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre was ordered to pay $650,000 in civil fines, and give up an additional $175,463 bonus plus interest linked to the transaction at the heart of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total payout fell below the roughly $1.15 million, including a $910,000 fine, that the SEC had sought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the judge said a stiff sanction for the 35-year-old Frenchman was appropriate, saying Tourre's fraud lasted for several months and noting what investigators said were his false emails and misleading materials sent to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He has shown no remorse or contrition," Forrest added, referring to Tourre. The judge also forbade Goldman from paying Tourre's fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman in July 2010 reached a related $550 million settlement with the SEC. It did not admit wrongdoing but acknowledged and expressed regret that its marketing materials were incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEC enforcement chief Andrew Ceresney welcomed Wednesday's decision, including penalties he characterized as "significant."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ruling reflects the SEC's intent of pursuing meaningful sanctions to punish individuals responsible for misconduct and deter others from violating the federal securities laws," he said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre resigned from Goldman in December 2012, and is pursuing a doctorate in economics at the University of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, he said he was "deeply grateful for the unwavering support of my family and friends as I consider potential next steps in the legal process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SYMBOL OF THE MELTDOWN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre became a symbol of the financial meltdown after the SEC sued him and Goldman in 2010 for misleading investors in a synthetic collateralized debt obligation, or CDO, linked to mortgages called Abacus 2007-AC1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He became widely known as "Fabulous Fab" after using that nickname in an email cited in the SEC lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC accused Tourre of concealing from investors how Paulson &amp; Co, the hedge fund of billionaire John Paulson, had helped put Abacus together and had bet it would fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also accused Tourre of misleading ACA Capital Holdings Inc, which helped choose Abacus assets, into thinking Paulson would be an equity investor in the CDO, rather than bet the other way as part of a massive wager against subprime mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulson, meanwhile made about $1 billion by shorting Abacus, while investors lost the same amount, the SEC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fraud on ACA was critical to making the transaction work; without ACA as portfolio selection agent, Goldman would not have been able to convince others to invest in the equity of the transaction," Forrest wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August, a federal jury found Tourre liable on six of seven civil charges related to Abacus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre had been slated to teach an honors economics class this spring, but a University of Chicago spokesman on March 4 said those plans had been scrapped. No reason was given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SENDING THE RIGHT MESSAGE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre's lawyers had fought against any ban on Goldman reimbursing their client, saying it would be unprecedented, even as they said he had every intention of paying any penalty out of his own pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge, however, said letting Goldman reimburse Tourre would send the wrong message to others mulling illegal conduct, though the defendant could seek reimbursement from others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To permit Tourre to obtain reimbursement from Goldman, which the jury in this case found to be a co-violator of the securities laws, would undermine the purposes of the civil penalty statutes - to punish the individual violator and to deter future violations," she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman did pay Tourre's legal fees, and has said it had no agreement with Tourre to reimburse him for penalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the bank declined to comment on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forrest also denied an SEC request for an injunction barring Tourre from future securities law violations, saying there was no evidence he planned to return to the industry after finishing his studies in June 2016. But she said the SEC could reapply if he returns in the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge's decision drew mixed reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This really sends a loud and clear message that this court is not going to tolerate this conduct," said David Marder, a partner at Robins, Kaplan, Miller &amp; Ciresi and a former SEC lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dennis Kelleher, chief executive of the non-profit organization Better Markets, said a big fine cannot hide the government's "indefensible" failure to have brought criminal charges against senior Wall Street executives over the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wall Street recklessness, fraud and criminality were at the core of the crash and crisis," he said. "History will judge prosecutors and regulators harshly for abdicating their duty to enforce the law without fear or favor on Wall Street as they do on Main Street."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 10-03229.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Nate Raymond and Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Jonathan Oatis)&lt;/p&gt;

			Pfizer Will Appeal Court Decision Regarding Celebrex Reissue Patent
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. confirmed today that the United States District Court for 
      the Eastern District of Virginia granted summary judgment invalidating 
      the reissue patent (U.S. Patent No. RE44,048), covering methods of 
      treating osteoarthritis and other approved conditions with celecoxib, 
      the active ingredient in Celebrex&#174;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer disagrees with the ruling and will pursue all available remedies, 
      including an immediate appeal of the court&#8217;s decision.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A trial was scheduled to begin on March 19, 2014, for infringement of 
      the reissue patent in the action brought by Pfizer against the generic 
      companies Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc., 
      Watson Laboratories, Inc., Lupin Pharmaceuticals, USA, Inc., Apotex 
      Corp., and Apotex, Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Each of these generic companies previously filed an abbreviated new drug 
      application with the United States Food and Drug Administration seeking 
      approval to market a generic form of celecoxib in the United States 
      beginning on May 30, 2014, when Pfizer&#8217;s basic Celebrex&#174; compound patent 
      (including the six-month pediatric exclusivity period)expires. This is

      Fitch Takes Various Actions on JPMCC 2003-ML1
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has upgraded four, downgraded one, and affirmed one class 
      of J.P. Morgan Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp. 2003-ML1, commercial 
      mortgage pass-through certificates. A detailed list of rating actions 
      follows the end of the press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The upgrades to classes H through L are due to increased credit 
      enhancement from significant paydowns and the relatively stable 
      performance of the pool. The downgrade to class M reflects the loss 
      expectations from the specially serviced loans. Fitch modeled losses of 
      26.9% of the remaining pool; expected losses on the original pool 
      balance total 2.2%, including losses already incurred. The pool has 
      experienced $6.6 million (0.7% of the original pool balance) in realized 
      losses to date. Fitch has designated six (67%) of the remaining 14 loans 
      as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes three specially serviced 
      assets (48.9%). Three loans (4.6%) are currently defeased.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the February 2014 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been reduced by 94.2% to $53.9 million from $929.8 
      million at issuance. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting classes 
      N and NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Losses are expected for the three specially serviced loans. The 
      remaining loans do not generate a modeled loss using the most recent 
      reported cash flow and cap rates between 9% and 10.5%, the loan to value 
      ratios for these loan range from 17.2% to 87%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest specially serviced loan is a 199,366 square foot (sf) 
      unanchored retail property (16% of the remaining balance) located in 
      Dearborn, MI. The largest tenants at the property include Dental Center 
      (17%), Murray's Auto (9%), and the Secretary of State (3%). The property 
      was 56.1% occupied as of year-end (YE) 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second largest specially serviced loan is a 260,644 sf anchored 
      retail property (21%) located in Racine, WI. The loan transferred to the 
      special servicer due to a modification request, as the property has 
      experienced cash flow issues. Anchor tenants at the property include 
      Home Depot, Kmart, and OfficeMax. The property was 89% occupied as of 
      September 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest specially serviced loan is a 93,677 sf anchored retail 
      property (11.9%) located in Naugatuck, CT. The loan failed to make its 
      balloon payment in January 2013. The property was 98.5% occupied as of 
      YE 2012; however, the largest tenant at the property (56.1%) is 
      currently dark.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings on the class H through L notes are expected to be stable as 
      the credit enhancement remains high. Classes M and N may be subject to 
      further downgrades as losses are realized.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has taken the following actions:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$11.7 million class H upgraded to 'AAsf' from 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$10.5 million class J upgraded to 'Asf' from 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$5.8 million class K upgraded to 'BBBsf' from 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$5.8 million class L upgraded to 'BBsf' from 'B+sf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$7 million class M downgraded to 'CCCsf/RE 80%' from 'Bsf';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$4.6 million class N affirmed at 'CCCsf/RE 0%'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch also marked classes F and G as 'PIF'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch does not rate the class NR notes and previously withdrew the 
      rating on the X-1 notes. Classes A-1, A-2, B, C, D, E, and X-2 have paid 
      in full.

      Fitch Upgrades 1 Class of J.P. Morgan 1999-C8
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has upgraded one class of J.P. Morgan Commercial Mortgage 
      Finance Corp. series 1999-C8 commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$751,448 class G notes upgraded to 'Asf' from 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$10.9 million class H notes affirmed at 'Dsf'; RE 95%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Class J notes affirmed at 'Dsf'; RE 0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The upgrade to the class G notes reflects significant delevering and 
      high credit enhancement. Fitch modeled losses of 4.5% of the remaining 
      pool; expected losses on the original pool balance total 7.5%, including 
      losses already incurred. Fitch has designated four (36.7%) of the 11 
      remaining loans as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes one specially 
      serviced asset (5.2%). One loan (0.8%) is currently defeased.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the February 2014 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been reduced by 98.4% to $11.8 million from $731.5 
      million at issuance. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting classes 
      H and J.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch stressed the cash flow of the remaining loans by applying a 
      haircut to the 2013 trailing 12 months or 2012 fiscal year-end net 
      operating income. All the loans also underwent a refinance test by 
      applying an 8% interest rate and 30-year amortization schedule to the 
      stressed cash flow. All loans were modeled to pay off at maturity, and 
      could refinance to a debt-service coverage ratio (DSCR) above 1.25x.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest remaining loan in the transaction (20.3% of the remaining 
      balance) is secured by a 120-unit nursing home located in Lantana, FL. 
      The loan performance has improved over the past year and according to 
      the servicer, the property remains in good condition.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch does not rate the class NR notes and previously withdrew the 
      ratings on the K and X notes. Classes A-1, A-2, B, C, D, E, and F have 
      paid in full.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rating on the class G notes is expected to be stable as the credit 
      enhancement is increasing and the class continues to delever.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Nate Raymond and Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday
ordered former Goldman Sachs Group Inc trader Fabrice
Tourre to pay more than $825,000 after a jury found him liable
for defrauding investors in a subprime mortgage product that
failed during the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision by U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in
Manhattan came in one of the prominent Wall Street cases linked
to the crisis, and one of the few in which an individual was
held personally responsible for wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre was ordered to pay $650,000 in civil fines, and give
up an additional $175,463 bonus plus interest linked to the
transaction at the heart of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total payout fell below the roughly $1.15 million,
including a $910,000 fine, that the SEC had sought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the judge said a stiff sanction for the 35-year-old
Frenchman was appropriate, saying Tourre's fraud lasted for
several months and noting what investigators said were his false
emails and misleading materials sent to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He has shown no remorse or contrition," Forrest added,
referring to Tourre. The judge also forbade Goldman from paying
Tourre's fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman in July 2010 reached a related $550 million
settlement with the SEC. It did not admit wrongdoing but
acknowledged and expressed regret that its marketing materials
were incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEC enforcement chief Andrew Ceresney welcomed Wednesday's
decision, including penalties he characterized as "significant."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ruling reflects the SEC's intent of pursuing meaningful
sanctions to punish individuals responsible for misconduct and
deter others from violating the federal securities laws," he
said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre resigned from Goldman in December 2012, and is
pursuing a doctorate in economics at the University of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, he said he was "deeply grateful for the
unwavering support of my family and friends as I consider
potential next steps in the legal process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SYMBOL OF THE MELTDOWN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre became a symbol of the financial meltdown after the
SEC sued him and Goldman in 2010 for misleading investors in a
synthetic collateralized debt obligation, or CDO, linked to
mortgages called Abacus 2007-AC1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He became widely known as "Fabulous Fab" after using that
nickname in an email cited in the SEC lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC accused Tourre of concealing from investors how
Paulson &amp; Co, the hedge fund of billionaire John Paulson, had
helped put Abacus together and had bet it would fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also accused Tourre of misleading ACA Capital Holdings
Inc, which helped choose Abacus assets, into thinking Paulson
would be an equity investor in the CDO, rather than bet the
other way as part of a massive wager against subprime mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulson, meanwhile made about $1 billion by shorting Abacus,
while investors lost the same amount, the SEC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fraud on ACA was critical to making the transaction
work; without ACA as portfolio selection agent, Goldman would
not have been able to convince others to invest in the equity of
the transaction," Forrest wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August, a federal jury found Tourre liable on six of
seven civil charges related to Abacus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre had been slated to teach an honors economics class
this spring, but a University of Chicago spokesman on March 4
said those plans had been scrapped. No reason was given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SENDING THE RIGHT MESSAGE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre's lawyers had fought against any ban on Goldman
reimbursing their client, saying it would be unprecedented, even
as they said he had every intention of paying any penalty out of
his own pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge, however, said letting Goldman reimburse Tourre
would send the wrong message to others mulling illegal conduct,
though the defendant could seek reimbursement from others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To permit Tourre to obtain reimbursement from Goldman,
which the jury in this case found to be a co-violator of the
securities laws, would undermine the purposes of the civil
penalty statutes - to punish the individual violator and to
deter future violations," she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman did pay Tourre's legal fees, and has said it had no
agreement with Tourre to reimburse him for penalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the bank declined to comment on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forrest also denied an SEC request for an injunction barring
Tourre from future securities law violations, saying there was
no evidence he planned to return to the industry after finishing
his studies in June 2016. But she said the SEC could reapply if
he returns in the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge's decision drew mixed reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This really sends a loud and clear message that this court
is not going to tolerate this conduct," said David Marder, a
partner at Robins, Kaplan, Miller &amp; Ciresi and a former SEC
lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dennis Kelleher, chief executive of the non-profit
organization Better Markets, said a big fine cannot hide the
government's "indefensible" failure to have brought criminal
charges against senior Wall Street executives over the financial
crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wall Street recklessness, fraud and criminality were at the
core of the crash and crisis," he said. "History will judge
prosecutors and regulators harshly for abdicating their duty to
enforce the law without fear or favor on Wall Street as they do
on Main Street."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York, No. 10-03229.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, March 12 (Reuters) - U.S. fourth-quarter growth
is likely to be revised higher after services industry data on
Wednesday suggested a much stronger pace of consumer spending
than the government had previously assumed, JPMorgan economist
Daniel Silver said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government last month slashed its gross domestic product
estimate for October-December quarter to a 2.4 percent annual
pace from a previously reported 3.2 percent rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silver, at JPMorgan in New York, said the quarterly services
survey, from which government's estimates for services
consumption and intellectual property products are derived,
showed a much more robust pace of consumer spending in the
fourth quarter than the government's estimated 2.6 percent rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We now believe real consumption increased 3.4 percent and
and our estimate of growth in intellectual property products is
unchanged at 8.0 percent with rounding," said Silver in a
research note. "We are raising our tracking estimate of fourth
quarter real GDP growth to 3.0 percent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economy grew at a 4.1 percent rate in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not unusual for the government to make big revisions
to GDP numbers as it does not have complete data when it makes
its first and second estimates. The quarterly services survey
has caused revisions to GDP growth over the last several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should the government raise fourth-quarter growth, that
would suggest underlying strength in the economy at the end of
2013 and bolster the argument that a slowdown in growth at the
start of this year was weather-driven and would be temporary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will publish its third GDP growth estimate
for the fourth quarter on March 27.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 12 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's Prevnar 13
vaccine, designed to protect against pneumonia, performed well
in a large-scale trial among elderly patients, boosting the
chances of strong sales of the blockbuster product, analysts
said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial, whose results were announced on Wednesday, cut by
46 percent initial episodes of pneumonia acquired outside of
hospitals from infection with a common family of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that adults aged 65 and older who were
immunized with the vaccine were 75 percent less likely, compared
with patients taking placebos, to develop "invasive" infections
in the bloodstream with Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria, with
or without pneumonia. That secondary goal of the trial was
achieved by an impressive margin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meeting another secondary goal, there was a 45 percent
reduced incidence of first situations in which the pneumonia was
caused by the bacteria, but the bacteria were not detected in
the bloodstream or any other normally sterile site in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer last month said Prevnar 13, used mainly to prevent
infections with the bacteria in young children, had met primary
and secondary goals of the 85,000-patient trial, called CAPiTA.
But the largest U.S. drugmaker, at the time, did not provide
clinical data from the study, which was conducted in the
Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevnar 13, sold under the brand name Prevenar 13 in many
markets outside the United States, is one of Pfizer's biggest
products. It and an older version of the vaccine known as
Prevnar 7 have combined annual sales of $4.4 billion, making
them the company's second-biggest franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan analyst Chris Schott on Wednesday said he
expects $300 million of Prevnar 13 sales in the adult population
in 2015, thanks to the "robust" data in the CAPiTA study,
growing to $1.5 billion over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alex Arfaei, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, was far
more bullish. He called the results of the trial "positive and
better than our expectations" and predicted adult sales of
Prevnar 13 would reach $4.1 billion in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arfaei, in a research note, predicted especially strong
demand among adults outside of the United States in countries
where smoking and other factors make people more vulnerable.
Infections from the bacteria are often referred to as
pneumococcal disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares were little changed in morning trading on the
New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday
ordered former Goldman Sachs Group Inc trader Fabrice
Tourre to pay more than $825,000 after a jury found him liable
for defrauding investors in a complex investment product linked
to subprime mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision by U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in
Manhattan came in one of the highest-profile cases by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission to flow out of the events
leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre was ordered to pay $650,000 in civil fines, and give
up an additional $175,463 plus interest, representing the
portion of his bonus attributable to the transaction at the
heart of the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forrest also barred Tourre from seeking to have Goldman
cover his civil fines, but said he could seek reimbursement from
others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC had sought to recoup $1.15 million from Tourre,
including a $910,000 fine plus ill-gotten gains and interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			U.S. Bank is First to Offer Visa&#174; 
      Payment Controls Service for Small Business Owners
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      U.S. Bank is the first bank in the nation to offer Visa Payment 
      Controls, which gives small business owners control over how, when and 
      where their employees&#8217; business credit cards are used.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Visa Payment Controls lets small business owners spend more time 
      focused on their business and less time worrying about how their 
      business credit cards are being used by their employees,&#8221; said Cathi 
      Stanton, senior vice president for U.S. Bank Retail Payment Solutions. 
      &#8220;Combined with U.S. Bank&#8217;s exclusive and free FlexControl options and 
      ScoreBoard reporting tool, we&#8217;re offering small businesses powerful 
      applications to help them control and track business credit card 
      spending, while also cutting down on administrative work.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With easy, online management controls, Visa Payment Controls lets small 
      business owners manage how employees can use their cards based on:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Time of day or day of week
      
			
        Geographical area
      
			
        Certain merchant types
      
			
        Dollar amount
      
			
        Transaction types, such as cash advances or cash withdrawals
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      For example, the owner of a delivery company could set controls that 
      allow drivers to use their business credit card only during certain 
      times of the day with a cap on daily spending. The owner could also set 
      up alerts to be notified when transactions are blocked because they&#8217;re 
      outside parameters set on a particular card. Controls can be applied or 
      removed in real-time, giving business owners complete flexibility over 
      managing their employee card usage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With Visa Payment Controls, business owners can replace inefficient and 
      costly cash and check systems with secure, reliable and convenient 
      employee credit cards and automatically take greater control over 
      employee spending,&#8221; Stanton said.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WARSAW, Ind., March 12, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Symmetry Medical Inc. (NYSE:SMA), a leading global source of innovative medical device solutions, including surgical instruments, orthopedic implants, and sterilization cases and trays, announced today that its subsidiary, Symmetry Surgical, is launching the newest innovation in its industry-leading Bookwalter&#174; portfolio, the Bookwalter&#174; Femoral Elevator, at the Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) in New Orleans, March 11-15, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Bookwalter&#174; Femoral Elevator supports direct anterior approach (DAA) total hip arthroplasty (THA) by providing a simple method to elevate and stabilize the resected femur during femoral canal broaching. Built through collaboration with surgeons and operating room professionals, this product offers an operating room (OR) table-mounted alternative to healthcare providers in providing access and visualization in the minimally invasive DAA THA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Bookwalter&#174; Femoral Elevator is the first orthopedic specific system from the market leading, table-mounted line of Bookwalter&#174; Retractor Systems for general surgical applications. It leverages the robust construction and OR table attachments required in general surgery into DAA THA and does not require an assistant to elevate the femur using hand-held retractors during off-table cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Dr. John Bookwalter, surgeon inventor of the Bookwalter&#174; Retractor System, said, "I believe that good exposure is the key to good surgery. By facilitating reliable exposure of the femoral shaft within the incision, the new Bookwalter&#174; Femoral Elevator can help hospitals and surgery centers provide access and visibility in minimally invasive direct access hip surgery. This new Bookwalter&#174; innovation is the result of years of research and development with orthopedic surgeons and I am excited to extend the Bookwalter&#174; brand to Orthopedics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Symmetry Surgical is focused on driving innovation and developing surgical instruments that help give our customers leading-edge alternatives in surgical procedures," said Ajey Atre, President, Symmetry Surgical. "The new Bookwalter&#174; Femoral Elevator demonstrates our commitment to developing surgical technologies designed to help surgeons and surgical staff deliver exceptional care around the world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Symmetry Surgical will provide hands-on demonstrations of the Bookwalter&#174; Femoral Elevator at AAOS in Symmetry Medical's Booth 4949. The product is now available through Symmetry Surgical for direct hospitals and surgery centers as well as through Symmetry Medical's OEM Solutions team for current OEM customers looking for additional access into the direct anterior approach market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Anne Sweeney, the president of Walt Disney Co's Disney/ABC Television Group, will leave the media company in January after 18 years to pursue a career in television directing, the company said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweeney, also co-chair of Disney Media Networks, oversees the ABC broadcast network, ABC Studios and cable networks including the Disney Channels and ABC Family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former Fox and Nickelodeon executive joined Disney in 1996 and played a key role in implementing Chief Executive Bob Iger's digital strategy. In 2005, she led negotiations with Apple Inc that enabled Disney to become the first Hollywood studio to license its movies for download from Apple's iTunes store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 3, Disney licensed the digital rights for ESPN, the Disney Channel and other properties to satellite operator Dish Networks Inc, allowing it to become the first pay television operator to distribute TV shows online outside of a traditional TV subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweeney, 56, said she wanted to explore a more creative job in the television business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There has always been a nagging voice in the back of my head pushing me to step out of the comfort zone of the executive ranks and more directly into the creative arena that enticed me to TV in the first place," she said in a statement. "I finally listened to that voice and thought, &#8216;If not now, when?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, said he had offered Sweeney a multi-year contract extension. "She shocked me by saying she didn't really want to go long, that she was thinking about her life and exploring other things," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger said he would look for a replacement quickly, aiming to have someone in place during the TV pilot season that runs through May. "My goal is to do it fast," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CEO also expressed confidence in ABC Entertainment Group President Paul Lee, who was hired to run the network in 2010. ABC has struggled in the ratings, ranking fourth so far this season among the major broadcasters in overall viewers and in the 18 to 49 age group prized by advertisers, according to Nielsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee "has got my full support," Iger said, adding that "he and I share the (belief that) we'd love a few more hits at ABC."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By the way, there are elements of prime time that we're quite happy about," Iger said, mentioning political drama "Scandal" and business reality show "Shark Tank."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by Steve Orlofsky, Nick Zieminski and Cynthia Osterman)&lt;/p&gt;

      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today presented detailed results of the 
      Community-Acquired Pneumonia Immunization Trial in Adults (CAPiTA), the 
      landmark study of approximately 85,000 subjects, demonstrating that 
      Prevenar 13* (pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine

      community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults 65 years of age and older, 
      the study&#8217;s primary objective. This trial is the first in adults to 
      clearly demonstrate a significant reduction in vaccine-type pneumococcal 
      CAP, and importantly, non-bacteremic/non-invasive vaccine-type 
      pneumococcal CAP. Results were presented during the late-breaker session 
      at the 9th International Symposium on Pneumococci and Pneumococcal 
      Diseases (ISPPD) in Hyderabad, India, on March 12, 2014.

      Regarding the study&#8217;s primary objective, there were 45.56 percent&#160;fewer 
      first episodes of vaccine-type CAP among Prevenar 13-vaccinated subjects 
      than in subjects who received placebo (P=0.0006). Regarding the study&#8217;s 
      secondary objectives, the Prevenar 13 group experienced&#160;45.00 percent 
      fewer first episodes of non-bacteremic/non-invasive vaccine-type CAP 
      (P=0.0067) and 75.00 percent fewer first episodes of vaccine-type IPD 
      (P=0.0005) compared with the placebo group. The safety profile of 
      Prevenar 13 in this study was consistent with studies previously 
      conducted in adults.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additional data showed reductions in vaccine-type CAP, 
      non-bacteremic/non-invasive vaccine-type CAP, and vaccine-type IPD for 
      up to four years after vaccination among subjects who received Prevenar 
      13.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      &#8220;With the aging of the population, hospitalizations due to pneumococcal 
      pneumonia represent a growing burden to public health systems. Evidence 
      from this study is particularly important for a population in which 
      age-related decline of the immune system makes it difficult to prevent 
      disease,&#8221; said Dr. Emilio A. Emini, senior vice president, Vaccine 
      Research and Development, Pfizer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This study demonstrated that vaccination with Prevenar 13 can prevent a 
      significant portion of pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia in 
      adults aged 65 and older, which is an important global public health 
      goal,&#8221; said principal investigator Prof. Marc Bonten, professor of 
      Molecular Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medical 
      Microbiology, Julius Center for Health Sciences  Primary Care, 
      University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The CAPiTA (Community-Acquired Pneumonia Immunization Trial in Adults) 
      study data will be an important part of any consideration of potential 
      new or updated recommendations for Prevenar 13 in adults. Other key 
      factors also are expected to be taken into consideration, including the 
      current burden of pneumococcal disease in adults.

			About CAPiTA (Community-Acquired Pneumonia Immunization Trial in 
      Adults)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In 2011, Prevnar 13 was licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug 
      Administration under an accelerated approval process to address an unmet 
      medical need in older adults. As a requirement of the accelerated 
      approval pathway, Pfizer conducted CAPiTA (Community-Acquired Pneumonia 
      Immunization Trial in Adults) to verify clinical benefit.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This was a parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 
      single-center trial in which subjects aged 65 years and older were 
      randomly assigned to receive a single dose of either Prevnar 13 or 
      placebo. A total of 84,496 subjects were enrolled. The trial was 
      conducted by Julius Clinical, a spin-off of the Julius Center for Health 
      Sciences and Primary Care, a division of the University Medical Center 
      Utrecht in the Netherlands. Fifty-eight sentinel hospitals were used for 
      the surveillance of CAP and IPD.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Vaccine-type CAP (VT-CAP) was defined as CAP caused by any Streptococcus 
      pneumoniae serotype included in the vaccine. 
      Non-bacteremic/noninvasive VT-CAP was defined as CAP in which 
      vaccine-type S. pneumoniae caused the pneumonia, but was not 
      detected concurrently in the bloodstream or any other normally sterile 
      site. Vaccine-type IPD was defined as a case in which vaccine-type S. 
      pneumoniae was present in the bloodstream or any other normally 
      sterile site, with or without pneumonia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			About Pneumococcal Disease
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pneumococcal disease refers to a group of illnesses caused by&#160;S. 
      pneumoniae bacteria.1 Invasive pneumococcal disease 
      occurs when bacteria enter the bloodstream, or another site that is 
      normally sterile.2 Non-invasive pneumococcal pneumonia occurs 
      when the bacteria cause infection in the lungs but are not detected in 
      the blood concurrently.1 In adults, pneumonia is the most 
      common presentation of pneumococcal disease.1 For every one 
      case of invasive pneumococcal pneumonia in adults, it is estimated that 
      at least three cases of non-invasive pneumococcal pneumonia occur.3 
      While non-invasive forms of pneumococcal disease are typically more 
      common, the invasive types of disease are generally more severe.4
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Prevenar 13
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prevenar 13 was first introduced for use in infants and young children 
      in December 2009 in Europe and is now approved for such use in more than 
      120 countries worldwide, including the United States and Japan. It is 
      the most widely used pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) in the world, 
      and more than 640 million doses of Prevenar 7-valent/Prevenar 13 have 
      been distributed worldwide. In addition, Prevenar 13 is approved for use 
      in adults 50 years of age and older in more than 90 countries, and is 
      also approved in the United States and European Union (EU) for use in 
      older children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Recently, Prevenar 13 
      was also approved in the EU for use in adults 18 to 49 years of age.

			INDICATIONS FOR PREVNAR 13&#174;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Prevnar 13&#174; is a vaccine approved for adults 50 years of 
        age and older for the prevention of pneumococcal pneumonia and 
        invasive disease caused by 13 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains 
        (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F). This 
        indication is based upon immune responses to the vaccine
      
			
        For children 6 weeks through 17 years of age, Prevnar 13&#174; 
        is approved for the prevention of invasive disease caused by the 13 
        vaccine strains, and for children 6 weeks through 5 years for the 
        prevention of otitis media caused by 7 of the 13 strains
      
			
        Prevnar 13&#174; is not 100% effective and will only help 
        protect against the 13 strains included in the vaccine
      
			
        Effectiveness when given less than 5 years after a pneumococcal 
        polysaccharide vaccine is not known
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Prevnar 13&#174; should not be given to anyone with a history of 
        severe allergic reaction to any component of Prevnar 13&#174; or 
        any diphtheria toxoid&#8211;containing vaccine
      
			
        Children and adults with weakened immune systems (eg, HIV infection, 
        leukemia) may have a reduced immune response
      
			
        In adults, immune responses to Prevnar 13&#174; were reduced 
        when given with injected seasonal flu vaccine
      
			
        In adults, the common side effects were pain, redness, or swelling at 
        the injection site, limitation of arm movement, fatigue, headache, 
        muscle pain, joint pain, decreased appetite, chills, or rash
      
			
        A temporary pause of breathing following vaccination has been observed 
        in some infants born prematurely
      
			
        The most commonly reported serious adverse events in infants and 
        toddlers were bronchiolitis (an infection of the lungs) (0.9%), 
        gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach and small intestine) 
        (0.9%), and pneumonia (0.9%)
      
			
        In children 6 weeks through 17 years, the most common side effects 
        were tenderness, redness, or swelling at the injection site, 
        irritability, decreased appetite, decreased or increased sleep, and 
        fever

&lt;p&gt;* Chevron hasn't filed full report on 2nd incident in
offshore field -ANP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Report needed before regulator can approve drilling,
injection -ANP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jeb Blount&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANGRA DOS REIS, BRAZIL, March 13 (Reuters) - Permission for
Chevron Corp to resume drilling and water injection at
its Frade offshore field in Brazil is being held up by the
company's failure to deliver a full report on the causes of a
2012 oil seepage, the head of Brazil's oil regulator said on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They can't get authorization until we get the report and
analyze it," said Magda Chambriard, director general of the ANP
regulatory agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report is supposed to explore and explain the reasons
for a second leak at Frade, Chambriard said. Frade was the site
of a November 2011 accident that resulted in a spill of about
4,600 barrels into the Atlantic Ocean northeast of Rio de
Janeiro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. company has spent more than $2 billion developing
Frade, which was once the largest foreign-run oil field in the
country. It has a projected capacity to produce about 80,000
barrels of oil and equivalent natural gas a day (boepd). That's
more than 3 percent of Brazil's oil and natural gas output or
2.56 million boepd in January, according to the ANP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field was temporarily shut after a second leak in the
area was discovered in March 2012. At the time there was
speculation that a pressure "kick" that caused the original
spill may have caused fractures in rock beneath the sea-bed that
led to the new leaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said then that it was shutting the well as a
precautionary measure and that there was no evidence that the
March leaks of several barrels of oil was linked to the November
spill. Chevron also said it did not know if the leaks were
natural or the result of oil production activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small, natural leaks of oil from the ocean floor are common
in the Campos Basin, where Frade is located. The Campos Basin is
home to more than 80 percent of Brazil's oil output. Natural oil
leaks in the area prompted Brazil's state-run oil company,
Petroleo Brasileiro SA, to explore for oil in the basin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No oil came near shore and no workers or wildlife were
harmed in either event at Frade. ANP officials said there was no
sign of negligence by Chevron and that there was no discernable
harm to the environment. The original Frade leak in 2011 was
less than 0.1 percent of the giant Deepwater Horizon spill in
the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, San Ramon, California-based Chevron was allowed to
resume output at Frade, but remained under a drilling and
injection ban after it explained the reasons for the initial
spill and agreed to a series of new procedures and remedial
actions in an "Adjustment of Conduct Agreement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Injection of water is used to increase reservoir pressure
and help increase oil production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frade, which was producing as much as 72,000 boepd before
the November 2011 spill, churned out 21,199 boepd in January,
according to the ANP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adjustment of conduct agreement also resulted in the
closing of lawsuits seeking as much as 40 billion reais ($17
billion) in damages for the initial spill and criminal penalties
against Chevron, Transocean Ltd., its drilling
contractor and 18 Chevron and Transocean employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frade is 52 percent owned by Chevron, which is also the
field operator. Brazil's state-run oil company Petroleo
Brasileiro SA owns 30 percent and 18 percent is owned
by Frade Jap&#228;o, a joint venture between Japanese trading houses
Inpex Corp. and Sojitz Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			Kroll Bond Rating Agency Assigns Preliminary Ratings to JPMCC 2014-FL4
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) is pleased to announce the assignment of 
      preliminary ratings to seven classes of JPMCC 2014-FL4, a $755.3 million 
      large loan floating rate CMBS transaction (see ratings listed below).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The collateral for the transaction consists of nine first-lien mortgage 
      loans secured by a total of 61 properties. The loans have principal 
      balances ranging from $30.9 million to $220.0 million for the largest 
      loan in the pool, which is secured by Waikiki Beach Marriott Resort  
      Spa (29.1%). Waikiki Beach Marriott Resort  Spa is a 1,310-key, 
      full-service hotel located on a 5.4-acre site along Waikiki Beach in 
      Honolulu. The five largest loans also include Blackstone Industrial 
      Portfolio (27.1%), Carefree Resorts MHC Portfolio (13.2%), Generation 
      Companies Portfolio A (6.6%) and Hilton Los Cabos Resort (6.4%), and 
      represent 82.5% of the initial pool balance. Seven loans (66.1%) are 
      secured by the borrowers' fee simple interests in the related 
      properties, one loan (29.1%) is secured by the borrower&#8217;s leasehold 
      interest, and one loan (4.8%) is secured by the borrower&#8217;s fee simple 
      and leasehold interests in the related property. The mortgaged 
      properties are located in ten states, Canada and Mexico, with three 
      state concentrations that each represents more than 15.0% of the initial 
      pool balance: Hawaii (29.1%), Florida (17.2%), and Virginia (16.1%). 
      There is also exposure to two property types with concentrations in 
      excess of 15.0%: Hospitality (55.4%) and industrial warehouse/flex 
      (27.1%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KBRA&#8217;s analysis of the transaction involved a detailed evaluation of the 
      underlying cash flows using our CMBS Property Evaluation Guidelines and 
      the application of our CMBS Single-Borrower  Large Loan Rating 
      Methodology. The results of the analysis yielded KNCF for the underlying 
      collateral properties that was, on average, 3.9% less than issuer cash 
      flow. KBRA applied our stressed capitalization rates to KNCF to arrive 
      at valuations of the underlying properties. The KBRA values were, on 
      average, 35.8% less than the appraiser&#8217;s as-is valuation. The resulting 
      KBRA in-trust Loan to Value (KLTV) for the pool was 71.8%, and the 
      all-in KLTV was 110.8%. As part of our analysis of the transaction, we 
      also reviewed and considered third party engineering and environmental 
      reports, our analysts&#8217; site visits of the collateral properties, and the 
      transaction structure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      For complete details on the analysis, please see our Presale Report,&#160;JPMCC 
      2014-FL4, published today at&#160;www.krollbondratings.com.&#160;The 
      preliminary ratings are based on information known to KBRA at the time 
      of this publication. Information received subsequent to this release 
      could result in the assignment of final ratings that differ from the 
      preliminary ratings.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO/SEATTLE (Reuters) - It may be one of Microsoft Corp's biggest squandered opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tired of waiting for Office to be optimized for their mobile gadgets, a growing contingent of younger companies is turning to cheaper, simpler and touch-friendly apps that can perform word processing and other tasks in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take Artivest Holdings Inc, a New York-based financial services startup that sells alternative investment products. The New York-based company uses an app called Quip, which combines word processing and messaging, to handle all but the most sensitive legal and financial files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are no more Microsoft Word documents being circulated. If someone emails me a Word document, I'll tell them to put it in Quip," said Artivest Chief Investment Officer David Levine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I'm walking to and from home, or going to an appointment, I can review or edit on my iPad. Not being tied to my desk, that's a big pro," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The speed with which apps like Quip have been adopted is forcing Microsoft to intensify its efforts to bring the powerful but ageing Office software suite to tablets and smartphones, according to people close to the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft already has a full iPhone and iPad version of Office ready for release, the sources said. The only question is when Chief Executive Satya Nadella, who took over in February, will pull the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella wants to widen Office's customer base but has to balance that with the flagship Windows franchise, which benefits greatly from tight integration with Office, especially on desktop computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have some pretty exciting plans," said John Case, the top Office marketing executive, without giving any details. "Certainly, interest in Office on the iPad is extreme. When they (customers) want to do real work, they are going to want to use Office."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors for years have urged Microsoft to adapt Office, its most profitable product, for mobile devices from Apple Inc and Google Inc - rather than shackling it to Windows as PC sales decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activist investment firm ValueAct Capital, whose president Mason Morfit sits on Microsoft's board, has more recently voiced misgivings about Office's continued mobile absence, sources familiar with the firm said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to one analyst estimate, Microsoft is giving up $2.5 billion a year in revenue by keeping Office off the iPad, which has now sold almost 200 million units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Office is being disenfranchised on the hottest growth platforms," Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund wrote in a note to clients. "Maybe it is time to focus on Office independent of Windows."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts say it may be too late for Microsoft to win back the iPad generation, even if it introduces a mobile-optimized Office suite in the next few months, as expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Look at the applications that are on the rise to support mobile. It is not Microsoft OneNote or Word. It's Dropbox, or Evernote," said Ted Schadler, an analyst at tech research firm Forrester. "It's really about being everywhere. That's an important, immediate decision that Satya's going to have to drive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW APPS ON THE BLOCK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's productivity tools remain the industry standard, with more than a billion users spending almost $25 billion on them last fiscal year. But Office revenues are driven primarily by corporate officers who buy for large workforces - and more than half of America's employees use a mobile device daily to supplement their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rapid rise of apps such as Quip, Haiku Deck, Prezi, Paper, Smartsheet, Good and Evernote, not to mention Google Apps, is nibbling away at the Office franchise. That is particularly true among mid-sized and smaller companies, which tend to be more frugal and less dependent on legacy Office documents or spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ian Ray, a network administrator at Cypress Grove Chevre Inc, a cheese maker based in Arcata, California, has most of his 35-member workforce using web-friendly apps on iPads and Google Chromebooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We use Google for email, Google Docs tied to that, Expensify for expense reports, Lucidchart for doing flow charts, and Smartsheet for organizing projects," Ray said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After more than two decades, Microsoft has in recent years eased some Office functions into the mobile arena, mostly accessibly via web browser. The company has yet to release a touchscreen-optimized version of the full Office suite including Word, PowerPoint and Excel - not even for the Windows 8 operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason for the delay appears to be internal politics. The powerful Windows group and the younger but more profitable Office group have a patchy history of collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When then-Windows boss Steven Sinofsky unveiled the touch-friendly Windows 8 and the Surface tablet in late 2012, many industry insiders remarked on the absence of a tailor-made Office suite, which was shepherded by Kurt DelBene at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Sinofsky and DelBene left their jobs within months. Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer has vowed to override divisions with his 'One Microsoft' overhaul launched last summer, now in Nadella's hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But divisions remain. Some in the Windows camp want to make sure Office remains primarily a Windows experience, which should help sales of the Surface. Others in the Office camp, however, want to reach customers on as many platforms as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will bring these apps to Windows devices and also other devices like the iPad in ways that meet our customers' needs and in ways that make sense economically for Microsoft," the company said in a recent statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLOCK TICKING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to research firm Ovum, 57 percent of all employees use a personal smartphone or tablet to access corporate data, while 70 percent of tablet owners use their personal tablets at work at some point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies are increasingly allowing employees to work on their personal devices - a trend the IT industry has dubbed "bring your own device" or BYOD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is the true danger for Microsoft, said Adam Tratt, a former Office executive who is now chief executive of Seattle-based Haiku Deck, an iPad-based presentation app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft rose to dominance in an age when the CIO (chief information officer) really held the keys to IT decision making," said Tratt. "Over the past five years, BYOD has really eroded the level of control that many CIOs have."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although they are not as fully fleshed out as Office, younger challengers have been built from the ground up in an era defined by mobile devices and cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Text files in Quip, for instance, are not formatted in virtual 8.5- by 11-inch pieces of paper - instead, they automatically zoom to fit any tablet screen. Revisions in a file can be made and viewed, in real time, by collaborators without sending email attachments back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't have Word's 30 years of features built into it," said Bret Taylor, Quip's co-founder. "But we're much better at collaboration and much better at mobile."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gerry Shih and Bill Rigby; Editing by Edwin Chan and Tiffany Wu)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ROME (Reuters) - Italian police on Thursday arrested Federica Gagliardi, a woman who acted as Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's secretary at two international summits in Canada in 2010, on suspicion of smuggling 24 kg of cocaine on a flight from Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gagliardi, who is in her early 30s, was taken into custody at Rome's Fiumicino airport shortly after arriving on a flight from Caracas after police found the drugs in her carry-on luggage, a finance police spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials provided no further details, but according to Italy's anti-drug police estimates the local street value of 24 kg of pure cocaine, after it is cut with other substances to be sold on, would be about 6.7 million euros ($13.21 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The police did not say whether they found pure cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Italian media dubbed Gagliardi the "white lady", splashing her picture on the front pages and describing her as Berlusconi's mystery companion when she stepped off the plane in Toronto in June 2010, previously unknown, dressed in a white linen blouse and trousers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to questions about her role, Berlusconi's office said she was acting as his secretary on the trip. She said she had met Berlusconi while campaigning for a member of his party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a few weeks, she dropped out of the media spotlight, but her LinkedIn page says she remained a regional government secretary in Rome until last year. ($1 = 0.7192 euros)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Antonella Cinelli; Writing by Steve Scherer; Editing by Alison Williams)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prime money market funds in February cut their holdings of repurchase agreements with banks and Wall Street dealers to the lowest in over three years, according to a J.P. Morgan Securities report released on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SANTA CLARA, Calif., March 13, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Neonode Inc., (Nasdaq:NEON), the optical touch company, has completed its Windows 8 certification process with Microsoft for its Multi-touch PC solution, which will be called zForce&#174; PLUS. This official certification can be viewed on Microsoft's Certified Products List website (http://goo.gl/DUZX3q), which specifically details the approval for Neonode's zForce&#174; PLUS (http://goo.gl/OkzbPk).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	This watershed event independently validates the world-class performance of Neonode's MultiSensing&#174; family of optical touch solutions. It also illustrates the versatility of optical technology and how it can be expanded beyond normal finger touch to new ways of human interactions with PC devices and accessories. With zForce&#174; PLUS, Neonode is not only targeting multi-touch PC displays, but in combination with zForce&#174; AIR, it replaces capacitive sensing PC track-pads and expensive mechanical switches in PC keyboards, thereby creating virtual touch areas on any surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Neonode's zForce&#174; PLUS allows OEMs to remove front-glass from devices such as notebooks and monitors, which saves costs, reduces weight, eliminates annoying glare and reflections, and improves production yields by cutting-out the low-yield process of glass to display-lamination. However, if an OEM prefers to use a glass cover, zForce&#174; PLUS works perfectly with it, without diminishing its low-cost, high-yield, and feature-rich solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Neonode's proven MultiSensing&#174; family of technologies has an established record of low-cost, high-yield and function-rich solutions, which are demonstrable within our installed-base of millions of units in consumer hands. Neonode is already engaged with a number of Tier One PC OEMs who are working to integrate Neonode's zForce&#174; PLUS multi-touch solutions into PC monitors, All-In-One Desktops, Chromebooks and Windows 8 Notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"After 15 months of intensive development of our new multi touch zForce&#174; PLUS technology, we have now reached this extremely gratifying milestone of Windows 8 certification" says Thomas Eriksson, CEO of Neonode. "Adding this technology to our MultiSensing&#174; technology family expands our offering to include multi-touch solutions for our PC customers, who are urgently demanding low-cost, high-performance, multi-touch solutions, that are easily manufactured."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, March 13 (Reuters) - Capital flight from Russia has
risen sharply since the start of this year to $45-$50 billion,
Goldman Sachs said on Thursday, predicting full-year outflows
could be as much as $130 billion, or double 2013 levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman says its calculations show capital outflows have
jumped 60 percent from year-ago levels as the economy slows and
the threat of Western sanctions bites. It also slashed its
forecast for Russian economic growth this year to 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western powers are considering imposing sanctions on Moscow 
in response to its military intervention in neighbouring
Ukraine,  especially if the Crimea region votes this weekend in
a referendum to secede from Ukraine and join Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Achilles heel of the Russian economy remains the flow
abroad of Russian capital following any shock. We would also
think that any sanctions or even the threat of sanctions will be
ultimately targeted at these flows," Goldman analysts Clemens
Grafe and Andrew Matheny said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most of these flows, in our view, are driven by Russian
capital outflows rather than lower foreign inflows."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grafe and Matheny calculate that total net private capital
outflows amounted to $45-50 billion in the year to date, or more
than a 10th of Russia's economic output in the first 2014
quarter. The outflows also represent a big jump over the $28
billion that left the country in the first three months of 2013,
they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their models indicate total capital outflows for the year of
$130 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If confirmed, the data indicates growing pressure on the
Russian economy which is already showing its slowest growth
since 2008. Official data shows capital flight was $62.7 billion
in 2013, with outflows totalling $420 billion since 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman based its capital flight calculations on estimates
of a $25 billion current account surplus in the first three
months of the year and around $30 billion in foreign exchange
interventions by the central bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we are right in our estimate of net private capital
flows, pressure on the central bank's FX reserves will continue
all year," the analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also is the latest investment bank to cut economic
growth forecasts, predicting the economy will grow 1 percent
this year. Citi this week also cut its 2013 growth estimates to
1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Recent events including an even sharper than we had
forecasted depreciation in the rouble, an even more aggressive
reduction in public sector wage growth and, most importantly, a
sharp shock to confidence on the back of the heightened
political tensions ... require a significant change in our
forecasts," Goldman told clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They added however that given the fluidity of the Ukraine
situation and possible policy responses, the margin of errors in
all the forecasts remained large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRINCETON, N.J., March 13, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Advaxis, Inc.
			(Nasdaq:ADXS), a biotechnology company developing the next generation of cancer immunotherapies, today announced that the company will present at the 2nd Annual Sachs Cancer Bio Partnering  Investment Forum on Wednesday, March 19 at the New York Academy of Sciences. Robert G. Petit, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Advaxis, will serve on an expert panel titled "Immunotherapies and Cancer Vaccines" at 11:45am and Daniel J. O'Connor, Chief Executive Officer of Advaxis, will present an update on the Company at 1:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The 2nd Annual Sachs Cancer Bio Partnering  Investment Forum is designed to bring together thought leaders from cancer research institutes, patient advocacy groups, pharma, and biotech to facilitate partnering and investments. Over 200 delegates are expected, with one on one partnering meetings, company presentations, and licensing connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			About Advaxis, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Advaxis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing the next generation of cancer immunotherapies. Advaxis's immunotherapies are based on a novel platform technology using live, attenuated bacteria to stimulate the immune system to selectively target cancer cells while reducing tumor defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	ADXS-HPV, Advaxis's lead immunotherapy for the treatment of HPV-associated cancers, has demonstrated improved survival and objective tumor responses in a Phase 2 trial in 110 patients with recurrent cervical cancer. Advaxis is now planning the registrational program for ADXS-HPV. ADXS-HPV is also being evaluated in other HPV-associated cancers including a Phase 2 in advanced cervical cancer, a Phase 1/2 in head and neck cancer, and a Phase 1/2 in anal cancer. ADXS-HPV has orphan drug status for both anal and head and neck cancers. As part of its global commercialization strategy to enter into regional licensing deals with other market dominant biopharmaceutical companies in territories where there is a high prevalence of HPV-associated cancers, Advaxis has granted exclusive licenses for the development and commercialization of ADXS-HPV in Asia and India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	ADXS-cHER2 is an immunotherapy for the treatment of HER2-overexpressing cancers (such as breast, gastric, esophageal, and other cancers in humans and for osteosarcoma in canines). Advaxis' lead animal-health immunotherapy, ADXS-cHER2, has demonstrated encouraging survival data in a Phase 1 trial in canine osteosarcoma. These data provide the rationale to advance this same immunotherapy into a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with HER2-overexpressing cancers such as breast, gastric, esophageal, and others. The Company is preparing an IND submission for ADXS-cHER2 in the treatment of HER2 overexpressing cancers in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Advaxis has created more than 20 distinct immunotherapies based on its platform, either directly or through strategic collaborations with recognized cancer centers of excellence. We have clinical research collaborations with the University of Pennsylvania, Brown University, the Georgia Regents University Cancer Center, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      Big Data represents a collection of data sets so large and complex that 
      it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tool. 
      It is also unstructured, meaning that it is not tabulated, correlated, 
      etc. (e.g. it does not have a pre-defined data model or is not organized 
      in a pre-defined manner). Big Data technologies enable organizations to 
      handle huge datasets and generate information/insights from them with 
      minimal delay time (sometimes in real-time). Leading companies in Big 
      Data are the already making great strides and will surely represent the 
      forbearers of many great solutions yet to come.

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Since Visa&#8217;s inception, the company&#8217;s success has been dependent on the 
      strength of our client relationships,&#8221; said Charlie Scharf, CEO of Visa 
      Inc. &#8220;Visa&#8217;s future will be defined by our ability to enhance our 
      relationships with merchants with emphasis on delivering products and 
      service that offer greater, tangible value to this critical client

      Mr. Mart&#237;n joins Visa from American Express Company, where he spent 16

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Visa has an ambitious agenda for engaging merchants in new and 
      innovative ways. I am impressed by the energy and talent of the team and 
      the global focus of the work. I am eager to contribute to the 
      development of merchant solutions and continuing to expand Visa&#8217;s 
      payment leadership,&#8221; said Mr. Mart&#237;n.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      after more than 16 years with the organization. Most recently, she has 
      been leading the Global Solutions group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      &#8220;Throughout her career, Elizabeth has worked tirelessly to build a 
      stronger, more effective and engaged Visa,&#8221; said Scharf. &#8220;I am thankful 
      for the foundation she has created for us to work from and wish her

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA, March 13 (Reuters) - Chevron's 
multi-billion dollar Indonesia Deepwater Development (IDD) gas
project is facing a delay of up to 18 months, the country's oil
and gas regulator (SKKMigas) said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The IDD project will be delayed and we're currently taking
steps to alleviate this," SKKMigas chief Johannes Widjonarko
told Reuters in an SMS message. The current schedule for the
project to go into production is 2016, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this may be pushed back by 18 months pending
completion of a tender for the project's floating production
units, said a source at the regulator, who declined to be named
because of the sensitivity of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily production from the project is expected to peak at 1.1
billion cubic feet of natural gas and 31,000 barrels of
condensate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"During 2013, the company received bids for all major
contracts. A final investment decision is planned for 2014, but
is subject to the timing of government approvals," Chevron said
in a recent SEC filing.&lt;/p&gt;

			Goldman Scarlato Karon  Penny, P.C. Announces Investigation of 
      Conn&#8217;s, Inc.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman Scarlato Karon  Penny, P.C. is investigating potential claims 
      on behalf of investors who purchased Conn&#8217;s, Inc. (&#8220;Conn&#8217;s or the 
      "Company") (NASDAQ: CONN) stock between April 3, 2013 and February 19, 
      2014, inclusive (the &#8220;Class Period&#8221;).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The investigation concerns whether Conn&#8217;s and certain of its officers 
      and/or directors violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities 
      Exchange Act of 1934 in connection with statements regarding the 
      Company&#8217;s financial performance and prospects.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Specifically, the Firm is investigating Conn&#8217;s underwriting and 
      collection practices, the risk of bad debt that might have resulted 
      there from, and whether the Company failed to disclose those practices 
      to investors. The Firm is also investigating whether Conn&#8217;s failed to 
      disclose rising customer delinquencies and charge-off rates in its 
      credit segment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On February 20, 2014, Conn&#8217;s reported disappointing quarterly results 
      and lowered its earnings guidance, attributing the decline to a rise in 
      customer delinquencies and charge-offs. On this news, Conn&#8217;s stock price 
      declined 42.85 percent&#8212;erasing more than $860 million of its market 
      value.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      execution of a non-binding Letter of Intent. Under the Letter of Intent, 
      Invisa will acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of Uniroyal 
      Engineered Products and Wardle Storeys Limited in exchange for newly 
      issued shares of Invisa non-convertible preferred stock. The number of 
      current outstanding shares of Invisa common stock will not be altered by 
      the proposed transaction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The acquisition will combine Uniroyal&#8217;s strong presence in the U.S. 
      market and its established Naugahyde&#174; brand name and Wardle 
      Storeys&#8217; strong presence in the UK market into a publicly traded 
      international textured coatings business serving the automotive, 
      industrial, upholstery and healthcare industries. Upon completion of the 
      acquisition, Invisa will have in excess of 500,000 square feet of 
      manufacturing space, 500 employees and approximately $100 million in 
      revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to Edmund C. King, Invisa&#8217;s CEO, &#8220;This is a significant step 
      toward transforming Invisa into a sustainable and profitable growth 
      company. We are thrilled to have the opportunity to bring these strong 
      operating businesses and superior management into Invisa.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Howard R. Curd, CEO of Uniroyal said, &#8220;We are indeed proud of Uniroyal&#8217;s 
      operating history and brand loyalty in the textured coatings industry. 
      With our expansion earlier this year into the UK through our acquisition 
      of Wardle Storeys and the transaction described in the Letter of Intent 
      announced today, I believe that we will be well-positioned to accelerate 
      and maximize potential growth opportunities.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Letter of 
      Intent is subject to numerous material conditions including execution by 
      the parties of a definitive agreement and ongoing due diligence. 
      Accordingly, numerous future events could result in the terms of the 
      Letter of Intent being modified or the proposed transaction being 
      delayed or not being consummated. The principal owner of Uniroyal and 
      Wardle Storeys has voting control of Invisa.

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) - A possible ban on visas for the heads of Russia's two biggest energy firms, Rosneft and Gazprom, may hamper their international partnerships but also harm their Western partners and push the two towards the East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosneft, the world's largest listed oil company by production and reserves, and Gazprom, the top natural gas producer, rely heavily on overseas markets for their sales. Their chief executives travel abroad frequently to promote their businesses and strike deals with international partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany's Bild newspaper reported on Friday that visa bans threatened by the European Union and the United States in retaliation for Russia's seizure of Ukraine's Crimea region would include Gazprom head Alexei Miller and Rosneft head Igor Sechin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European officials earlier said that the EU list includes 120 to 130 names of senior Russian officials who could be subjected to travel bans and asset freezes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Sechin and Miller worked together with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the 1990s and are the members of what is seen as Putin's inner circle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is stupid, petty and obvious sabotage of themselves most of all," Rosneft spokesman Mikhail Leontyev said, when asked about the threat of EU visa sanctions. "I think this would primarily affect Rosneft's business partners in the West in an extraordinary way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller frequently travels to Europe and on Thursday was in Berlin to celebrate an anniversary of cooperation with German utility E.ON.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sechin also travels frequently. Sources at Rosneft said he would embark on a long tour to Asia next week with stops in India, Vietnam, South Korea and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gazprom declined to comment, saying it would wait for an official statement, rather than rely on media speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLOBAL GIANTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disruptions in energy supplies from Russia as a result of a visa ban or other sanctions could lead to a jump in oil and gas prices, which could damage the fragile recovery of the European economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gazprom last year accounted for more than 15 percent of global gas production and reserves and earned export revenues of $163 billion. It controls a third of Europe's gas market. Russia also supplies Europe with a quarter of its oil, mainly from Rosneft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"European business is closely tied up with Rosneft and Gazprom," said Sergei Vakhrameyev, an analyst with Ankorinvest brokerage in Moscow. "If (the visa ban report) is true, it would hamper partnerships between the companies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosneft has agreements with the U.S.'s Exxon Mobil, Italy's ENI and Norway's Statoil on exploring oil and gas in Russia's Arctic. It holds a 50 percent stake in four Ruhr Oel refineries in Germany and 21 percent in Italian refinery Saras. Last December, it agreed to buy much of Morgan Stanley's physical oil-trading business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Deals are in danger of being scrapped (in the case of sanctions)," Vakhrameyev said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western companies with significant interests in Russian energy stand to lose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK's BP owns 19.75 percent of Rosneft. Shell is part of the Gazprom-led Sakhalin-2 project in Russia's Pacific, which includes Russia's sole liquefied natural gas export plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western banks hold most of the $90 billion in combined debts of Rosneft and Gazprom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASIA PUSH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disintegrating relations with the West could push Russia's energy giants further to the East and encourage them to do more business with China, which earlier this year overtook Germany as Russia's single largest oil buyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It impedes (Rosneft/Gazprom's) ability to do some deals and is annoying and uncomfortable, but it isn't crippling," said Bruce Bower, an analyst at Moscow-based hedge fund Verno, about the threat of visa sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that the move would accelerate Russia's tilt toward the Far East, which started with the building of pipelines to China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosneft has been increasing oil exports to China and targets delivery of nearly 1 million barrels per day there, up from around 300,000 bpd last year. The rise in oil exports to Asia has led to cuts in oil exports to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(With additional reporting and written by Megan Davies; editing by Jane Baird)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Supreme Court on Friday ordered Nokia to give a 35 billion rupee ($572.5 million) guarantee before it transfers one of its biggest handset plants to Microsoft Corp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling upheld a lower court verdict over the plant in Chennai, which is the subject of a tax dispute, and had been challenged by the Finnish company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia's case is one of several high-profile tax disputes involving foreign companies in India. Vodafone Group, IBM and Royal Dutch Shell are among foreign groups contesting local tax claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia, which is selling its mobile phones business to Microsoft in a 5.4 billion euro ($7.5 billion) deal, previously agreed to set aside 22.5 billion rupees in an escrow account while it fights the Indian tax authority's claims in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Delhi High Court last month said that Nokia should also commit to paying an additional amount for any future tax claims and waive some of its rights to legal defense as a condition for transferring Indian assets to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft deal, which will allow Nokia to shift its focus to network equipment, is expected to close by the end of this month and Nokia had been keen for a ruling before then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia said in a statement that it was disappointed by Friday's ruling and was considering its options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the plant is not allowed to be transferred, Nokia can run it as a contractor to Microsoft, but not for long, the Finnish company's lawyers have said in court hearings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Nokia chooses to shut down the Chennai plant, it would leave thousands out of work and Microsoft without a key manufacturing site.

&lt;p&gt;By Quentin Webb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lego has trumped Goldman Sachs in the $1.5 billion flotation of cleaning giant ISS. The Danish toymaker&#8217;s owners, the Kirk Kristiansen family, made a minority investment in the group in 2012 to help cut its debt. ISS&#8217;s successful stock-market debut has brought a sparkling return for the Lego latecomers, leaving owners EQT and Goldman in the dust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The March 13 initial public offering of ISS went well. Its stock priced at 160 Danish crowns and closed up 14 percent at 182.7 crowns. EQT, the buyout firm backed by Sweden&#8217;s powerful Wallenbergs, and Goldman&#8217;s private equity gurus, sold 1 million shares at the float price, and may offload 7.7 million in the coming weeks. They retain another 89.5 million shares. So their holdings, plus the 160 million crowns already raised, are now worth 17.9 billion crowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That gives a 2.3 times gross return on the 7.7 billion crowns of equity that EQT and Goldman invested in ISS&#8217;s leveraged buyout in 2005. Neither firm made any further investments into the business, nor did they take dividends out. That means the investment to date has delivered a less-than-stellar 10 percent gross annual rate of return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the investment clients of EQT and Goldman, the return would be even lower due to fees. In typical private equity funds, these can run to 1.75 percent in annual management charges and 20 percent of investment gains. The shares of ISS&#8217;s listed rivals would have been a simpler and more lucrative bet. Investors who bought Sodexo or Compass stock in May 2005 and reinvested dividends have roughly quadrupled or quintupled their money, respectively, Datastream shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For EQT and Goldman, this deal was marred by high debts, and numerous failed attempts at sales or flotations. Contrast that with the rapid profit for the Lego billionaires&#8217; KIRKBI vehicle, and their partners in the 2012 equity injection, the Ontario Teachers&#8217; Pension Plan. The duo&#8217;s 3.7 billion crown investment has turned into stakes worth 6.4 billion crowns: a 41 percent internal rate of return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investing in private companies not long before they go public can backfire. Ask Norway&#8217;s oil fund, which is ruing a move into Formula One. But here it allowed OTPP and KIRKBI to clean up handsomely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Supreme Court on Friday ordered Nokia to give a 35 billion rupees ($572.5 million) guarantee before it transfers one of its biggest mobile phone plants and other assets in the country to Microsoft Corp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling upheld a lower court verdict over the plant in Chennai, which is the subject of a tax dispute, and had been challenged by the Finnish company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia's case is one of several high-profile tax disputes involving foreign companies in India. Vodafone Group Plc, IBM and Royal Dutch Shell Plc are among foreign firms contesting local tax claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia, which is selling its mobile phones business to Microsoft in a 5.4 billion euro ($7.5 billion) deal, last month appealed to the Supreme Court saying the Delhi High Court had imposed new conditions over the transfer after previously lifting a freeze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal, which will allow Nokia to shift its focus to network equipment, is expected to close by the end of this month and Nokia had been keen for a ruling before then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia did not immediately comment after the Supreme Court verdict on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia had agreed at the Delhi High Court to set aside 22.5 billion rupees in an escrow account while it fights the Indian tax authority's claims in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was also asked to give a guarantee for 35 billion rupees more, which the company has said will restrict its ability to contest the tax claims locally and internationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chennai plant is one of Nokia's biggest phone-making factories and the company says it employs 8,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the plant is not allowed to be transferred, Nokia can run it as a contractor to Microsoft but not for long, the Finnish company's lawyers have previously said in court hearings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia was served with a tax demand of about 20.8 billion rupees last year in March. Including the anticipated liability, interest and penalty, the bill could total 210 billion rupees, a lawyer representing the tax office said in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Suchitra Mohanty; Writing by Devidutta Tripathy; Editing by Tom Heneghan)&lt;/p&gt;

      Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield is pleased to announce the winners of 
      the 2013-2014 Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield Get Active, Get Fit 
      School Challenge hosted by Radio Disney. An effort between Anthem and 
      Radio Disney, the #1 radio network for kids, tweens and families, Get 
      Active, Get Fit is designed to motivate kids and families to achieve 
      fitness together by engaging in fun activities. Nearly 40,000 students 
      in Ohio signed up to participate in this, the fifth consecutive year of 
      the statewide program. To successfully complete the challenge, students 
      had to be active for a minimum of 40 of the 55 days during the event, 
      which ran from Sept. 20 through Nov. 23, 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The 20 schools with the highest percentage of participation in the 
      challenge won a live dance party at their school hosted by Radio 
      Disney.&#160;Five schools that completed the challenge and submitted their 
      results were entered into a drawing for new gym equipment packages 
      valued at $500 each. The winning schools of this drawing were: Erwine 
      Elementary, Akron; Holy Trinity School, Avon; Stadium Drive, Boardman; 
      Crestview Elementary, Columbiana; and Dover Elementary, Westlake.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We stuck our toe in the water five years ago to try to reach as many 
      kids as possible with this awesome program, to help combat the high 
      rates of childhood obesity we were seeing in Ohio,&#8221; said Erin 
      Hoeflinger, President of Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Ohio. &#8220;The Get 
      Active, Get Fit School Challenge has touched hundreds of thousands 
      of kids, teachers and their families. I&#8217;m proud to say we&#8217;re making a 
      difference in our children&#8217;s health.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      New this year was the &#8220;Habit Hero&#8221; Family Photo Contest, where during 
      the challenge children and their parents submitted photos of family 
      members engaged in fun, healthy activities to www.GetActiveGetFit.com 
      for a chance to win a trip for four to the Walt Disney World Resort, 
      where they can experience the Habit Heroes interactive exhibit at 
      INNOVENTIONS at Epcot. The Anthem-sponsored Habit Heroes exhibit teaches 
      families to work together to unlock their healthy habit powers of 
      physical activity, nutrition and hydration.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
      approximately 17 percent (or 12.5 million) of children and adolescents 
      aged 2 -19 years are obese. Since 1980, obesity prevalence among 
      children and adolescents has nearly tripled. According to the National 
      Survey of Children&#8217;s Health (NSCH), Ohio ranks 37th in 
      overall prevalence with 33.3 percent of children considered either 
      overweight or obese. The percentage of children ages 6-17 years who 
      participate in four or more days of vigorous physical activity per week 
      is 69.8. Get Active, Get Fit directly impacts these statistics.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nearly 160,000 students nationwide signed up to participate in this 
      year&#8217;s Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield Get Active, Get Fit 
      School Challenge hosted by Radio Disney in Colorado, Georgia, Maine, New 
      Hampshire, Ohio and Upstate New York.&#160;In Ohio, the challenge was

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, March 14 (Reuters) - EU regulators have approved
U.S. food packager Crown Holdings' purchase of Spanish
food can maker Mivisa Envases, the European Commission said on
Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approval is conditional on Crown selling its plants
producing metal cans in Spain as well as Mivisa's metal food
cans plant in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Commission had been concerned that the
acquisition would have meant competition in the market for metal
food cans would have become too weak in Belgium, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, France, Spain and Portugal to prevent price
increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said commitments offered by Crown addressed those issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Banks around the world, consumed with meeting more stringent capital regulations, will miss a deadline to upgrade outdated software for automated teller machines (ATMs) and face additional costs to Microsoft to keep them secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. software company first warned that it was planning to end support for Windows XP in 2007, but only one-third of the world's 2.2 million ATMs which use the system will have been upgraded to a new platform, such as Windows 7 by the April deadline, according to NCR, one of the biggest ATM makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure the machines are protected against viruses and hackers many banks have agreed deals with Microsoft to continue supporting their ATMs until they are upgraded, extra costs and negotiations that were avoidable but are now likely to be a distraction for bank executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are certainly large enterprise customers who haven't finished their migrations yet and are purchasing custom support," a spokesman for Microsoft said, declining to name those customers or to quantify the extra revenue it is earning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The cost will depend on both the specific needs of the customer and what support they already have in place, so it's different for every customer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain's five biggest banks - Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Barclays and Santander UK - either have, or are in the process of negotiating, extended support contracts with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost of extending support and upgrading to a new platform for each of Britain's main banks would be in the region of 50 to 60 million pounds ($100 million), according to Sridhar Athreya, London-based head of financial services advisory at technology firm SunGard Consulting, an estimate corroborated by a source at one of the banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athreya said banks have left it late to upgrade systems after being overwhelmed by new regulatory demands in the wake of the 2007-08 financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They were probably not very serious about the directive that came in from Microsoft. There's a lot of change going on at these banks at this moment in time and they would have seen Windows XP as one more change," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows XP currently supports around 95 percent of the world's ATMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 440,000 - or one-fifth of the world's ATMs - are located in the United States and many of the banks operating them will still be running their ATMs with Windows XP for a while after the April 8 deadline, said Doug Johnson, vice president for risk management policy at the American Bankers Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One thing in our favor is that XP is battle-hardened," Johnson said. "People will benefit from years of fine-tuning of XP...It has been through wars."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STAND IN LINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The queue of banks waiting to upgrade means there aren't enough people to do the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a little bit of a bottle-neck," said Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some banks are using the upgrade as an opportunity to introduce new features to their ATMs such as being able to read cards that have microchips rather than magnetic stripes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks in the United States, where the old-fashioned swipe and sign magnetic stripe credit cards are still in use, have to upgrade their ATMs to read chip cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which has 19,200 ATMs, will start converting its machines to Windows 7 in July, with a goal of finishing by the end of the year. With the change, JPMorgan expects to improve data encryption and ensure machines take software upgrades more efficiently and be offline for less time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for the bank declined to say how much JPMorgan is paying Microsoft for the extended XP coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America also said it would ask Microsoft to extend support for its machines still running on Windows XP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc, which has more than 12,000 ATMs worldwide, said it is in the process of upgrading its machines from XP and declined to give further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Britain, RBS, which has been hit by a succession of IT problems, has agreed a fee with Microsoft in return for it continuing to support its 9,000 ATMs for up to three years, a source familiar with the arrangement told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBS will begin upgrading its ATMs to run on Windows 7 next year and expects to complete the process within three years, the source said. The investment is part of the 1.4 billion pounds each year which new Chief Executive Ross McEwan has committed in order to improve the bank's computer systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McEwan admitted in December that RBS had neglected its technology for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lloyds said it had agreed to pay Microsoft an undisclosed amount to extend support until 2016 while it upgrades its 7,000 ATMs. The bank will start upgrading its ATMs later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HSBC, which has 3,200 ATMs, said it was two years into a three-year programme of upgrades which it expects to complete next year. It had also reached a deal with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays, which has 4,300 ATMs, said it was still negotiating with Microsoft while Santander UK, which has 2,370 ATMs, said it had already agreed a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 0.5982 British pounds)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Bill Rigby in Seattle and Peter Rudegeair in New York.

&lt;p&gt;BERLIN (Reuters) - Visa bans threatened by the European Union and United States should Crimea vote to join Russia in a referendum would target at least 13 Russian politicians and industry leaders including Vladimir Putin's close aides, Germany's Bild newspaper reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visa ban list includes Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, head of the presidential administration Sergei Ivanov, the secretary of the National Security Council Nikolai Patrushev, as well as several of Putin's advisors, Bild said in an advance copy of a report to be published on Saturday. The report cited diplomatic sources in Brussels and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa bans could also be slapped on the chief executive of Russian energy firm Gazprom Alexei Miller, and Igor Sechin, head of Russia's top crude oil producer Rosneft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Alexandra Hudson; Editing by Noah Barkin)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 17 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp Chief Executive
Satya Nadella may unveil an iPad version of the company's Office
software suite on March 27, a source familiar with the event
told Reuters, and use his first big press appearance to launch
the company's most profitable product in a version compatible
with Apple Inc's popular tablet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella, who replaced longtime CEO Steve Ballmer earlier
this year, will address the media and industry executives in San
Francisco on March 27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors for years have urged Microsoft to adapt Office for
mobile devices from Apple and Google Inc, rather than
shackling it to Windows as PC sales decline. But the Redmond,
Washington-based software giant has been reluctant to undermine
its other lucrative franchise, its PC operating software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft gives up some $2.5 billion a year in revenue by
keeping Office off the iPad, which has now sold almost 200
million units, analysts estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech blog Re/code first reported news of Nadella's event.
Microsoft said in an invitation to reporters that Nadella will
discuss "news related to the intersection of cloud and mobile"
but declined to comment on the specifics of the CEO's
appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has had iPad and iPhone versions of Office primed
for several months now, sources told Reuters, but the company
has dallied on their release due to internal divisions, among
other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Nadella is expected to discuss his thinking in
depth next week, the company has already signaled that it will
adopt a more liberal attitude toward putting its software on
different platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said earlier on Monday that it would make OneNote,
its note-taking software, available on Mac, a move interpreted
by observers as a shot against Evernote, the popular note-taking
application that has both Mac and Android compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from Evernote, Microsoft also faces budding challenges
from startups that have released mobile-friendly alternatives to
Word, Excel and Powerpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 17 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp Chief Executive
Satya Nadella may unveil an iPad version of the company's Office
software suite on March 27, a source told Reuters, potentially
using his first major press outing to launch the company's most
profitable product for Apple Inc's popular tablet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nadella, who replaced longtime CEO Steve Ballmer earlier
this year, will address the media and industry executives in San
Francisco on March 27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors for years have urged Microsoft to adapt Office for
mobile devices from Apple and Google Inc, rather than
shackling it to Windows as PC sales decline. But the Redmond
software giant has been reluctant to undermine its other
lucrative franchise, its PC operating software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft gives up some $2.5 billion a year in revenue by
keeping Office off the iPad, which has now sold almost 200
million units, analysts estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech blog Re/code first reported news of Nadella's event.
Microsoft declined to comment on the specifics of the CEO's
appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

more than $4 trillion in assets, performance at its basic value,
large-cap growth product and large-cap value product funds had
improved.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Broad Ecosystem Gives Customers Extensive Choices for Proactive Alerting, Log Analysis and New Levels of Security Intelligence and Rapid Response&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;SUNNYVALE, CA--(Marketwired - Mar 17, 2014) -  Fortinet&#174; (NASDAQ: FTNT) -- a global leader in high-performance network security -- today announced an expansion of its Security Incident and Event Manager (SIEM) ecosystem with AccelOps, IBM and LogRhythm. This ecosystem gives Fortinet customers and resellers a broad choice of solutions providers for delivering broad visibility into data center service availability, performance, security, change management and compliance. Fortinet's SIEM ecosystem is designed to address the unique requirements of a wide range of customers, from large enterprises to managed security service providers (MSSPs) that manage thousands of individual customer environments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"AccelOps, IBM and LogRhythm expand upon and complement Fortinet's existing hardware and software portfolio, which includes the high-performance, enterprise-grade FortiGate platform as well as supporting FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer platforms," said John Maddison, vice president of marketing for Fortinet. "Our customers have indicated they wish to use these partner products in their IT environments, and today's announcement illustrates our ability to fulfill these customer requirements with a high level of integration and compatibility." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AccelOps (key strength: Monitors SIEM, performance and IT infrastructure availability on a single platform)
				AccelOps provides analytics-driven IT Operations Management that integrates SIEM, performance and availability of IT infrastructure and applications on a single platform. The AccelOps monitoring platform is built for highly dynamic and scalable virtualized data centers. It works across private and public clouds as well as traditional data centers to provide comprehensive service health visibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AccelOps' monitoring approach is anchored on patent-pending distributed real-time analytics technology that is extremely efficient at detecting patterns in high-volume IT events and data. Unlike software suites built from disparate applications, AccelOps offer a scalable, high-performance solution that spans server, storage, network, security user, and application domains across an entire infrastructure -- both physical and virtual. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"AccelOps' and Fortinet's combined offering gives businesses the ability to increase service reliability while improving their operational efficiency with a fully integrated data center monitoring solution," said Flint Brenton, president and CEO of AccelOps. "MSSPs need a broad, unified way to monitor, manage and optimize their IT services. AccelOps offers a scalable, high-performance monitoring platform that helps MSSPs reduce costs and improve overall security both in traditional data centers and the cloud." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM (key strength: Combines the power of QRadar SIEM with IBM Security X-Force Threat Intelligence) 
				IBM Security QRadar Security Intelligence Platform consolidates log source event data and network flows natively from thousands of devices, endpoints and applications distributed throughout a network. It performs immediate normalization and correlation activities on raw data to distinguish real threats from false positives. As an option, the software incorporates IBM Security X-Force Threat Intelligence, which supplies a list of potentially malicious IP addresses including malware hosts, spam sources and other threats. IBM Security QRadar SIEM can also correlate system vulnerabilities with event and network data, helping to prioritize security incidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key features include near real-time visibility for threat detection and prioritization, delivering visibility across the entire IT infrastructure. It reduces and prioritizes alerts to focus investigations on an actionable list of suspected incidents. And it enables more effective threat management while producing detailed data access and user activity reports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The IBM QRadar Security Intelligence Platform enables Fortinet customers to perform immediate normalization and correlation activities on raw data to distinguish real threats from false positives," said Michael Loria, Vice President, Business and Corporate Development, IBM. "QRadar SIEM can also correlate system vulnerabilities with event and network data, helping to better prioritize security incidents." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LogRhythm (key strength: Integrates SIEM, Log Management, File Integrity Monitoring and Machine Analytics, with Host and Network Forensics)
				LogRhythm's Security Intelligence Platform uniquely combines next-generation SIEM, log management, file integrity monitoring, network forensics and host forensics in a fully integrated solution that empowers organizations worldwide to detect breaches and today's most sophisticated cyber threats faster and with greater accuracy than ever before. LogRhythm also provides unparalleled compliance automation and assurance as well as IT predictive intelligence to Global 2000 organizations, government agencies and mid-size businesses.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key features include next-generation SIEM, log management; independent host forensics and file integrity monitoring; network forensics with application ID and full packet capture; state-of-the art machine analytics; advanced correlation and pattern recognition; multi-dimensional user /host /network/application behavior anomaly detection; large data set analysis through rapid, intelligent search, pivot, and drill down; analytics-driven countermeasures via LogRhythm's SmartResponse&#8482;; integrated case management; and management-level dashboards.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"LogRhythm's Security Intelligence Platform enables Fortinet customers to get broad, actionable insight into their environments and respond rapidly to potential threats," said Matthew Winter, vice president of business development, LogRhythm. "By integrating with Fortinet's NGFW, LogRhythm dramatically reduces the time needed to investigate and respond to suspicious behavior and advanced threats."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on Fortinet's partner program please visit: http://www.fortinet.com/partners/index.html

Gunzburg, Executive Chairman and Chief Technical Officer of Nuvilex Affiliate SG Austria, Presents at 2014 BioPharma Asia Convention in Singapore&lt;NVLX.PK&gt;</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SILVER SPRING, Md., March 17, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nuvilex, Inc. (OTCQB:NVLX), an international biotechnology company providing cell and gene therapy solutions for the treatment of diseases, announced today that Dr. Professor Walter H. G&#252;nzburg, Chairman and Chief Technical Officer of Nuvilex's partner SG Austria Pte. Ltd., gave a major presentation at the international BioPharma Asia Convention 2014 that was held in Singapore March, 10-13, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Dr. G&#252;nzburg, together with Dr. Brian Salmons, President and CEO of Austrianova Singapore, developed the Cell-in-a-Box&#174; live cell encapsulation technology that can serve as a platform upon which treatments for serious and deadly diseases can be built.&#160;Nuvilex obtained the worldwide exclusive licenses to use the technology for the development of treatments for cancer and diabetes from SG Austria and Austrianova Singapore, respectively, in 2013.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	In his presentation entitled "Cell-in-a-Box&#174; Living Cell Encapsulation Products for Medical and Healthcare Use" given during the Clinical Trials section of the Convention's program, Dr. G&#252;nzburg reviewed the data from the early/mid-phase clinical trials that were done with the combination of Cell-in-a-Box&#174; and the anti-cancer prodrug ifosfamide in patients with advanced inoperable pancreatic cancer; &#160;In those Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, the Cell-in-a-Box&#174;/ifosfamide combination treatment was shown to essentially double the median survival time and percentage of one-year survivors over those seen in historical data for Gemzar&#174; (gemcitabine), the only drug approved to date by the FDA as a single agent for the treatment of the disease.&#160;But unlike Gemzar&#174;, Nuvilex's treatment had no serious treatment-related side effects associated with it because the dose of ifosfamide used in these trials was only one-third of that normally employed for cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The annual BioPharma Asia Convention is the leading event for Asia's biopharmaceutical industry. &#160;The Convention brings together decision makers and influencers from academia, biotech and pharmaceutical companies, contract research organizations and contract medical organizations and gives these individuals a unique opportunity to convene, network and deliberate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Dr. G&#252;nzburg commented, "The lively discussions at the BioPharma Asia Convention underscored the tremendous potential of the Cell-in-a-Box&#174; technology as a means to protect, restrain, store and transport human cells both in clinical applications and in clinical research programs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The CEO and President of Nuvilex, Kenneth L. Waggoner, stated, "Because of the collaboration of Drs. G&#252;nzburg and Salmons for more than a decade, the Cell-in-a-Box&#174; live-cell encapsulation technology has now matured to the point that it will soon see its fulfilment as a platform for the development of treatments for cancer and diabetes. The exposure that Dr. G&#252;nzburg's presentation at the BioPharma Asia Convention gave the technology as a whole, and our pancreatic cancer treatment in particular, can only serve to generate interest as we move to advance the technology for the treatment of patients with this devastating disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

	Nuvilex is a biotechnology company focused on developing and preparing to commercialize treatments for cancer and diabetes based upon a proprietary cellulose-based live-cell encapsulation technology, called Cell-in-a-Box&#174;.&#160;This unique technology will be used as a platform upon which treatments for several types of cancer, including advanced, inoperable pancreatic cancer, and diabetes are being built. &#160;Nuvilex's treatment for pancreatic cancer involves the widely used anticancer prodrug, ifosfamide, together with encapsulated live cells that convert ifosfamide into its active or "cancer-killing" form.&#160;Nuvilex's subsidiary, Medical Marijuana Sciences, Inc., is dedicated to the development of cancer treatments based upon chemical constituents of marijuana known as cannabinoids.&#160;To do so, it will examine ways to exploit the benefits of Cell-in-a-Box&#174; technology in optimizing the anticancer effectiveness of cannabinoids against cancers while minimizing or outright eliminating the debilitating side effects usually associated with cancer treatments.&#160;This provides Medical Marijuana Sciences a unique opportunity to develop "green" approaches to fighting deadly cancers, such as those of the pancreas, brain, breast and prostate, that affect hundreds of thousands of individuals worldwide every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Microsoft withdraws support for Windows XP on April 8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* U.S., UK major banks negotiate fees for extended support&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* 95 percent of world's 2.2 million ATMs run on outdated XP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* One-third of ATMs have been upgraded to Windows 7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Cost of upgrade for each UK bank around $100 million -
sources&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Matt Scuffham and David Henry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON/NEW YORK, March 14 (Reuters) - Banks around the
world, consumed with meeting more stringent capital regulations,
will miss a deadline to upgrade outdated software for automated
teller machines (ATMs) and face additional costs to Microsoft
 to keep them secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. software company first warned that it was planning
to end support for Windows XP in 2007, but only one-third of the
world's 2.2 million ATMs which use the system will have been
upgraded to a new platform, such as Windows 7 by the April
deadline, according to NCR, one of the biggest ATM makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure the machines are protected against viruses and
hackers many banks have agreed deals with Microsoft to continue
supporting their ATMs until they are upgraded, extra costs and
negotiations that were avoidable but are now likely to be a
distraction for bank executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are certainly large enterprise customers who haven't
finished their migrations yet and are purchasing custom
support," a spokesman for Microsoft said, declining to name
those customers or to quantify the extra revenue it is earning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The cost will depend on both the specific needs of the
customer and what support they already have in place, so it's
different for every customer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain's five biggest banks - Lloyds Banking Group
, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Barclays and
Santander UK - either have, or are in the process of
negotiating, extended support contracts with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost of extending support and upgrading to a new
platform for each of Britain's main banks would be in the region
of 50 to 60 million pounds ($100 million), according to
London-based Sridhar Athreya, principle at financial technology
advisers SunGard Consulting Services - an estimate corroborated
by a source at one of the banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athreya said banks have left it late to upgrade systems
after being overwhelmed by new regulatory demands in the wake of
the 2007-08 financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They were probably not very serious about the directive
that came in from Microsoft. There's a lot of change going on at
these banks at this moment in time and they would have seen
Windows XP as one more change," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows XP currently supports around 95 percent of the
world's ATMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 440,000 - or one-fifth of the world's ATMs - are
located in the United States and many of the banks operating
them will still be running their ATMs with Windows XP for a
while after the April 8 deadline, said Doug Johnson, vice
president for risk management policy at the American Bankers
Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One thing in our favour is that XP is battle-hardened,"
Johnson said. "People will benefit from years of fine-tuning of
XP...It has been through wars."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STAND IN LINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The queue of banks waiting to upgrade means there aren't
enough people to do the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a little bit of a bottle-neck," said Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some banks are using the upgrade as an opportunity to
introduce new features to their ATMs such as being able to read
cards that have microchips rather than magnetic stripes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks in the United States, where the old-fashioned swipe
and sign magnetic stripe credit cards are still in use, have to
upgrade their ATMs to read chip cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which has 19,200 ATMs, will start converting its
machines to Windows 7 in July, with a goal of finishing by the
end of the year. With the change, JPMorgan expects to improve
data encryption and ensure machines take software upgrades more
efficiently and be offline for less time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for the bank declined to say how much JPMorgan
is paying Microsoft for the extended XP coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America also said it would ask Microsoft to extend
support for its machines still running on Windows XP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc, which has more than 12,000 ATMs
worldwide, said it is in the process of upgrading its machines
from XP and declined to give further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Britain, RBS, which has been hit by a succession of IT
problems, has agreed a fee with Microsoft in return for it
continuing to support its 9,000 ATMs for up to three years, a
source familiar with the arrangement told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBS will begin upgrading its ATMs to run on Windows 7 next
year and expects to complete the process within three years, the
source said. The investment is part of the 1.4 billion pounds
each year which new Chief Executive Ross McEwan has committed in
order to improve the bank's computer systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McEwan admitted in December that RBS had neglected its
technology for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lloyds said it had agreed to pay Microsoft an undisclosed
amount to extend support until 2016 while it upgrades its 7,000
ATMs. The bank will start upgrading its ATMs later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HSBC, which has 3,200 ATMs, said it was two years into a
three-year programme of upgrades which it expects to complete
next year. It had also reached a deal with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays, which has 4,300 ATMs, said it was still
negotiating with Microsoft while Santander UK, which has 2,370
ATMs, said it had already agreed a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA, March 17 (Reuters) - Indonesia's crude oil output
has dropped to 790,000 barrels per day (bpd) after haze from
forest fires on the island of Sumatra forced the country's
biggest producer, Chevron, to close hundreds of its
wells, the country's oil and gas regulator said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's still below 800,000 bpd, around 790,000 bpd," SKKMigas
spokesman Handoyo Budi Santoso told Reuters on Monday, referring
to the latest national crude output figure from Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santoso also said hundreds of Chevron employees and their
families had been relocated due to the forest fire haze that had
reached dangerous levels last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesia has targeted to produce 870,000 bpd of crude this
year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PORTLAND, Oregon (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co appeased large shareholders who demanded more say in the naming of directors and splitting of the chairman and chief executive officer jobs in the future, persuading them to withdraw a proposal hours before it was to have gone to a vote on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A last-minute change in board guidelines specified that the chairman should be an independent director unless the company justifies it in writing. Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger has also served as chairman since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shareholder deal averted a contest, and investors re-elected Iger and nine other directors at Disney's annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney shareholders had originally been scheduled to vote on a "proxy access" resolution that asked the company to allow large shareholders to nominate board members. The resolution's proponents agreed to withdraw their proposal, according to a regulatory filing from Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger's dual appointment as chairman and chief executive has drawn criticism from some investors and driven support for the proposal. A similar resolution won the support of 40 percent of votes a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest amendment to the guidelines allows for exceptions to the rule, provided the company justifies in writing annually why that would be in the best interests of shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In such cases, Disney said it will also designate one independent director its lead director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The chairman of the board shall in the normal course be an independent director unless the board concludes that, in the light of the circumstances then present when any such decision is made, the best interests of shareholders would be otherwise better served," Disney said in its early morning filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Disney spokesman said on Tuesday that the amendment clarified a standard that the company's board had previously committed to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the shareholder meeting, all current board members were re-elected with at least 92 percent of the vote.

Those issues included an "emphasis on short-term performance with large cash payments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another investor, the Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds, said it reserved the right to re-file the proposal "if the engagement between the co-filers and Disney does not continue to demonstrate transparency on board leadership issues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, shareholders on Tuesday approved the compensation packages for Iger and other executives in a non-binding vote, with support coming from 80 percent of ballots cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CalSTRS voted against that resolution, Duran said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney previously slashed Iger's compensation for fiscal 2013 for the year that ended in October by some 15 percent.

&lt;p&gt;By Lisa Richwine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PORTLAND, Oregon, March 18 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co

			Goldman Scarlato Karon  Penny, P.C. Announces Investigation of Geron 
      Corporation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman Scarlato Karon  Penny, P.C. is investigating potential claims 
      on behalf of investors who purchased Geron Corp. (&#8220;Geron&#8221; or the 
      &#8220;Company&#8221;) (NASDAQ: GERN) stock between June 16, 2013 and March 11, 
      2014, inclusive (the &#8220;Class Period&#8221;), including investors who 
      purchased shares of Geron common stock in the Company&#8217;s January 30, 2014 
      secondary public offering.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The investigation concerns whether Geron and certain of its officers 
      and/or directors violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities 
      Exchange Act of 1934, and provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, in 
      connection with statements regarding prospects for imetelstat, a cancer 
      drug the Company was developing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Specifically, the Firm is investigating the veracity of statements made 
      by or in the name of the Company while Phase 2 clinical studies for 
      imetelstat were underway, in light of certain abnormalities experienced 
      by patients taking part in the study. On March 12, 2014, Geron announced 
      that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) put a full clinical 
      hold on the study. The FDA cited the incidence of chronic liver injury 
      among participants in the study and its concerns about whether liver 
      abnormities caused by imetelstat were reversible. On this news, Geron&#8217;s 
      shares dropped 61 percent, erasing more than $400 million in market 
      value.
    &lt;/p&gt;

second straight session on Tuesday, with the S within 1
percent of its intraday record after comments from Russian
President Vladimir Putin relaxed investors' concerns that
tensions over Ukraine could escalate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gains were broad, with nine of the ten primary S 500
sectors higher on the day. Technology shares, up 1.3
percent, led the advance, buoyed by a rally in Microsoft Corp
.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares rose 4 percent to $39.58, the biggest daily
advance for the software giant since November, and the move took
the stock near $40 a share for the first time since July 2000.
Late Monday, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters that
the company may unveil an iPad version of the company's Office
software suite on March 27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an address to the Russian parliament, Putin said Russia
didn't want Ukraine to be divided further, and that he did not
want to seize more of the country after approving plans to make
Crimea part of Russia following a disputed referendum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, not all market participants were convinced the
relief over Ukraine would continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the triumph of hope over experience," said Brad
McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial in
Waltham, Massachusetts. "I would say investors should be very
cautious. This doesn't seem to be a market that is trading on
longer-term expectations or possibilities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average rose 107.19 points
or 0.66 percent, to 16,354.41, the S 500 gained 13.95
points or 0.75 percent, to 1,872.78 and the Nasdaq Composite
 added 53.093 points or 1.24 percent, to 4,333.042.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the day's advance, the S 500 is less than 1 percent
away from an all-time high hit earlier this month. Over the past
two sessions, the benchmark index has gained about 1.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors were looking ahead to the conclusion of a two-day
meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy-setting committee,
which began as scheduled at 2 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Tuesday. The
central bank is not expected to deviate from previously
announced policy plans, but since the Fed's stimulus has kept a
floor under equity prices, market participants will be attuned
to any hint of a change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the latest economic data, consumer prices rose 0.1
percent in February, as expected, while housing starts fell
modestly from the previous month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In company news, Hertz Global Holdings Inc said it
would spin off its equipment rental business for $2.5 billion
and use part of the proceeds to fund a stock buyback program.
Shares edged up 0.8 percent to $27.43.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nasdaq OMX Group Inc lost 2.6 percent to $38.71.
New York's attorney general urged U.S. stock exchanges and other
venues to limit services that he said provided unfair advantages
to high-frequency traders and undermined confidence in the
markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the Wall Street Journal said Chinese e-commerce
company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd IPO-ALIB.N is leaning toward
listing shares on IntercontinentalExchange Group's New
York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GameStop Corp shares fell 3.5 percent to $38.34 as
the worst performer on the S 500 after Wal-Mart Stores Inc
 said it would allow shoppers to trade in used video
games for anything from groceries to gadgets.

seizure of the Black Sea peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What had been going on in the Ukraine has been weighing on

are apparently moving beyond this," said Joseph Tanious, global
market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While from an economic standpoint the Ukraine doesn't have
a major impact on the global economy, there were worries about
more tension between Russia and western powers, and how far this
kind of standoff could go."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average was up 95.75 points,

	Located on the campus of Naval Support Activity Bethesda, home of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, the world's largest military medical center, the USO Warrior and Family Center at Bethesda is strategically located adjacent to the wounded warrior barracks, known as Tranquility Hall, making it more convenient for wounded, ill and injured troops and their families to get support during their recovery process. At more than 16,000 square feet, the building features dozens of spaces and hundreds of programs and services that support troops and military families including:&lt;/p&gt;
			
		Physical health and recreation
			
		Family strengthening and resilience
			
		Positive behavioral health
			
		Education
			
		Employment
			
		Community reintegration
		&lt;p&gt;
	Like the 20,000 square foot USO Warrior and Family Center at Fort Belvoir, which opened in February 2013, the Bethesda center will be an important structure to help support active duty troops and build hope, resiliency and confidence in the lives of wounded, ill and injured troops, their families and caregivers, on the challenging journey toward recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PORTLAND, Oregon (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co amended guidelines on Tuesday for the selection of its chairman, persuading investors to withdraw a proposal to grant large shareholders more say in electing directors just hours before it was to have gone to a vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last-minute change states that the chairman should be an independent director unless justified in writing. It averted a potential contest, and investors re-elected Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger and nine other directors to the media company's board at its annual shareholder meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney shareholders had been scheduled to vote on a "proxy access" resolution that asked the company to allow large shareholders to nominate board members. The change scrapped that vote, after the resolution's proponents agreed to withdraw their proposal, according to a regulatory filing from Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger's dual appointment as chairman and chief executive, in effect since 2012, has drawn criticism from some investors and driven support for the proposal. A similar resolution won the support of 40 percent of voters a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest amendment to the guidelines allows for exceptions to the rule, provided the company justifies in writing annually why that would be in the best interests of shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In such cases, Disney said it will also designate one independent director its lead director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The chairman of the board shall in the normal course be an independent director unless the board concludes that, in the light of the circumstances then present when any such decision is made, the best interests of shareholders would be otherwise better served," Disney said in its early morning filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Disney spokesman said on Tuesday that the amendment clarified a standard that the company's board had previously committed to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the shareholder meeting, all current board members were re-elected with at least 92 percent of the vote. They include Twitter Inc Co-Founder Jack Dorsey, who joined the board in December, and Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. lawyer on Tuesday appealed a federal judge's ruling that he used fraud to secure a multibillion-dollar pollution judgment against Chevron Corp in Ecuador, a decision that bars him from collecting a $9.5 billion award in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyer Steven Donziger has also asked the judge, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, to put his ruling on hold while a federal appeals court considers the merits of Donziger's challenge, a process that will likely take months to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaplan issued a nearly 500-page decision earlier this month finding that Donziger had used "corrupt means," including bribery, in pursuit of an $18 billion judgment against Chevron in 2011 on behalf of a group of villagers who claimed the oil giant polluted an area of northeastern Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecuador's high court cut the judgment in half to $9.5 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision, which followed a six-week non-jury trial last fall in New York, bars Donziger and the villagers from seeking to collect on the judgment in the United States.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 18 (Reuters) - A U.S. lawyer on Tuesday
appealed a federal judge's ruling that he used fraud to secure a
multibillion-dollar pollution judgment against Chevron Corp
 in Ecuador, a decision that bars him from collecting a

District Judge Lewis Kaplan, to put his ruling on hold while a
federal appeals court considers the merits of Donziger's

finding that Donziger had used "corrupt means," including
bribery, in pursuit of an $18 billion judgment against Chevron
in 2011 on behalf of a group of villagers who claimed the oil

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's shares scaled levels last seen in the dotcom boom following reports that the company plans to unveil an iPad version of its Office software suite, potentially generating billions of dollars in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters reported late on Monday that new Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella would unveil the iPad app at an event on March 27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event will be Nadella's first major public appearance since his appointment last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares rose as much as 5 percent to $39.90 on Tuesday, adding $15 billion to the company's market value. At that price, the stock was up about 10 percent since the announcement of Nadella's appointment on February 4. The shares last touched $40 in July 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has had iPad and iPhone versions of Office primed for several months now, sources told Reuters, but the company has dallied on their release due to internal divisions, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said the lack of an Office version for the iPad may have robbed Microsoft of billions of dollars in revenue. (Reuters Insider: reut.rs/1gC77rr)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We estimate that if 10 percent of the iPad install base were to subscribe to Office then this could add 15 million subscribers and generate $1.1 billion to $1.5 billion in consumer Office subscription revenue per year," Bernstein Research analyst Mark Moerdler said in a note on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors have for years urged Microsoft to adapt Office, its most profitable product, for iPhones and iPads and devices using Google Inc's Android software rather than shackling it to Windows as PC sales decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's productivity tools remain the industry standard in offices, but America's employees are increasingly using smartphone and tablets to supplement their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tired of waiting for Office to be optimized for their touchscreen devices, a growing contingent of younger companies are turning to cheaper touch-friendly apps that can perform word processing and other tasks in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow said the plan to launch the iPad app would signal that Microsoft is moving towards a more serious cross-platform strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernstein's Moerdler said he did not believe that the app would have any significant positive or negative impact on Microsoft's Windows franchise as most corporate customers use Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft already offers Office Online on its Windows smartphones and as a free Web-based version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Inc has been making inroads into Microsoft's Office software business with its free Google Drive application, which includes spreadsheets, presentation and word-processing tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Apple offered free updates for life on its iWork business software, which includes rival applications to Microsoft's Excel, Word and PowerPoint, for MacBooks, Mac computers and iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple also said today it would offer an iPad 4 tablet in place of the mid-range iPad 2 at the same price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tablets based on Apple's iOS platform held 36 percent share of the market in 2013, trailing those based on Google's Android software that had 62 percent share, according to research firm Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares were trading up 4 percent at $39.60 in midday trading on the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Supantha Mukherjee; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)&lt;/p&gt;

      Meeting
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Shareholders of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) at the 2014 Annual 
      Meeting today elected all 10 members of the Board of Directors standing 
      for re-election and supported Board recommendations on the Company&#8217;s 
      auditor, the advisory vote on executive compensation, and an amendment 
      to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, based on preliminary 
      results.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Disney Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert A. Iger welcomed 
      shareholders to the meeting at The Keller Auditorium in Portland and 
      introduced independent Lead Director Orin C. Smith, formerly President 
      and Chief Executive Officer of Starbucks Corporation, and the other 
      members of the Board of Directors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Fiscal 2013 was our third consecutive year of record results,&#8221; Mr. Iger 
      told shareholders.&#160;&#8220;We increased revenue by 7% to a record $45 billion, 
      which led to a record $6.1 billion in net income, up 8% over the year 
      before.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;These results drove total shareholder return of 27% for the year, 
      compared to 20% for the SP 500. And over the last five years, we&#8217;ve 
      delivered total shareholder return of 113%, which is more than double 
      the return generated by the SP 500 for the same period,&#8221; Mr. Iger noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Iger also announced that the next D23 Expo, the ultimate Disney fan 
      event, will take place August 14-16, 2015 in Anaheim, Calif.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Based on preliminary results, all Disney Directors standing for election

      support, and friendship, and I join the entire board in expressing our

&lt;p&gt;(Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Soham Chatterjee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 18 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's shares scaled
levels last seen in the dotcom boom following reports that the
company plans to unveil an iPad version of its Office software
suite, potentially generating billions of dollars in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters reported late on Monday that new Microsoft Chief
Executive Satya Nadella would unveil the iPad app at an event on
March 27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event will be Nadella's first major public appearance
since his appointment last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares rose as much as 5 percent to $39.90 on
Tuesday, adding $15 billion to the company's market value. At
that price, the stock was up about 10 percent since the
announcement of Nadella's appointment on Feb. 4. The shares last
touched $40 in July 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has had iPad and iPhone versions of Office primed
for several months now, sources told Reuters, but the company
has dallied on their release due to internal divisions, among
other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said the lack of an Office version for the iPad may
have robbed Microsoft of billions of dollars in revenue.
(Reuters Insider: reut.rs/1gC77rr)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We estimate that if 10 percent of the iPad install base
were to subscribe to Office then this could add 15 million
subscribers and generate $1.1 billion to $1.5 billion in
consumer Office subscription revenue per year," Bernstein
Research analyst Mark Moerdler said in a note on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors have for years urged Microsoft to adapt Office,
its most profitable product, for iPhones and iPads and devices
using Google Inc's Android software rather than
shackling it to Windows as PC sales decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's productivity tools remain the industry standard
in offices, but America's employees are increasingly using
smartphone and tablets to supplement their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tired of waiting for Office to be optimized for their
touchscreen devices, a growing contingent of younger companies
are turning to cheaper touch-friendly apps that can perform word
processing and other tasks in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow said the plan to launch the
iPad app would signal that Microsoft is moving towards a more
serious cross-platform strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernstein's Moerdler said he did not believe that the app
would have any significant positive or negative impact on
Microsoft's Windows franchise as most corporate customers use
Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft already offers Office Online on its Windows
smartphones and as a free Web-based version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Inc has been making inroads into Microsoft's
Office software business with its free Google Drive application,
which includes spreadsheets, presentation and word-processing
tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Apple offered free updates for life on its iWork
business software, which includes rival applications to
Microsoft's Excel, Word and PowerPoint, for MacBooks, Mac
computers and iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple also said today it would offer an iPad 4 tablet in
place of the mid-range iPad 2 at the same price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tablets based on Apple's iOS platform held 36 percent share
of the market in 2013, trailing those based on Google's Android
software that had 62 percent share, according to research firm
Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares were trading up 4 percent at $39.60 in
midday trading on the Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;PORTLAND, Oregon, March 18 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co
 amended guidelines on Tuesday for the selection of its
chairman, persuading investors to withdraw a proposal to grant
large shareholders more say in electing directors just hours
before it was to have gone to a vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last-minute change stipulates that the chairman should
be an independent director unless justified in writing. It
averted a potential contest later on Tuesday, as investors
prepared to re-elect Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger as
chairman of the board and elect other directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney shareholders had been scheduled to vote on a
resolution that asked the company to allow large shareholders to
nominate board members. The last-minute change scraps that vote,
after the resolution's proponents agreed to withdraw their
proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger's dual appointment as chairman and chief executive, in
effect since 2012, has drawn criticism from some investors and
driven support for the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest amendment to the guidelines allows for exceptions
to the rule, provided the company justifies in writing annually
why that would be in the best interests of shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In such cases, Disney said it will also designate one
independent director its lead director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The chairman of the board shall in the normal course be an
independent director unless the board concludes that, in the
light of the circumstances then present when any such decision
is made, the best interests of shareholders would be otherwise
better served," Disney said in its early morning filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Disney spokesman said on Tuesday that the amendment
clarified a standard that the company's board had previously
committed to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h1&gt;Microsoft ISV Case Study on Ariett Purchase  Expense Management Software&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;PEMBROKE, MA--(Marketwired - Mar 18, 2014) -  Ariett, a leading provider of Cloud Purchase and Expense Management Software, announces today that Microsoft Windows Azure has published an ISV Case Study and &#160;Datasheet on the company and its web-based business software solutions. Ariett joins the ranks of a select group of rapidly growing software companies to be featured by Windows Azure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By selecting the Windows Azure platform, Ariett quickly delivered to customers a cost-effective, feature-rich software solution for Requisition and Purchase Order Management, Travel and Expense Reporting, and Accounts Payable Invoice Automation in the Cloud," said Glenn Brodie, President of Ariett. "We were able to use a single code base to meet the business requirements of both Cloud and on-premises deployments, resulting in choice, affordability, scalability and security for current and future customers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This case study serves a dual purpose: to highlight Ariett's partnership with Windows Azure and to share the resulting benefits for customers. "Customers are able to quickly choose Ariett Purchase and Expense and Ariett Touch in the Azure Cloud because they are familiar with Microsoft products, such as SQL Server Reporting Services and Active Directory, making Windows Azure an easy and secure Cloud destination for business software," said Glenn Brodie. Unlike regional hosting providers, Windows Azure offers customers redundancy, size and capabilities coupled with world class security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft case study also highlights Ariett's support for Windows Azure Active Directory (WAAD). With WAAD, Ariett increases customers' control over user security by allowing IT managers to configure and manage user accounts from a single location. Ariett customers with Active Directory (AD) on-premises can use Microsoft's wizard drive tools to synchronize AD with WAAD. In addition, WAAD ensures a user-friendly experience for employees, who only have to keep track of one password and username to access Ariett and Microsoft apps both on-premises and in the Cloud (Office 365).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Ariett&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ariett is the leading provider of Purchasing and Expense Management Software that reduces costs for organizations and improves employee productivity by&#160;streamlining Requisition and Purchase Order Management, Accounts Payable Automation, and Travel and Expense Reporting on a single platform.

&lt;p&gt;March 18 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's shares scaled
levels last seen in the dotcom boom on Tuesday following reports
that the company plans to unveil an iPad version of its Office
software suite, potentially generating billions of dollars in
revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters reported on Monday that Microsoft Chief Executive
Satya Nadella would unveil the iPad app at an event on March 27
as part of the new CEO's "mobile first cloud first" strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has had iPad and iPhone versions of Office primed
for several months now, sources told Reuters, but the company
has dallied on their release due to internal divisions, among
other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said the lack of an Office version for the iPad may
have robbed Microsoft billions of dollars in revenue. (Reuters
Insider link: reut.rs/1gC77rr)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We estimate that if 10 percent of the iPad install base
were to subscribe to Office then this could add 15 million
subscribers and generate $1.1 billion to $1.5 billion in
consumer Office subscription revenue per year," Bernstein
Research analyst Mark Moerdler said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares rose as much as 5 percent to $39.90. The
stock had last touched $40 in July 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors have urged Microsoft for years to adapt Office,
its most profitable product, for iPhones and iPads and devices
using Google Inc's Android software - rather than
shackling it to Windows as PC sales decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moerdler said he did not believe that the app would have any
significant positive or negative impact on Microsoft's Windows
franchise as majority of corporate customers use Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft already offers Office Online as a free Web-based
version, and on its Windows smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Inc has been making inroads into Microsoft's
Office software business with its free Google Drive application,
which includes spreadsheets and word-processing tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Apple offered free upgrades for life on its iWork
business software, which includes rival applications to
Microsoft's Excel, Word and PowerPoint, for Macbooks, Mac
computers and iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of the Redmond, Washington-based company were trading
at $39.60 on Tuesday morning on the Nasdaq.

Funky Trademark Trend Continues as Procter  Gamble Files Trademark Request for Old Spice Whistle

		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
        Pig Calls and Reality Show Catch Phrases Also Aim for Trademark Protection 
      &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
				ANN ARBOR, MI--(Marketwired - March 18, 2014) - The familiar Old Spice whistle is a decades-old jingle, but owner Procter  Gamble has just now applied to federally register the sound as a trademark. The consumer products giant is joining companies and universities of all sizes in the trend toward registering non-traditional trademarks, according to Michael Spink, an intellectual property attorney who blogs (http://funkymarks.wordpress.com/) and tweets (@funkymarksblog) about unusual trademarks for motion, sound, color, scent, texture, and shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While unusual, Spink says the whistle trademark seems less so when considering both historical and recent non-traditional mark registrations for sound.&#160;For example, the NBC chime (the three notes G, E and C) has been used for more than 50 years, and was registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office in 1971.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, the University of Arkansas' famous 'hog call', a distinctive crowd cheering "Woooooooo. Pig. Sooie! Woooooooo. Pig. Sooie! Woooooooo. Pig. Sooie! Razorbacks!" was recently registered with the trademark office, according to Spink, who is a shareholder in the Ann Arbor office of Brinks Gilson  Lione, one of the nation's largest intellectual property law firms. "In overcoming an initial rejection, the University submitted a substitute specimen, along with evidence of continuous and exclusive use for at least 5 years preceding the application, in order to obtain the trademark registration."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spink notes that while most types of non-traditional marks are registerable in the U.S., they can be more difficult to register than traditional marks, mainly due to the requirement that non-traditional marks be distinctive and non-functional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first hurdle is that all trademarks must be distinctive, that is, capable of distinguishing the owner's goods from those of others; however, certain non-traditional marks such as product configuration, color, scent, flavor and some sound marks can never be inherently distinctive," said Spink. "In these cases, secondary meaning, which is distinctiveness acquired through consumer recognition, must be shown for registration on the Principal Register, which is the primary register of trademarks maintained by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)."&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an example, Spink notes that a recent trademark application for the catch phrase, "Right Here" from the reality television show, Storage Wars, was recently&#160;rejected by the USPTO as not being source-identifying, rather considered by consumers simply as dialogue. Still, Spink notes that rejection doesn't mean the TV show couldn't seek a different mark in the category of 'Entertainment in the nature of live radio personality performances,' perhaps in the auction calling segment of the show. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When non-traditional marks are merely appealing aspects of a product, or simply inherent features, they can only be registered on the principal register with proof of secondary meaning.&#160;For example, the sound emitted by a device in its normal course of operation requires secondary meaning to be accepted for trademark consideration.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when a non-traditional mark is sufficiently distinctive, the functionality doctrine may present a barrier to trademark registration.&#160;The functionality doctrine prevents the owner from limiting competition by trademarking a useful product feature to extend patent-like protection.&#160;Generally, the question asked by the Trademark Office is whether aspects of the design are essential to the use or purpose of the article, or affect the cost or quality of the article.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If a shape of a product enables it to operate, or improves on another design in some way (i.e. cheaper, faster, lighter, stronger), then it cannot be trademarked," said Spink. "Similarly, if a particular color makes a device more visible in an industry where visibility is desired, it cannot be trademarked."&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whistles, pig calls and catch phrases notwithstanding, product packaging is still the most common type of non-traditional trademark registered in the U.S., followed by product configuration, sound and color.&#160;What's next on the trademark horizon?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Scent, texture and flavor trademarks, while increasing, are still fairly rare in the U.S., but I expect that to change over the next five to ten years," said Spink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

			JetPay&#174; Card Services Introduces MAC--
			the 
      Money Access Visa&#174; Prepaid Card
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JetPay&#174; Corporation (&#8220;JetPay&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) (NASDAQ: 
      JTPY), through JetPay Card Services, is pleased to introduce the MAC 
      (Money Access VISA&#174; Prepaid Card). The first phase of the MAC rollout 
      begins today and will focus on employees and employers that are clients 
      of JetPay&#8217;s payroll processing business, JetPay Payroll Services. 
      Employees, friends, and families of these businesses will be invited to 
      make MAC the card that they use to help them with their everyday 
      shopping, budgeting, bill payment or other financial services needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MAC is a general purpose reloadable (GPR) prepaid card that behaves much 
      like a checkless checking account with a compelling value proposition 
      that will have broad appeal to consumers with or without a bank account. 
      MAC has two pricing options which are being offered through JetPay&#8217;s 
      payroll processing channel; MAC One and MAC Choice. MAC One is intended 
      for those individuals that do not have a bank account and are in need of 
      a payment card that can meet their every day purchasing, bill payment 
      and financial services needs. MAC Choice is a perfect choice for those 
      consumers that may have a bank account but need a great tool for 
      budgeting, helping to manage household expenses, saving for that special 
      need, or occasional funding for students. Both cards are reloadable and 
      can accept deposits from employers, tax refunds, government payments and 
      cash through the GreenDot network. Both cards also offer all the 
      features today&#8217;s consumers expect from a leading prepaid card and can 
      help cardholders save check-cashing and money transfer fees as well as 
      give them a safe place to store and spend their money. With pricing at 
      $1 a month or free depending on the option chosen and no swipe fees, MAC 
      is the lowest-priced general purpose prepaid card of its kind available 
      today.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MAC is a vision fulfilled for JetPay&#8217;s founder and Chairman, Bipin C. 
      Shah. Mr. Shah describes his idea for the card as follows: &#8220;I wanted to 
      make banking and purchasing services available equally to everyone in 
      America. As long as the cardholder has access to any of the methods we 
      offer to add funds to the card, they can realize the benefits of having 
      MAC and have the convenience of using MAC anywhere Visa debit is 
      accepted. This saves the cardholder unnecessary check cashing expenses 
      and provides anyone who wants it with a bill payment and shopping card 
      that is safe and secure.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ralph Bianco, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Card 
      Services for JetPay, explains: &#8220;We are focused on developing and 
      launching products that are designed for the takers and not the makers. 
      MAC, as a brand, stands for social responsibility, a firm commitment to 
      offering consumers a high value, high quality and low cost product and 
      an equal commitment to customer service and support. Additional MAC 
      programs are in development that will address the needs of consumers and

			Successful project preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV set 
      to expand in Bayelsa State
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) announced today that it is increasing its 
      support to programs in Nigeria that prevent mother-to-child transmission 
      of HIV (PROMOT), building on initial success in the heart of the Niger 
      Delta. Chevron is committing an additional $1.7 million to the PROMOT 
      Project- sponsored by the nonprofit Pact- to extend the program 
      throughout Bayelsa, the Nigerian state with the third-highest HIV 
      prevalence rate in the country, with the goal of increasing awareness 
      and services that support pregnant women who are HIV positive.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron&#8217;s additional commitment raises its 5-year investment in the 
      PROMOT Project to $5.3 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron&#8217;s partnership with Pact began in 2012, and is part of a larger, 
      multi-organization, $20 million United Nations millennium goal 
      commitment to halt and reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015. Since 
      then, the partnership in Bayelsa state has achieved several important 
      results, including reaching more than 6,500 people with critical 
      HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention information, testing more than 7,000 
      women during prenatal care, and arranging for HIV counseling for nearly 
      700 people.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Chevron is proud to expand our partnership with Pact to support 
      impactful initiatives like PROMOT,&#8221; said Rhonda Zygocki, executive vice 
      president, Policy and Planning for Chevron Corporation. &#8220;This is a 
      proven model that we&#8217;re motivated to expand as we work together to 
      deliver real, measurable results in the effort to end mother-to-child 
      transmission of HIV.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are committed to working with local community based organizations to 
      strengthen their collective capacity to provide critical health services 
      to mothers,&#8221; said John Whalen, president of Pact Institute. &#8220;Capacity 
      development is at the heart of our work because we believe that 
      empowering communities to create and implement their own solutions is 
      what makes development sustainable.&#8221;

      when it joined other U.S. companies to promote education and reduce the

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Hindu nationalist opposition has seized upon a secret report about how the government bungled a war with China more than 50 years ago to batter the ruling party days before an election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India, led by its first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was defeated in the 1962 conflict that was painted at home as Chinese aggression across the Himalayas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But excerpts of a military investigation that were leaked by an Australian journalist who wrote an acclaimed book on the war said the government's policy of forward deployment in the high mountains had increased the chances of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bharatiya Janata Party, which is the front-runner in the election beginning next month, demanded that the government release the report by former army Lieutenant General Henderson Brooks so that the country would know how the government pushed the military into a war it could only lose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What are they trying to hide by making the war report classified ?" BJP spokesman Ravi Shankar Prasad said. "We have a right to know what went wrong. We lost the war because of Nehru."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The party led by prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi has targeted the Nehru-Gandhi family that leads the Congress as a central plank of its campaign platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The military investigation said that in the months leading to the war, Nehru's government ordered the military to patrol and establish posts far into the disputed border as part of a forward policy to deter the Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It held the top military brass also responsible for failing to stand up to the government and tell the politicians that it did not have the resources to support aggressive deployment and that troops would be too thinly spread out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the introduction of the forward policy, the chances of a conflict certainly increased...that this implementation would bring about a major change in the military situation was obvious and it cannot be viewed as being wise after the event," the report leaked by journalist and historian Neville Maxwell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's response was immediate and it began setting up posts of its own and by October 1962 the two countries were at war on both the western and eastern stretches of the Himalayas. It ended the following month with China holding large tracts of what India said was its territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two countries remain locked in the territorial dispute although trade ties have boomed in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our leadership lied to the nation, hid information and lived in a romantic world. Result: War lost, territory lost, also loss of face," Ram Madhav, a senior leader of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological parent of the BJP and the umbrella group of Hindu organizations, said in a Twitter post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BJP has long advocated a tough national security posture towards both China and Pakistan and last month Modi said Beijing must drop its "mindset of expansion".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The defense ministry in a statement rejected calls to release the war report, saying its contents were sensitive and of current operational value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nehru's great grandson, Rahul Gandhi, is leading the Congress campaign in the election next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sanjeev Miglani; Editing by Nick Macfie)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) is selling its physical commodities business to Mercuria for $3.5 billion, the U.S. bank said on Wednesday, sweeping the fast-growing Swiss trading house into the top league of commodities traders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The all-cash transaction for one of the most powerful oil and metals desks on Wall Street is expected to close in the third quarter, JPMorgan said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In documents circulated to potential buyers last year, JPMorgan had valued its physical commodity business at $3.3 billion, with an annual income of $750 million. JPMorgan paid nearly $2 billion to buy the largest part of the business from RBS in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan decided to sell its multibillion-dollar physical commodities division last year because of rising regulatory and political pressure, and so it could concentrate on the bank's core business of lending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our goal from the outset was to find a buyer that was interested in preserving the value of JPMorgan's physical business," said Blythe Masters, head of JPMorgan's global commodities business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it would still provide traditional banking activities in commodities markets, including financial products and the vaulting and trading of precious metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It gave no further details of what exactly would be included in the transaction, but a source close to the matter said the bank's metal brokerage business including its London Metal Exchange (LME) ring dealing team would remain with JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However its Henry Bath metals warehousing unit was included in the deal, the source added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also has sizeable power, natural gas and carbon trading desks, largely operating from London, as well as owning power plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FATE OF JPMORGAN EMPLOYEES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fate of JPMorgan's Masters was too early to tell, the source said, adding that she and her management team had been primarily focused on achieving the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others in the commodities units were waiting to hear about their future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will be interesting to see whether Mercuria will want to keep us on or not, and whether they will attempt to move our desks to Geneva," one trader with the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most of us want to stay here (in London), so I suspect a drive to move us to Geneva would equate to a reduction of our power and gas trading desks," the trader added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many other banks, including Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) and Barclays (BARC.L), have recently scaled back or shut down their power, gas and carbon trading desks, citing unfavorable banking regulation as the main reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, Reuters reported that Mercuria, led by two former Goldman Sachs (GS.N) executives Marco Dunand and Daniel Jaeggi, became the front-runner to buy the physical commodities unit, one of the most powerful oil and metals desks on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EXCLUSIVE TALKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank went into exclusive talks with Mercuria in February. In the weeks before that, the trade house had been competing with Australian bank Macquarie Group (MQG.AX) and private equity manager Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) to buy JPMorgan's unit, sources had said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private and lightly regulated trading houses have benefited most from a major retreat by banks from commodities trading over the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies such as Glencore (GLEN.L) and Russian oil major Rosneft hired whole teams of traders from banks such as Morgan Stanley (MS.N) but Mercuria will become the first trading house to absorb an entire physical division from a bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the news on Wednesday, Democratic U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown, who has been a staunch critic of Wall Street's physical commodity activities, renewed his call for U.S. regulators to clamp down on banks' ownership of metals warehouses, oil pipelines and other commodity assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today's news is a welcome development, but this does not let regulators off the hook," Brown said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Fed, CFTC, and others must enact robust reforms to Wall Street's physical commodities activities and do more to protect end users and consumers of aluminum and other materials."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Chris Peters, Dmitry Zhdannikov and Ron Bousso; Additional reporting by Susan Thomas, Veronica Brown and Henning Gloystein in London and Josephine Mason in New York; Editing by Anna Willard and Lisa Shumaker)&lt;/p&gt;

commodities business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it would still provide traditional banking
activities in commodities markets, including financial products
and the vaulting and trading of precious metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It gave no further details of what exactly would be included
in the transaction, but a source close to the matter said the
bank's metal brokerage business including its London Metal
Exchange (LME) ring dealing team would remain with JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However its Henry Bath metals warehousing unit was included
in the deal, the source added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also has sizeable power, natural gas and carbon
trading desks, largely operating from London, as well as owning
power plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FATE OF JPMORGAN EMPLOYEES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fate of JPMorgan's Masters was too early to tell, the
source said, adding that she and her management team had been
primarily focused on achieving the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others in the commodities units were waiting to hear about
their future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will be interesting to see whether Mercuria will want to
keep us on or not, and whether they will attempt to move our
desks to Geneva," one trader with the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most of us want to stay here (in London), so I suspect a
drive to move us to Geneva would equate to a reduction of our
power and gas trading desks," the trader added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many other banks, including Deutsche Bank, Bank
of America Merrill Lynch and Barclays, have
recently scaled back or shut down their power, gas and carbon
trading desks, citing unfavourable banking regulation as the
main reason&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, Reuters reported that Mercuria, led by two
former Goldman Sachs executives Marco Dunand and Daniel
Jaeggi, became the front-runner to buy the physical commodities
unit, one of the most powerful oil and metals desks on Wall
Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EXCLUSIVE TALKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank went into exclusive talks with Mercuria in
February. In the weeks before that, the trade house had been
competing with Australian bank Macquarie Group and
private equity manager Blackstone Group LP to buy
JPMorgan's unit, sources had said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private and lightly regulated trading houses have benefited
most from a major retreat by banks from commodities trading over
the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies such as Glencore and Russian oil major
Rosneft hired whole teams of traders from banks such as Morgan
Stanley but Mercuria will become the first trading house
to absorb an entire physical division from a bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the news on Wednesday, Democratic U.S. Senator
Sherrod Brown, who has been a staunch critic of Wall Street's
physical commodity activities, renewed his call for U.S.
regulators to clamp down on banks' ownership of metals
warehouses, oil pipelines and other commodity assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today's news is a welcome development, but this does not
let regulators off the hook," Brown said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Fed, CFTC, and others must enact robust reforms to Wall
Street's physical commodities activities and do more to protect
end users and consumers of aluminum and other materials."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chevron Corp is seeking $32.3 million in legal fees from Steven Donziger and others who this month who were found by a judge to have used fraud to obtain a multibillion-dollar pollution judgment against Chevron in Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a filing late on Tuesday, Chevron asked a federal court in New York to order Donziger, a Harvard-educated lawyer, to reimburse it for the cost of bringing its racketeering case against him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Crinklaw, a spokesman for Chevron, said the company was attempting to hold Donziger accountable for bringing what he called a fraudulent case in Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Donziger, Deepak Gupta, said Chevron's "eye-popping" fee request was a "transparent attempt" to intimidate anyone who might be thinking of suing the company for wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 4, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan found that Donziger used bribery and extortion to win the case in Ecuador, which was brought on behalf of people whose land was polluted by Texaco between 1964 and 1992. Chevron later acquired Texaco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaplan found that Donziger bribed the Ecuadorean judge who oversaw the case and who issued an $18 billion judgment against Chevron in 2011. Ecuador's high court cut that award to $9.5 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaplan's ruling, which followed a six-week non-jury trial in New York, bars Donziger and the villagers from attempting to collect on the judgment in the United States. Chevron has said it would seek to use the ruling to bolster challenges to attempts by the villagers to go after its assets in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's fee request came the same day as Donziger appealed the March 4 ruling by Kaplan and asked him to put his order on hold while the appeals court considered the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its court filing Tuesday, Chevron said the $32.3 million in fees included 36,837 hours billed by its lawyers at Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher. Randy Mastro, the lead lawyer for Chevron, most recently billed at a rate of $1,140 an hour, the filings show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mastro was hired in January by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie to conduct an internal inquiry into the scandal involving lane closings at George Washington Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's fee request also reflected 139,747 hours billed by contract attorneys at Huron Consulting Group and Merrill Communications, which provided document review and other tasks, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's Crinklaw declined Wednesday to say how much Chevron had spent overall in litigation over pollution in Ecuador. The company in court papers said the $32.3 million does not reflect all the work performed in connection with the racketeering case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron is seeking to hold Mr. Donziger accountable for his actions by pursuing an award for the legal costs incurred in defending the company from his extortionate scheme and in prosecuting our successful RICO suit," Crinklaw said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta, Donziger's lawyer, said Donziger could not pay the fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Steven is a solo environmental lawyer who works from the kitchen table of his apartment," Gupta said.

&lt;p&gt;BOGOTA, March 19 (Reuters) - Colombia's peso staged its
strongest rally in six months after investment bank J.P. Morgan
announced on Wednesday it will boost the weighting of the
country's peso-denominated debt in two closely followed emerging
market bond indexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a note circulated to investors, J.P. Morgan said it will
introduce five new Colombian Treasury bonds, known as TES, in
its GBI-EM Global Diversified and GBI-EM Global indexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new instruments -  maturing in 2016, 2018, 2022, 2024
and 2028 - will be included in a phased approach over five
month-end periods, starting on May 30 and ending on Sept. 30, it
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, an increased weighting of a country in major
indexes leads to more investment in that nation's securities
since investment fund managers are often judged against the
benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"COP (the Colombian peso) and TES bonds staged a huge rally
after (the J.P. Morgan) announcement," Citibank said in a note.
"The weight increase should generate very significant inflows
into TES bonds. "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colombia's peso strengthened 1.17 percent on
Wednesday to 2007 to the dollar while public debt appreciated
across the entire maturity curve. It was the peso's strongest
appreciation since Sept. 19 last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In announcing the move to boost Colombia's weighting in the
indexes, J.P. Morgan cited "improved transparency and
accessibility for international investors in the local TES
market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the bank said Colombia's participation in J.P.
Morgan's GBI-EM Global Diversified index will rise to 8 percent
up from 3.2 percent previously and in the GBI-EM Global, it will
increase to 5.6 percent from 1.8 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 3, the director of public credit, Michel Janna,
told Reuters in an interview that the country was preparing
reforms to boost sales of its debt to foreign investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janna was referring to the need to make an even deeper cut
to the tax foreigners pay on earnings from debt investments even
after it was slashed to 14 percent from the start of 2013, down
from 33 percent previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That cut raised the proportion of Colombia's debt in foreign
hands to around 7 percent up from 2 percent in 2012, still a
comparatively low figure for the region, Janna said. He added
foreign ownership of Mexican and Peruvian debt is between 40 and
50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janna considers 15 to 20 percent a desirable level of
foreign ownership of the country's public debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colombia's increased weighting may come at the expense of
the that of Turkey, Russia, Thailand, Indonesia and Hungary, the
announcement from the bank warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TES bonds that will be introduced in the bank's indexes
expire on June 2016, November 2018, May 2022, July 2024 and
April 2028.

North African country.

&lt;p&gt;Federica Gagliardi, dubbed the "white lady" by Italy's media, was detained last week by police at Rome's Fiumicino airport who found 24 kg (53 lbs) of cocaine in her carry-on luggage after she stepped off a flight from Caracas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela's state prosecutor said on Wednesday a policeman, a National Guard soldier, and a junior official were arrested at the Simon Bolivar International Airport, as well as the four cafe workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their presumed connection with the trafficking of the drugs seized in Italy was determined by various investigations," the prosecutor said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gagliardi, who is in her early 30s, piqued the curiosity of Italian media when she appeared unexpectedly as Berlusconi's secretary at two summits in Canada during 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her arrest, and the discovery of cocaine with an estimated street value of more than $13 million, was the highest-profile drugs case to involve Venezuela in six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last September, local authorities arrested several National Guard soldiers and airport baggage handlers after 1.3 tonnes of cocaine worth as much as $270 million was found on an Air France plane arriving in Paris from Caracas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three Italians and three Britons were also detained in Paris in what was France's biggest ever cocaine seizure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in this week's case, the vast majority of National Guard members accused by the Venezuelan authorities over that alleged smuggling were low-ranking soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington says Venezuela has "failed demonstrably" to meet its obligations under global counter-narcotics agreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country's location on South America's Caribbean and Atlantic seaboards makes it a preferred route for planes and ships carrying Colombian cocaine to the United States and Europe via Central America and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro says anti-drugs cooperation has actually improved since 2005, when his late mentor Hugo Chavez kicked out U.S. drug enforcement agents whom he accused of spying on his "Bolivarian Revolution".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Daniel Wallis; Editing by Sophie Hares)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CARACAS, March 19 (Reuters) - Venezuelan authorities have
detained seven people, including four young workers at an
airport cafe, in connection with the cocaine smuggling arrest of
an ex-secretary to former Italian Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federica Gagliardi, dubbed the "white lady" by Italy's
media, was detained last week by police at Rome's Fiumicino
airport who found 24 kg (53 lbs) of cocaine in her carry-on
luggage after she stepped off a flight from Caracas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela's state prosecutor said on Wednesday a policeman,
a National Guard soldier, and a junior official were arrested at
the Simon Bolivar International Airport, as well as the four
cafe workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their presumed connection with the trafficking of the drugs
seized in Italy was determined by various investigations," the
prosecutor said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gagliardi, who is in her early 30s, piqued the curiosity of
Italian media when she appeared unexpectedly as Berlusconi's
secretary at two summits in Canada during 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her arrest, and the discovery of cocaine with an estimated
street value of more than $13 million, was the highest-profile
drugs case to involve Venezuela in six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last September, local authorities arrested several National
Guard soldiers and airport baggage handlers after 1.3 tonnes of
cocaine worth as much as $270 million was found on an Air France
plane arriving in Paris from Caracas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three Italians and three Britons were also detained in Paris
in what was France's biggest ever cocaine seizure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in this week's case, the vast majority of National Guard
members accused by the Venezuelan authorities over that alleged
smuggling were low-ranking soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington says Venezuela has "failed demonstrably" to meet
its obligations under global counter-narcotics agreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country's location on South America's Caribbean and
Atlantic seaboards makes it a preferred route for planes and
ships carrying Colombian cocaine to the United States and Europe
via Central America and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro says anti-drugs
cooperation has actually improved since 2005, when his late
mentor Hugo Chavez kicked out U.S. drug enforcement agents whom
he accused of spying on his "Bolivarian Revolution".

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The private equity arm of Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Oak Investment Partners are in talks to sell iHealth Technologies Inc in a deal that could value the medical claims company at more than $1 billion, people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - The big three just became the big four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercuria's purchase of JPMorgan's (JPM.N) physical commodities business marks the culmination of a 10-year journey for Swiss traders Marco Dunand and Daniel Jaeggi, two men who transformed a small trading house into an operation to rival the biggest in the natural resources business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunand and Jaeggi started Mercuria in 2004 when they took a stake in Poland-focused trade house J+S, but buying the largest oil and metals trader on Wall Street for $3.5 billion catapults them into the elite club of global commodity titans, alongside Glencore Xstrata (GLEN.L), Vitol and Trafigura TRAFGF.UL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunand said on Wednesday he and Jaeggi's combined 60-plus years of trading experience, starting at agricultural dealer Cargill before rising through the ranks at storied commodity firms such as Goldman Sachs' (GS.N) J.Aron operation and oil-trader Phibro, had prepared them for the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I could of course tell you that I want to be the king of the world but the reality is we are changing to adapt," Dunand told Reuters. "We want to be fast growing in an ever changing world. Our model is very much between a traditional trading company and a bank."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few would rule out further expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mercuria, named after the Roman god of trade, was growing rapidly even before the JPMorgan purchase. Turnover in 2013 was above $100 billion for the first time, with profit estimated at over $400 million. The firm's current 700-strong headcount will likely expand markedly after the JPMorgan purchase. The bank's physical commodity division currently employs around 600 people, including traders and commercial operators&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total value of the deal was $3.5 billion, JPMorgan said in a statement, slightly higher than the $3.3 billion the bank valued its physical operations in an early prospectus, according to industry sources. The all-cash deal is expected to conclude in the third quarter this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The business includes a large North American energy operation, including vast storage tanks near the Canadian oil sands, substantial gas and electricity trading operations, and a supply and trading deal with one of the largest refiners on the East Coast of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also includes the Henry Bath metals warehousing business, which should help Mercuria's metals trading operation, led by ex-Barclays commodities chief Roger Jones since last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunand said valuing the JPMorgan business, hammered out in New York since the firms entered exclusive talks last month, was an ever-changing target, as it included the bank's stockpiles of industrial metals and oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The complexity of the deal was massive," Dunand said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have to agree on every word in 1,500 pages of documents. And you are buying a moving thing, because JPMorgan's traders keep trading."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEXT MOVES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunand said while the company had no plans to go public like London-listed Glencore (GLEN.L), it was still looking to sell a sizeable stake in the firm to a strategic investor in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That plan, which could see a long-term buyer take as much as 20 percent of Mercuria, was first aired last year, but put on hold while they finalised the JPMorgan deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunand and Jaeggi, both in their early 50s, still own almost one third of Mercuria between them, with around half belonging to senior employees through equity schemes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remaining share remains with J+S's founders, including Grzegorz Jankielewicz and Slawomir Smolokowsk, who focused their business on supplying Polish refiner PNK Orlen with Russian oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The J+S business expanded into shipping Russian oil to China, before Jaeggi and Dunand, fresh from starting U.S. energy firm Sempra's European trading business, were brought on board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2004, shortly after launching Mercuria, Dunand told Reuters "the ultimate step is to have your skin in it," for any trader looking to make their fortune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mercuria has been such a fast growing company that it feels normal to see them expanding this way," said Olivier Jakob, an oil analyst at Petromatrix in Zug, Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In terms of management it is a bigger challenge. It's always a little more challenging to expand the business through acquisition rather than through internal growth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jakob said Dunand and Jaeggi were widely respected as strong leaders, but firms such as Vitol, Glencore and Trafigura would be prepared for the challenge of a newly-expanded rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One question mark hanging over the deal is Mercuria's ability to absorb a large bank team into their existing culture, something JPMorgan initially struggled with after its rapid-fire acquisition strategy at the end of the last decade, including the physically-orientated RBS Sempra business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will be interesting to see whether Mercuria will want to keep us on or not, and whether they will attempt to move our desks to Geneva," one JPMorgan trader in London said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most of us want to stay here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But industry sources say Mercuria has always been keen to hire big-name traders away from banks, a trend that has accelerated since the financial crisis, with Wall Street facing greater restrictions on bonuses and proprietary dealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you look at their biggest hires over the last couple of years they've been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the trend for commodity traders to leave banks for trading houses," said Jake White, head of front-office commodities recruitment at Selby Jennings in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's always a cultural change to get over, especially if anyone is relocating from London to Geneva, but Mercuria are perhaps better placed than most to manage this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMING TO AMERICA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest potential benefits for Mercuria is that the deal will vastly expand its capabilities in North America, where the energy trading landscape has been upended by the shale oil revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pipeline bottlenecks and the growth of crude-by-rail has created numerous opportunities for savvy trading firms to make money by arbitraging price differences on crudes and refined oil products around the continent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan business will give Mercuria one of the largest stakes in the fast-growing U.S. crude-by-rail patch, helping to ship almost a fifth of the shale oil produced in the Bakken fields of North Dakota to Philadelphia Energy Solutions' 350,000 bpd refinery on the U.S. East Coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The so-called "supply and offtake" deal with that plant will also give Mercuria a stronger foothold in the key NY Harbor refined products market, which plays a significant role in setting the price of gasoline, diesel and heating fuel consumed in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In that respect we want to be in the U.S., we want to be part of those plays that the U.S. shale revolution has created," Dunand said. "We want to go into value chains and be in places where we see imbalances."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significantly, Mercuria will get access to the JPMorgan's long-term leases on over 6 million barrels of crude oil storage in Hardisty, Alberta, the heart of Canada's oil sands industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside Mercuria's existing stakes in a Canadian oil sands producer, this could give it greater insight into the region, as booming production and limited pipeline capacity create new trading opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After completing such a large deal with JPMorgan, Dunand is guarded about future plans, but didn't rule out acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I really don't know what the next big step for us could be," Dunand said. "We want to remain flexible. Essentially we are laying out a platform which can quickly react to market changes. There are loads of opportunistic ways of growing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to Reuters shortly after forming Mercuria out of J+S back in 2004, Dunand stated that for him and Jaeggi: "This is the last move."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten years on, it's a promise you can't imagine him making again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov in New York and David Sheppard in London; Additional reporting by Sue Thomas, Henning Gloystein, Ron Bousso and Shadi Bushra in London, editing by David Evans)&lt;/p&gt;

hire big-name traders away from banks, a trend that has
accelerated since the financial crisis, with Wall Street facing
greater restrictions on bonuses and proprietary dealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you look at their biggest hires over the last couple of

perhaps better placed than most to manage this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMING TO AMERICA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest potential benefits for Mercuria is that
the deal will vastly expand its capabilities in North America,
where the energy trading landscape has been upended by the shale
oil revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pipeline bottlenecks and the growth of crude-by-rail has
created numerous opportunities for savvy trading firms to make
money by arbitraging price differences on crudes and refined oil
products around the continent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan business will give Mercuria one of the largest
stakes in the fast-growing U.S. crude-by-rail patch, helping to
ship almost a fifth of the shale oil produced in the Bakken

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan is selling its physical commodities business to Mercuria for $3.5 billion, the U.S. investment bank said on Wednesday, sweeping the fast-growing Swiss trading house into the top league of commodities traders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The all-cash transaction for one of the most powerful oil and metals desks on Wall Street is expected to close in the third quarter, JPMorgan said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In documents circulated to potential buyers last year, JPMorgan had valued its physical commodity business at $3.3 billion, with an annual income of $750 million. JPMorgan paid nearly $2 billion to buy the largest part of the business from RBS in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan decided to sell its multi-billion dollar physical commodities division last year due to rising regulatory and political pressure and so it could concentrate on the bank's core business of lending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our goal from the outset was to find a buyer that was interested in preserving the value of J.P. Morgan's physical business," said Blythe Masters, head of JPMorgan's global commodities business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it would still provide traditional banking activities in commodities markets, including financial products and the vaulting and trading of precious metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It gave no further details of what exactly would be included in the transaction, but a source close to the matter said the bank's metal brokerage business including its London Metal Exchange (LME) ring dealing team would remain with JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However its Henry Bath metals warehousing unit was included in the deal, the source added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also has sizeable power, natural gas and carbon trading desks, largely operating from London, as well as owning power plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MASTERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fate of JPM's Masters was too early to tell, the source said, adding that she and her management team had been primarily focused on achieving the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others in the commodities units were waiting to hear about their future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will be interesting to see whether Mercuria will want to keep us on or not, and whether they will attempt to move our desks to Geneva," one trader with the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most of us want to stay here (in London), so I suspect a drive to move us to Geneva would equate to a reduction of our power and gas trading desks," the trader added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many other banks, including Deutsche Bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Barclays, have recently scaled back or shut down their power, gas and carbon trading desks, citing unfavorable banking regulation as the main reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, Reuters reported that Mercuria, led by two former Goldman Sachs executives Marco Dunand and Daniel Jaeggi, became the front-runner to buy the physical commodities unit, one of the most powerful oil and metals desks on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EXCLUSIVE TALKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank went into exclusive talks with Mercuria in February. In the weeks before that, the trade house had been competing with Australian bank Macquarie Group and private equity manager Blackstone Group LP to buy JPMorgan's unit, sources had said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private and lightly regulated trading houses have benefited most from a major retreat by banks from commodities trading over the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies such as Glencore and Russian oil major Rosneft hired whole teams of traders from banks such as Morgan Stanley but Mercuria will become the first trading house to absorb an entire physical division from a bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Chris Peters, Dmitry Zhdannikov and Ron Bousso; Additional reporting by Susan Thomas, Veronica Brown and Henning Gloystein; Editing by Anna Willard)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h1&gt;BT Achieves Microsoft Lync Server 2013 Integration to Expand Enterprise Unified Communications Services&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;BT Implements Oracle Enterprise Session Border Controller in Four Weeks to Advance Its New Hosted Unified Communications Services&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;REDWOOD SHORES, CA--(Marketwired - Mar 19, 2014) -  Oracle (NYSE: ORCL)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News Summary
				Oracle worked with BT to test Oracle Enterprise Session Border Controller and BT's session initiation protocol (SIP) trunks on Microsoft Lync 2013, providing the companies with new opportunities to deploy innovative unified communications services in enterprise environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News Facts&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Oracle today announced it worked with BT, one of the world's leading providers of communications services and solutions and a platinum-level member of the Oracle Partner Network (OPN), to test Oracle Enterprise Session Border Controller and BT's session initiation protocol (SIP) trunking to support a Microsoft Lync 2013 unified communications environment.
            
				Oracle Enterprise Session Border Controller securely connects Microsoft Lync unified communications services to BT's network, which helps support a smooth migration for enterprises moving to a BT-hosted unified communications offering. &#160;The certification helps broaden the enterprise market segment for BT, which recently completed a global rollout of its unified communications services to a multinational oil company with more than 50,000 end users.
            
				BT customers that implement its SIP trunking service with Oracle Enterprise Session Border Controller and Microsoft Lync 2013 configuration will be able to deploy interactive voice and video communications on a common Internet protocol (IP) backbone, which can help reduce maintenance fees, streamline operations and improve collaboration and worker productivity.&#160;
            
				Oracle Enterprise Session Border Controller can simplify and accelerate SIP trunking deployments through a network provisioning approach that can quickly resolve multi-vendor interoperability issues often found in heterogeneous environments.&#160;The solution also addresses security, reliability and regulatory compliance challenges by protecting and controlling real-time voice, video and unified communications as they traverse IP network borders.
            
				With Oracle Enterprise Session Border Controller, BT can:
            
						Accelerate installation of unified&#160;communications services for new enterprise customers by overcoming&#160;interoperability challenges and supporting tight integration between Microsoft&#160;Lync's enterprise voice features and other IT systems
                
						Maintain highly reliable enterprise&#160;communication services by balancing network loads across SIP trunks and helping&#160;to ensure service quality
                
						Enhance security to protect the service&#160;provider network and enterprise end-users 
					
				
				BT worked with Oracle Communications Consulting, which helped to complete the Oracle Enterprise Session Border Controller implementation, including integration testing with&#160;Microsoft Lync, in an aggressive four-week timeline, which would not be possible without Oracle Communications Consulting team's specific skills and expertise.
					
				
			&lt;p&gt;Supporting Quotes&lt;/p&gt;
			
				"More and more enterprises are seeking ways to leverage the improved functionality of next-generation networks to enhance their unified communications and collaboration platforms.&#160;Thanks to our relationship with Oracle, we can securely and effectively take advantage of this new opportunity," said Andrew Small, vice president, unified communications and customer relationship management (CRM) BT Global Services.
            
						"We are focused on providing our partners and customers with the technology they need to confidently roll out services and functionality without compromising their networks.&#160;We are pleased to work with BT to achieve this integration with its Microsoft Lync environment and help grow its enterprise business," Bhaskar Gorti, senior vice president and general manager, Oracle Communications.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc has won a pay dispute with a former employee known for his role in shorting the U.S. housing market in the run-up to the financial crisis, according to a arbitration ruling this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deeb Salem, who worked on Goldman's mortgage trading desk, had been seeking more than $21 million in compensation as well as legal costs and other penalties, according to the ruling by a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority arbitration panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salem filed the claim last April, and Goldman sought to dismiss it in June. The panel granted Goldman's request on March 17. The document was posted to a Finra database on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salem gained some notoriety after the financial crisis because a U.S. Senate panel included his own performance review for 2007. In the review, he detailed what he described as Goldman's plan to put a "short squeeze" on the mortgage market. He also described himself as an expert trader and said he deserved to be promoted to managing director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am as competitive as Michael Jordan," Salem wrote, according to Senate documents. "I don't just want to win - I want to win every time and I want to steamroll the opposition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his Finra claim against Goldman, Salem said he deserved higher bonuses for 2010 and 2011, and a bonus and deferred compensation that he did not receive for 2012. He left the Wall Street bank that year to take a job at GoldenTree Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman declined to comment on the Finra dispute.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 20 (IFR) - Investors in the new USD350m
payment-in-kind (PIK) bond from Walter Energy are nursing big
losses after the risky security dropped six points immediately
after pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bond plummeted on Wednesday to 94 in cash terms and
stayed down around the same level in the after market Thursday,
leading bankers to say the trade had been mispriced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The six-year PIK toggle, part of the coal company's plan to
push out its debt maturities, priced at par with a 11% cash
coupon and 12% PIK via left lead Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays, Citi, Credit Agricole, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan
and Scotia were also bookrunners on the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The yield-to-worst jumped to around 13.6% after the price of
the bond fell - a level at which the PIK should have initially
priced, one observer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The deal was mispriced and jammed. There is no other
explanation. Bonds only drop like that on the break when they
have been poorly allocated," said one observer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley declined to comment on the PIK's performance,
or to offer any further clarity on how they arrived at the
pricing levels, demand for the deal, or any details on how it
was allocated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others pointed to a negative equity research note published
by BofAML, which cut the price target on the stock to USD2 from
USD8 and contributed to a 20% fall in the company's share price
to USD7.27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that the note was published on Thursday, however, does
not explain Wednesday's bond performance and the general
consensus was that market conditions were unlikely to have been
a factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, other new high-yield issues have been trading up -
including Walter's USD200m first lien add-on, which priced
alongside the PIK at 101.5. Multiplan's USD1bn bond, for
example, carrying similar Triple C ratings and having priced on
Tuesday at par, was bid at 102.5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two investors said left-lead Morgan Stanley had told some
portfolio managers that they would only get allocation on the
add-on, which was doubled in size, if they also bought the PIK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's how it looks to me," said one investor, who played
in the PIK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some investors have clearly sold it immediately, and that's
why it has fallen so dramatically."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the 12% PIK coupon had looked very attractive,
offering a chance to get exposure to a rare name after recent
high-yield deals from sector peers Westmoreland and Arch Coal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We just have to move on," the investor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BREATHING SPACE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, of course, the coal industry faces some tough
headwinds that have already hurt liquidity. For metallurgical
coal companies like Walter Energy, weak global steel production
has been the Achilles heel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The company is very sensitive to met coal, which is very
sensitive to the slowdown in China. Walter was essentially
terming out loans to give themselves enough time for that cycle
to turn (if they're lucky)," said another investor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts at CreditSights recently said Walter was in the
worst shape of the coal producers it covers, with 2.4 years of
cash at its projected burn rate without tapping its revolver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to them, Walter Energy had a cash balance of
USD261m in the fourth quarter of 2013, and they assume a
negative USD109m free cash flow in their analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And overall, they are bearish on the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are continuing our long-held view that coal producers
will underperform the broad HY corporate bond averages and would
prefer to miss the upturn in coal prices than risk further
downside in the bonds," the analysts said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The uncertain outlook had already unnerved some of the
company's lenders, as some decided not to extend the maturity of
the revolver - a move that three market sources said was very
unusual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Moody's, only 82% of the revolver lenders voted
for the amendment, which means the size of the facility will
shrink to USD314m from USD375m until April 2016, and to USD245m
until October 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New leverage covenants on the revolver could also make it
difficult for the company to use unless its situation improves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, even though Walter has pushed out its debt maturities
to 2018, its liquidity position is still fragile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The company will generate negative free cash flows absent a
meaningful recovery in metallurgical coal markets. In addition,
if metallurgical coal prices remain weak, the revolver's
covenants could restrict availability," Moody's said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, Walter has won itself some breathing space with the
USD550m bond deals under its belt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the sale of the second lien PIK - which sits in the
company's capital structure between its first lien 9.5% bonds
and unsecured 2020 and 2021 bonds, yielding a massive 14-15% -
was crucial to refinancing plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before even getting to this stage, the company had to first
get an amendment allowing it to repay its roughly USD406m Term
Loan A maturing over the next two years, without having to
refinance its Term Loan B maturing in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proceeds from the new bonds will repay the TLA, and will
now allow for the company's revolver to be extended by 18
months.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Thursday Steve Luczo stepped down from its board of directors so he can focus on his job as chief executive of digital storage company Seagate Technology Plc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luczo's exit comes just six weeks after the appointment of Satya Nadella as Microsoft chief executive, which Luczo played a key role in as a member of the software company's four-man search committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the CEO search completed and Satya off to a strong start, this felt like an appropriate time to make this change so I can turn my full attention to leading Seagate," said Luczo in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luczo, 57, had been a member of Microsoft's board since May 2012. He was the board's youngest and newest member until the appointment of Mason Morfit last week, and was regarded by Wall Street as one of the more tech-savvy directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has had trouble keeping younger board members recently.

			&#8220;The AHH Effect&#8221; Expands to Explore More Dimensions of Coca-Cola&#8217;s 
      Delicious Refreshment
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To celebrate the multidimensional nature of teens and the refreshing 
      feeling that only comes from a sip of an ice-cold Coke, the brand is 
      rolling out significant expansions and optimizations to &#8220;The AHH Effect&#8221; 
      in its second year, both online and off. The teen-focused effort will 
      build on its history of innovation with several marketing firsts for 
      Coca-Cola in interactive and broadcast media this coming year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Launched as a socially and digitally-led program last April, the 
      campaign will continue to bring to life the feeling of happiness, uplift 
      and delicious refreshment people experience while drinking an ice-cold 
      Coke &#8211; &#8220;The AHH Effect&#8221; &#8211; found within the campaign&#8217;s 61 AHH.com URLs 
      (each experience with one more &#8220;H&#8221; in its URL).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Beginning this week, the campaign&#8217;s first dedicated television ad is 
      airing on teen-favorite networks, including Adult Swim, MTV and MTV2. 
      The 30-second &#8220;Feels Like AHH&#8221; spot is designed to recreate the feeling 
      of drinking a Coke through a fun montage-style music video highlighting 
      a collection of the interactive games, videos and GIFs found within 
      AHH.com.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A second television commercial, &#8220;This is AHH,&#8221; will premiere at the end 
      of April, and will be the first-ever spot produced by Coca-Cola to 
      exclusively feature user-generated content. The brand is inviting teens 
      to submit a short video clip showing what it feels like when they take a 
      sip of Coke &#8211; their own personal expression of AHH &#8211; at AHH.com/thisisAHH 
      or via social media using the hashtag #ThisisAHH. Submissions are being 
      collected until April 10. The entries that best illustrate that 
      indescribable feeling you get from a delicious sip of Coca-Cola will be 
      featured in the commercial.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our efforts to connect with teens through &#8216;The AHH Effect&#8217; exceeded our 
      expectations in 2013. With digital still at the core, we&#8217;re now 
      expanding into real-world activations and TV as the next phase of its 
      evolution,&#8221; said Andy McMillin, Vice President, Coca-Cola Trademark, 
      Coca-Cola North America. &#8220;&#8216;The AHH Effect&#8217; will be everywhere teens will 
      be and we&#8217;re going to connect with them in ways that appeal to their 
      natural curiosity and love of fun, bite-sized content.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola is joining forces with some of teens&#8217; favorite online 
      celebrities to showcase all of its refreshing, energizing and fun 
      qualities on AHH.com and beyond. Content featuring viral dance sensation 
      Marquese Scott and YouTube stars Joe Penna, Kurt Hugo Schneider will 
      live fluidly on AHH.com and other teen-favorite destinations through 
      mobile, digital, connected TV consoles, search, TV, social and more.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      AHH.com has been redesigned and features new experiences that follow the 
      same unique recipe of randomness, creativity and delight that caught 
      teens&#8217; attention in the campaign&#8217;s first year. One of the most popular 
      experiences called &#8220;Cat 
      or Not&#8221; has transformed into the new &#8220;Laser 
      Cats,&#8221; which challenges users to keep a laser beam from an 
      ever-increasing herd of laser-hungry cats. Another, &#8220;Fortune 
      Cookie,&#8221; reminds teens that a refreshing sip of Coke makes you feel 
      like the luckiest person in the world&#160;with an endless supply of fortunes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our mobile-friendly approach really resonated, but we believe it was 
      our willingness to try something new and speak to teens in their 
      language that&#8217;s the real success story here,&#8221; said Jennifer Healan, 
      Group Director, Integrated Marketing Content and Design, Coca-Cola North 
      America. &#8220;The content was at times quirky and light-hearted, but was 
      absolutely crucial to starting a dialogue. And we&#8217;re listening by adding 
      more levels and functionality to the games they love and constantly 
      introducing new content based on their suggestions.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Offline, behind-the-label content featuring &#8220;AHH&#8221; moments will appear on 
      20-ounce Coca-Cola products and at partner locations like AMC Theatres, 
      7-Eleven, McDonalds, Domino&#8217;s Pizza, Simon Malls and Six Flags. Customer 
      experiences will drive fans to various &#8220;AHH&#8221; URLs and will introduce 
      &#8220;AHH&#8221; into new properties like Live Nation.

      Research and Markets: Global Unified Communication as-a-Service Market 
      2012-2016 with Alcatel-Lucent SA., Cisco Systems Inc. and Microsoft 
      Corp. Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/3hqjk9/global_unified) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Unified Communication as-a-Service Market 2012-2016" report to 
      their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysts forecast the Global Unified Communication as-a-service 
      (UCaaS) market to grow at a CAGR of 25.46 percent over the period 
      2012-2016. One of the key factors contributing to this market growth is 
      the increasing need for centralized management. The Global Unified 
      Communication as-a-service (UCaaS) market has also been witnessing the 
      adoption of cloud-based enterprise services. However, the requirement 
      for a high bandwidth could pose a challenge to the growth of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The key vendors dominating this space include Avaya Inc., Alcatel-Lucent 
      SA., Cisco Systems Inc., and Microsoft Corp.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The other vendors mentioned in the report are 8x8 Inc., CSC, Google 
      Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co., IBM Corp., Mitel Networks, PanTerra Networks 
      Inc., ShoreTel Inc., AT and T Inc., British Telecom Group plc., Deutsche 
      Telekom AG, Orange Telecom, Sprint Nextel Corp., Telefonica SA, Telstra 
      Corp. Ltd., and Verizon Wireless.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from the Telecom team said: 'The 
      cost of implementing a new infrastructure is high. Hence, organizations 
      are reluctant to dispose of their existing legacy systems and install 
      new systems. Cloud-based services are developed to help organizations 
      minimize their infrastructure cost. They provide them with a 
      better-quality service and reduce the cost incurred during maintenance, 
      thus increasing the adoption of UCaaS by organizations.'
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers is the increased need 
      for centralized management. UCaaS manages all the administrative tasks 
      in a centralized manner; administrators can perform the task once and 
      the data will be updated at every relevant location. The data can be 
      accessed and information can be communicated without time and location 
      constraints. This improves the reliability of the system and also saves 
      time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one major challenge is the need for high 
      bandwidth to share huge amounts of data through the cloud. As there is a 
      scarcity of high bandwidth, this can hamper the quality of the service 
      provided. This can delay the decision-making process in an organization, 
      which may affect the organization's productivity and therefore adversely 
      affect the growth of the Global UCaaS market.

		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysts forecast the Global PC and Server Power Management Software 
      Market to grow at a CAGR of 35.48 percent over the period 2012-2016. One 
      of the key factors contributing to this market growth is the increased 
      power consumption in the IT industry. The market has also been 
      witnessing the emergence of customized software solutions. However, lack 
      of RD activities could pose a challenge to the growth of this market.

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from the Clean Tech team said: The 
      Global PC and Server Power Management Software market is witnessing 
      intense competition among vendors in terms of prices of product 
      offerings as well as the capacity of vendors to offer end-to-end power 
      monitoring solutions. Moreover, many vendors are providing customized PC 
      and server power management software to remain competitive in the 
      market. Also, vendors are providing customization options to get a 
      better view of the power consumption of critical systems across the IT 
      infrastructure. At the same time, these customized services are mostly 
      provided to large enterprises and service providers. Thus, the emergence 
      of customized software solutions is a new trend that is expected to have 
      a positive impact on the market during the forecast period.

      Research and Markets: Global Customer Experience Management Market 
      2012-2016 with IBM Corp., OpenText Corp., and Oracle Corp. Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/zz44jr/global_customer) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Customer Experience Management Market 2012-2016" report to 
      their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysts forecast the Global Customer Experience Management (CEM) 
      market to grow at a CAGR of 20.79 percent over the period 2012-2016. One 
      of the key factors contributing to this market growth is the increased 
      number of customer touch points. The Global CEM market has also been 
      witnessing a growing demand for mobile analytics. However, integration 
      of multiple communication channels could pose a challenge to the growth 
      of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The key vendors dominating this market space include Adobe Systems Inc., 
      Hewlett-Packard Co., IBM Corp., OpenText Corp., and Oracle Corp.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The other vendors mentioned in the report are Alcatel-Lucent, Amdocs 
      Ltd., Attensity Group inc., Birst Inc., CA Technologies Inc., CDC 
      Software, Chatterplug Inc., Cisco Systems Inc., ClickFox, Corsential 
      ULC, Dax Technologies Corp., Egain communications Corp., Empathica Inc., 
      iPerceptions Inc., Medallia Inc., Microsoft Corp., Riverstar Software 
      Inc., and Webtrends Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from the Enterprise Computing team 
      said: As a result of the increasing penetration of smartphones and 
      tablets in the global market, the traffic to websites through mobiles is 
      increasing. There are various smartphone experience providers, such as 
      Apple, Nokia, Blackberry, and Samsung through which a large number of 
      people access the internet. The increasing amount of website traffic 
      through mobile phones is driving the demand for mobile analytics. In 
      addition, many marketers are now using smartphones in their campaigns to 
      increase website traffic.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers is the increase in the 
      number of customer touch points. In the current business environment, 
      the number of touch points between a customer and an organization has 
      increased. Enterprises are analyzing various responses collected from 
      customer interaction at these touch points. This helps enterprises 
      assess their business condition and develop competitive strategies.

&lt;p&gt;* Philly Fed far stronger than expected in March&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Financial stocks among the day's biggest gainers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Yellen raises uncertainty about timing of rate hike&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Dow up 0.7 pct; S 500 up 0.6 pct; Nasdaq up 0.4 pct

 (Updates to afternoon trading)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ryan Vlastelica&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 20 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Thursday,
boosted by a read on factory activity that was much stronger
than expected, which offset the prospect of an
earlier-than-expected rate hike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street opened lower, but reversed course after the
Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity
index rose far more than expected in March, rebounding after a
contraction in February. In another positive
report, jobless claims rose less than expected in the latest
week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data "shows that fundamentals are getting stronger every
day, and that strength is getting firmer," said Frank Davis,
director of sales and trading at LEK Securities in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial shares, which are tied to the pace of economic
growth, were among Thursday's biggest gainers, with the S
financial sector index up 1.7 percent. JPMorgan Chase &amp;
Co gained 3.5 percent to $60.32, rising above $60 for
the first time since April 2000. Citigroup Inc shot up 2.6
percent to $50.22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT Inc ranked among the top percentage gainers in
both the Dow and the S 500, rising 2.5 percent to $33.78.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her first press conference as chair of the Federal
Reserve, Janet Yellen on Wednesday indicated that the first
increase in interest rates could come in the first half of next
year. She estimated the "considerable period" between the end of
the Fed's stimulus and its first rate increase at possibly six
months. Analysts widely expected a hike in the second half of
2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're trying to decipher her timeframe and get ahead of
it," Davis said. "While we didn't make any drastic changes to
our positions as a result of what she said, we have a tight
watch on her to figure out how she'll play her hand."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average gained 107.66
points, or 0.66 percent, to 16,329.83. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
Index advanced 10.63 points, or 0.57 percent, to
1,871.40. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 15.10 points,
or 0.35 percent, to 4,322.71.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S 500 is within 1 percent of its record closing high,
but volume has been anemic on positive market days, suggesting
limited conviction behind the move. According to the latest
Reuters poll of analysts, the S 500 is expected to end 2014 at
1,950, less than 5 percent above current levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volume is expected to surge on Friday as options expiration
takes place alongside multiple index rebalances. Credit Suisse
estimates $14 billion in gross trading will stem from the S
500 index rebalance, with another $6 billion coming from
rebalancing in other indexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geopolitical concerns stayed in focus as Russian troops
seized two Ukrainian naval bases, including a headquarters in
the Crimean port of Sevastopol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama announced sanctions on Thursday
against prominent Russians, including close allies of President
Vladimir Putin, as Moscow raced to complete its annexation of
Crimea and built up its forces in the region. The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;United States warned Russia that it was on a "dark path" to
isolation in the biggest crisis between the two countries since
the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While few U.S. companies have outsized exposure to the
region, investors are concerned about the fallout from any
escalation in tension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lennar Corp reported a sharp jump in its
first-quarter profit, helped by higher prices. The results came
a day after KB Home posted similarly strong results in a
bullish read on the housing market.In Thursday afternoon
trading, Lennar's shares fell 1.9 percent to $40.56 and KB Home
lost 3 percent to $18.16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jabil Circuit Inc forecast 2015 core earnings above
Wall Street's estimates as the struggling contract electronics
maker expects to recover from the loss of its business with
BlackBerry Ltd . Jabil Circuit's stock slid 2.1
percent to $17.87.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First Solar rose 4.1 percent to $72.27 and was
among the S 500's biggest gainers, building on its jump of
more than 20 percent on Wednesday after the company gave a
strong outlook. The stock is on track for its fifth straight
daily rise, gaining almost 40 percent over that period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the downside, the Nasdaq's gains were limited by weakness
in large-cap internet shares. Amazon.com Inc fell 1.3
percent to $368.46 while Yahoo Inc dropped 1.1 percent
to $38.20.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON, March 20 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp will
report on how it views the risks climate change could pose to
the value of its assets, shareholder activists said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company agreed to publish a report on areas like how it
assesses the risk of "stranded assets" like lower values for its
oil or coal reserves if prices fall, the activists said. In
return they agreed to withdraw a proposed shareholder resolution
calling for such a report at Exxon's upcoming annual meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Exxon spokesman did not immediately return messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activists including the As You Sow foundation and Arjuna
Capital had brought the resolution, similar to those pending at
other energy firms including Chevron Corp and Anadarko
Petroleum Corp. [ ID : nL2N0LH0PB ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danielle Fugere, president of Oakland-based As You Sow, said
that Exxon's move sets a standard other companies could follow.
"That the largest American oil and gas company is the first to
come to the table on this issue says a lot about the direction
that energy markets are taking," Fugere said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resolution filed at Exxon cited studies suggesting that
lower-than-expected demand or prices for fossil fuels might
emerge in coming years, and noted possible responses to climate
change like carbon regulation or market forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Without additional disclosure, shareholders are unable to
determine whether Exxon Mobil is adequately managing these risks
or seizing related opportunities," the resolution stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ross Kerber; Editing by Stephen Powell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Rates J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs, Series 4439 Trust
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the Puttable Tax-Exempt 
      Receipts (PUTTERs) and Derivative Inverse Tax-Exempt Receipts (DRIVERs) 
      of the J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs Trust series listed below:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --PUTTERs, Series 4439 'AAA/F1', Stable Outlook; DRIVERs, Series 4439A-C 
      'AAA', Stable Outlook.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The long-term 'AAA', Stable Outlook ratings assigned to the series 4439 
      PUTTERs and series 4439A-C DRIVERs are based on the ratings that Fitch 
      has assigned to the State of Maryland general obligation bonds, state 
      and local facilities loan of 2014, first series C tax-exempt refunding 
      bonds (rated 'AAA', Stable Outlook) that have been deposited in the 
      series 4439 trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term 'F1' rating assigned to the series 4439 PUTTERs is based 
      on the liquidity facility provided by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (rated 
      'A+/F1', Stable Outlook). The 'F1' rating assigned to the PUTTERs will 
      expire on March 15, 2015, the expiration date of the liquidity facility, 
      unless such date is extended or earlier terminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term rating assigned to the PUTTERs reflects the short-term 
      rating that Fitch maintains on the bank providing liquidity support and 
      will be adjusted upward or downward in conjunction with the short-term 
      rating of the bank, and, in some cases, the long-term rating of the 
      underlying bonds deposited in the trust. The long-term ratings assigned 
      to the PUTTERs and DRIVERs are exclusively tied to the creditworthiness 
      of the underlying bonds deposited in the trust and will reflect all 
      changes to that rating.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, March 20 (Reuters) - JPMorgan commodity
chief Blythe Masters laid out an ambitious plan four years ago
to become the top Wall Street bank in energy and metals trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year Masters achieved that goal, a closely watched
report said on Thursday, the day after the bank announced the
sale of the giant physical commodities operation she had
assembled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK analytics firm Coalition's annual sector league table
showed JPMorgan had the largest revenues of any investment bank
in commodities last year, leapfrogging last year's winner
Goldman Sachs, which was second ahead of Morgan Stanley
.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Masters it is something of a Pyrrhic victory, with the
rump of the business she built now going to Swiss commodities
trader Mercuria in a $3.5 billion deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank announced it was selling its physical commodities
business last summer in the face of unprecedented political and
regulatory pressure after a $410 million settlement with U.S.
regulators over allegations of power market manipulation.
{ID:nL4N0FW4G7]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other pressures also contributed to the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total commodity trading revenues on Wall Street have fallen
by about two-thirds in the last five years, with the top 10
banks notching just $4.5 billion last year, according to an
earlier report by Coalition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is down from more than $14 billion at its peak in 2008,
when the bumper returns earned by sector stalwarts Goldman and
Morgan Stanley encouraged many other banks to expand into energy
and metals trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While JPMorgan was a relative late comer to large-scale
commodities dealing, Masters was the architect of a
multi-billion dollar expansion plan that saw the bank buy or
absorb oil, electricity and metals desks from firms such as Bear
Stearns, UBS, and RBS Sempra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By August 2010, Masters was telling employees that Goldman
and Morgan Stanley should be "scared" of JPMorgan's
newly-expanded commodity operation, Bloomberg reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They'd better be, because this is a platform that's going
to win," Masters said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's own internal review of the business last year
concluded the returns from commodities weren't worth the capital
or regulatory risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source close to the bank said on Thursday it was too early
to say what the future held for Masters, adding that she and her
management team had been primarily focused on achieving the
sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our goal from the outset was to find a buyer that was
interested in preserving the value of JPMorgan's physical
business," Masters said of the sale to Mercuria on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Coalition league tables ranked BNP Paribas,
Barclays and Deutsche Bank as the second
tier of commodity banks, followed by a third tier filled by Citi
, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, UBS and
Credit Suisse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coalition does not rank the banks individually outside of
the top three.

		&lt;h1&gt;SmartMetric Expects Hearing Before Federal Circuit Court to Be Scheduled for May 2014 in Its $13.4 Billion Patent Infringement Lawsuit Over EMV Technology Against Defendants Visa and Mastercard&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Mar 20, 2014) -  SmartMetric, Inc. (OTCQB: SMME) expects that its motions which it has brought in its patent infringement law suit against both Visa and MasterCard to be heard by the US Federal Circuit Court this coming May. If, as expected, the Court's hearing is held in May, then a ruling can be reasonably expected by June 2014, according to SmartMetric's President and CEO Chaya Hendrick. Of course this is a guideline and is subject to scheduling that is yet to be made by the Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SmartMetric is asking the Federal Circuit Court to make a ruling on its motions before the Court that both defendants, Visa and MasterCard are in control of the EMV technology used on the new chip credit and debit cards and therefore are liable as patent infringing parties. In representations to the court Visa and MasterCard have denied they "control" the offending technology therefore should not be held liable. SmartMetric believes this to be a preposterous position of the card company's especially in the light that both company's expert witnesses under oath in deposition have acknowledged that Visa and Mastercard do control the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SmartMetric is the owner of a United States Patent  Trade Mark Office issued patent referred to as the "464" patent in the SmartMetric infringement lawsuit brought by SmartMetric, Inc. against defendants Visa Inc. and MasterCard International covering the use of cards (EMV Cards) that are used to make connections to a network after insertion into a card reader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some millions of EMV cards have already been issued in the United States as part of the ongoing EMV adoption and roll out throughout the USA that has now been accelerated in the light of the Target card security breach. SmartMetric has also asked the Federal Circuit Court to rule on SmartMetric's claim of 25% of the economic benefit flowing from the claimed infringing use of EMV cards in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About SmartMetric
        SmartMetric, Inc. (OTCQB: SMME) is the owner of a USPTO issued patent covering the use of smartcards (EMV cards are smart cards) that connect to networks. The company develops biometric smart cards including EMV and access control cards used for payments, security and identification.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A former employee of Microsoft Corp is facing criminal charges after he allegedly passed trade secrets to a blogger in France, U.S. court documents showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian national Alex Kibkalo, a former Microsoft employee in Lebanon and Russia, admitted to Microsoft investigators that he provided confidential company documents and information to the blogger, documents from a Seattle federal court showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blogger, who was not identified, was known to those in the Microsoft blogging community for posting screenshots of pre-release version of the Windows Operating System. The blogger hid his identity stating falsely that he was from Quebec, according to the documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An internal investigation by Microsoft revealed unauthorized transmissions of proprietary and confidential trade secrets, according to the court documents.

			Pfizer&#8217;s Investigational Vaccine Candidate Bivalent rLP2086 Receives 
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration Breakthrough Therapy Designation for 
      Potential Prevention of Meningococcal B Disease

		&lt;p&gt;
			Pfizer Intends to Submit Biologics License Application for
			Bivalent 
      rLP2086 to U.S. Food and Drug Administration by Mid-2014
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today that the United States Food and 
      Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation 
      to Pfizer&#8217;s vaccine candidate, bivalent rLP2086, currently under 
      investigation for the prevention of invasive meningococcal disease due 
      to Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B in persons 10 &#8211; 25 years of 
      age. Disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B has 
      been estimated at between 20,000 and 80,000 cases per year globally, and 
      can result in death or significant long-term disabilities, including 
      brain damage and hearing loss.1,2
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Enacted as part of the 2012 FDA Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA), 
      Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development 
      and review of potential new medicines for serious and life-threatening 
      diseases.3 A Breakthrough Therapy designation conveys FDA's 
      existing fast track development program features, as well as more 
      intensive FDA guidance on an efficient drug development program.4
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Pfizer is developing this meningococcal B vaccine candidate to help 
      protect adolescents and young adults against a difficult to diagnose and 
      often deadly disease,&#8221; said Dr. Emilio Emini, senior vice president of 
      Vaccine Research and Development for Pfizer Inc. &#8220;We are encouraged by 
      the FDA&#8217;s recognition of the need to prevent meningococcal B disease, 
      and the Breakthrough Therapy designation highlights the urgent need for 
      prevention of meningococcal B disease.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer is conducting a global clinical development program for rLP2086, 
      which includes both Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials evaluating more than 
      20,000 participants, about 14,000 of whom will receive the 
      investigational vaccine.5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 Following 
      interactions that we have had with the FDA, Pfizer intends to submit a 
      Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA for bivalent rLP2086 by 
      mid-2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Invasive meningococcal disease is a rapidly progressing disease that can 
      lead to serious disabilities and can be life-threatening for those 
      infected.2 Of the five meningococcal serogroups (A, B, C, 
      W-135 and Y) that historically have been responsible for the majority of 
      meningococcal disease,13 serogroup B is the only one for 
      which no broadly-protective vaccine is currently approved in the U.S. 
      13,14
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About rLP2086
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer&#8217;s investigational meningococcal B vaccine targets LP2086, or 
      factor H-binding protein, which is found on the surface of the 
      meningococcal B bacterium. The gene for factor H-binding protein is 
      present in the more than 1,800 meningococcal B isolates Pfizer 
      researchers have studied.15
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Breakthrough Therapy designation was based, in part, on data from 
      two clinical trials studying the safety and immunogenicity of rLP2086. 
      Clinical data from a Phase 2 study published in the Lancet Infectious 
      Diseases showed the investigational rLP2086 vaccine induced 
      bactericidal antibodies in healthy adolescents (aged 11-18 years) that 
      were broadly active against meningococcal B bacteria.16 
      Safety data from the study also showed the vaccine had an acceptable 
      safety profile in this healthy adolescent study population and supported 
      the further evaluation of the vaccine in Phase 3 studies.16
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, data from another Phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
      single-blind study of two- and three-dose schedules of rLP2086 in 
      healthy adolescents (aged 11-18 years), showed that the investigational 
      vaccine had an acceptable safety profile.17 Injection site 
      pain was the most common adverse event.17 This study, 
      presented at the Meningitis Research Foundation 2013 meeting, also 
      showed that one month after the last vaccine dose in the two- and 
      three-dose groups, 86-99% (after 3 doses) of subjects and 69-100% (after 
      2 doses) of subjects had hSBA titers (functional antibodies) greater 
      than or equal to 1:8 to each meningococcal B test strain.17 
      The study results supported further evaluation of a three dose regimen 
      in the Phase 3 program.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In November 2012, the Phase 3 program began with the initiation of a 
      large scale safety study. Additional immunogenicity and safety studies 
      are also ongoing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Kevin Allison and Antony Currie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists. The opinions expressed are their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s $3.5 billion sale of its physical commodities business is a perfect example of just how opaque trading is. The bank is selling what is probably a low-return business with regulatory headaches to Mercuria, a privately held firm that does not have to make its financials public. The dearth of details does make it hard to judge, but applying some statistics from both the industry and some rivals suggests Mercuria may be paying top whack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment bank consultants Coalition recently reported commodity revenue at the top 10 investment banks of $4.5 billion in 2013, down from $5.5 billion in 2012. Assume JPMorgan&#8217;s share of that revenue pool is around $1.2 billion and that its net margin runs at around 20 percent, which may be generous. That means the bank run by Jamie Dimon could have made around $240 million of net income on the business last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trading physical commodities accounts for the lion&#8217;s share of the business, but is also less profitable than trading derivatives, for example. So assume the unit for sale brought in $140 million. That would mean Mercuria is paying a hefty 25 times last year&#8217;s earnings for JPMorgan&#8217;s unwanted traders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s a boon for the bank. Commodities is one of the worst-performing businesses on Wall Street at present. In June last year Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman admitted his firm&#8217;s unit was only managing a 5 percent return on equity. That&#8217;s probably as good as it gets for banks, considering Morgan Stanley has what is considered one of the best operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it&#8217;s expensive by the standard of Mercuria&#8217;s publicly traded rivals. Glencore and Noble Group trade at 14 and 16 times trailing earnings respectively, for example. Mercuria bosses Marco Dunand and Daniel Jaeggi should be able to squeeze more out of the business than JPMorgan. Along with other banks, it is facing increased regulatory scrutiny and higher capital requirements for the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Dunand and Jaeggi are still handing over a big premium. And they and the fellow standalone commodity trading giants are being themselves challenged by new competitors and a broad shift of the business onto exchanges which is likely to dent revenue per trade. That makes their acquisition look like a bold move. JPMorgan&#8217;s Dimon, meanwhile, must be breathing a sigh of relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine is in no hurry to impose a visa regime on Russia in response to Moscow's takeover of the Crimea peninsula, Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk was quoted as saying on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We should not be in a hurry with the introduction of a visa regime with Russia...," Yatseniuk's press service said, referring to comments the prime minister made in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Such an initiative by Ukraine is most unlikely to be effective in terms of influencing Russia," he said, adding that the measure could negatively affect Ukrainians living in the predominantly Russian-speaking east of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukraine's Security Council, a body of top officials, decided on Wednesday to impose rules within days to require Russians travelling to Ukraine to obtain visas. Yatseniuk is in Brussels to sign the political part of an association agreement with the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Pavel Polityuk, Writing by Ron Popeski, Editing by Mike Collett-White)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 20 (Reuters) - A former employee of Microsoft Corp
 is facing criminal charges after he allegedly passed
trade secrets to a blogger in France, U.S. court documents
showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian national Alex Kibkalo, a former Microsoft employee
in Lebanon and Russia, admitted to Microsoft investigators that
he provided confidential company documents and information to
the blogger, documents from a Seattle federal court showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blogger, who was not identified, was known to those in
the Microsoft blogging community for posting screenshots of
pre-release version of the Windows Operating System. The blogger
hid his identity stating falsely that he was from Quebec,
according to the documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An internal investigation by Microsoft revealed unauthorized
transmissions of proprietary and confidential trade secrets,
according to the court documents. An email from Kibkalo was
found within the blogger's Hotmail account, establishing that he
shared confidential data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We take protection of our intellectual property very
seriously, including cooperating with law-enforcement agencies
who are investigating potential criminal actions by our
employees or others," a Microsoft spokesman said in an emailed

comment immediately outside regular U.S. business hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court documents said during interviews, the blogger
admitted to posting information on Twitter and his websites and
selling Windows Server activation keys on eBay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Microsoft's investigation, in July and August
2012, Kibkalo uploaded proprietary software including
pre-release software updates of Windows 8 RT and ARM devices, as
well as the Microsoft Activation Server Software Development Kit
(SDK) to a computer in Washington and subsequently to his
personal Windows Live SkyDrive account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft product teams use the SDK in customizing their
product code to ensure proper validation in the product key
activation process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kibkalo, who worked with Microsoft for seven years, received
a poor performance review in 2012 and threatened to resign if
the review was not amended, the documents showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to an FBI agent who was part of the investigation,
Kibkalo has relocated to Russia and based on a LinkedIn account,
he is currently working for another U.S.-based technology
company with offices in Moscow and St. Petersburg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is in USA v. Kibkalo, Case No 2:14-mj-00114-MAT,

      Proposed 2014 Equity Plan

		&lt;p&gt;
      Wintergreen Advisers, LLC details concerns with Coca-Cola&#8217;s proposed 
      2014 Equity Plan in letters to Coca-Cola shareholders and the Coca-Cola 
      Board of Directors and Warren Buffett.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dear Fellow Coca-Cola Shareholders,
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wintergreen Advisers, LLC on behalf of its clients expresses its deep 
      disappointment with Coca-Cola&#8217;s proposed 2014 Equity Plan. As further 
      detailed in the attached letters to the Coca-Cola board of directors and 
      Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett, Wintergreen Advisers believes 
      this plan to be an unnecessarily large transfer of wealth from 
      Coca-Cola&#8217;s shareholders to members of the Company&#8217;s management team. We 
      can find no reasonable basis for gifting management 14.2% of the share 
      capital of Coca-Cola, worth $24 billion at today&#8217;s share price. No 
      matter how well a management team performs, it is unfathomable that they 
      would require such astronomical sums of money to provide motivation. As 
      representatives of the shareholders, it is the number one priority of 
      the board to look after the owners&#8217; interests. This compensation plan 
      appears to place the economic well-being of management far ahead of the 
      interests of the Company&#8217;s owners.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Although the Company has a &#8220;robust&#8221; share repurchase plan, we believe 
      that a large portion of those repurchased shares will likely be 
      allocated to satisfying the issuance demands of the proposed Plan. The 
      purpose of the Company&#8217;s share repurchase plan should be to shrink the 
      number of shares outstanding and increase value on a per share basis, 
      not merely serve to offset share issuance to Company executives. We also 
      believe that Article 13.1 of the 2014 Equity Plan, which allows the 
      Compensation Committee to award shares to management &#8220;purely as a 
      &#8216;bonus&#8217; and not subject to any restrictions or conditions&#8221; is an 
      excessively large amount of power to delegate to a select few members of 
      the board. While such a practice may be an &#8220;industry norm,&#8221; we expect a 
      greater show of leadership from one of the world&#8217;s preeminent 
      corporations. Coca-Cola should be the industry leader for best practices 
      in corporate governance and pay practices; the 2014 Equity Plan clearly 
      falls far short of this bar.

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dear Coca-Cola Board Members,
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On behalf of our clients, Wintergreen Advisers, LLC (&#8220;Wintergreen&#8221;) owns 
      over 2.5 million shares of The Coca-Cola Company (&#8220;Coke,&#8221; &#8220;Coca-Cola,&#8221; 
      or &#8220;the Company&#8221;), Wintergreen Advisers writes today to express our 
      disappointment with the Company&#8217;s proposed 2014 Equity Plan (&#8220;the 
      Plan&#8221;). The Company&#8217;s Board of Directors is asking shareholders to 
      approve an equity compensation plan which, we believe, will 
      significantly erode the per-share value of Coca-Cola shares. If 
      approved, this Plan in conjunction with previous equity compensation 
      plans, will dilute existing shareholders by a Company estimated 14.2%. 
      The Company expects that the 2014 Plan will award a mix of 60% options, 
      40% full value shares, resulting in the issuance of 340,000,000 
      Coca-Cola shares. At the current share price, these shares would be 
      worth approximately $13 billion. In effect, the Board is asking 
      shareholders for approval to transfer approximately $13 billion from all 
      of our pockets to the Company&#8217;s management over the next four years. 
      When combined with awards from previously approved compensation plans, 
      this figure rises to $24 billion. This is a staggering transfer of value 
      from shareholders to management. Shareholders are in effect being asked 
      to give Coca-Cola management, at no cost to management, 14.2% of the 
      Company. These billions of dollars given to management will come at the 
      sole expense of the many teachers, nurses, federal and state government 
      employees, and union members who have invested their hard-earned savings 
      in Coca-Cola shares, either directly or through pensions and mutual 
      funds.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The proposed Plan will meaningfully increase the number of Coca-Cola 
      shares outstanding, reducing the ownership stake of all shareholders in 
      the Company. At a time when Coke is facing slowing growth in both sales 
      and profit, we do not believe it is in the best interest of shareholders 
      to compound the Company&#8217;s headwinds by significantly diluting 
      shareholders. Coca-Cola is a mature business in a low-growth industry. 
      By necessity, a large portion of the Company&#8217;s growth in per-share 
      earnings and value must come from shrinking the number of shares 
      outstanding, so that each share is entitled to a larger share of the 
      Company&#8217;s profits. The Company had been on the path to doing just this, 
      with a share repurchase program totaling 500 million shares, 11% of 
      shares outstanding, announced just 17 months ago. Now instead of 
      meaningfully reducing shares outstanding and growing value on a 
      per-share basis, this share repurchase program will merely help to 
      offset the new shares issued to management under the Plan. Rather than 
      shrinking the number of slices in the pie and increasing the size of 
      each of our slices, management wants to take a $13 billion bite out of 
      the pie at the expense of all shareholders. When the share repurchase 
      program was announced in October 2012, current Coke Chairman and CEO 
      Muhtar Kent said that it &#8220;underscores our continued commitment to 
      delivering increased value to shareholders.&#8221; It now seems that the 
      Company&#8217;s executives are more interested in increasing the value of 
      their own accounts, with shareholders footing the bill.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      From a shareholder's perspective, the details of the Plan itself are not 
      any more appealing than the idea of transferring 14.2% of the Company to 
      management. For example, the Plan allows the Company&#8217;s Compensation 
      Committee to ignore the impact of such things as asset write-downs and 
      impairment, reorganization and restructuring expenses, and extraordinary 
      non-recurring items when determining whether or not management has met 
      their performance goals. Who but management could possibly bear 
      responsibility for these types of expenses, and why should management 
      not equally share the pain of their impact along with shareholders? If a 
      company takes a write-down or impairment charge, it is usually due to 
      past business decisions made by management; why should these decisions 
      then be ignored when it comes time to determine the compensation of 
      those individuals who made those decisions?
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Plan also allows participants to be awarded up to 3,000,000 share 
      options, 3,000,000 stock appreciation rights, and 1,000,000 shares of 
      common stock each year, in addition to their cash compensation. On top 
      of this, the Plan allows the Compensation Committee of the board to 
      grant &#8220;without limitation Shares awarded purely as a &#8216;bonus&#8217; and not 
      subject to any restrictions or conditions.&#8221; This could lead to Coca-Cola 
      executive&#8217;s earnings tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars in a 
      single year. We do not believe there is any justifiable reason to allow 
      for the possibility of such excessive compensation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In summary, Wintergreen Advisers believes the proposed Coca-Cola 2014 
      Equity Plan is a raw deal for all shareholders. It will serve to enrich 
      a small number of Coca-Cola executives, while significantly diluting 
      existing shareholders and diminishing the per-share value of all 
      Coca-Cola shares. Particularly at a time of slowing growth for the 
      Company, shareholders cannot afford to transfer 14% of their ownership 
      in Coca-Cola to management. Coca-Cola remains a world class company with 
      some of the most valuable brands in the world. The economics of the 
      underlying business are as strong as ever. The proposed 2014 Equity 
      Plan, however, presents a headwind that we believe will harm Coca-Cola 
      as an investment. The proposal is an excessive transfer of wealth from 
      its shareholders, the true owners of Coca-Cola, to Company management, 
      and we believe it should be voted down by shareholders.

		&lt;p&gt;
      On behalf of our clients, we are fellow shareholders of Coca-Cola, as 
      well as Berkshire Hathaway. As the largest owner of Coca-Cola stock, you 
      are almost certainly aware that the company is seeking shareholder 
      approval for a new equity compensation plan at their 2014 shareholder 
      meeting. It is our belief that Coca-Cola will be best served by 
      shareholders voting against approval of the new plan, for the reasons 
      laid out below.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Over the course of your career, you have spent a great deal of time 
      discussing the importance of management compensation and proper 
      alignment of management's interests with those of shareholders. The 
      excessive compensation of management and the expense it imposes upon 
      long-term shareholders has been a topic you have frequently touched 
      upon. As you review the details of Coke&#8217;s new equity compensation 
      proposal in their proxy statement, I believe you will find that it 
      contains elements of both misalignment of management and shareholder 
      interests and excessive compensation. This new equity compensation plan, 
      when combined with existing equity compensation plans, could dilute 
      existing shareholders by more than 14% according to Coca-Cola&#8217;s own 
      calculations. You will not need your calculator to estimate the worth of 
      that 14% stake and the value the share issuance could transfer from 
      shareholders to management. It will likely also negate much of the 
      Company&#8217;s current 500 million share repurchase program, making it all 
      the more difficult to grow Coca-Cola&#8217;s value on a per-share basis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On top of the sheer magnitude of dollars of this plan, the proposed plan 
      allows Coca-Cola&#8217;s Compensation Committee to exclude things such as 
      write-downs, impairments and other extraordinary nonrecurring items when 
      deciding whether or not management has met the performance goals 
      required to trigger their pay day. They can, in effect, move the goal 
      posts closer once the ball is in the air. Buried deep within the plan 
      document (and seemingly excluded from the proxy statement itself) is the 
      fact that the proposal also allows the Compensation Committee to award 
      &#8220;bonus&#8221; shares which are &#8220;not subject to any restrictions or 
      conditions.&#8221; This hardly appears to be the &#8220;pay for performance&#8221; type of 
      compensation which is so critical to incentivizing management to create 
      long term per-share value for shareholders.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      You have often decried how excessive compensation is so difficult to 
      reign in precisely because shareholders have no direct voice in the 
      negotiation with management and because Compensation Committees are 
      often comprised of lap dogs rather than Dobermans. In this situation, 
      with Berkshire as the largest shareholder of the company in question, 
      you hold significant sway over the process. We believe Coca-Cola is 
      setting a poor precedent with regard to corporate pay practices with 
      this proposal, and as a leading global corporation, others will 
      inevitably and unfortunately follow their lead.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We believe that the shareholders of Coca-Cola, including Berkshire 
      Hathaway, will be best served by shareholders voting down Coca-Cola&#8217;s 
      Equity Plan proposal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday gave final approval to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's (JPM.N) $218 million settlement to resolve class-action litigation accusing the largest U.S. bank of playing a central role in the huge Ponzi scheme of former client Bernard Madoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan said the accord "easily meets the standards" for final approval, and provides "substantial and immediate" benefits to the swindler's former customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also awarded $18 million of fees to law firms that represented the customers: Entwistle &amp; Cappucci, and Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement was part of a $2.24 billion global resolution of Madoff-related matters by JPMorgan, which was Madoff's main bank for more than 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also agreed to pay $1.7 billion to settle civil claims by the U.S. government, and $325 million to settle claims by Irving Picard, the trustee liquidating Madoff's firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picard has estimated that Madoff customers lost $17.3 billion of principal. Madoff is serving a 150-year prison term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases are Hill et al v. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-07961; and Shapiro et al v. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-08331.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Tom Brown)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h1&gt;Virtru Brings Its Encrypted Email and Privacy Service to Microsoft 365&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;As Microsoft Discloses Internal Surveillance of Outlook.com and Hotmail, Virtru Provides Users With Free Service to Protect Their Email From Unwanted Parties&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, DC--(Marketwired - Mar 21, 2014) -  Virtru, a digital privacy company dedicated to making it simple to keep private communications private, today announced their support for Microsoft Outlook Desktop and Microsoft 365.&#160;Like users of Virtru's Hotmail and Outlook.com service, individuals who add Virtru to Microsoft Outlook Desktop clients and Microsoft 365 will benefit from the rock-solid encryption, government-level data security, and privacy controls Virtru offers.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This news comes on the heels of Microsoft's disclosure that the company monitors the private communications of its email users and is in direct response to email users concerned that their everyday private and business communications are being monitored by unwanted third parties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to US District Court documents released earlier this week, Microsoft monitored the email of a Hotmail user in order to find evidence of Intellectual Property (IP) theft. Microsoft is one of many email providers who now share data on email surveillance, sparking concerns among users regarding the limited privacy of their inboxes. In response, a team of former NSA cryptographers launched Virtru back in January, a free service to encrypt and control email messages and attachments among disparate email systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We understand the capabilities of email companies, network providers, and government agencies in all countries to monitor email communications," said Will Ackerly, former architect of the NSA's cloud security team, and now a co-founder of Virtru. "Without client-side encryption and key management, you might as well be tweeting every email you send."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a TED Talk yesterday NSA Deputy Director Richard Ledgett defended surveillance of mainstream websites, citing the practice in other nations as well. Trying to strike a balance between privacy and security, President Obama meets again today with technology CEOs. Experts agree that the outcome will be more transparency on the rules of surveillance, but that messaging providers will be compelled by court orders to break their own encryption in monitoring communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An innovation of Virtru's end-to-end encryption is that Virtru itself has never has access to content, focusing solely on managing encryption keys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Strong encryption is not a new technology, but it has always been too complex for average users to deploy, especially between disparate email providers, like Hotmail and Gmail," continued Ackerly. "Our mission at Virtru is to embed strong, provable encryption and control into the email programs that most people already use on their computers and smartphones."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Virtru
				Virtru is the first company to make email privacy accessible to everyone.&#160;With a single plug-in, Virtru empowers individuals and businesses to control who receives, reviews, and retains their digital information -- wherever it travels, throughout its lifespan.&#160;The company has set a new standard for digital privacy based on the Trusted Data Format (TDF), created by Virtru Co-Founder Will Ackerly and used by the intelligence community to secure some of the nation's most sensitive data.&#160;Virtru requires no special skills or knowledge, supports all popular email and file types, and can be used on a PC, Mac or mobile device.&#160;To learn more about the company, visit http://www.virtru.com/ and follow @virtruprivacy on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs and world No.1 cablemaker Prysmian will be charged along with France's Nexans and several Japanese cable firms next month by the EU for operating an industry price-fixing cartel, four people with knowledge of the matter said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission's competition authority launched the case with raids on the companies more than five years ago.

&lt;p&gt;By Foo Yun Chee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, March 21 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs and world No.1
cablemaker Prysmian will be charged along with France's Nexans
and several Japanese cable firms next month by the EU for
operating an industry price-fixing cartel, four people with
knowledge of the matter said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Commission's competition authority launched the
case with raids on the companies more than five years ago. It
can fine wrong-doers up to 10 percent of their global turnover
for breaching EU rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Commission's decision is expected to come before Easter
(April 20)," one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities in Japan, South Korea and Australia have already
levied million-dollar fines against cable companies for
anti-competitive practices, and the United States Department of

 via one of its private equity funds in 2005, declined

200-million-euro provision three years ago for a possible fine,
said it did not have any information as to when the European
Commission would give its ruling or what the ruling would be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Nexans said the last exchange the company
had had with the European Commission dated from late 2013, at
which point it had not been informed of any fine or when a
ruling would come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Commission spokesman for competition policy,
Antoine Colombani, also declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources said that Swiss engineering group ABB

      Visa and PULSE Agree on EMV Common Debit Solution
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			EMV Debit Solution Helps Accelerate Chip Technology Adoption in the 
      U.S.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) and PULSE, a Discover Financial Services (NYSE: DFS) 
      company, announced an agreement to enable financial institutions that 
      issue EMV debit cards on both the Visa and PULSE networks to use Visa&#8217;s 
      common debit solution. Visa&#8217;s common application identifier (AID) 
      supports U.S. debit regulations requiring the ability to route 
      transactions over multiple, unaffiliated networks. A common debit 
      solution shared among all participants will help to accelerate EMV chip 
      adoption in the United States and provide a uniform platform that will 
      enable network innovation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It&#8217;s important for the industry to work together, especially when it 
      comes to the adoption of EMV chip,&#8221; said Bill Sheedy, executive vice 
      president of Corporate Strategy and Government Relations, Visa Inc. &#8220;Our 
      common solution is an asset we are making available to the industry free 
      of charge to provide issuers and merchants greater choice among debit 
      networks and enable a streamlined implementation for all parties. The 
      addition of PULSE in Visa&#8217;s EMV common debit solution, which now has 
      been adopted by 4 of the top 5 debit networks, provides a level of 
      clarity that we hope will jump start mainstream adoption of EMV 
      technology for debit in the U.S.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Our network has been EMV-capable since October 2013, which will enable 
      us to support transactions using the Visa common AID with minimal 
      updates to our existing specification,&#8221; said Judith McGuire, executive 
      vice president, Product Management, PULSE. &#8220;With this agreement, 
      merchants and acquirers can develop their systems to support the full 
      range of debit routing options available through PULSE, including PIN, 
      signature and PINless transactions.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Patricia Hewitt, vice president and managing director of consulting 
      services at Mercator Advisory Group said, &#8220;This agreement addresses the 
      uncertainty that has plagued the advancement of EMV for the U.S. debit 
      market and signals that the industry is ready to move forward with the 
      broad adoption of EMV technology among U.S. debit issuers and acquirers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PULSE will use functionality on Visa&#8217;s common AID to facilitate all 
      types of point-of-sale debit transactions on its network. In addition, 
      the agreement enables PULSE to facilitate domestic ATM transactions on 
      its network and provides for issuer choice in the routing of ATM 
      transactions.

			Data from First of Five Phase 3 Studies in Psoriasis to be

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today detailed results from OPT Compare 
      (A3921080), a Phase 3 study of tofacitinib, the first in a new class of 
      treatment, oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, the safety and efficacy 
      of which are being investigated for the treatment of adults with 
      moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Top-line results from OPT 
      Compare were previously announced in October 2013. This is the first of 
      five studies from the Phase 3 Oral treatment Psoriasis Trial (OPT) 
      Program, one of the largest global clinical trial programs in 
      moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis to date. The results of OPT 
      Compare showed that in a step-down procedure design, tofacitinib 10 mg 
      twice daily (BID) was non-inferior to high-dose ENBREL&#174; 
      (etanercept) 50 mg twice weekly (BIW), and tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily 
      did not meet the non-inferiority criteria compared to high-dose ENBREL. 
      No new safety signals for tofacitinib were observed in the OPT Compare 
      study. Detailed results of this study are being presented as an oral 
      presentation during the Latest in Dermatology Research Symposium at the 
      72nd American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting held in 
      Denver, at 9:45 a.m. MDT today.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are pleased to present the detailed results of OPT Compare, the 
      first Phase 3 trial showing non-inferiority of an oral small molecule, 
      tofacitinib, versus an injected biologic agent, ENBREL, in psoriasis. 
      The results demonstrated that tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily had similar 
      efficacy to high-dose ENBREL 50 mg twice weekly,&#8221; said lead author Herv&#233; 
      Bachelez, M.D., Ph.D., Sorbonne Paris Cit&#233; Universit&#233; Paris Diderot, 
      Department of Dermatology, APHP H&#244;pital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      OPT Compare is a 12-week, non-inferiority study comparing the efficacy 
      and safety of tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg BID to high-dose ENBREL 50 mg 
      BIW, the approved starting dose for ENBREL for the first 12 weeks, and 
      placebo for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe 
      chronic plaque psoriasis. The results of the study showed that 
      tofacitinib 10 mg BID was non-inferior to high-dose ENBREL 50 mg BIW as 
      measured by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 response and 
      Physician&#8217;s Global Assessment (PGA) response. The proportion of patients 
      that achieved a PASI75 response at week 12 was: tofacitinib 10 mg BID: 
      63.6 percent; ENBREL 50 mg BIW: 58.8 percent; tofacitinib 5 mg BID: 39.5 
      percent; placebo: 5.6 percent. The proportion of patients that achieved 
      &#8220;clear&#8221; or &#8220;almost clear&#8221; in PGA at week 12 were: tofacitinib 10 mg BID: 
      68.2 percent; ENBREL 50 mg BIW: 66.3 percent; tofacitinib 5 mg BID: 47.1 
      percent; placebo: 15.0 percent. Tofacitinib 5 mg BID did not meet the 
      non-inferiority criterion of 15 percent difference compared to high-dose 
      ENBREL as measured by PASI75.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The efficacy and safety profile of tofacitinib in this study was 
      expected based on what was seen in the Phase 2 clinical trial and dose 
      modeling. Rates of selected safety events of special interest in the 
      study patient population, including serious infections, herpes zoster, 
      non-melanoma skin cancer and cardiovascular events, were below 1 percent 
      and similar for all active treatment groups (both tofacitinib arms and 
      the ENBREL arm). The most frequent adverse events across active 
      treatment groups were infections (most commonly nasopharyngitis and 
      upper respiratory tract infections). Injection site reactions were more 
      frequent among patients receiving active ENBREL treatment compared with 
      the tofacitinib and placebo arms, whereas increases in cholesterol and 
      creatine phosphokinase were more common in tofacitinib recipients.

      The detailed OPT Compare study results mark the completion of the first 
      Phase 3 trial for tofacitinib in psoriasis. Top-line results for the 
      second completed study, OPT Retreatment (A3921111), were previously 
      announced in October 2013, and detailed results will be presented at a 
      future scientific meeting. Top-line results from two of the three 
      remaining trials in the Phase 3 Oral treatment Psoriasis Trial (OPT) 
      Program, the OPT Pivotal 1 and OPT Pivotal 2 trials (A3921078 and 
      A3921079), are anticipated in the second quarter of 2014, and these four 
      studies, in addition to a long-term extension study, will form the 
      planned psoriasis submission package to regulatory authorities.

		&lt;p&gt;
      OPT Compare was a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, 
      placebo-controlled 12-week non-inferiority study comparing the efficacy 
      and safety of tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg BID to high-dose ENBREL 
      (etanercept) 50 mg BIW and placebo (oral tablet and subcutaneous 
      injection) for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe 
      chronic plaque psoriasis who had an inadequate response to, intolerance 
      to, or contraindication to conventional systemic therapy. Patients that 
      previously failed treatment with a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor 
      were excluded from this study. There were 1,106 patients enrolled in 
      this study in 23 countries outside of the U.S. and Canada (three Latin

			About the OPT Clinical Trial Program
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Phase 3 OPT clinical trial program consists of five studies 
      (including one open-label, long-term extension study) evaluating oral 
      tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg BID in adults with moderate-to-severe chronic 
      plaque psoriasis. It is a global, multi-study, comprehensive clinical 
      development program that includes over 3,600 patients in 36 countries, 
      and is one of the largest global clinical trial programs in 
      moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis to date. The OPT Program is 
      designed to specifically evaluate tofacitinib in moderate-to-severe 
      chronic plaque psoriasis, and to support an independent assessment of 
      the benefit: risk profile of tofacitinib in this particular patient 
      population. In addition to OPT Compare, the OPT Program includes the 
      following Phase 3 studies of tofacitinib in psoriasis:

				OPT Retreatment (A3921111): A phase 3 randomized, mixed-blind, 
        three-period, parallel group, placebo-controlled study evaluating the 
        efficacy and safety of the withdrawal and retreatment with tofacitinib 
        5 mg and 10 mg BID compared to placebo in adult patients with 
        moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis.
      
			
				OPT Pivotal #1 (A3921078) and OPT Pivotal #2 (A3921079): Two

        placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies evaluating the safety and 
        efficacy of tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg BID. The primary objectives of 
        the studies are to compare the efficacy of tofacitinib to placebo for 
        the reduction in severity of plaque psoriasis as measured by the 
        proportion of patients achieving a PGA response of &#8220;clear&#8221; or &#8220;almost 
        clear,&#8221; at week 16, and the proportion of patients achieving PASI75 
        relative to baseline at week 16, as well as to evaluate the safety and 
        tolerability of tofacitinib over 52 weeks.
      
			
				OPT Extend (A3921061): An open-label long-term extension study 
        evaluating the safety and tolerability of tofacitinib. Patients who

			About Plaque Psoriasis
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated skin disease, affecting the skin 
      and other organs, such as nails and joints. It affects approximately 
      two-to-three percent of people worldwide and 7.4 million in the United 
      States.1,2,3,4,5,6,7 Due to inconsistent response to 
      treatment, adverse effects, and the limited persistence of therapeutic 
      effects of some systemic therapies, a need for additional therapies for 
      patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis still remains.8,9,10 
      According to a recent survey, approximately 50 percent of patients with 
      psoriasis are dissatisfied with their treatment, and under-treatment 
      represents a significant problem. Even though guidelines typically state 
      that moderate-to-severe patients are candidates for systemic therapy, 
      many treated adult plaque psoriasis patients appear to be undertreated, 
      with approximately 30 percent of treated moderate patients and 22 
      percent of treated severe patients receiving only topical therapy in the 
      U.S.11

			About XELJANZ&#174; (tofacitinib citrate)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Tofacitinib is approved in several markets around the world for the 
      treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients who had an inadequate 
      response to existing therapies. The brand name for tofacitinib is XELJANZ&#174; 
      (ZEL&#8217; JANS&#8217;).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      XELJANZ (tofacitinib citrate) 5 mg tablets is a prescription medicine 
      called a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. XELJANZ is used to treat adults 
      with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis in which 
      methotrexate did not work well.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        It is not known if XELJANZ is safe and effective in people with 
        Hepatitis B or C.
      
			
        XELJANZ is not for people with severe liver problems.
      
			
        It is not known if XELJANZ is safe and effective in children.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Important Safety Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				XELJANZ can lower the ability of the immune system to fight 
        infections. Some people have serious infections while taking XELJANZ, 
        including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, 
        or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died 
        from these infections. Healthcare providers should test patients for 
        TB before starting XELJANZ, and monitor them closely for signs and 
        symptoms of TB and other infections during treatment. People should 
        not start taking XELJANZ if they have any kind of infection unless 
        their healthcare provider tells them it is okay.
			
			
				XELJANZ may increase the risk of certain cancers by changing the 
        way the immune system works. Malignancies were observed in clinical 
        studies of XELJANZ.
			
			
        The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to 
        initiating XELJANZ in patients with chronic or recurrent infection; 
        who have been exposed to tuberculosis; with a history of a serious or 
        an opportunistic infection; who have resided or traveled in areas of 
        endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or with underlying conditions 
        that may predispose them to infection.
      
			
        Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation 
        (e.g., herpes zoster), was observed in clinical studies with XELJANZ.
      
			
        Use of live vaccines should be avoided concurrently with XELJANZ. 
        Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines 
        prior to initiating XELJANZ therapy.
      
			
        Some people who have taken XELJANZ with certain other medicines to 
        prevent kidney transplant rejection have had a problem with certain 
        white blood cells growing out of control (Epstein Barr 
        virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder).
      
			
        Some people taking XELJANZ get tears in their stomach or intestines. 
        This happens most often in people who also take nonsteroidal 
        anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or methotrexate. 
        Patients should tell their healthcare provider right away if they have 
        fever and stomach-area pain that does not go away, or a change in 
        bowel habits. XELJANZ should be used with caution in patients who may 
        be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients 
        with a history of diverticulitis).
      
			
        XELJANZ can cause changes in certain lab test results including low 
        blood cell counts, increases in certain liver tests, and increases in 
        cholesterol levels. Healthcare providers should do blood tests before 
        starting patients on XELJANZ and while they are taking XELJANZ, to 
        check for these side effects. Normal cholesterol levels are important 
        to good heart health. Healthcare providers may stop XELJANZ treatment 
        because of changes in blood cell counts or liver test results.
      
			
        Use of XELJANZ in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not 
        recommended.
      
			
        Patients should tell their healthcare providers if they plan to become 
        pregnant or are pregnant.
      
			
        It is not known if XELJANZ will harm an unborn baby. To monitor the 
        outcomes of pregnant women exposed to XELJANZ, a registry has been 
        established. Physicians are encouraged to register patients and 
        pregnant women are encouraged to register themselves by calling 
        1-877-311-8972.
      
			
        Patients should tell their healthcare providers if they plan to 
        breastfeed or are breastfeeding. Patients and their healthcare 
        provider should decide if they will take XELJANZ or breastfeed. They 
        should not do both.
      
			
        In carriers of the hepatitis B or C virus (viruses that affect the 
        liver), the virus may become active while using XELJANZ. Healthcare 
        providers may do blood tests before and during treatment with XELJANZ.
      
			
        Common side effects include upper respiratory tract infections (common 
        cold, sinus infections), headache, diarrhea, and nasal congestion, 
        sore throat, and runny nose (nasopharyngitis).

&lt;p&gt;CARACAS (Reuters) - The U.S. embassy in Venezuela said on Sunday it is suspending appointments for new tourist visas due to a lack of personnel following the expulsion of consular staff last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government of President Nicolas Maduro in February kicked out three consular officers on charges they were recruiting students to participate in anti-government protests that have sparked the country's deadliest unrest in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The State Department denied those accusations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The embassy said that because of the expulsions and the delays in approval to bring in new consular officers, it no longer has sufficient staff to process first-time tourist visa requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Until further notice, we are able to offer such appointments only in emergency situations," the embassy said in a statement posted on its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said it will still process visa renewals and applications for other types of visas, and that it will attend to those who already have appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement encouraged those who already have appointments not to miss them "because it is unlikely under current staffing conditions that we will be able to re-schedule your interview in a timely manner."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two countries have not had ambassadors in each other's capitals since late socialist leader Hugo Chavez expelled the U.S. envoy to the OPEC nation in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anti-government protests have convulsed the country since the middle of February and left at least 34 dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Diego Ore; Writing by Brian Ellsworth; Editing by Eric Walsh)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 24 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's chief
executive for China investment banking Fang Fang has decided to
leave the U.S. bank after more than a decade amid a probe of its
Asian hiring practices, the Wall Street Journal reported on

was not known why Fang wanted to step down now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities have been investigating whether JPMorgan
violated bribery laws by improperly hiring the relatives of
well-connected Chinese officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has provided U.S. prosecutors with emails from
Fang, who is also the bank's vice chairman of investment banking
in Asia, discussing the hiring of China Everbright Group
Chairman Tang Shuangning's son, the Journal reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Bureau of Investigation and prosecutors from the
Justice Department are examining whether the son's employment
helped JPMorgan win assignments from Everbright, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives for JPMorgan and China Everbright did not
immediately respond to requests for comment.

&lt;p&gt;(Adds Mastercard, Visa comment)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW, March 23 (Reuters) - Visa Inc and MasterCard
Inc have resumed services for payment transactions for
clients at Russia's SMP bank, whose main shareholders were
affected by U.S. sanctions, the bank said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington imposed additional sanctions on Thursday against
20 Russians for involvement in the Ukraine crisis, including
Boris Rotenberg and his older brother Arkady, who received large
contracts for the Sochi Winter Olympics. They are co-owners of
SMP Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMP had said on Friday that Visa and MasterCard had stopped
providing services for payment transactions for clients at SMP
bank, which has about 100 branches covering more than 20 Russian
cities, according to its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Mastercard confirmed it was again serving
clients of the bank but did not say why it reversed its
decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa said it had been informed by the U.S. government to
lift sanctions against SMP bank and two other Russian banks
because they did not meet the criteria for sanctions. "All cards
issued by these banks will return to normal operation as soon as
possible," it said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa's statement named the other two banks as Investitsionny
Soyuz (Investment Union) and InvestKapitalBank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMP bank had said the decision to stop providing services by
Visa and MasterCard was unlawful because the sanctions were
imposed on shareholders, not the bank, which said it has no
assets in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are glad that the two biggest international payment
systems have heard our arguments and reversed their decision to
block (SMP bank transactions)," SMP bank CEO Dmitry Kalantyrsky,
said in a statement.

clients at Russia's SMP bank, whose main shareholders were
affected by U.S. sanctions, the bank said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington imposed additional sanctions on Thursday against
20 Russians for involvement in the Ukraine crisis, including
Boris Rotenberg and his older brother Arkady, who received large
contracts for the Sochi Winter Olympics. They are co-owners of
SMP Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMP had said on Friday that Visa and MasterCard had stopped
providing services for payment transactions for clients at
Russia's SMP bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said the decision to stop providing services by
Visa and MasterCard was unlawful because the sanctions were
imposed on shareholders, not the bank, which said it has no
assets in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are glad that the two biggest international payment
systems have heard our arguments and reversed their decision to
block (SMP bank transactions)," SMP bank CEO Dmitry Kalantyrsky,
said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has about 100 branches covering more than 20
Russian cities, according to its website.

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's government on Monday proposed giving a new regulator wide-reaching powers to police the operations of dominant telecommunications companies and TV broadcasters, right down to their prices and discounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill sent to Congress fleshes out a constitutional reform approved last year that seeks to curb the power of phone mogul Carlos Slim and the country's top broadcaster, Televisa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regulator, the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT), will have sweeping powers to order companies to sell assets, revoke concessions and share networks and infrastructure, according to the bill sent to the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico's two main opposition parties, however, said in a joint statement later on Monday that the proposal would curtail the power of the IFT and instead empower the executive branch for "political purposes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement was signed by the conservative National Action Party and the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, rivals of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the proposal, the IFT will have the power to levy fines of up to 10 percent of revenue in Mexico in the case of a repeat offense. It will also be able to force companies to seek approval annually for interconnection and infrastructure-sharing terms, in line with a draft obtained by Reuters last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major market players such as billionaire Slim's phone and Internet giant America Movil, his fixed-line operator Telmex and TV broadcaster Televisa have been declared dominant by the regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most important part of this is more competition," communications and transport secretary Gerardo Ruiz Esparza told local radio. "What the (bill) says is that for there to be more competition, we need to ensure there is no dominance in the market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The telecoms overhaul, a central plank of a wider raft of economic measures ranging from taxes to energy that Pena Nieto pushed through Congress last year, has raised hope the government is serious about finally breaking the stranglehold of a select few over Latin America's second-biggest economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slim, who became one of the world's richest men after taking control of Mexico's former state telephone monopoly at the outset of the 1990s, controls around 80 percent of Mexico's fixed-line business and about 70 percent of the mobile sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa has more than 60 percent of the TV market, and many Mexicans complain it exerts too much political influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico's radio and television industry group said in a memo to members that some aspects of the bill imply "new and severe" regulatory burdens for the broadcast sector, according to a preliminary review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said some measures translated into over-regulation and could be subjective and editorial independence could be compromised by the imposition of a code of ethics. It also cited unduly harsh fines and legal uncertainty regarding concession extensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IFT has ordered Slim's companies to present plans to cut rates for rivals using America Movil's mobile network, scrap roaming charges, open up the fixed-line network and share transmission towers as well as other infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the IFT has not ordered a break-up of his operations, a step the regulator says should only be taken as a last resort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(With reporting by Elinor Comlay, Gabriel Stargardter, Michael O'Boyle and Adriana Barrera; Editing by Simon Gardner, David Gregorio and Lisa Shumaker)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TEXAS CITY, Texas (Reuters) - The closure of the vital Houston Ship Channel looked set to extend to a fourth day after the Coast Guard struggled to finish cleaning up after an oil barge spill on Monday, threatening to force deeper production cuts at local refiners.&lt;/p&gt;

Also, any ships that were touched must be cleaned before moving through water deemed sufficiently clean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The closure of the channel on Saturday has led to a queue of more than 90 vessels trying to move into or out of the Gulf of Mexico.

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on Monday sent to Congress measures to implement a new telecoms reform, handing sweeping powers to new regulator the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reform is designed to rein in the empires of telecoms billionaire Carlos Slim and Televisa's Emilio Azcarraga by imposing asymmetric regulation, controlling tariffs and threatening asset sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the key proposals:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORE POWERFUL WATCHDOG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IFT is independent and will have wide powers for monitoring and sanctioning broadcast, internet and phone companies, including the ability to revoke concessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other issues, the IFT will have the final word on interconnection tariffs, when these are disputed, and on changes in the corporate structure of companies tied to license holders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOMINANCE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dominant companies will submit end-user tariffs, discounts and packages to the IFT for approval.

Dominant broadcasters must offer their public programming to cable and other pay-television providers free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IFT can revoke pay-television concessions if dominant agents benefit from the new must-offer, must-carry rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FINES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concession-holders who break rules can be fined up to 5 percent of their revenue in Mexico.

&lt;p&gt;* Coast Guard says will re-open channel 'as soon as we can'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* More than 80 inbound and outbound vessels waiting to move

 (Updates with detail about re-opening; adds quotes, byline;
changes dateline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Erwin Seba&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TEXAS CITY, Texas March 24 (Reuters) - U.S. authorities
expected a "tapered" re-opening of the Houston Ship Channel, but
gave no timeline on Monday of when vessels could start moving
again after an oil barge spill shut the waterway for a third
day, forcing the nation's second-largest refinery to curb
production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will begin the process of a tapered ... not a floodgate 
resumption of marine traffic," Captain Brian Penoyer, commander
of U.S. Coast Guard sector Houston-Galveston and captain of the
Port of Houston, told reporters on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We anticipate re-opening the Houston Ship Channel as soon
as we can," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Monday, the Coast Guard had told ship operators
that it should be able to reopen the waterway later in the day,
resuming at least some supply of crude oil to more than
one-tenth of the nation's refining capacity. A Coast Guard
spokesman declined to discuss the timeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even earlier, officials had said the channel could remain
shut for several more days. Penoyer explained that traffic can't
move again until there's no more oil in the water to cling to
ships and be carried further. Also, any ships that were touched
must be cleaned before moving through water deemed sufficiently
clean, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The closure of the channel on Saturday has led to a queue of
more than 80 vessels trying to move into or out of the Gulf of
Mexico. Shipping delays forced Exxon Mobil Corp to cut
production at its largest refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said production at its 560,500 barrel per day Baytown,
Texas, refinery had been cut on Monday due to the closure of the
Houston Ship Channel. The company expects further production
cuts by mid-week if the channel remains shut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INVENTORIES CONSIDERED AMPLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on Monday were largely unconcerned, noting that
ample inventories in the region provide a cushion for refiners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a senior engineer at a Houston-area refinery that
depends on crude deliveries through the ship channel was
concerned about the requirement that the water be cleaned of any
thick fuel oil before ships run back and forth to ensure they
don't track it further upstream or into the Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're toast," the engineer said. "I would say this is a big
problem. Any delay is bad, but three days or more is really bad
because we use the channel to bring crude and products in and
out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ship channel was shut on Saturday after a collision
between a Kirby Inland Marine oil barge and a cargo ship,
spilling some 4,000 barrels, or 168,000 gallons (636,000
liters), of residual fuel oil. The channel allows oil barges and
cargo ships to sail from the Gulf Coast to refiners and
terminals further inland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penoyer said the thick viscosity of the oil made it
recoverable by skimmers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 39 ships were waiting to leave the port of
Houston and 43 ships were waiting to come in, the Coast Guard
said on Monday afternoon. Penoyer said a typical day in the
channel includes movement of 60 to 80 large ships - tankers,
freighters, containers and cruise ships - and 300 to 400 tug and
barge movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A warning to mariners issued by the Coast Guard on Sunday
said portions of the Houston channel and its offshoots to Texas
City and Galveston, Texas, along with a portion of the Gulf
Intracoastal Waterway, could be closed through March 29 or
longer, depending on the requirements of a cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five ships waited to come into the ports of Texas City and
Galveston, Texas, and 12 ships waited to leave the ports, the
Coast Guard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kirby Inland Marine is operated by Kirby Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penoyer said Kirby "immediately" stepped forward to take
responsibility for the response costs by hiring the cleanup
crews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cleanup crews have pumped all of the remaining fuel oil from
the barge, which has been refloated and moved to a different
position near the site of the collision in the channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marathon Petroleum Corp. declined on Monday to
discuss operations at its 451,000-bpd Galveston Bay Refinery and
80,000-bpd Texas City refinery. Royal Dutch Shell's 
joint-venture 327,000 bpd Deer Park refinery was evaluating
supply impacts and had contingency plans to mitigate them, a
spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fewer than 10 oil-covered birds have been recovered for
cleaning, according Texas wildlife agencies.

      Research and Markets: Global Plasticizer Market 2014-2018 with BASF SE, 
      Eastman Chemical Co., ExxonMobil Corp., and Ferro Corp Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/679tdd/global) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Plasticizer Market 2014-2018 with BASF SE, Eastman Chemical Co., 
      ExxonMobil Corp., and Ferro Corp Dominating" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the main drivers in this market is the rising demand for 
      plasticizers from the Medical industry. Plasticizers are increasingly 
      being used in the production of medical devices and in their packaging. 
      The rapid growth of the Medical industry has also adding to the 
      increased requirement for plasticizers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The increasing global concern about the environment and the need for 
      environmental sustainability is forcing vendors to design eco-friendly 
      plasticizers. Plasticizers such as DOP and other types of phthalates 
      contain harmful substances and toxins which often harm the environment 
      and pose risks to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The public in many 
      countries, and social bodies concerned with the environment, have 
      started pressurizing vendors and manufacturers of various products to 
      use bio-plasticizers in the manufacture of various goods. Hence, vendors 
      are increasing their research capabilities and are developing 
      biodegradable and less harmful plasticizers such as TEC, TBC, and TOC to 
      protect the environment and population, and to reduce their carbon 
      footprint. Consumers are also demanding more eco-friendly plasticizers, 
      which is positively influencing the growth in this market, though it 
      adds to the manufacturing pressure on some plasticizer vendors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the main challenges hindering the 
      growth of this market is the health risks associated with the use of 
      plasticizers, especially phthalates. Some plasticizers harm humans and 
      lead to low birth weights, problems in the reproductive system, problems 
      in breathing, and numerous other diseases, especially among children.

			Agencies accepting applications from college students for summer 
      intern positions

        ExxonMobil Community Summer Jobs Program provides grants to 30 local 
        agencies to hire college students
      
			
        Positions provide range of experience for students to enhance their

		&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      The ExxonMobil 
      Foundation today announced the 30 Dallas County nonprofit agencies 
      to receive grants through the 2014 ExxonMobil Community Summer Jobs 
      Program. The eight-week summer program provides assistance to nonprofit 
      agencies while enabling college students to gain valuable work 
      experience and a better understanding of the important role of nonprofit 
      organizations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Nonprofit agencies provide vital community services, especially during 
      the summer when children are out of school,&#8221; said Suzanne McCarron, 
      president of the ExxonMobil Foundation. &#8220;In addition to helping these 
      agencies realize their mission, the Community Summer Jobs Program aims 
      to foster college students&#8217; appreciation for the nonprofit sector, while 
      also offering them opportunities to develop their skills.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Paid internship positions engage students in a broad range of 
      activities, such as coordinating camp programs for underprivileged 
      children and developing marketing campaigns. In addition to daily 
      internship duties, students also receive professional development and 
      participate in a group service project. Qualified college students 
      interested in gaining hands-on experience in the nonprofit sector are 
      encouraged to apply.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To be eligible, applicants must be current undergraduate students 
      returning to college as a full-time (minimum 12 credit hours per 
      semester) sophomore, junior or senior in the fall of 2014. Interested 
      students may contact the selected agencies, listed below, to request 
      applications and learn more about available opportunities, or visit csjpdallas.org.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since 1990, the ExxonMobil Foundation has contributed nearly $4 million 
      to fund the program in Dallas, subsidizing nearly 1,600 internships and 
      benefitting more than 330 agencies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since the program began in 1971 in New York City, the ExxonMobil 
      Foundation has provided nearly $19 million to support more than 7,600 
      community summer job internships across the country.

      Law Section of the American 
      Bar Association as the law firm recipient of its 2014 National 
      Public Service Award. Initiated in 1994, the annual honor recognizes 
      delivery of significant pro bono legal services that demonstrate a

      Goodwin was nominated for the award by Lawyers 
      Clearinghouse, a nonprofit organization the firm&#8217;s attorneys have 
      worked with for more than a decade. In its nomination, Lawyers 
      Clearinghouse recognized the 10-year anniversary of its collaboration 
      with Goodwin to produce legal seminars and workshops for Massachusetts 
      nonprofits, as well as the firm&#8217;s integral role in creating The 
      One Fund Boston, the charity formed to raise money for families 
      affected by the Boston Marathon bombings.

      Committee Chair William Woodward said the Section &#8220;carefully considered 
      the firm&#8217;s dedication to the development and delivery of innovative pro 
      bono services that have provided legal counsel to nonprofit 
      organizations and microbusinesses in aid of community development on an 
      ongoing basis.&#8221;

      wide range of organizations and individuals.

      the pro bono services we provide on a daily basis,&#8221; said Mark 
      Macenka, co-chair of Goodwin Procter&#8217;s Pro 
      Bono Committee. &#8220;Through our pro bono programs, we are proud to

&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI (Reuters) - Nokia does not expect to close the sale of its phone business to Microsoft until April as talks with Asian regulators drag on, it said on Monday, fuelling speculation it may have to make technology patent concessions to get the deal done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After selling its loss-making handset business, Nokia - which expected the deal to close this month - will derive more than 90 percent of sales from its telecom network unit, but its patent portfolio is seen as a promising source of future growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a phone maker, Nokia has paid rivals for the use of their licenses as well as charging for its own. A newly restructured Nokia would be freer to push up those fees, analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expected future revenue from patents make up as much as half Nokia's roughly 20-billion-euro market capitalization, they say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google and Samsung Electronics have asked Chinese regulators to ensure the 5.4 billion euro ($7.4 billion) deal between Microsoft and Nokia would not lead to higher licensing fees, according to media reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(The delay) is a bad sign. They have been discussing with authorities for quite a while already, and they still need more time," Nordea Markets analyst Sami Sarkamies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest risk is in the upside of their patents. It looks like Nokia will have to make bigger concessions to push the deal through," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia shares fell 0.7 percent to 5.24 euros by 1215 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Finnish firm said both companies remain committed to the deal, and Microsoft said it expects it to close next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are nearing the final stages of our global regulatory approval process," Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, said on the company's website. "Currently we are awaiting approval confirmation in the final markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia also reiterated that its tax disputes in India would not have an impact on the deal schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indian authorities hit the company with a new $414 million tax claim last week, following a Supreme Court decision ordering Nokia to give a $571 million guarantee before transferring its Chennai factory to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pohjola Markets analyst Hannu Rauhala said Nokia and Microsoft had several options on how to deal with the tax issues while the antitrust problem was essentially out of their hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is always the risk of further postponements (in deal closure). Based on the information they have given today, it can't be ruled out," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time needed to close the deal, announced last September, is not exceptional for Microsoft, which took five months to complete its purchase of online chat company Skype in 2011. Nokia and Microsoft have already received approvals from the European Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rauhala said that delays to the deal could also push forward Nokia's strategy update. Nokia had been expected to name a new chief executive and outline its new strategy after the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with its network unit and patents, future Nokia also includes its navigation software business HERE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Simon Johnson in Stockholm and Bill Rigby in Seattle; Editing by Louise Ireland)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BELGRADE (Reuters) - Alleged Balkan drugs boss Darko Saric, who surrendered to Serbian police last week after almost five years on the run, denied on Monday any involvement in trafficking cocaine from Latin America to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saric, one of the most wanted figures in the crime-riddled Balkan region, faces 13 indictments including the trafficking of 5.7 tonnes of cocaine from Latin America and the laundering of 22 million euros in Serbia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saric, 43, told his first court hearing in Belgrade that the charges against him had been fabricated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The only thing I have not been indicted for is an earthquake," joked Saric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belgrade media have speculated that Saric might reveal during his trial the names of Serbian politicians believed to have helped him with money laundering operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was friends with some influential and rich people (in Serbia)," he told the court but gave no further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saric decided to surrender after Serbian agents identified him with the help of CIA in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had set no conditions for his surrender, other than to see his wife, son and daughter for 30 minutes at an airport in neighbouring Montenegro, en route from an unspecified third country to Belgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His detention followed last year's arrest in Serbia's former Kosovo province of Naser Kelmendi, blacklisted by the United States on suspicion of trafficking drugs to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organised crime flourished during the Balkan wars in the 1990s as socialist Yugoslavia fell apart, spawning sophisticated crime networks that exploited poorly policed borders, a glut of cheap firearms and a political and security establishment riddled with corruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Balkan region is a well-known transit route for illicit drugs heading to western Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All former Yugoslav republics have since set their sights on joining the European Union, alongside members Slovenia and Croatia, and face pressure to tackle organised crime as a condition of integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ivana Sekularac; Editing by Zoran Radosavljevic and Gareth Jones)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 24, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against Walter Investment Management Corporation ("Walter Investment" or the "Company") (NYSE:WAC) and certain of its officers. The class action, filed in United States District Court, Middle District of Florida, and docketed under 1:14-cv-20880, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Walter Investment securities between May 9, 2012 and February 26, 2014, both dates inclusive (the "Class Period"). This class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws pursuant to Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	If you are a shareholder who purchased Walter Investment securities during the Class Period, you have until May 6, 2014 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Robert S. Willoughby at rswilloughby@pomlaw.com or 888.476.6529 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll free, x237. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and number of shares purchased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Walter Investment is a loan servicer and business solutions provider focused on generating recurring, fee-based revenues from an "asset-light" platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the Company lacked adequate internal controls over financial accounting and compliance with applicable laws; (2) the Company's internal controls were not effective; (3) the Company's financial statements contained false and misleading statements; (4) the Company had failed to disclose material weaknesses in the internal controls of its recently acquired subsidiary, RMS; (5) the Company had overstated the value of its RMS acquisition; (6) the Company was in violation of applicable laws, rules and regulations; (7) the Company's business practices violated consumer financial protection laws, thereby jeopardizing future revenues and profits; and, (8) as a result of the foregoing, the Company's statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	On March 18, 2013, the Company shocked investors by disclosing that, based on an evaluation by the Company's Board of Directors and management, "our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. As a result of this material weakness, management has concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	On this news, the Company's shares fell $8.61 per share to close on March 19, 2013 at $32.98 per share, a drop of over 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	On February 27, 2014, the Company announced in a Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") Form 8-K filing that the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") issued a Civil Investigation Demand ("CID") to Green Tree Servicing LLC ("Green Tree"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, requesting information on a broad range of subjects relating to the company's operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	On this news, shares of Walter Investment fell from $28.28 to $25.90, more than 8%, on unusually heavy trading volume, on February 27, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Florida, and San Diego, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, the Pomerantz Firm pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 70 years later, the Pomerantz Firm continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members. See www.pomerantzlaw.com.&lt;/p&gt;CONTACT: Robert S. Willoughby

&lt;p&gt;The memo gave no reason for his resignation. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported Fang's departure, said he had emerged as a key figure for U.S. authorities as they investigate whether the investment bank violated bribery laws by improperly hiring the relatives of well-connected Chinese officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fang, 48, could not be reached for comment. A spokesman for JPMorgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source familiar with the matter said Fang would leave with immediate effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frank Gong, will be promoted to chairman of investment banking for China from vice chairman, according to the memo obtained by Reuters on Monday. Brian Gu and Jing Zhao will become co-heads of investment banking for China with Jing also continuing in her current role as head of the Financial Institutions Group for Emerging Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities are examining whether JPMorgan's hiring of China Everbright Group Chairman Tang Shuangning's son helped the bank win assignments from Everbright, the Journal said, adding that JPMorgan has provided U.S. prosecutors with emails from Fang discussing the hire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has withdrawn from underwriting a $3 billion Hong Kong listing by China Everbright Bank Co Ltd (601818.SS) - one of two China initial public offerings it has stopped working on while the investigation is being carried out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives for JPMorgan and China Everbright did not respond to requests for comment on the hiring of Tang's son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fang has strong ties to the Chinese government, having been appointed to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in March 2008 for a five year term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other firms that have come under scrutiny for their hiring practices in Asia include Citigroup (C.N), Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBSN.VX) has placed two Hong Kong-based bankers on leave of absence as part of an investigation over the hiring of an employee related to a Chinese corporate client, IFR reported last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in NEW YORK and Lawrence White in HONG KONG; Editing by Eric Walsh and Edwina Gibbs)&lt;/p&gt;

hiring the relatives of well-connected Chinese officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fang, 48, could not be reached for comment. A spokesman for
JPMorgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source familiar with the matter said Fang would leave with
immediate effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frank Gong, will be promoted to chairman of investment
banking for China from vice chairman, according to the memo
obtained by Reuters on Monday. Brian Gu and Jing Zhao will
become co-heads of investment banking for China with Jing also
continuing in her current role as head of the Financial
Institutions Group for Emerging Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities are examining whether JPMorgan's hiring of
China Everbright Group Chairman Tang Shuangning's son helped the
bank win assignments from Everbright, the Journal said, adding
that JPMorgan has provided U.S. prosecutors with emails from
Fang discussing the hire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has withdrawn from underwriting a $3 billion Hong
Kong listing by China Everbright Bank Co Ltd - one
of two China initial public offerings it has stopped working on
while the investigation is being carried out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives for JPMorgan and China Everbright did not
respond to requests for comment on the hiring of Tang's son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fang has strong ties to the Chinese government, having been
appointed to the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference in March 2008 for a five year term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other firms that have come under scrutiny for their hiring
practices in Asia include Citigroup, Goldman Sachs 
and Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS AG has placed two Hong Kong-based bankers on
leave of absence as part of an investigation over the hiring of
an employee related to a Chinese corporate client, IFR reported
last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in NEW YORK and Lawrence White

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity firm Carlyle Group LP poached one of Jamie Dimon's closest aides, Michael Cavanagh, from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co on Tuesday, in a surprise hire that reflects both the increasing prominence of so-called shadow banking and the regulatory challenges faced by banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cavanagh, 48, who was co-head of JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank, will become the co-president and co-chief operating officer of Carlyle, as the alternative asset manager puts its own succession plan in place. He will also join Carlyle's executive board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will share both new titles with Carlyle veteran Glenn Youngkin, 47, who has until now been sole chief operating officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cavanagh's departure is a blow to Dimon, and sources familiar with the situation said the move came as a surprise to senior bank executives. Dimon hired Cavanagh more than two decades ago and has worked with him ever since. In recent years, Cavanagh, who was also a member of the bank's operating committee, had come to be seen as one of the potential successors to the JPMorgan chairman and CEO. Daniel Pinto, who had the same role as Cavanagh, was named sole CEO of JPMorgan's corporate and investment banking division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cavanagh's move underscores the challenges banks face in retaining talent amid an onslaught of regulations in the aftermath of the financial crisis, which have complicated bank managers' jobs and reduced their pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several other long-time bankers, such as former JPMorgan executives Jes Staley and Steven Black, have moved in recent years to private equity, hedge funds and other more lightly regulated corners of high finance, broadly referred to as shadow banking. The sector offers executives more business opportunities as banks pull back, as well as higher pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carlyle's founders - David Rubenstein, William Conway and Daniel D'Aniello - each received $92.9 million in dividends and salaries in 2013. They also received $108.1 million, $252.8 million and $109.5 million, respectively, from Carlyle's funds in 2013 as a result of investing alongside the firm's clients. By comparison, Dimon was paid $20 million for 2013, with $18.5 million of that coming in restricted stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cavanagh told Dimon over the weekend that he was considering the job after having been approached by Carlyle earlier this year, one of the sources said. The increased demands from changing regulations and JPMorgan's myriad problems in recent years with regulators were factors that played into Cavanagh's decision, the source added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past two years, new people have moved into seven of nine key positions at JPMorgan, according to a count by analyst Mike Mayo of CLSA. Cavanagh, Mayo said, "was a familiar face in a shuffled deck."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cavanagh, the source added, was not tired of waiting in the wings to become chief executive, as Dimon, one of the longest-serving U.S. bank CEOs, shows no signs of stepping down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cavanagh will be on "gardening leave" at JPMorgan until he joins Carlyle in the summer. Gardening leave is the typical cooling-off period that senior executives go through when they switch jobs, allowing them to receive their salary while not actively carrying out their duties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMORGAN SUCCESSION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision marks a major career move for Cavanagh, who went to work for Dimon at age 26 at Smith Barney.

This has enriched their investors as well as insiders at these firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded in Washington, D.C., in 1987, Carlyle had $189 billion in assets at the end of December in private equity, credit, real estate and funds of funds.

Subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, the Offering is expected to close on April 1, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta intends to use the net proceeds of the Offering&#160;to redeem all of its $125 million outstanding Series 1, 7.625% senior unsecured debentures that mature on November 23, 2017 (the "Series 1 Debentures"), to reduce its senior indebtedness and for general corporate purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The successful completion of this refinancing and the redemption of our Series 1 debentures will further enhance our financial flexibility and strengthen our balance sheet by increasing the proportion of our long term debt, extending the average term of our debt outstanding and lowering our cost of debt," said Mike Borys, Executive Vice President and CFO of Newalta.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Satya Nadella, the Indian-born self-described cricket fanatic who took over as Microsoft Corp's chief executive last month, makes his public debut on Thursday and is expected to go on the offensive right away with some bold strokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Nadella hosts his first major press conference this week, he's likely to describe - if not officially launch - versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint designed for Apple Inc's iPad, looking to cash in on a market worth up to $7 billion a year, according to Wall Street analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology behind the software is not ground-breaking, but the strategy is: It puts Office at the heart of the company's push to become a leading services company across a variety of platforms - possibly at the expense of Windows and its own Surface tablet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That perceived willingness to break with the Windows tradition, which remains co-founder Bill Gates' most enduring legacy, has helped spur Microsoft shares to $40-plus levels not seen since the dotcom boom of 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street is now guardedly optimistic on a company that, while still garnering billions of dollars in annual profit, risks gradual obsolescence in a mobile-powered tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that Nadella is going to pull the trigger (on Office) shows he's not just an insider that's going to continue the status quo. Right now, it's a blank sheet of paper," said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending what Microsoft charges for Office on the iPad, and how many of the scores of millions - and rising - iPad users adopt it, it could rake in anywhere between $840 million to $6.7 billion a year in revenue, estimates Raimo Lenschow, an analyst at Barclays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura who has urged Microsoft to put its most lucrative franchise on the iPad for some time, welcomed the idea but was more cautious on the rewards. He estimates that an iPad Office would generate only $1 billion or so in new revenue a year, as many potential users will already have corporate licenses that can be converted to the new product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it's unclear how much of its revenue will be surrendered to Apple, which generally takes a 30 percent cut of app sales through its store. Microsoft and Apple declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPTIMISM BOOSTS SHARES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anticipation of Nadella's mobile-centric strategy has pushed Microsoft shares up 11 percent in the seven weeks since he took the helm, and they are now rolling along at 14-year highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Nadella is officially slated to talk about mobile and cloud strategies. But investors and industry executives will be just as attuned to any signals from the new CEO on whether he's willing to take Microsoft in a radically different direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To some investors, steering a new course for such a massive entity - Microsoft is the second-largest U.S. tech company by market value - is a daunting task. And some, who would rather have seen an energetic outsider like Ford Motor Co's Alan Mulally get the job, are yet to be convinced Nadella has the leverage to make the necessary change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But bold moves with Office, and signifying a renewed drive to conquer the mobile arena and 'cloud' computing after years of shackling its best products to PC-centric Windows, are seen as a promising start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is something that should have happened a few years ago," said J.P. Gownder, an analyst at tech research firm Forrester. "Holding Office for iPad as a hostage in the tablet war didn't work out well for them. They have to start to undo this negative behavior."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella has more work to do as well on the devices side of Microsoft's business plan. Windows-powered phones are well reviewed but held only 3 percent of the global smartphone market last year. Its Surface tablet, an iPad competitor, had 2 percent of the tablet market, according to tech research firm Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's $7.2 billion deal to buy the handset unit of Nokia, now delayed in closing, is unpopular with many investors who view it as a doomed defensive play to curb Google Inc's Android's dominance in the smartphone market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is "an acquisition not even a mother could love," according to Nomura's Sherlund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street will be listening for Nadella's thoughts on the Xbox, the subject of renewed spin-off talk recently, and his willingness to buy his way into cloud-based computing services exploited by growing startups such as Dropbox and Evernote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"M specifically on cloud is going to be key, around big data, cybersecurity, software-centric deals," said Ives at FBR.

				KENDALL PARK, NJ--(Marketwired - March 25, 2014) - Binary Tree introduces its revolutionary exCHANGE UPgrade migration offering at the Microsoft Exchange Conference (MEC) 2014 on March 31 in Austin, Texas. Binary Tree, a Gold Sponsor, will showcase its award-winning E2E Complete Exchange migration software, SMART Active Directory Migrator software, and an exciting "Enter the Matrix with Binary Tree" challenge featuring binary code competitions at its booth, #401. A Binary Tree expert will also present best practices for enhancing the public folder migration experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the end of support for Microsoft Exchange 2003, MEC provides the perfect venue for attendees to consult with Binary Tree migration experts about migrating to Office 365 or to the latest version of Exchange on-premises, quickly and without disruption to their users or IT department. Binary Tree's exCHANGE UPgrade is the first delivery model to offer the full spectrum of transition functionality, while completely removing the burden from the client. Clients get it all -- interoperability, analysis and rationalization, user transition and content migration -- regardless of type of enterprise or platform, at a cost-effective, predictable per user price. The company's exCHANGE UPgrade means the migration solution is delivered quickly and remotely, so it dramatically reduces the need for IT involvement, and reduces the time and complexity of migration for clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a leader in enterprise Exchange migrations, we wanted to bring even more attention to our solutions during MEC," states Carl Baumann, Vice President of Sales  Marketing. "Customers can explore our exCHANGE UPgrade promotion, hear about our successful migrations for Fortune 500 companies, and learn why Binary Tree is the preferred provider for Exchange migrations," he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Binary Tree's expertise is reiterated by Terry Birdsell, Director of Productivity Solution Sales at&#160;Microsoft. Birdsell states, "Binary Tree's technical excellence and best-in-class methodology allows Microsoft enterprise customers of any size to quickly and smoothly transition to the cloud. Binary Tree is a proven leader and truly valued Microsoft Gold Partner."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Binary Tree's exciting in-booth competition, "Enter the Matrix with Binary Tree," will appeal to the company's technical users who are often avid game players. Commonly known to computer programmers, binary code has experienced a resurgence made popular from The Matrix
movie series. The various code challenges will be offered via social media and inside Binary Tree's booth, and will culminate in code challenges and prize giveaways during the event's MAPI hour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
				Binary Tree Solutions Featured at Booth #401During MEC, Binary Tree will feature its latest release of E2E Complete, which addresses the complete spectrum of Microsoft Exchange migration needs for any size enterprise. The newest release allows enterprise clients to easily migrate public folder data to public folder mailboxes within Exchange 2013 or Office 365. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company will also exhibit its SMART Active Directory Migrator software, which enables a project team to automate the migration and restructuring of the Active Directory (AD) environment while ensuring full coexistence between migrated and un-migrated users. With SMART Active Directory Migrator, end users can continue working, totally unaware of the migration project, and administrators can manage associated restructuring activities during business hours, instead of the typical nights and weekends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
				Binary Tree Presentation
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, March 31st, from 12:30pm - 1:00pm, Valentin (Val) Vasquez, Senior Solutions Architect, will present Public Folder Migrations: Much More Than just a Move Request, in Ballroom A of the Neal Kocurek Memorial Austin Convention Center.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's Xalkori delayed progression of lung cancer longer than chemotherapy in patients who had never previously been treated for the disease, according to results of a late-stage study released on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medicine, which received U.S. approval in 2011 for lung cancer patients who have a specific gene mutation, had shown in a previous Phase III trial that it significantly delayed disease progression among those who have already undergone chemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer, the most common form of the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said favorable results from the latest trial, combined with those from the earlier big study, establish that Xalkori is appropriate for first-line as well as second-line use, meaning for patients receiving initial treatment as well as for those who have already undergone chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug is used among patients who have a mutation in the so-called ALK gene, as determined by an approved diagnostic test. The mutation only occurs in a small percentage of patients with lung cancer, but makes them good candidates for treatment with Xalkori.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xalkori, with current annual sales of about $350 million, is expected to get a significant boost from the new data. Cowen and Co has predicted the medicine will generate annual peak sales of $1.05 billion by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is also developing an array of other cancer medicines that work through new mechanisms, with the aim of becoming a major player in the oncology field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares were up 0.6 percent at $31.67 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Andrew Hay)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court upheld the conviction of former Goldman Sachs Group Inc director Rajat Gupta, one of the biggest successes in federal prosecutors' long-running probe to stop insider trading on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Gupta's claim that wiretap evidence should not have been admitted to show that he leaked news about Goldman's finances, including a crucial investment by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, by phone to Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Circuit Judge Amalya Kearse said the timing of Gupta's calls, coming just one minute after he learned "extraordinary" news about Goldman's finances, followed by Rajaratnam's fast and large trades in Goldman shares, were "powerful evidence that Rajaratnam was given the confidential information by Gupta."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday's decision upholding Gupta's conviction and two-year prison term for securities fraud and conspiracy was a fresh endorsement of the aggressive tactics that prosecutors have used to thwart insider trading, in a probe unveiled in October 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta, 65, is a former global managing director of the consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co, and the top corporate official convicted in the probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government has won 79 convictions and guilty pleas in its probe, much of which has focused on hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those convicted include Rajaratnam, as well as two portfolio managers for billionaire Steven Cohen's SAC Capital Advisors LP, Mathew Martoma and Michael Steinberg. SAC pleaded guilty to fraud in November. Cohen has not been criminally charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're very disappointed in today's decision, believe Mr. Gupta is entitled to a new trial, and are closely reviewing the opinion with an eye toward further review," Gupta's lawyer Seth Waxman, a WilmerHale partner and former U.S. solicitor general under President Bill Clinton, said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta was appealing his June 2012 conviction, prison term and $5 million fine for feeding tips from Goldman board meetings in the second half of 2008 to Rajaratnam, his longtime friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tips included information on Goldman's financial results, as well as a $5 billion investment from Berkshire at the height of the financial crisis, according to prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SOMETHING GOOD MIGHT HAPPEN TO GOLDMAN"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam was heard telling a trader that a caller had told him not long before the Berkshire investment was announced on September 23, 2008 that "something good might happen to Goldman."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors contended that Gupta was the caller, and had contacted Rajaratnam just after emerging from a Goldman board meeting to approve the Berkshire investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam bought more than $33 million of Goldman stock in the final minutes prior to the market close, before the Berkshire investment was made public, and reaped a profit exceeding $1 million, prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing for a three-judge appeals court panel, Kearse said in a 48-page decision that there was "ample evidence" to support a finding by jurors that Gupta conspired to pass confidential tips about Goldman to Rajaratnam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She rejected Gupta's argument that U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan, the trial judge, wrongly excluded evidence that Rajaratnam was cheating Gupta on an investment, and that Gupta had "integrity" and "obeys the law."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta has been free during his appeal, and it was not immediately clear when he might begin his prison term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is separately appealing Rakoff's February 2013 order that he reimburse $6.22 million to Goldman to help the bank cover its legal costs. Goldman was not implicated in wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government's case against Rajaratnam also relied heavily on wiretap evidence, which prior to the insider probe was more commonly associated with efforts to fight organized crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam is serving an 11-year prison term. Last June, the 2nd Circuit upheld his conviction, saying the use of wiretaps was proper. Rajaratnam has appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v.

				NEW PROVIDENCE, NJ--(Marketwired - March 25, 2014) - Chemetall will present "Metal Cleaning and Application Fundamentals" during the MWF 130 session on Wednesday, May 21, 2014. To increase the effectiveness of the finish, parts must be cleaned prior to coating. If the cleaner does not fulfill its purpose of removing unwanted soils from the substrate, subsequent processing steps will not produce a uniform conversion coating, and therefore inadequately protect the metal surface from corrosion. A high-quality conversion coating combined with the appropriate organic coating is essential for the durability of finished products. Rinse water quality and proper rinsing are as critical, yet often-over-looked step in the pretreatment process. A well-designed, lean cleaning and rinsing process can help improve product quality, thru-put, and higher profits! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technical session will focus on different cleaning technologies (mechanical  chemical primarily) and issues specific to the parts cleaning. It will provide a foundation of critical terminology used to enable informed decisions in the selection, design, installation, and upgrade of a cleaning system. It will highlight topics including soils, substrates, cleaners, rinsing and drying, and the means to verify the cleaning and rinsing effectiveness. Process automation, safety, troubleshooting, and preventative maintenance of process equipment will also be covered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemetall has been developing, manufacturing, and supplying state-of-the-art specialty chemical products since 1909. The ISO 9001 company offers a wide spectrum of products ranging from metalworking fluids and drawing  stamping compounds to cleaners, rust preventatives and surface treatment chemistries. Chemetall's integrated products, chemical management systems, process equipment, and technical service programs deliver efficient and cost effective solutions for industrial manufacturing needs. Expect more with Chemetall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemetall is a world-class specialty chemical company and a global provider of chemical technologies based in Frankfurt/Main, Germany.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 25 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on
Tuesday rejected a bid by former Goldman Sachs Group Inc 
director Rajat Gupta to overturn his insider trading conviction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the claim by
Gupta, also a former global managing director of consulting firm
McKinsey &amp; Co, that his trial judge improperly admitted wiretap
evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta had appealed his June 2012 conviction and two-year
prison term for having fed confidential tips from Goldman board
meetings in the second half of 2008 to Raj Rajaratnam, a
longtime friend and head of the Galleon Group hedge fund firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam was also convicted of insider trading, and is
serving an 11-year prison term.

&lt;p&gt;March 25 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's Xalkori delayed
progression of lung cancer longer than chemotherapy in patients
who had never previously been treated for the disease, according
to results of a late-stage study released on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medicine, which received U.S. approval in 2011 for lung
cancer patients who have a specific gene mutation, had shown in
a previous Phase III trial that it significantly delayed disease
progression among those who have already undergone chemotherapy
for non-small-cell lung cancer, the most common form of the
illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug is used among patients who have a mutation in the
so-called ALK gene, as determined by an approved diagnostic
test. The mutation only occurs in a small percentage of patients
with lung cancer, but makes them good candidates for treatment
with Xalkori.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xalkori, whose chemical name is crizotinib, had global sales
of $89 million in the fourth quarter. Pfizer is also developing
an array of other cancer medicines that work through new
mechanisms, with the aim of becoming a major player in the
oncology field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares were up 0.6 percent at $31.68 in morning
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;THE HAGUE (Reuters) - The White House on Tuesday said it was "deeply disappointed" that Saudi Arabia had denied a visa to a U.S. citizen working for Israeli newspaper The Jerusalem Post to cover President Barack Obama's trip to the kingdom later this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia does not recognize Israel, but has said it is willing to change that if Israel agrees to a peace plan it proposed that involved creating a Palestinian state and allowing Palestinian refugees to return to their former homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are deeply disappointed that this credible journalist was denied a visa," White House spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said in a statement. "We will continue to register our serious concerns about this unfortunate decision."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jerusalem Post said on its website that Obama's national security adviser Susan Rice and her deputy, Tony Blinken, had expressed displeasure to Saudi Arabia over the delay in processing reporter Michael Wilner's application and its potential refusal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper said Wilner is a Jewish American who does not hold Israeli citizenship and has never lived in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Holland and Jeff Mason; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 25 (Reuters) - Private equity firm Carlyle Group LP
 said it appointed Mike Cavanagh, co-head of JPMorgan
Chase &amp; Co's corporate and investment bank, as
co-president and co-chief operating officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cavanagh, who will also join Carlyle's executive board, will
share both positions with company veteran Glenn Youngkin, who is
currently the sole chief operating officer, Carlyle said in a
statement on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cavanagh, 48, was a member of JPMorgan's operating committee
and was seen as a possible successor to Chief Executive Jamie
Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel Pinto will become the sole CEO of JPMorgan's
corporate and investment bank after Cavanagh's departure, the
bank said in a separate statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appointments highlight the succession planning under way
at some of the major private equity firms, which have been run
by their founders for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now in their 60s, Carlyle's founders also poached veteran
dealmaker Kewsong Lee from Warburg Pincus LLC last year and
named him deputy chief investment officer for private equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cavanagh and Youngkin will manage Carlyle's global
operations on a day-to-day basis.

			Pfizer Reports Positive Phase 3 Study Outcome Of XALKORI&#174; 
      (crizotinib) Compared To Chemotherapy In Previously Untreated Patients 
      With ALK-Positive Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Crizotinib is the Only Agent That Demonstrated Superior PFS Over 
      Chemotherapy in Two Global Randomized Studies in First- and Second-Line 
      ALK-Positive Advanced NSCLC
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. announced today that PROFILE 1014, a Phase 3 study of 
      anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor XALKORI&#174; 
      (crizotinib), met its primary objective of significantly prolonging 
      progression-free survival (PFS) in previously untreated patients with 
      ALK-positive advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
      when compared to standard platinum-based chemotherapy regimens. PROFILE 
      1014 is the second positive global Phase 3 study that evaluated XALKORI 
      against chemotherapy, a standard of care for patients with advanced 
      NSCLC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The results of the PROFILE 1014 study are important in that they 
      demonstrate, for the first time, that XALKORI is superior to standard 
      chemotherapy doublet regimens in prolonging survival without progression 
      as first-line treatment for patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC,&#8221; 
      said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, senior vice president of Clinical Development 
      and Medical Affairs and chief medical officer for Pfizer Oncology. 
      &#8220;These findings build upon the data from the PROFILE 1007 randomized 
      Phase 3 study in previously treated patients and collectively establish 
      XALKORI as a standard of care in both the first and second-line setting 
      for patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      No unexpected safety issues were identified in the PROFILE 1014 study. 
      The adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile for 
      XALKORI. Efficacy and safety data from this study will be submitted for 
      presentation at a future medical meeting.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;These data from the PROFILE 1014 study highlight the importance of not 
      only testing a tissue specimen for the presence of biomarkers at the 
      time of diagnosis in all patients with advanced stage NSCLC, but 
      actually having those results in hand before determining the most 
      appropriate treatment option for each patient,&#8221; said Professor Tony Mok, 
      Li Shu Fan Medical Foundation Professor of Clinical Oncology at the 
      Chinese University of Hong Kong. &#8220;It is clear that a multidisciplinary 
      collaborative approach to molecular testing is required in order to 
      deliver those results on time, which in fact is the foundation of 
      personalized medicine in lung cancer.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      XALKORI was first approved in 2011 through the accelerated approval 
      program of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It was granted 
      regular approval in 2013 in the U.S. based on the results of PROFILE 
      1007, a Phase 3 study demonstrating that XALKORI significantly prolonged 
      PFS in previously treated patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC when 
      compared to single agent chemotherapy. To date, more than 8,000 patients 
      have been treated with XALKORI1, now approved in 74 countries2, 
      including Australia, Canada, China, Japan, South Korea and the European 
      Union.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide.3 
      NSCLC accounts for about 85 percent of lung cancer cases and remains 
      difficult to treat, particularly in the metastatic setting.4 
      Approximately 75 percent of NSCLC patients are diagnosed late with 
      metastatic, or advanced, disease where the five-year survival rate is 
      only 5 percent.5,6,7
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			XALKORI&#174; (crizotinib) Indication and 
      Important Safety Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      XALKORI is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic 
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors are anaplastic lymphoma 
      kinase (ALK)-positive as detected by an FDA-approved test.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hepatotoxicity:
			Drug-induced hepatotoxicity with fatal outcome 
      occurred in 0.2% of patients treated with XALKORI across clinical trials 
      (n=1225). Transaminase elevations generally occurred within the first 2 
      months of treatment. Monitor with liver function tests including ALT and 
      total bilirubin every 2 weeks during the first 2 months of treatment, 
      then once a month and as clinically indicated. Permanently discontinue 
      for ALT or AST elevation greater than 3 times ULN with concurrent total 
      bilirubin elevation greater than 1.5 times ULN (in the absence of 
      cholestasis or hemolysis), otherwise temporarily suspend and dose reduce 
      XALKORI as indicated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pneumonitis:
			Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung 
      disease (ILD)/pneumonitis can occur in patients treated with XALKORI. 
      Across clinical trials (n=1225), 2.5% of XALKORI-treated patients had 
      any grade ILD, 0.9% of patients had Grade 3 or 4, and 0.5% had fatal 
      cases. These cases generally occurred within 2 months after the 
      initiation of treatment. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms 
      indicative of pneumonitis. Exclude other causes and permanently 
      discontinue XALKORI in patients with drugrelated pneumonitis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      QT Interval Prolongation:
			QTc prolongation can occur in patients 
      treated with XALKORI. Across clinical trials (n=1225), QTc prolongation 
      (all grades) was observed in 2.7% of patients and QTc greater than 500 
      ms on at least 2 separate ECGs occurred in 1.4% of patients. Avoid use 
      of XALKORI in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. Consider 
      periodic monitoring with electrocardiograms and electrolytes in patients 
      who have a history of or predisposition for QTc prolongation, or who are 
      taking medications that prolong the QT interval. Permanently discontinue 
      XALKORI in patients who develop QTc greater than 500 ms or greater than 
      or equal to 60 ms change from baseline with Torsade de pointes, 
      polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, or signs/symptoms of serious 
      arrhythmia, otherwise temporarily suspend and dose reduce XALKORI as 
      indicated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Bradycardia:
			Symptomatic bradycardia can occur in patients 
      receiving XALKORI. Across clinical trials, bradycardia with a heart rate 
      less than 50 beats per minute occurred in 11% of patients treated with 
      XALKORI (n=1174). Monitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly. Avoid 
      using XALKORI in combination with other agents known to cause 
      bradycardia to the extent possible. Permanently discontinue for 
      life-threatening bradycardia due to XALKORI; however, if associated with 
      concomitant medications known to cause bradycardia or hypotension, hold 
      XALKORI until recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart rate of 
      60 bpm or above. If concomitant medications can be adjusted or 
      discontinued, restart XALKORI at 250 mg once daily with frequent 
      monitoring. Otherwise temporarily suspend and resume or dose reduce 
      XALKORI as indicated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Embryofetal Toxicity:
			XALKORI can cause fetal harm when 
      administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should 
      be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving XALKORI. If the 
      patient or their partner becomes pregnant while taking this drug, 
      apprise the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Adverse Reactions:
			Safety was evaluated in a phase 3 study in 
      patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC randomized to XALKORI 
      (n=172) or chemotherapy (n=171). Serious adverse reactions were reported 
      in 37.2% patients treated with XALKORI. The most frequent serious 
      adverse reactions reported in patients treated with XALKORI were 
      pneumonia (4.1%), pulmonary embolism (3.5%), dyspnea (2.3%), and ILD 
      (2.9%). Fatal adverse reactions in XALKORI-treated patients occurred in 
      9 (5%) patients, consisting of: acute respiratory distress syndrome, 
      arrhythmia, dyspnea, ILD, pneumonia, pneumonitis, pulmonary embolism, 
      respiratory failure, and sepsis. Common adverse reactions occurring in 
      &#8805;25% included vision disorder (diplopia, photophobia, photopsia, vision 
      blurred, visual acuity reduced, visual impairment, vitreous floaters), 
      diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, constipation, edema, decreased appetite, 
      fatigue, upper respiratory infection, and dysgeusia. Grade 3 or 4 events 
      occurring at a higher incidence with XALKORI than with chemotherapy and 
      at greater than 2% incidence were syncope (3%), QT prolongation (3%), 
      and pulmonary embolism (5%). Elevation of ALT of any grade occurred in 
      76% of patients and grade 3 or 4 in 17% of patients. Neutropenia of any 
      grade occurred in 49% of patients and grade 3 or 4 in 12% of patients. 
      Lymphopenia of any grade occurred in 51% of patients and grade 3 or 4 in 
      9% of patients. Renal cysts occurred in 4% and neuropathy in 19% of 
      patients treated with XALKORI.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Drug Interactions:
			Exercise caution with concomitant use of 
      moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice which 
      may increase plasma concentrations of crizotinib. Avoid concomitant use 
      of strong CYP3A inducers and inhibitors. Dose reduction may be needed 
      for coadministered drugs that are predominantly metabolized by CYP3A.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nursing Mothers:
			Given the potential for serious adverse 
      reactions in nursing infants, consider whether to discontinue nursing or 
      discontinue XALKORI.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hepatic Impairment:
			XALKORI has not been studied in patients with 
      hepatic impairment. As crizotinib is extensively metabolized in the 
      liver, hepatic impairment is likely to increase plasma Crizotinib 
      concentrations. Use caution in patients with hepatic impairment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Renal Impairment:
			Administer XALKORI at a starting dose of 250 mg 
      taken orally once daily in patients with severe renal impairment 
      (CLcr30 mL/min) not requiring dialysis. No starting dose adjustment is 
      needed for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment.

		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) announced today that Daniel Pinto, co-Chief 
      Executive Officer of the company&#8217;s Corporate  Investment Bank (CIB), 
      will become sole CEO of the CIB, effective immediately. Mike Cavanagh, 
      co-CEO of the CIB, is leaving the company to become co-President and 
      co-Chief Operating Officer of The Carlyle Group, a global alternative 
      asset management company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I have worked with Mike Cavanagh for more than 20 years,&#8221; said Jamie 
      Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. &#8220;He&#8217;s a highly talented 
      executive and has been an integral part of our management team, as our 
      CFO for six years and as co-CEO of the Corporate  Investment Bank. He&#8217;s 
      also a special person and we wish him well in his choice to take on a 
      new challenge. While we would prefer he stay at the firm, we are glad 
      he&#8217;s going to a valued client in Carlyle. I know the whole Operating 
      Committee joins me in thanking him for his years of service to our firm.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Dimon added: &#8220;I am pleased that we have someone as extraordinarily 
      capable as Daniel Pinto to take over as sole CEO of the Corporate  
      Investment Bank. Daniel is an exceptional manager of risk who 
      understands markets as well as anyone I&#8217;ve ever met. He is a true leader 
      &#8211; his values, character and judgment are second to none. He&#8217;s proven he 
      can lead in the toughest of times and will be a terrific CEO to build on 
      the CIB&#8217;s track record of success.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Cavanagh said: &#8220;I have worked at JPMorgan Chase for almost my entire 
      professional life, and it was not without a lot of soul searching that I 
      decided it was time for me to take my career in a different direction. I 
      wouldn&#8217;t have left for any company other than The Carlyle Group, a firm 
      and a management team I have known for a long time. While I am saddened 
      to be leaving this remarkable firm, I am looking forward to a new 
      chapter. I wish all of my friends and colleagues at JPMorgan Chase the 
      very best.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Pinto said, &#8220;I am very honored to become CEO of the Corporate  
      Investment Bank. It&#8217;s truly a privilege to lead the talented team in CIB 
      at a time when the business is performing exceptionally well. We will 
      all miss Mike &#8211; he&#8217;s been a terrific partner and friend and key 
      contributor to our success. We will continue to work hard for that 
      success, and, as we always have, to serve our clients with distinction.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;A decision by Standard &amp; Poor's to lower Brazil's sovereign debt
ratings to "BBB minus" from "BBB" is likely to reinforce a
negative perception on the nation's equities, strategists at
JPMorgan Securities said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a client note by strategists led by Pedro
Martins, S's decision "does not help Brazil's relative
valuation to emerging markets" because it heightens risks that
earnings could disappoint. Currently, prices for Brazilian
equities are trading at 9.2 times estimated earnings, compared
with a multiple of 9.7 for emerging markets countries, the
strategists said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ratings cut "validates the perception that Brazil's cost
of equity should be rising, adding to the expected increase in
10-year U.S. Treasuries ... and it should create headwinds for
domestic consumption, financially leveraged and infrastructure
companies," the note said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The downgrade is a sign of enhanced scrutiny of Brazil's
policies, Martins and his team said. They pointed to a
deterioration in interest rates, foreign exchange and credit
risk in Brazil as well as the possibility of energy rationing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMSTERDAM, March 25, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gemalto (Euronext NL0000400653 GTO), the world leader in digital security, has introduced the Coesys Border and Visa Management solution to meet the combined needs of securing borders and simplifying travel procedures. The end-to-end solution integrates high-availability service platforms, secure software and on-site services to significantly reduce waiting times through the use of automated document verification and border control at land, sea and airport check points. Gemalto's visa and border management technology enables government authorities to implement an electronically connected system&#160;for easy deployment of immigration policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	This new, entirely computerized system enhances security and provides a more efficient set of tools to monitor border entries and exits. It also delivers higher rates of detection and prevention through official international databases to check if the travel document has been lost or stolen. Coesys Border and Visa Management can easily incorporate automated e-gates at border immigration check points. These highly secure, two-stage traveler verification systems first verify that the e-passport is authentic and then performs facial or fingerprint recognition to match the holder to the electronic data securely stored on&#160;the e-passport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to a dedicated platform for border control, Gemalto's portfolio includes consultancy, solution design, system integration and full support for the transition from legacy systems to integrated border management infrastructures. Coesys Border  Visa Management leverages Gemalto's unique global footprint and long-standing trusted relationships with government and authorities worldwide, acquired through more than 80 successful deployments in the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"This new solution capitalizes on Gemalto's security expertise and the hundreds of millions of electronic travel documents with the associated services that we have deployed so far," said Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Trojani, Executive Vice President, Government Programs at Gemalto. "With air passengers traffic expected to double by 20301 and 53% of all passports issued forecast to embed the electronic feature in 20172, Coesys Border and Visa Management comes about just when governments need to fast track travelers through major international airports, with no compromise on security."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      Fitch Affirms JPMC 2001-C1
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed six classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Corp.'s (JPMC) commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates series 2001-C1. A detailed list of rating actions follows 
      at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations reflect the increasingly concentrated nature of the 
      pool. There are seven loans remaining in the pool, one of which is 
      specially serviced (36.5%) and two are defeased (54.1%). Fitch modeled 
      losses of 19.1% of the remaining pool; expected losses on the original 
      pool balance total 4.7%, including $45.4 million (4.2% of the original 
      pool balance) in realized losses to date.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the March 2014 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 97.4% to $28 million from $1.07 billion at 
      issuance. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting classes J through 
      NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The specially-serviced loan (36.5% of the pool) is secured by a 200-unit 
      multifamily property in Holland, OH. The loan had transferred to special 
      servicing in June 2010 for monetary default. The borrower had filed for 
      bankruptcy in August 2011. The bankruptcy stay was lifted in May 2012 
      and the servicer was in the process of pursuing foreclosure. The 
      borrower filed for bankruptcy for the second time in November 2012, 
      which was later dismissed in June 2013. The borrower is now appealing 
      that decision. Fitch expects a prolonged workout on this asset. 
      Occupancy was reported at 96% by the servicer in February 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rating on class H is expected to remain stable as the class benefits 
      from defeasance and has sufficient credit enhancement to offset Fitch 
      expected losses. The distressed class J may be subject to further rating 
      actions as losses are realized.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirms the following classes as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$18 million class H at 'BBBsf', Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$9 million class J at 'Csf', RE 55%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$1 million class K at 'Dsf', RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class L at 'Dsf', RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class M at 'Dsf', RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class N at 'Dsf', RE 0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The balances on classes L, M and N have been reduced to zero due to 
      realized losses. The class A-1, A-2, A-3, B, C, D, E, F, G, NC-1, NC-2 
      and X-2 certificates have paid in full. Fitch does not rate the class NR 
      certificates. Fitch previously withdrew the rating on the interest-only 
      class X-1 certificates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			JPMorgan Chase Plans Dividend Increase and $6.5 Billion Capital 
      Repurchase Program
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE:JPM) announced today that, following the 
      Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s release of the 2014 Comprehensive Capital 
      Analysis and Review (CCAR) results, its Board of Directors intends to 
      increase the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.40 per share, 
      effective the second quarter of 2014. The Board has also authorized a 
      common equity repurchase program to repurchase $6.5 billion of common 
      equity between April 1, 2014, and March 31, 2015. This authorization 
      includes shares repurchased to offset issuances under the Firm&#8217;s 
      equity-based compensation plans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Federal Reserve Board informed the Firm that it does not object to 
      the Firm&#8217;s proposed 2014 capital distribution plan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase said:&#160;&#8220;We are pleased 
      that our Board intends to raise the dividend and has authorized us to 
      continue our equity buyback program. We anticipate reaching a Basel III 
      Tier I common ratio of 10% by the end of this year, taking into account 
      these capital actions and our ongoing investments in our growing 
      businesses.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Firm&#8217;s dividends will be subject to the Board&#8217;s approval at the 
      customary times those dividends are declared. The 2014 second quarter 
      dividend, which the Board intends to increase to $0.40 per share, would 
      be for shareholders of record on July 3, 2014, payable on July 31, 2014. 
      Upon the declaration of a dividend in the second quarter of 2014 in an 
      amount in excess of $0.38 per share, the Exercise Price and the Warrant 
      Share Number for the warrants (as defined in the warrants) to purchase 
      shares of common stock of the Firm may be adjusted. Further information 
      regarding the warrants and adjustments to the warrant Exercise Price and 
      the Warrant Share Number is available on the Firm&#8217;s website at jpmorganchase.com, 
      under the heading Investor Relations, Shareholder Information: &#8220;Warrant 
      Information.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Repurchases of equity will be pursuant to the common equity repurchase 
      program of $15.0 billion previously authorized by the Firm&#8217;s Board of 
      Directors on March 13, 2012. As of the date of this press release, $8.3 
      billion of repurchase capacity was remaining under such program. The 
      timing and exact amount of common equity purchased will be consistent 
      with the Firm&#8217;s capital plan and will depend on various factors, 
      including market conditions, the Firm&#8217;s capital position, internal 
      capital generation, alternative investment opportunities, and legal and 
      regulatory considerations; the Firm&#8217;s repurchase program does not 
      include specific price targets or timetables, and may be executed 
      through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, 
      including the use of Rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any 
      time.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Products Company, a Chevron U.S.A. Inc. division, maker of the 
      Delo brand of technologically advanced engine oils, lubricants and 
      coolants, today announced plans to conduct a live teardown of a DD15 
      engine, with over 400,000 miles of service using Delo&#174; 400 XLE 10W-30, 
      during the Mid-America Trucking Show (MATS) in Louisville, KY March 
      27-29 (booth# 32495, South Wing). The event is designed to demonstrate 
      the ability of lower-viscosity oils, like 10W-30, to provide comparable 
      protection to a 15W-40 grade, while at the same time improving fuel 
      economy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;There&#8217;s a misconception that lighter viscosity oils don&#8217;t offer the 
      same level of protection as heavier oils,&#8221; said Jim Gambill, North 
      America Commercial and Industrial Brands Manager, Chevron Products 
      Company. &#8220;We&#8217;re here to dispel that myth. Besides the teardown, we&#8217;ll 
      challenge attendees to compare parts from engines that have used 10W-30 
      and 15W-40 in similar environments and for similar lengths of service 
      and ask if they can see the difference. Once they realize they can rely 
      on Delo 400 XLE 10W-30 to maintain engine durability while improving 
      fuel economy, we feel they will be comfortable making the switch.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Updated Delo Truck
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron will also debut the newly updated Delo Truck, an 80-foot rolling 
      education center that serves as a mobile ambassador for the Delo brand. 
      The Delo Truck features all-new graphics, a new interactive proof of 
      performance display, an updated DD15 engine cutaway display and an area 
      dedicated to Tier IV emissions. The Delo Truck is designed to educate 
      customers on key market issues, Delo technology and the importance of 
      premium performance heavy-duty engine oils, lubricants and coolants.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Edgar Hansen of &#8220;Deadliest Catch&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, Chevron will also have Edgar Hansen, Chief Engineer of the 
      fishing vessel Northwestern in its booth Thursday through 
      Saturday. Edgar, whose business uses Delo lubricants and is featured on 
      Discovery Channel&#8217;s &#8220;Deadliest Catch,&#8221; will take photos, sign autographs 
      and answer questions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fans of Edgar that can&#8217;t attend MATS are encouraged to visit Chevron 
      Delo on Facebook 
      or Twitter 
      and submit their questions using the hashtag #AskEdgar. During the show, 
      select questions will be answered by Edgar and posted online.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      While at MATS, attendees will also have an opportunity to have their 
      picture taken with the Delo Parts Guy and take home Delo-branded gear.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms JPMCC 2012-C6
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed 13 classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Trust 2012-C6, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through 
      Certificates, Series 2012-C6. A detailed list of rating actions follows 
      at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations are based on stable performance of the underlying 
      collateral pool. There have been no delinquent or specially serviced 
      loans since issuance. As of the March 2014 distribution date, the pool's 
      aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 1.7% to $1.11 billion 
      from $1.13 billion at issuance. The servicer has placed three loans 
      (6.4% of the pool) on the watchlist, including one of the top 15 loans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest loan on the watchlist (4.9% of the pool) is the 8080  9400 
      North Central Expressway loan, a two-building office portfolio with 
      total combined 673,188 square feet (sf) located in suburban Dallas, TX. 
      The largest tenants are Healthtexas Provider Network (92,167 sf, expires 
      November 2022) and Compass Bank (53,938 sf, expires September 2023). 
      Prior to issuance, the property had historically struggled to maintain 
      stable occupancy. Occupancy has declined to 72% as of December 2013 from 
      77% as of December 2012. At issuance the physical vacancy was 80%; Fitch 
      assumed a 77.2% stabilized occupancy estimate in its cash flow analysis. 
      The further decline in occupancy from issuance, which was cited as a 
      concern due to near-term rollover, is partially mitigated by an ongoing 
      leasing cost reserve of $800,000 per year, capped at $2.4 million. In

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms JPMorgan Chase's Ratings at 'A+/F1'; Outlook Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed JPMorgan Chase  Co.'s (JPM) long-term Issuer 
      Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+' and short-term IDR at 'F1'. Fitch has also 
      affirmed JPM's viability rating (VR) at 'a+', its support rating at '1', 
      and its support rating floor (SRF) at 'A'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. 
      A full list of ratings is provided at the end of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rating actions have been taken in conjunction with a review of 
      support for banks globally and also as part of a periodic review of the 
      Global Trading and Universal Banks, which comprise 12 large and globally 
      active banking groups. Fitch's outlook for the sector is stable on 
      balance. Earnings pressure in securities businesses and continued 
      conduct and regulatory risks present in the GTUBs are offset by stronger 
      balance sheets as capitalisation and liquidity remain sound. Fitch 
      forecasts stronger GDP growth in most economies, which should contribute 
      to a more balanced operating environment, but the operating environment 
      is likely to remain challenging in 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today's rating actions assume that JPM will perform adequately under the 
      CCAR stress test, though Fitch has no visibility into any potential 
      qualitative rejections for JPM, or any of the other 29 banks subject to 
      regulatory stress testing. Although a qualitative rejection of a capital 
      plan request under CCAR would be viewed negatively, it is not expected 
      to have any rating implications for JPM.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPM's ratings affirmation reflects the strong underlying earnings 
      capacity of the bank, given its dominant domestic franchise and growing 
      international franchise, and progress made toward achieving compliance 
      with heightened capital and liquidity requirements. The affirmation also 
      reflects the firm's strong funding flexibility, given its deposit 
      raising capabilities and uninterrupted access to the global capital 
      markets through an economic cycle.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPM's Basel III tier 1 common equity ratio improved from an estimated 
      8.7% at year-end 2012 to 9.5% at year-end 2013, which is in-line with 
      management's target but lower than the peer average. Capital 
      improvements have been supported by growth in retained earnings and 
      modest reductions in risk-weighted assets, due largely to non-core 
      portfolio run-off. Management is targeting a ratio of 10% by the end of 
      2014 and 10%-10.5% longer-term, which Fitch believes is prudent, given 
      the 9.5% minimum requirement. Fitch believes JPM is well positioned to 
      maintain compliance with Basel III capital requirements, even with its 
      higher G-SIFI loss absorbing buffer, given the superior earnings 
      capacity of the bank.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch believes progress on compliance with the supplementary leverage 
      ratio (SLR) will extend into 2015, as certain structural adjustments are 
      required for the bank to reach a ratio of 6%. JPM converted some 
      intercompany debt into equity during the fourth quarter, which 
      contributed to a 40 basis point increase in the bank's SLR, to 4.7% at 
      year-end. However, the conversion yielded an increase in the firm's 
      double leverage to approximately 1.17 times (x), which Fitch believes is 
      high, relative to historical standards. Further increases in double 
      leverage would be viewed negatively. Fitch expects JPM to achieve full 
      compliance with all regulatory requirements, well ahead of required 
      implementation, which for SLR is 2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The bank's liquidity profile remains sound, with $522 billion of high 
      quality liquid assets at Dec. 31, 2013, up from $341 billion a year 
      earlier. Fitch believes the growth was largely driven by JPM's efforts 
      to accelerate compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), which 
      has been achieved. Additionally, clarity regarding the direction of the 
      net stable funding ratio (NSFR) was released in a consultative document 
      in January, and JPM believes it is currently compliant with the 
      requirements, which Fitch views favorably.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Earnings performance has been highly resilient, particularly on a 
      relative basis, as the company remained profitable throughout the 
      financial crisis and continued to post relatively solid returns despite 
      the recognition of over $11.1 billion of legal expenses in 2013. This is 
      a testament to the company's broad and diverse franchise. The firm had 
      another strong year on a core basis in 2013. Fitch estimates that 
      pre-tax earnings were essentially flat, on an adjusted basis, as weaker 
      mortgage performance was offset by reduced provision expenses and 
      stronger asset management revenue. Core operating expenses remained 
      relatively flat, with efficiency measures funding higher costs 
      associated with the control agenda.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPM made significant progress settling a variety of outstanding 
      litigation during 2013 and early 2014, which Fitch views as a positive 
      step in moving beyond the headline issues stemming from the financial 
      crisis. Legal costs are likely to remain elevated in coming quarters, 
      but Fitch expects the incremental impact to earnings will be manageable. 
      Still, the emergence of material and unexpected litigation losses could 
      alter the agency's view, particularly given where the firm's current 
      capitalization ratios compare to the broader peer group.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Stable Outlook reflects expectations for continued operating 
      consistency, although Fitch believes credit costs will become a growing 
      headwind, as asset quality metrics rise from historical lows, and 
      earnings are likely to continue to be challenged by relatively low 
      interest rates. A continued focus on operational improvements is 
      expected to offset the impact to some extent. Investment banking results 
      will remain dependent upon market conditions, but JPM's strong market 
      position and diverse product offering should yield peer-superior 
      performance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Going forward, Fitch believes JPM is going to be challenged to deliver 
      earnings growth, particularly in light of the current regulatory 
      environment. Higher capital charges and what remains difficult market 
      conditions present a challenge for all GTUBs, which may be encouraged to 
      seek more aggressive ways to generate profits that take advantage of 
      regulatory changes. However, Fitch expects that JPM's strong global 
      franchise, liquidity risk management, and product diversity mitigate 
      some of these concerns.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Negative rating actions could result from reputational damage that 
      impacts the firms market position and/or material asset quality 
      weakening which pressures JPM's earnings and its ability to build 
      capital, deterioration in liquidity levels, material and unexpected 
      litigation losses, and/or failure to sufficiently address weaknesses 
      noted in regulatory consent orders and internal reviews following 
      material losses in the chief investment office. Further, significant 
      risk management or operational failures that result in material losses 
      to the firm could also result in a negative rating action.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch considers JPM's ratings to be particularly sensitive to the degree 
      and scope of litigation risk going forward. Fitch recognizes that the 
      large litigation charge taken during the third quarter of 2013 reflects 
      JPM's desire to address outstanding legal issues, related largely to 
      mortgage. To the extent JPM enters into any new and material litigation 
      settlements, Fitch will consider whether these effectively diminish 
      ongoing legal risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Upward rating momentum for JPM is believed to be limited for the 
      foreseeable future given that its current rating level is among the 
      highest of its peer group and of the global bank universe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SRF
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPM's Support Rating (SR) and Support Rating Floor (SRF) reflect Fitch's 
      expectation that there remains an extremely high probability of support 
      from the U.S. government ('AAA'/Outlook Stable) if required. This 
      expectation reflects the U.S.'s extremely high ability to support its 
      banks especially given its strong financial flexibility, though 
      propensity is becoming less certain. Specific to JPM, Fitch's view of 
      support likelihood is based mostly on its systemic importance in the 
      U.S., its global interconnectedness given its size and operations in 
      global capital markets, significant deposit market share and its 
      position as a key provider of financial services to the U.S. economy. 
      JPM's IDRs and senior debt ratings do not benefit from support because 
      JPM's VR is above its SRF.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      However, in Fitch's view, there is a clear intention to reduce support 
      for G-SIFIs in the U.S., as demonstrated by the Dodd Frank Act (DFA) and 
      progress regulators have made on implementing the Orderly Liquidation 
      Authority (OLA). The FDIC has proposed its single point of entry (SPOE) 
      strategy and further initiatives are demonstrating the U.S. government's 
      progress to eliminate state support for U.S. banks going forward, which 
      increases the likelihood of senior debt losses if its banks run afoul of 
      solvency assessments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS  SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SRF
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The SR and SRF are sensitive to progress made in finalizing the SPOE 
      strategy and any additional regulatory initiatives that may be imposed 
      on the G-SIFIs, including debt thresholds at the holding company. 
      Fitch's assessment of continuing support for U.S. G-SIFIs has to some 
      extent relied upon the feasibility of OLA implementation rather than its 
      enactment into law (when DFA passed). Hurdles that remain include the 
      resolution of how cross-border derivative acceleration/termination 
      provisions are handled and that there is sufficient contingent capital 
      at the holding company to recapitalize without requiring government 
      assistance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch expects that the SPOE strategy and regulatory action to ensure 
      sufficient contingent capital will be finalized in the near term, but 
      regardless of its finalization Fitch believes that sufficient regulatory 
      progress continues to be made over the ratings time horizon. Therefore, 
      Fitch expects to revise JPM's Support Rating to '5' and its SRF to 'No 
      Floor' within the next one to two years, likely to be some point in late 
      2014 or 1H15.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A revision of the SRF to 'No Floor' would mean no change to JPM's 
      Long-term IDR and debt ratings because JPM's viability rating is above 
      the SRF.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS  SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID 
      SECURITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by JPM and by various 
      issuing vehicles are all notched down from JPM's or its bank 
      subsidiaries' VRs in accordance with Fitch's assessment of each 
      instrument's respective nonperformance and relative Loss Severity risk 
      profiles. Their ratings are primarily sensitive to any change in the VRs 
      of JPM or its bank subsidiaries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS  SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPM's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the 
      company's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits 
      benefit from depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives 
      deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in the event of default.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings of long and short-term deposits issued by JPM and its 
      subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in JPM's IDR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS  SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY

		&lt;p&gt;
      JPM's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and 
      banks, reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is 
      mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of strength for its bank 
      subsidiaries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Common equity double leverage rose in late 2013 as the firm converted 
      certain intercompany debt into equity during the fourth quarter to boost 
      the bank's SLR ratio. Double leverage is at the high-end of the peer 
      group, at 1.17x at Dec. 31, 2013. Fitch would view further increases in 
      double leverage negatively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS  SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The IDRs and VRs of JPM's bank subsidiaries benefit from the 
      cross-guarantee mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA and therefore IDRs 
      and VRs are equalized across the group. JPMorgan Securities LLC (JPMS) 
      is a wholly owned subsidiary that is the firm's U.S. broker dealer and 
      is considered core to JPM's business. As a result its IDR is equalized 
      with that of its parent JPM. Bear Stearns Companies, LLC and JPMorgan 
      Clearing Corp. benefit from a parent guarantee and therefore their IDRs 
      are equalized with JPM's. Collateralized Commercial Paper Co., LLC's 
      short-term IDR benefits from JPMS's guarantee of the amounts payable by 
      the repo seller, JPMCC, and as result its short-term IDR is equalized 
      with that of JPMS. Collateralized Commercial Paper II Co., LLC's 
      short-term IDR is based on the repo seller, JPMS's ST IDR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPM is a leading global trading and universal bank with $2.4 trillion in 
      total assets and $17.9 billion of net income for the year ended Dec. 31, 
      2013.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms Goldman Sachs' Ratings at 'A/F1'; Outlook Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.'s (Goldman) 
      Issuer Default Rating (IDRs) at 'A/F1', support rating at '1', support 
      rating floor (SRF) at 'A' and viability rating (VR) at 'a'. The Rating 
      Outlook is Stable. A complete list of rating actions follows at the end 
      of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rating actions on Goldman have been taken in conjunction with a 
      periodic review of the Global Trading and Universal Banks, which 
      comprise 12 large and globally active banking groups. Fitch's outlook 
      for the sector is stable on balance. Earnings pressure in securities 
      businesses and continued conduct and regulatory risks present in the 
      GTUBs are offset by stronger balance sheets as capitalization and 
      liquidity remain sound. Fitch forecasts stronger GDP growth in most 
      economies, which should contribute to a more balanced operating 
      environment, but the operating environment is likely to remain 
      challenging in 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today's rating actions assume that Goldman will perform adequately under 
      the CCAR stress test, though Fitch has no visibility into any potential 
      qualitative rejections for Goldman, or any of the other 29 banks subject 
      to regulatory stress testing. Although a qualitative rejection of a 
      capital plan request under CCAR would be viewed negatively, it is not 
      expected to have any rating implications for Goldman.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman's IDRs, VR and senior debt continue to be supported by its 
      leading investment banking franchise, solid liquidity position, 
      better-than-average capital position, and strong risk management. The 
      ratings are constrained by Goldman's focus on capital market activities 
      and relatively higher level of wholesale funding.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman has higher reliance on capital market operations than many 
      global trading and universal banks (GTUBs). Fitch recognizes that 
      capital market revenues are inherently volatile and susceptible to 
      declines in difficult market periods. Concerns over this inherent 
      volatility are offset by management's successful track record in 
      managing through difficult periods.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch believes that Goldman has a comparatively strong risk management 
      organization and systems to manage and monitor risk as demonstrated by 
      its ability to manage risk during period of market stress.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman has consistently maintained liquidity at conservative levels, 
      which is viewed as appropriate given the company's reliance on wholesale 
      funding. Unencumbered highly liquid securities and cash was $184 billion 
      (20% of total assets) at year end 2013. Goldman's reliance on unsecured 
      short-term funding continues to be modest and the weighted average 
      maturity of secured funding remained constant during 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman's capital position continues to improve and remains 
      comparatively strong. Fitch Core Capital to risk-weighted assets 
      remained higher than the GTUB average. Goldman's Tier I common ratio 
      under the Basel III advanced approach was approximately 9.8% at year-end 
      2013 (in line with the average of U.S. GTUBs).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Regulatory and legal issues appear manageable. Goldman and peers face 
      new capital markets regulations such as the Volcker Rule and 
      implementation of Basel III capital and liquidity standards. Goldman is 
      projected to meet new requirements well within allowable time frames.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman's IDRs, VR and senior debt continue to be underpinned by its 
      leading investment banking franchise, solid operating profitability, 
      strong risk management, comfortable liquidity position and 
      better-than-average capital position. The ratings factor in Fitch core 
      capital in line with current levels and the management of capital 
      comfortably above Basel III capital minimums. The IDRs, VR and senior 
      debt have limited upward potential, given Goldman's business focus on 
      the capital markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Downward pressure on the VR could result from a material loss, 
      significant increase in leverage or deterioration in liquidity levels. 
      Similarly, any unforeseen outsized or unusual fines, settlements or 
      charges levied could also have adverse rating implications. Goldman's 
      Long-term IDR could be negatively pressured if both its financial 
      profile deteriorates (reflected in the VR) and Fitch's view of support 
      of U.S. G-SIFIs change.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATIING FLOOR
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman's Support Rating (SR) and Support Rating Floor (SRF) reflect 
      Fitch's expectation that there remains an extremely high probability of 
      support from the U.S. government ('AAA'/ Outlook Stable) if required. 
      This expectation reflects the U.S.'s extremely high ability to support 
      its banks especially given its strong financial flexibility, though 
      propensity is becoming less certain. Specific to Goldman, our view of 
      support likelihood is based mostly on its systemic importance in the 
      U.S., its global interconnectedness given its size and operations in 
      global capital markets, and its position as a key provider of financial 
      services to the U.S. economy. Goldman's IDRs and senior debt ratings do 
      not benefit from support because Goldman's VR is equal to its SRF.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      However, in Fitch's view, there is a clear intention to reduce support 
      for G-SIFIs in the U.S., as demonstrated by the Dodd Frank Act (DFA) and 
      progress regulators have made on implementing the Orderly Liquidation 
      Authority (OLA). The FDIC has proposed its single point of entry (SPOE) 
      strategy and further initiatives are demonstrating the U.S. government's 
      progress to eliminate state support for U.S. banks going forward, which 
      increases the likelihood of senior debt losses if its banks fall afoul 
      of solvency assessments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SRF
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The SR and SRF are sensitive to progress made in finalizing the SPOE 
      strategy and any additional regulatory initiatives that may be imposed 
      on the G-SIFIs, including debt thresholds at the holding company. 
      Fitch's assessment of continuing support for U.S. G-SIFIs has to some 
      extent relied upon the feasibility of OLA implementation rather than its 
      enactment into law (when DFA passed). Hurdles that remain include the 
      resolution of how cross-border derivative acceleration/termination 
      provisions are handled and that there is sufficient contingent capital 
      at the holding company to recapitalize without requiring government 
      assistance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch expects that the SPOE strategy and regulatory action to ensure 
      sufficient contingent capital will be finalized in the near term, but 
      regardless of its finalization Fitch believes that sufficient regulatory 
      progress continues to be made over the ratings time horizon. Therefore, 
      Fitch expects to revise Goldman's Support Rating to '5' and its SRF to 
      'No Floor' within the next one to two years, likely to be some point in 
      the late 2014 or in 1H15.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A revision of the SRF to 'No Floor' would result in no change to 
      Goldman's Long-term IDR and debt ratings because Goldman's viability 
      rating is equal to the current SRF.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES -SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID 
      SECURITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by Goldman and by 
      various issuing vehicles are all notched down from Goldman's VR in 
      accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective 
      nonperformance and relative Loss Severity risk profiles. Their ratings 
      are primarily sensitive to any change in Goldman's VR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the 
      company's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits 
      benefit from depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives 
      deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in the event of default. 
      However, Goldman's uninsured deposits outside of the U.S. do not benefit 
      from rating uplift because they do not typically benefit from the U.S. 
      depositor preference unless the deposit is expressly payable at an 
      office of the bank in the United States. Since Fitch cannot determine 
      which foreign branch deposits may be dually payable, they do not get the 
      rating uplift.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings of long and short-term deposits issued by Goldman and its 
      subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in Goldman's IDR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman's IDR is equalized with those of its operating companies and 
      banks, reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is 
      mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of strength for its bank 
      subsidiaries, as well as the use of the holding company to fund 
      subsidiary operations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IDRs of major rated operating subsidiaries are equalized with Goldman's 
      IDR reflecting Fitch's view that these entities are core to Goldman's 
      business strategy and financial profile.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman is a top global bank with four business segments: investment 
      banking, institutional client services, investment management, and 
      investing and lending. Goldman, in September 2008, converted to a bank 
      holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve Board. Goldman is 
      designated as a G-SIFI by the Financial Stability Board.

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
NEW YORK, March 26 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed JPMorgan
Chase &amp; Co.'s 
(JPM) long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+' and
short-term IDR at 'F1'. 
Fitch has also affirmed JPM's viability rating (VR) at 'a+', its
support rating 
at '1', and its support rating floor (SRF) at 'A'. The Rating
Outlook is Stable. 
A full list of ratings is provided at the end of this release.
The rating actions have been taken in conjunction with a review
of support for 
banks globally and also as part of a periodic review of the
Global Trading and 
Universal Banks, which comprise 12 large and globally active
banking groups. 
Fitch's outlook for the sector is stable on balance. Earnings
pressure in 
securities businesses and continued conduct and regulatory risks
present in the 
GTUBs are offset by stronger balance sheets as capitalisation
and liquidity 
remain sound. Fitch forecasts stronger GDP growth in most
economies, which 
should contribute to a more balanced operating environment, but
the operating 
environment is likely to remain challenging in 2014.
Today's rating actions assume that JPM will perform adequately
under the CCAR 
stress test, though Fitch has no visibility into any potential
qualitative 
rejections for JPM, or any of the other 29 banks subject to
regulatory stress 
testing. Although a qualitative rejection of a capital plan
request under CCAR 
would be viewed negatively, it is not expected to have any
rating implications 
for JPM.
KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT
JPM's ratings affirmation reflects the strong underlying
earnings capacity of 
the bank, given its dominant domestic franchise and growing
international 
franchise, and progress made toward achieving compliance with
heightened capital 
and liquidity requirements. The affirmation also reflects the
firm's strong 
funding flexibility, given its deposit raising capabilities and
uninterrupted 
access to the global capital markets through an economic cycle. 
JPM's Basel III tier 1 common equity ratio improved from an
estimated 8.7% at 
year-end 2012 to 9.5% at year-end 2013, which is in-line with
management's 
target but lower than the peer average. Capital improvements
have been supported 
by growth in retained earnings and modest reductions in
risk-weighted assets, 
due largely to non-core portfolio run-off. Management is
targeting a ratio of 
10% by the end of 2014 and 10%-10.5% longer-term, which Fitch
believes is 
prudent, given the 9.5% minimum requirement. Fitch believes JPM
is well 
positioned to maintain compliance with Basel III capital
requirements, even with 
its higher G-SIFI loss absorbing buffer, given the superior
earnings capacity of 
the bank.
Fitch believes progress on compliance with the supplementary
leverage ratio 
(SLR) will extend into 2015, as certain structural adjustments
are required for 
the bank to reach a ratio of 6%. JPM converted some intercompany
debt into 
equity during the fourth quarter, which contributed to a 40
basis point increase 
in the bank's SLR, to 4.7% at year-end. However, the conversion
yielded an 
increase in the firm's double leverage to approximately 1.17
times (x), which 
Fitch believes is high, relative to historical standards.
Further increases in 
double leverage would be viewed negatively. Fitch expects JPM to
achieve full 
compliance with all regulatory requirements, well ahead of
required 
implementation, which for SLR is 2018. 
The bank's liquidity profile remains sound, with $522 billion of
high quality 
liquid assets at Dec. 31, 2013, up from $341 billion a year
earlier. Fitch 
believes the growth was largely driven by JPM's efforts to
accelerate compliance 
with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), which has been
achieved. Additionally, 
clarity regarding the direction of the net stable funding ratio
(NSFR) was 
released in a consultative document in January, and JPM believes
it is currently 
compliant with the requirements, which Fitch views favorably.   
Earnings performance has been highly resilient, particularly on
a relative 
basis, as the company remained profitable throughout the
financial crisis and 
continued to post relatively solid returns despite the
recognition of over $11.1 
billion of legal expenses in 2013. This is a testament to the
company's broad 
and diverse franchise. The firm had another strong year on a
core basis in 2013. 
Fitch estimates that pre-tax earnings were essentially flat, on
an adjusted 
basis, as weaker mortgage performance was offset by reduced
provision expenses 
and stronger asset management revenue. Core operating expenses
remained 
relatively flat, with efficiency measures funding higher costs
associated with 
the control agenda. 
JPM made significant progress settling a variety of outstanding
litigation 
during 2013 and early 2014, which Fitch views as a positive step
in moving 
beyond the headline issues stemming from the financial crisis.
Legal costs are 
likely to remain elevated in coming quarters, but Fitch expects
the incremental 
impact to earnings will be manageable. Still, the emergence of
material and 
unexpected litigation losses could alter the agency's view,
particularly given 
where the firm's current capitalization ratios compare to the
broader peer 
group. 
The Stable Outlook reflects expectations for continued operating
consistency, 
although Fitch believes credit costs will become a growing
headwind, as asset 
quality metrics rise from historical lows, and earnings are
likely to continue 
to be challenged by relatively low interest rates. A continued
focus on 
operational improvements is expected to offset the impact to
some extent. 
Investment banking results will remain dependent upon market
conditions, but 
JPM's strong market position and diverse product offering should
yield 
peer-superior performance. 
RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT
Going forward, Fitch believes JPM is going to be challenged to
deliver earnings 
growth, particularly in light of the current regulatory
environment. Higher 
capital charges and what remains difficult market conditions
present a challenge 
for all GTUBs, which may be encouraged to seek more aggressive
ways to generate 
profits that take advantage of regulatory changes. However,
Fitch expects that 
JPM's strong global franchise, liquidity risk management, and
product diversity 
mitigate some of these concerns.
Negative rating actions could result from reputational damage
that impacts the 
firms market position and/or material asset quality weakening
which pressures 
JPM's earnings and its ability to build capital, deterioration
in liquidity 
levels, material and unexpected litigation losses, and/or
failure to 
sufficiently address weaknesses noted in regulatory consent
orders and internal 
reviews following material losses in the chief investment
office. Further, 
significant risk management or operational failures that result
in material 
losses to the firm could also result in a negative rating
action.
Fitch considers JPM's ratings to be particularly sensitive to
the degree and 
scope of litigation risk going forward. Fitch recognizes that
the large 
litigation charge taken during the third quarter of 2013
reflects JPM's desire 
to address outstanding legal issues, related largely to
mortgage. To the extent 
JPM enters into any new and material litigation settlements,
Fitch will consider 
whether these effectively diminish ongoing legal risks.
Upward rating momentum for JPM is believed to be limited for the
foreseeable 
future given that its current rating level is among the highest
of its peer 
group and of the global bank universe. 
KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SRF
JPM's Support Rating (SR) and Support Rating Floor (SRF) reflect
Fitch's 
expectation that there remains an extremely high probability of
support from the 
U.S. government ('AAA'/Outlook Stable) if required. This
expectation reflects 
the U.S.'s extremely high ability to support its banks
especially given its 
strong financial flexibility, though propensity is becoming less
certain. 
Specific to JPM, Fitch's view of support likelihood is based
mostly on its 
systemic importance in the U.S., its global interconnectedness
given its size 
and operations in global capital markets, significant deposit
market share and 
its position as a key provider of financial services to the U.S.
economy. JPM's 
IDRs and senior debt ratings do not benefit from support because
JPM's VR is 
above its SRF.
However, in Fitch's view, there is a clear intention to reduce
support for 
G-SIFIs in the U.S., as demonstrated by the Dodd Frank Act (DFA)
and progress 
regulators have made on implementing the Orderly Liquidation
Authority (OLA). 
The FDIC has proposed its single point of entry (SPOE) strategy
and further 
initiatives are demonstrating the U.S. government's progress to
eliminate state 
support for U.S. banks going forward, which increases the
likelihood of senior 
debt losses if its banks run afoul of solvency assessments. 
KEY RATING DRIVERS &amp; SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SRF
The SR and SRF are sensitive to progress made in finalizing the
SPOE strategy 
and any additional regulatory initiatives that may be imposed on
the G-SIFIs, 
including debt thresholds at the holding company. Fitch's
assessment of 
continuing support for U.S. G-SIFIs has to some extent relied
upon the 
feasibility of OLA implementation rather than its enactment into
law (when DFA 
passed). Hurdles that remain include the resolution of how
cross-border 
derivative acceleration/termination provisions are handled and
that there is 
sufficient contingent capital at the holding company to
recapitalize without 
requiring government assistance. 
Fitch expects that the SPOE strategy and regulatory action to
ensure sufficient 
contingent capital will be finalized in the near term, but
regardless of its 
finalization Fitch believes that sufficient regulatory progress
continues to be 
made over the ratings time horizon. Therefore, Fitch expects to
revise JPM's 
Support Rating to '5' and its SRF to 'No Floor' within the next
one to two 
years, likely to be some point in late 2014 or 1H15. 
A revision of the SRF to 'No Floor' would mean no change to
JPM's Long-term IDR 
and debt ratings because JPM's viability rating is above the
SRF. 
KEY RATING DRIVERS &amp; SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER
HYBRID 
SECURITIES
Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by JPM and by
various issuing 
vehicles are all notched down from JPM's or its bank
subsidiaries' VRs in 
accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's
respective 
nonperformance and relative Loss Severity risk profiles. Their
ratings are 
primarily sensitive to any change in the VRs of JPM or its bank
subsidiaries. 
KEY RATING DRIVERS &amp; SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM
DEPOSIT RATINGS
JPM's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than
the company's 
IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits
benefit from 
depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit
liabilities 
superior recovery prospects in the event of default.
The ratings of long and short-term deposits issued by JPM and
its subsidiaries 
are primarily sensitive to any change in JPM's IDR. 
KEY RATING DRIVERS &amp; SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY 
JPM's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating
companies and banks, 
reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is
mandated in the U.S. 
to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. 
Common equity double leverage rose in late 2013 as the firm
converted certain 
intercompany debt into equity during the fourth quarter to boost
the bank's SLR 
ratio. Double leverage is at the high-end of the peer group, at
1.17x at Dec. 
31, 2013. Fitch would view further increases in double leverage
negatively. 
KEY RATING DRIVERS &amp; SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED
COMPANY 
The IDRs and VRs of JPM's bank subsidiaries benefit from the
cross-guarantee 
mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA and therefore IDRs and VRs
are equalized 
across the group. JPMorgan Securities LLC (JPMS) is a wholly
owned subsidiary 
that is the firm's U.S. broker dealer and is considered core to
JPM's business. 
As a result its IDR is equalized with that of its parent JPM.
Bear Stearns 
Companies, LLC and JPMorgan Clearing Corp. benefit from a parent
guarantee and 
therefore their IDRs are equalized with JPM's. Collateralized
Commercial Paper 
Co., LLC's short-term IDR benefits from JPMS's guarantee of the
amounts payable 
by the repo seller, JPMCC, and as result its short-term IDR is
equalized with 
that of JPMS. Collateralized Commercial Paper II Co., LLC's
short-term IDR is 
based on the repo seller, JPMS's ST IDR. 
JPM is a leading global trading and universal bank with $2.4
trillion in total 
assets and $17.9 billion of net income for the year ended Dec.
31, 2013.

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
NEW YORK, March 26 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed The
Goldman Sachs Group, 
Inc.'s (Goldman) Issuer Default Rating (IDRs) at 'A/F1', support
rating at '1', 
support rating floor (SRF) at 'A' and viability rating (VR) at
'a'. The Rating 
Outlook is Stable. A complete list of rating actions follows at
the end of this 
release. 
The rating actions on Goldman have been taken in conjunction
with a periodic 
review of the Global Trading and Universal Banks, which comprise
12 large and 
globally active banking groups. Fitch's outlook for the sector
is stable on 
balance. Earnings pressure in securities businesses and
continued conduct and 
regulatory risks present in the GTUBs are offset by stronger
balance sheets as 
capitalization and liquidity remain sound. Fitch forecasts
stronger GDP growth 
in most economies, which should contribute to a more balanced
operating 
environment, but the operating environment is likely to remain
challenging in 
2014.
Today's rating actions assume that Goldman will perform
adequately under the 
CCAR stress test, though Fitch has no visibility into any
potential qualitative 
rejections for Goldman, or any of the other 29 banks subject to
regulatory 
stress testing. Although a qualitative rejection of a capital
plan request under 
CCAR would be viewed negatively, it is not expected to have any
rating 
implications for Goldman. 
KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT 
Goldman's IDRs, VR and senior debt continue to be supported by
its leading 
investment banking franchise, solid liquidity position,
better-than-average 
capital position, and strong risk management. The ratings are
constrained by 
Goldman's focus on capital market activities and relatively
higher level of 
wholesale funding 
Goldman has higher reliance on capital market operations than
many global 
trading and universal banks (GTUBs). Fitch recognizes that
capital market 
revenues are inherently volatile and susceptible to declines in
difficult market 
periods. Concerns over this inherent volatility are offset by
management's 
successful track record in managing through difficult periods. 
Fitch believes that Goldman has a comparatively strong risk
management 
organization and systems to manage and monitor risk as
demonstrated by its 
ability to manage risk during period of market stress.
Goldman has consistently maintained liquidity at conservative
levels, which is 
viewed as appropriate given the company's reliance on wholesale
funding. 
Unencumbered highly liquid securities and cash was $184 billion
(20% of total 
assets) at year end 2013. Goldman's reliance on unsecured
short-term funding 
continues to be modest and the weighted average maturity of
secured funding 
remained constant during 2013. 
Goldman's capital position continues to improve and remains
comparatively 
strong. Fitch Core Capital to risk-weighted assets remained
higher than the GTUB 
average. Goldman's Tier I common ratio under the Basel III
advanced approach was 
approximately 9.8% at year-end 2013 (in line with the average of
U.S. GTUBs). 
Regulatory and legal issues appear manageable. Goldman and peers
face new 
capital markets regulations such as the Volcker Rule and
implementation of Basel 
III capital and liquidity standards. Goldman is projected to
meet new 
requirements well within allowable time frames. 
RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT 
Goldman's IDRs, VR and senior debt continue to be underpinned by
its leading 
investment banking franchise, solid operating profitability,
strong risk 
management, comfortable liquidity position and
better-than-average capital 
position. The ratings factor in Fitch core capital in line with
current levels 
and the management of capital comfortably above Basel III
capital minimums. The 
IDRs, VR and senior debt have limited upward potential, given
Goldman's business 
focus on the capital markets. 
Downward pressure on the VR could result from a material loss,
significant 
increase in leverage or deterioration in liquidity levels.
Similarly, any 
unforeseen outsized or unusual fines, settlements or charges
levied could also 
have adverse rating implications. Goldman's Long-term IDR could
be negatively 
pressured if both its financial profile deteriorates (reflected
in the VR) and 
Fitch's view of support of U.S. G-SIFIs change. 
KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATIING FLOOR 
Goldman's Support Rating (SR) and Support Rating Floor (SRF)
reflect Fitch's 
expectation that there remains an extremely high probability of
support from the 
U.S. government ('AAA'/ Outlook Stable) if required. This
expectation reflects 
the U.S.'s extremely high ability to support its banks
especially given its 
strong financial flexibility, though propensity is becoming less
certain. 
Specific to Goldman, our view of support likelihood is based
mostly on its 
systemic importance in the U.S., its global interconnectedness
given its size 
and operations in global capital markets, and its position as a
key provider of 
financial services to the U.S. economy. Goldman's IDRs and
senior debt ratings 
do not benefit from support because Goldman's VR is equal to its
SRF.
However, in Fitch's view, there is a clear intention to reduce
support for 
G-SIFIs in the U.S., as demonstrated by the Dodd Frank Act (DFA)
and progress 
regulators have made on implementing the Orderly Liquidation
Authority (OLA). 
The FDIC has proposed its single point of entry (SPOE) strategy
and further 
initiatives are demonstrating the U.S. government's progress to
eliminate state 
support for U.S. banks going forward, which increases the
likelihood of senior 
debt losses if its banks fall afoul of solvency assessments.
KEY RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SRF 
The SR and SRF are sensitive to progress made in finalizing the
SPOE strategy 
and any additional regulatory initiatives that may be imposed on
the G-SIFIs, 
including debt thresholds at the holding company. Fitch's
assessment of 
continuing support for U.S. G-SIFIs has to some extent relied
upon the 
feasibility of OLA implementation rather than its enactment into
law (when DFA 
passed). Hurdles that remain include the resolution of how
cross-border 
derivative acceleration/termination provisions are handled and
that there is 
sufficient contingent capital at the holding company to
recapitalize without 
requiring government assistance. 
Fitch expects that the SPOE strategy and regulatory action to
ensure sufficient 
contingent capital will be finalized in the near term, but
regardless of its 
finalization Fitch believes that sufficient regulatory progress
continues to be 
made over the ratings time horizon. Therefore, Fitch expects to
revise Goldman's 
Support Rating to '5' and its SRF to 'No Floor' within the next
one to two 
years, likely to be some point in the late 2014 or in 1H15.
A revision of the SRF to 'No Floor' would result in no change to
Goldman's 
Long-term IDR and debt ratings because Goldman's viability
rating is equal to 
the current SRF.
RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES -SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER
HYBRID SECURITIES 
Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by Goldman and
by various 
issuing vehicles are all notched down from Goldman's VR in
accordance with 
Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective
nonperformance and relative 
Loss Severity risk profiles. Their ratings are primarily
sensitive to any change 
in Goldman's VR. 
RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT
RATINGS
Goldman's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher
than the 
company's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured
deposits benefit 
from depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives
deposit liabilities 
superior recovery prospects in the event of default. However,
Goldman's 
uninsured deposits outside of the U.S. do not benefit from
rating uplift because 
they do not typically benefit from the U.S. depositor preference
unless the 
deposit is expressly payable at an office of the bank in the
United States. 
Since Fitch cannot determine which foreign branch deposits may
be dually 
payable, they do not get the rating uplift. 
The ratings of long and short-term deposits issued by Goldman
and its 
subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in Goldman's
IDR. 
RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY 
Goldman's IDR is equalized with those of its operating companies
and banks, 
reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is
mandated in the U.S. 
to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries, as
well as the use of 
the holding company to fund subsidiary operations. 
RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED
COMPANIES 
IDRs of major rated operating subsidiaries are equalized with
Goldman's IDR 
reflecting Fitch's view that these entities are core to
Goldman's business 
strategy and financial profile. 
Goldman is a top global bank with four business segments:
investment banking, 
institutional client services, investment management, and
investing and lending. 
Goldman, in September 2008, converted to a bank holding company
regulated by the 
Federal Reserve Board. Goldman is designated as a G-SIFI by the
Financial 
Stability Board.

described by the United States as "the personal bank for senior
officials" of Russia.

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's main opposition party would welcome more foreign direct investment in defense, if elected, but would delay opening up the country's market of more than 1.2 billion people to international retail chains like Wal-Mart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which surveys show is on course to win the most seats in an election starting on April 7, would also introduce a general sales tax and overhaul the financial sector, its manifesto will say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Party sources told Reuters these concrete steps form the core of a pitch to voters that sets ambitious goals of creating 250 million jobs over the next decade, building up to 100 'smart' cities and constructing a high-speed rail network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The manifesto's priorities, in this order, are jobs, investment, manufacturing and infrastructure," one BJP official involved in drafting the document revealed to Reuters before its publication next week.

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects to remove erroneous RIC)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Shyamantha Asokan and Rajesh Kumar Singh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI, March 26 (Reuters) - India's leading opposition
party would aim to create 250 million jobs over the next 10
years as part of an economic development programme that could
create 100 new 'smart' cities, its election manifesto will say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has put
jobs and urbanisation at the centre of its policy pitch as it
seeks to oust the Congress-led government in a general election
starting on April 7, two party sources told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The manifesto's priorities, in this order, are jobs,
investment, manufacturing and infrastructure," said one party
official involved in drafting the document, which is expected to
be released next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BJP, on course to win the largest number of seats in the
five-week election, wants to tap into the aspirations of young
people in a country where more than half of the population is
under the age of 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the Congress party, which was due to unveil its
own election manifesto on Wednesday, is running campaign ads
that depict smiling artisans making bricks or weaving by hand -
an appeal to its core constituency of poor voters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BJP's candidate for prime minister, Narendra Modi, is
also campaigning on his record of economic development running
his home state, Gujarat, which on many metrics has performed
better than the national average over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other points, the BJP will propose introducing a national
general sales tax - seen as key to getting rid of a hodge-podge
of existing levies to make tax collection more effective - and
streamlining subsidies, a second source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the party is cautious about opening up so-called
'multi-brand' retail to foreign direct investors such as
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Tesco, as this could
pose an existential threat to millions of small traders that
constitute a big voter constituency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The domestic retail industry needs to be first made
competitive before allowing foreign investment," the second
source said.

			Riverbed Enables MTC Australia to Adopt &#8220;Cloud First&#8221; Strategy, 
      Accelerates Delivery of Microsoft Office 365 up to 300%
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Riverbed solution improves MTC Australia network performance greater 
      than 10x, reduces bandwidth upgrade costs by two-thirds and offers fast 
      access to cloud-based applications
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Riverbed Technology (NASDAQ: RVBD), the leader in application 
      performance infrastructure, today announced MTC Australia has deployed 
      components of the Riverbed&#174; Application Performance PlatformTM 
      for its &#8220;cloud first&#8221; strategy to accelerate the delivery of Office 365, 
      reduce bandwidth consumption and improve network and application 
      performance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Tweet 
      This: Riverbed enables MTC Australia to adopt &#8220;cloud first&#8221; 
      strategy and improves network performance by 10x: rvbd.ly/1eLnKAc
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MTC Australia, a not-for-profit organization, helps people in Australia 
      gain employment, skills training and work experience. With more than 30 
      locations and over 500 staff, the organization assists approximately 
      35,000 people annually through training courses, employment services, 
      youth programs and community initiatives. In mid-2013, Branko Ceran 
      joined the organization as CIO and started overhauling its aging 
      infrastructure by implementing a &#8220;cloud first&#8221; strategy, which included 
      cloud-based Office 365 and Lync, along with other business-critical 
      applications running in MTC Australia&#8217;s own private cloud. As a result, 
      on-site applications were going to be hosted remotely, which caused 
      concern about network performance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We wanted to move everything we could to the cloud and needed to make 
      this move without impacting application performance for employees,&#8221; said 
      Ceran. &#8220;With Riverbed, we have accelerated application delivery up to 
      300%, resulting in sub-second response times for Office 365, which is 
      located in a datacenter 4,000 miles away. We have also been able to 
      reduce bandwidth upgrade costs by two-thirds.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a result of moving to the cloud, the company&#8217;s network traffic 
      increased two to three times, so MTC Australia deployed Riverbed 
      Steelhead, the #1 WAN optimization solution, to accelerate the delivery 
      of applications and eliminate the need to increase bandwidth. To avoid 
      latency issues with cloud solutions, including Office 365 and other 
      business-critical applications, MTC Australia deployed the Riverbed 
      Steelhead Cloud Accelerator.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MTC Australia also deployed Riverbed Stingray&#174; Traffic ManagerTM 
      to inspect, prioritize and route application traffic. The #1 virtual 
      application delivery controller (ADC) for scalable, secure and elastic 
      delivery of enterprise, cloud and e-commerce applications, Riverbed 
      Stingray is the only virtual ADC that is software-based with an &#8220;ADC per 
      application&#8221; delivery model. Together, the Riverbed Steelhead QoS 
      functionality along with Riverbed Stingray Traffic Manager ensure that 
      mission-critical Lync Enterprise voice data has priority over other 
      types of traffic.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Riverbed Steelhead and Riverbed Stingray solutions &#8211; part of the 
      Riverbed Application Performance Platform&#8482; &#8211; were installed nationally 
      across 28 offices and two data centers in less than a month and began 
      providing immediate results. The Riverbed Application Performance 
      Platform is a set of integrated solutions that give companies the 
      flexibility to host applications and data in the locations that best 
      serve the business while ensuring the flawless delivery of those apps to 
      better leverage global resources, radically reduce the cost of running 
      their business and maximize employee productivity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Riverbed Steelhead
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Riverbed Steelhead is the industry&#8217;s #1 WAN optimization solution that 
      accelerates the delivery of applications to the branch and from the 
      cloud, and allows IT to prioritize delivery of mission-critical 
      applications over the fastest networks. The only leader in the &#8220;Gartner 
      Magic Quadrant for WAN Optimization Controllers&#8221; for six years in a row, 
      Steelhead pioneered WAN optimization in 2004 with unique innovations for 
      application and data streamlining across the WAN and Internet to deliver 
      the best end-user experience regardless of location, network or device 
      while dramatically reducing network bandwidth. With Steelhead, SaaS apps 
      can be delivered up to 33x faster while using 97% less bandwidth. As a 
      result, Steelhead has become critical to Microsoft Office 365 
      deployments with over one million users being accelerated to date.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Riverbed Stingray
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Riverbed Stingray is a family of application delivery products that 
      provides visibility and control of traffic to and from applications, 
      enabling fast, reliable and secure application delivery to users 
      anywhere from the cloud or data center. It is a complete software-based 
      Layer 7 application delivery controller (ADC) with integrated web 
      content optimization (WCO) and application firewall that enables 
      companies to deliver optimized and secure application delivery services 
      where and when they are needed in an elastic manner. Riverbed&#8217;s unique 
      approach automates the deployment, licensing and metering of application 
      delivery services, making possible an &#8220;ADC per application&#8221; delivery 
      model in which costs for ADC-as-a-Service can be allocated to each 
      client application. This unique approach reduces costs and time to 
      production while enabling rapid change and scale for data center 
      applications.

		&lt;h1&gt;Fresche Legacy RD Efforts Translate Into Big Gains for Companies With Business Applications and Data on IBM i&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Latest release of market leading X-Analysis solution gives IBM i users something to smile about&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;MONTREAL, CANADA--(Marketwired - Mar 26, 2014) - Fresche Legacy, a leading provider of legacy technology management solutions serving the IBM i and HP Midrange markets announced today the release of X-Analysis V10, a market leading solution for documentation and design recovery for IBM i environments and the flagship product of Fresche Legacy's Databorough division.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;New capabilities for automated analysis, modernization, documentation, consolidation and export of business rules from legacy code&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Over recent years, customer modernization projects have driven demand for better control and reuse of business rules embedded in legacy RPG, COBOL and CA 2E (Synon) applications. This release of X-Analysis has been significantly enhanced to provide new capabilities for automated analysis, documentation, data modernization, and consolidation and export of business rules from legacy code. It also adds powerful features for annotation and visualization. Users of the tool can now easily and accurately synchronise business, regulatory, and modernization requirements within their software code.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;New management and measurement features make software upgrades more efficient&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;To speed and ease the upgrade path for various vendor software releases, X-Analysis 10 also adds new management and measurement features, including powerful and sophisticated complexity, problem and difference analysis inquiries and trend reports. For instance, an IT organization planning an upgrade of the Oracle JD Edwards World ERP system can leverage X-Analysis 10 to easily report the differences between current releases (and customizations) and the latest 9.3 release or even interim releases and cumulative PTFs. This capability makes upgrades and installation of PTFs more efficient and cost-effective.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;"Complexity metrics and maintainability indices are the foundation of any efficient development practice," says Garry Ciambella, Vice President of RD. "This release of X-Analysis provides IT organizations and IBM i development managers with a much clearer set of measurable inputs to quantify resource requirements and run development projects. There's a lot less guesswork and much better results."&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;New tools to enhance database modernization efforts&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;For companies focused on database modernization to achieve better performance and security, X- Analysis 10 offers a unique set of automated tools for the database modernization lifecycle, including auto extracting foreign keys from RPG, Cobol or Synon, modernization problem analysis, automated conversion of DDS to DDL with modern long names and derived constraints, complete automation of data conversion and constraint extraction from RPG. Unique to X-Analysis 10, modernizing DDS to DDL is done without impact to the business, as recompiling the applications is not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Andy Kulakowski, President and CEO of Fresche Legacy states that: "X-Analysis has gained its stellar reputation in the IBM i market by allowing IT executives to better understand and measure the size, usage and complexity of their RPG, CA 2E/Synon, COBOL and Java applications, isolate code bases around a particular business function or division, and better understand complexity and identify problems upfront. This improves the project planning and costing process for IT project teams, minimizes redundancies and unknowns in the project cycle, and ultimately builds confidence among business stakeholders in IT delivery timelines and resource requirements."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pfizer Achieves Primary Endpoint With Phase 3B Top-Line Results Of 
      GENOTROPIN&#174; In Very Young Children Born Small For Gestational Age
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today the top-line results from a Phase 
      3B study evaluating the 24-month efficacy of GENOTROPIN&#174; (somatropin) on 
      the height in small-for-gestational-age (SGA) children 24-30 months old. 
      The primary endpoint of the study was achieved: there was a 
      statistically significant difference at 24 months in change from 
      baseline height between patients treated with GENOTROPIN and those in 
      the untreated control group, as measured by height standard deviation 
      score (SDS).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The study was intended to generate additional data regarding the safety 
      and efficacy of GENOTROPIN treatment in subjects born SGA who fail to 
      achieve catch-up growth by two years of age. The study results showed, 
      after 24 months of treatment, the GENOTROPIN group had a statistically 
      significantly greater gain in height SDS compared to the untreated 
      control group.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The study was a controlled, multi-center study, randomizing SGA children 
      to GENOTROPIN or an untreated control group. There were 43 participants 
      from 16 centers in eight European countries, including Spain, Italy, 
      Belgium, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Germany, Sweden and Netherlands. 
      Participants in the study were between 24-30 months old and were 
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive GENOTROPIN 0.035 mg/kg/d or no 
      treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A total of 39 participants completed the study, with two GENOTROPIN 
      participants and two control-group participants withdrawing from the 
      study. A total of 14 serious adverse events were reported in eight 
      participants. Two serious adverse events, occurring to one participant, 
      were deemed to be related to treatment with GENOTROPIN. The adverse 
      events observed in the study were consistent with the known safety 
      profile of GENOTROPIN.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About GENOTROPIN
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      GENOTROPIN is a man-made, prescription treatment option, approved in the 
      United States for children who do not make enough growth hormone on 
      their own, have the genetic condition called Prader-Willi syndrome 
      (PWS), were born smaller than most other babies, have the genetic 
      condition called Turner syndrome (TS) or have idiopathic short stature 
      (ISS). GENOTROPIN is also approved to treat adults with growth hormone 
      deficiency. GENOTROPIN is taken by injection just below the skin and is 
      available in a wide range of devices to fit a range of individual dosing 
      needs. GENOTROPIN is just like the natural growth hormone that our 
      bodies make and has an established safety profile.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Important GENOTROPIN&#174; Safety Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Growth hormone should not be used to increase height in children after 
        the growth plates have closed.
      
			
        Growth hormone should not be used in patients with diabetes who have 
        certain types of diabetic retinopathy (eye problems).
      
			
        Growth hormone should not be used in patients with cancer or who are 
        being treated for cancer. Growth hormone deficiency can be caused by 
        brain tumors. So, the presence of these brain tumors should be ruled 
        out before treatment is started. Growth hormone should not be used if 
        it is shown that a previous brain tumor has come back or is getting 
        larger.
      
			
        Growth hormone should not be used in patients who are critically ill 
        because of surgery, trauma, or respiratory failure.
      
			
        Growth hormone should not be used in children with Prader-Willi 
        syndrome who are very overweight or have severe breathing problems.
      
			
        GENOTROPIN should not be used by patients who have had an allergy or 
        bad reaction to somatropin or any of the other ingredients in 
        GENOTROPIN.
      
			
        Some patients have developed diabetes mellitus while taking 
        GENOTROPIN. Dosage of diabetes medicines may need to be adjusted 
        during growth hormone treatment. Patients should be watched carefully 
        if growth hormone is given along with glucocorticoid therapy and/or 
        other drugs that are processed by the body in the same way.
      
			
        In childhood cancer survivors, treatment with growth hormone may 
        increase the risk of a new tumor, particularly certain benign brain 
        tumors. This risk may be higher in patients who were treated with 
        cranial radiation. Also, patients and their doctors should check 
        regularly for any skin changes.
      
			
        A small number of patients treated with growth hormone have had 
        increased pressure in the brain. This can cause headaches and problems 
        with vision. Treatment should be stopped and reassessed in these 
        patients. Patients with Turner syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome may 
        be at higher risk of developing increased pressure in the brain.
      
			
        Thyroid function should be checked regularly during growth hormone 
        therapy. Thyroid hormone replacement therapy should be started or 
        adjusted if needed.
      
			
        Patients treated with growth hormone should be checked regularly if 
        they are receiving standard hormone replacement therapy to treat a 
        lack of more than one hormone.
      
			
        In children experiencing rapid growth, curvature of the spine may 
        develop or worsen. This is also called scoliosis. Patients with 
        scoliosis should be checked regularly to make sure their scoliosis 
        does not get worse during their growth hormone therapy.
      
			
        In children experiencing rapid growth, limping or hip or knee pain may 
        occur. If a child getting growth hormone therapy starts to limp or 
        gets hip or knee pain, the child&#8217;s doctor should be notified and the 
        child should be examined.
      
			
        Growth hormone should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. 
        It should be used with caution in nursing mothers because it is not 
        known whether growth hormone is passed into human milk.
      
			
        Use a different place on the body each day for growth hormone 
        injections. This can help to prevent skin problems such as lumpiness 
        or soreness.
      
			
        Some cases of pancreatitis (inflamed pancreas) have been reported 
        rarely in children and adults receiving growth hormone. There is some 
        evidence that there is a greater risk of this in children than in 
        adults. Literature suggests that girls who have Turner syndrome may 
        have a greater risk of pancreatitis than other children taking growth 
        hormone. In any child who develops lasting, severe abdominal pain, 
        pancreatitis should be considered.
      
			
        In studies of GENOTROPIN in children with GHD, side effects included 
        injection site reactions, such as pain, redness/swelling, 
        inflammation, bleeding, scarring, lumps, or rash. Other side effects 
        were fat loss, headache, blood in the urine, low thyroid activity, and 
        mildly increased blood sugar.
      
			
        In studies of GENOTROPIN in children born SGA, side effects included 
        temporarily elevated blood sugar, increased pressure in the brain, 
        early puberty, abnormal jaw growth, injection site reactions, growth 
        of moles, and worsening of scoliosis (curvature of the spine).
      
			
        Deaths have been reported with the use of growth hormone in children 
        with Prader-Willi syndrome. These children were extremely overweight, 
        had breathing problems, and/or lung infection. All patients with 
        Prader-Willi syndrome should be examined for these problems. They 
        should also establish healthy weight control.
      
			
        In studies of GENOTROPIN in children with PWS, side effects included 
        fluid retention, aggressiveness, joint and muscle pain, hair loss, 
        headache, and increased pressure in the brain.
      
			
        Turner syndrome patients taking growth hormone therapy may be more 
        likely to get ear infections. This is also called otitis media.
      
			
        In studies of GENOTROPIN in children with Turner syndrome, side 
        effects included flu, throat, ear, or sinus infection, runny nose, 
        joint pain, and urinary tract infection.
      
			
        In studies of GENOTROPIN in children with ISS, side effects included 
        respiratory illnesses, flu, throat infection, inflammation of the nose 
        and throat, stomach pain, headaches, increased appetite, fever, 
        fracture, mood changes, and joint pain.
      
			
        Women who are taking estrogen by mouth may take GENOTROPIN. They may 
        need a larger dose of growth hormone.
      
			
        GENOTROPIN may be taken by the elderly. Elderly patients may be more 
        likely to have side effects with growth hormone therapy.
      
			
        In studies of GENOTROPIN in adults with GHD, side effects included 
        fluid retention, joint or muscle pain, stiffness, and changes in 
        sensation. Usually these side effects did not last long and depended 
        on the dose of GENOTROPIN being taken.
      
			
        GENOTROPIN cartridges contain m-Cresol and should not be used by 
        patients allergic to it.
      
			
        A health care provider will help you with the first injection. He or 
        she will also train you on how to inject GENOTROPIN.

			GENOTROPIN Indications and Usage in the U.S.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      GENOTROPIN is a prescription product for the treatment of growth failure 
      in children:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Who do not make enough growth hormone on their own. This condition is 
        called growth hormone deficiency (GHD).
      
			
        With a genetic condition called Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Growth 
        hormone is not right for all children with PWS. Check with your doctor.
      
			
        Who were born smaller than most other babies born after the same 
        number of weeks of pregnancy. Some of these babies may not show 
        catch-up growth by age 2 years. This condition is called small for 
        gestational age (SGA).
      
			
        With a genetic condition called Turner syndrome (TS).
      
			
        With idiopathic short stature (ISS), which means that they are shorter 
        than 98.8% of other children of the same age and sex; they are growing 
        at a rate that is not likely to allow them to reach normal adult 
        height, and their growth plates have not closed. Other causes of short 
        height should be ruled out. ISS has no known cause.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      GENOTROPIN is a prescription product for the replacement of growth 
      hormone in adults with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) that started 
      either in childhood or as an adult. Your doctor should do tests to be 
      sure you have GHD, as appropriate.

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's main opposition party would welcome more foreign direct investment in defense, if elected, but would delay opening up big-box retail to global players now barred from the country's market of more than 1.2 billion people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which opinion polls show is on course to win the most seats in an election starting April 7, would also introduce a general sales tax and overhaul the financial sector, its manifesto is likely to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Party sources told Reuters these concrete steps form the core of a pitch to voters that sets aspirational goals of creating 250 million jobs over the next decade, building up to 100 'smart' cities and constructing a high-speed rail network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The manifesto's priorities, in this order, are jobs, investment, manufacturing and infrastructure," said one BJP official involved in drafting the document due out next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BJP's candidate for prime minister, Narendra Modi, is campaigning on his economic record in running his home state, Gujarat, where the party trumpets an unemployment rate of less than a third of the national average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the Congress party, which was unveiling its own manifesto on Wednesday, is running campaign ads that depict smiling artisans making bricks or weaving by hand - an appeal to its core constituency of poor voters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the BJP platform seeks to tap into the hopes of 100 million first-time voters whose job prospects have been hurt by a slowdown in economic growth, the tenets of 'Modinomics' remain nebulous beyond a broad focus on supply-side reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most of these proposals have been discussed by other parties too," said Shumita Sharma Deveshwar, a director at Trusted Sources, a policy advisory firm. "The key is implementation of these policies. That is the bigger challenge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAUTIOUS OPENING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BJP's policy platform takes a cautious stance towards opening up the Indian economy, Asia's third largest, to foreign direct investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be no quick move to allow the likes of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. or Tesco to enter so-called 'multi-brand' retail, which would pose an existential threat to small traders who form a key BJP constituency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The domestic retail industry needs to be first made competitive before allowing foreign investment," a second BJP source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the BJP would propose raising a cap on foreign ownership of Indian defense industry enterprises to 49 percent from 26 percent now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although India spends only a third as much as China on defense, it is the world's largest market for arms exports - reflecting a failure of past governments to turn around the state-dominated domestic defense industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legacy of dependence on the Soviet security umbrella has been prolonged by corruption scandals that have held up deals with foreign partners that would have moved production to India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can save huge foreign exchange by producing defense equipment at home," the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(We would) raise the FDI cap, (and) allow Indian companies to enter into joint ventures with foreign companies. It could be an arrangement where Indian partners hold the majority stake, say 51 percent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other points, the BJP is expected to propose a national general sales tax - key to getting rid of a hodge-podge of existing levies. More broadly, the BJP will seek to improve tax collection by lowering rates and closing loopholes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A "broad consensus" exists to overhaul the financial sector to turn India into an international hub, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts caution that the BJP and its allies, which polls show falling around 40 seats short of a majority, may end up having to strike a series of compromises to cobble together a parliamentary majority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of this is theoretical and open to question right now," said Deveshwar. "Let's see what kind of coalition is formed after the election."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Shyamantha Asokan and Rajesh Kumar Singh; Additional reporting by Frank Jack Daniel; Writing by Douglas Busvine; Editing by John Chalmers and Clarence Fernandez)&lt;/p&gt;

			IBM and Otsuka Develop Transformative Care Coordination Solution
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM and Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Otsuka) today announced they 
      are teaming to deliver a novel solution intended to improve care 
      coordination in the mental health community.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Many challenges face mental healthcare delivery networks worldwide. 
      Currently, almost 10 percent of patients discharged from a state 
      psychiatric hospital in the U.S. are readmitted within 30 days, and over 
      20 percent more are readmitted within 180 days. In the U.S., the cost of 
      re-incarceration of persons who suffer from severe mental illness is $15 
      billion. The IBM and Otsuka solution aims to help providers and 
      communities reduce hospital readmissions and re-incarcerations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The solution is designed to connect providers of mental health services 
      including system leaders, payers, community mental health centers, 
      hospitals, criminal justice systems, and social program organizations. 
      It is expected to help create more comprehensive patient health records. 
      Customized to meet the unique needs of each community that uses it, the 
      focus across users will remain on improving the quality and efficiency 
      of patient care.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are very pleased to be working with a leader such as IBM to bring 
      science and technology together to build novel solutions to mental 
      health challenges,&#8221; said Dieter Weinand, president of global 
      commercialization and portfolio management for Otsuka Pharmaceutical 
      Development  Commercialization, Inc. &#8220;With our long history and 
      experience in the market, we know that many of the challenges of mental 
      illness lie far beyond medication in a delivery system that is 
      fragmented and inconsistent. Together with IBM, we aim to help transform 
      the mental healthcare system, optimize the use of scarce resources more 
      effectively, and improve the care and quality of life for society&#8217;s most 
      vulnerable populations.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The companies will initially work with communities across the U.S. and 
      the U.K., with the intention to expand internationally. Both companies 
      contribute resources and expertise to make the solution successful. IBM 
      brings sophisticated information management and care coordination 
      software, as well as strategic consulting in smarter care, and Otsuka, a 
      big venture healthcare company, contributes a deep understanding of 
      neuroscience, the mental healthcare industry and delivery system 
      dynamics.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our hope is that by providing the right infrastructure to connect all 
      the providers in the system, patients will receive more holistic care,&#8221; 
      said Karen Parrish, vice president of industry solutions in IBM&#8217;s 
      Software Group. &#8220;Our focus is on applying technology to make healthcare 
      smarter.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since 2012, Otsuka has been collaborating with the South Florida 
      Behavioral Health Network in Miami-Dade County to pilot a comprehensive 
      solution aimed at improving the coordination of care. This ongoing 
      community-based project marks the first application of the new solution 
      from IBM and Otsuka. It uses custom-developed software and change 
      management expertise to support the transformational efforts underway in 
      South Florida.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As an organization, we look proactively for creative solutions to 
      coordinate care for our patients,&#8221; said John W. Dow, president and chief 
      executive officer of the South Florida Behavioral Health Network, Inc. 
      &#8220;We invited Otsuka and IBM to conduct this pilot because of their 
      innovative approach to improving efficiencies within our mental health 
      system.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The technology platform combines IBM software to coordinate care, and 
      various data management tools with Otsuka&#8217;s deep disease-specific 
      subject matter expertise in mental health to improve the following:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Utilization management, including eligibility, enrollment and consent
      
			
        Care coordination across clinical and social programs settings

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's new Chief Executive Officer, Satya Nadella, finally unveiled Office for Apple Inc's iPad in a polished debut that set him apart from his energetic predecessor while signaling his plans to make mobile apps the top priority at the world's largest software company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a news conference Thursday, executives demonstrated a new "touch-first" version of Office crafted for the iPad, available for download as a free app, though a subscription is needed to let users create or edit documents rather than just read them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significantly, they did not demonstrate any software on Windows machines, telegraphing a departure from former Chief Executive Steve Ballmer's focus on the personal computer operating software and its own devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their absence speaks volumes," said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. "Nadella's a cloud-centric guy; he's going to focus on what's been successful, and where the future's going. Windows 8 thus far has been extremely underwhelming."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella kicked off the presentation with a fluid, low-key introduction to Microsoft's approach to the new mobile, cloud-centric world of computing, in his first public appearance since taking the helm 52 days ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dressed in a black polo shirt and dark jeans, the 46-year-old computer scientist threw in some geek humor and lines of poetry from T.S. Eliot, marking a change in style from his energetic predecessor Steve Ballmer. His lack of references to Windows indicated a deeper strategic shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella gave no indication of when Microsoft would release "touch-first" versions of Office apps for Windows 8, the latest version of the operating software, which he acknowledged had fallen behind in the mobile era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Windows strategy, there's no change, except we want to be known as the innovative company that's coming from behind in some categories," Nadella told reporters in an ad hoc question and answer session after the presentation, another sign of new openness at the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you look at the story of Windows, we lead in some, we have fallen behind in some. We're grounded in that reality," he said. "What we need to be is a challenger there and be able to show what we're capable of doing in these new form factors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from the absence of any Windows devices, the Surface, one of Ballmer's prized concepts, was conspicuously missing from a show floor at the event that included Google Inc Android tablets from Samsung and Acer as well as the iPad. Nadella did not mention the poor-selling tablet at all in conversations with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OFFICE, AT LAST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Office apps are free to download from Apple's app store, but to create new documents, users will need a subscription to Microsoft's existing cloud-based service called Office 365.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Office 365 Home Premium, designed for home consumers, costs $100 a year. For businesses it costs $60 or more per year, depending on features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple gets its standard 30 percent cut of new Office 365 Home subscriptions sold through its app store, but no share of existing Office 365 revenue or multiple subscriptions bought by companies. That is analogous to the way Apple treats magazine subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Welcome to the #iPad and @AppStore!" Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook tweeted after the announcement. "Thanks @tim_cook, excited to bring the magic of @Office to iPad customers," Nadella tweeted back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have estimated that Microsoft could rake in anywhere from $840 million to $6.7 billion a year in revenue from iPad-native Office, although some fear it may have moved too late to grab the attention of many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Easy to use, touch-friendly work apps like Haiku Deck, Quip, Smartsheet and Evernote, not to mention Google Apps, have quickly gained a following among younger users who have never worked with Office applications, or relish the change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources have said an iPad-friendly version of Office - which encompasses such popular applications as Word, Excel and PowerPoint - had been ready for years, but the Redmond, Washington-based company had been reluctant to compromise its signature PC operating system. At the time, the sources could not speak because they were not authorized to talk to the press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Microsoft's own efforts to produce a touch-friendly operating system capable of challenging the iPad have floundered, with poor sales of its Surface tablet, and a general lack of interest from third party hardware makers in making tablets running Windows 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella's willingness to break with the Windows tradition, which remains co-founder Bill Gates' most enduring legacy, helped spur Microsoft shares to $40-plus levels not seen since the dotcom boom of 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street is now guardedly optimistic on a company that, while still garnering billions of dollars in annual profit, risks gradual obsolescence in a mobile-powered tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To some investors, steering a new course for such a massive entity - Microsoft is the second-largest U.S. tech company by market value - is a daunting task. Before Nadella's appointment, some investors had hoped for an outsider open to change to take the reins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But bold moves with Office, and signifying a renewed drive to conquer the mobile arena and 'cloud' computing after years of shackling its best products to PC-centric Windows, are seen as a promising start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He talks the talk," said Ives at FBR, referring to Nadella. "Now the big question is, will he walk the walk?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gerry Shih and Bill Rigby in Seattle; Editing by Bernard Orr and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's new Chief Executive Officer, Satya Nadella, finally unveiled Office for Apple Inc's iPad in a polished debut that set him apart from his energetic predecessor while signaling his plans to make mobile apps the top priority at the world's largest software company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a news conference Thursday, executives demonstrated a new "touch-first" version of Office crafted for the iPad, available for download as a free app, though a subscription is needed to let users create or edit documents rather than just read them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significantly, they did not demonstrate any software on Windows machines, telegraphing a departure from former Chief Executive Steve Ballmer's focus on the personal computer operating software and its own devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their absence speaks volumes," said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. "Nadella's a cloud-centric guy; he's going to focus on what's been successful, and where the future's going. Windows 8 thus far has been extremely underwhelming."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella kicked off the presentation with a fluid, low-key introduction to Microsoft's approach to the new mobile, cloud-centric world of computing, in his first public appearance since taking the helm 52 days ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dressed in a black polo shirt and dark jeans, the 46-year-old computer scientist threw in some geek humor and lines of poetry from T.S. Eliot, marking a change in style from his energetic predecessor Steve Ballmer. His lack of references to Windows indicated a deeper strategic shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella gave no indication of when Microsoft would release "touch-first" versions of Office apps for Windows 8, the latest version of the operating software, which he acknowledged had fallen behind in the mobile era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Windows strategy, there's no change, except we want to be known as the innovative company that's coming from behind in some categories," Nadella told reporters in an ad hoc question and answer session after the presentation, another sign of new openness at the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you look at the story of Windows, we lead in some, we have fallen behind in some. We're grounded in that reality," he said. "What we need to be is a challenger there and be able to show what we're capable of doing in these new form factors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from the absence of any Windows devices, the Surface, one of Ballmer's prized concepts, was conspicuously missing from a show floor at the event that included Google Inc Android tablets from Samsung and Acer as well as the iPad. Nadella did not mention the poor-selling tablet at all in conversations with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OFFICE, AT LAST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Office apps are free to download from Apple's app store, but to create new documents, users will need a subscription to Microsoft's existing cloud-based service called Office 365.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Office 365 Home Premium, designed for home consumers, costs $100 a year. For businesses it costs $60 or more per year, depending on features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple gets its standard 30 percent cut of new Office 365 Home subscriptions sold through its app store, but no share of existing Office 365 revenue or multiple subscriptions bought by companies. That is analogous to the way Apple treats magazine subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Welcome to the #iPad and @AppStore!" Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook tweeted after the announcement. "Thanks @tim_cook, excited to bring the magic of @Office to iPad customers," Nadella tweeted back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have estimated that Microsoft could rake in anywhere from $840 million to $6.7 billion a year in revenue from iPad-native Office, although some fear it may have moved too late to grab the attention of many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Easy to use, touch-friendly work apps like Haiku Deck, Quip, Smartsheet and Evernote, not to mention Google Apps, have quickly gained a following among younger users who have never worked with Office applications, or relish the change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources have said an iPad-friendly version of Office - which encompasses such popular applications as Word, Excel and PowerPoint - had been ready for years, but the Redmond, Washington-based company had been reluctant to compromise its signature PC operating system. At the time, the sources could not speak because they were not authorized to talk to the press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Microsoft's own efforts to produce a touch-friendly operating system capable of challenging the iPad have floundered, with poor sales of its Surface tablet, and a general lack of interest from third party hardware makers in making tablets running Windows 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella's willingness to break with the Windows tradition, which remains co-founder Bill Gates' most enduring legacy, helped spur Microsoft shares to $40-plus levels not seen since the dotcom boom of 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street is now guardedly optimistic on a company that, while still garnering billions of dollars in annual profit, risks gradual obsolescence in a mobile-powered tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To some investors, steering a new course for such a massive entity - Microsoft is the second-largest U.S. tech company by market value - is a daunting task. Before Nadella's appointment, some investors had hoped for an outsider open to change to take the reins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But bold moves with Office, and signifying a renewed drive to conquer the mobile arena and 'cloud' computing after years of shackling its best products to PC-centric Windows, are seen as a promising start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He talks the talk," said Ives at FBR, referring to Nadella.

The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act, and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and other applicable securities laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy used the net proceeds of the offerings of the Notes to repay in full its term loan A under its Credit Agreement, increase its liquidity and pay fees and expenses related thereto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 17, 2014, Walter Energy entered into an amendment (the "Sixth Amendment") to its $2.725 billion credit agreement, dated as of April 1, 2011 (as amended, the "Credit Agreement"), as described in Walter Energy's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 18, 2014. The Sixth Amendment, among other things, (i) permits Walter Energy to repay the term loan A under its Credit Agreement without making a pro rata repayment to the term loan B under its Credit Agreement, (ii) extends the maturity of 81.6% of its revolving commitments to October 2017, with such extending lenders having their revolving commitments reduced by 20%, (iii) provides for amendments to certain incurrence covenants to provide additional flexibility for Walter Energy, (iv) eliminates the liquidity and fixed charge coverage maintenance covenants, (v) modifies the secured leverage ratio covenant, including to make it apply only to the commitments of the extending revolving lenders and (vi) provides for a 0.50% increase in the interest rate payable on the term loan B under the Credit Agreement. The Sixth Amendment became effective upon consummation of the offerings of the New First Lien Notes and the Second Lien Notes, the repayment in full of the term loan A and other customary conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This press release does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to sell or buy any securities, in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Walter Energy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy is a leading, publicly traded "pure-play" metallurgical coal producer for the global steel industry with strategic access to high-growth steel markets in Asia, South America and Europe.

		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Virtual LoadMaster for Azure Allows Customers to Adopt a Hybrid Cloud Strategy and Integrate Existing Enterprise Applications Into Microsoft's IaaS Platform&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Mar 27, 2014) -  KEMP Technologies' Virtual LoadMaster (VLM) for Azure -- a mature, full-featured, enterprise-class Layer 7 persistence load balancing solution running in Windows Azure -- is now commercially available in three feature-enhanced performance profiles ranging up to 5Gb processing throughput and 10,000 SSL transactions per second. This will allow customers to seamlessly move their private cloud enterprise applications into a hybrid deployment using Azure and scale their application delivery services as application needs increase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Azure provides deployment flexibility and scale-as-you-grow cost savings, while enabling increased infrastructure agility, so that organizations can roll out major workload applications like SharePoint in hours as opposed to days or weeks," said Venkat Gattamneni, Senior Product Marketing Manager, Azure, Microsoft. "With Virtual LoadMaster for Layer 7 offering highly available, security-enhanced and scalable load balancer services in Azure, customers are assured of a comparable level of enterprise-class performance quality and standards that they experience with existing on-premises applications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Services enables applications to be easily provisioned and subscribed to in Azure. Mid-market and enterprise customers require advanced Layer 7 application visibility and traffic management control across&#160;Azure Virtual Machines. Virtual LoadMaster for Azure meets this need with Layer 7 application delivery functionality, application-aware health check monitoring and resource utilization, and global geo load balancing to ensure optimal application request routing performance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For supply chain execution software provider, Accellos, cloud computing enables its customers to remove the cost and complexity of technical execution they cannot afford to do on-premises. However, migrating customer-facing applications to the cloud requires robust security, session-persistence and high availability features that only KEMP's VLM can provide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Accellos recently established a new suite of cloud services in Azure, with several critical objectives in mind. Namely, our cloud services needed to scale, load balance, be automatable, and of course, be secured. Kemp helped us deliver on all of those goals." said Jared Mendenhall, the cloud product manager for Accellos, the leading supply chain software provider for logistics service providers. "Kemp's reverse proxy and load balancing functionality is proving to be a crucial component of our offerings, as it maintains session persistence for load balanced connections and adds an additional layer of security that our customers have come to expect. Furthermore, our team can secure and load balance our solutions quickly and efficiently via Kemp's PowerShell interface."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitoring application instance health at Layer 7 is a critical function for distributing user requests based upon data captured in application layer protocols such as HTTPS. Running enterprise-class applications in the cloud without a robust Layer 7 load balancing solution increases the risk of compromises in performance, availability, and security. KEMP LoadMaster's persistent Layer 7 data monitoring capability directly tracks and verifies the performance of individual applications, thus providing a multi-dimensional view of application delivery health status. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Jetze Mellema, former Microsoft MVP for Exchange Server and principal solutions consultant for Imara ICT, a KEMP partner based in the Netherlands, "There is no better illustration of this customer requirement than the movement of Microsoft productivity and collaboration apps to the cloud." The primary technical focus of Imara ICT is Microsoft messaging, virtualization, System Center and cloud infrastructure augmentation with IaaS platforms such as Azure.&#160;Imara ICT recently leveraged KEMP's Virtual LoadMaster for Azure in the architecture of a large social housing organization's application infrastructure. This environment included Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) with ADFS proxy servers running in Azure to provide single sign-on to the Office 365 environment. This hybrid architecture provided the best availability and flexibility for the customer, and VLM for Azure's local and GSLB load balancing was the glue that held it all together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Azure allows us to create a load-balanced set of Endpoints and KEMP's VLM for Azure enables us to load balance traffic from the customer's on-premise datacenter coming over the VPN as well," said Mellema. "We were also able to add secure features and perform real-time health checks via VLM for Azure. It is impossible to build this type of enterprise-class environment without a dynamic load balancer like KEMP's Virtual LoadMaster."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executive Quote:
				"Monitoring and optimizing cloud services at Layer 7 with LoadMaster for Azure ensures that, in an e-commerce scenario, for example, shopping cart applications display accurate information about products that are available for purchase over the Web or mobile device, while simultaneously ensuring that the company's payment transaction portal isn't being overloaded on the same server or VM," said Atchison Frazer, chief marketing officer, KEMP Technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About KEMP Technologies
				KEMP Technologies is the leading provider of application-centric load balancer solutions, used by thousands of businesses that consider IT, e-commerce, web and business applications as mission-critical to their long-term success. KEMP helps companies rapidly grow their business by providing 24/7 infrastructure availability, better web performance and secure operations -- while streamlining IT costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KEMP's LoadMaster products include Layers 4-7 load balancing, content switching, server persistence, SSL offload/acceleration, and application front-end capabilities (caching, compression, intrusion prevention system), plus one full year of product support -- delivering industry-leading price/performance advantages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is headquartered in New York City with significant operations in Limerick, Ireland.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Wintergreen Advisers, LLC on behalf of its clients has asked the Board 
      of Directors and the Compensation Committee of The Coca-Cola Company to 
      withdraw the proposed 2014 Equity Plan from shareholder consideration at 
      the 2014 Shareholder Meeting. We believe the proposed Plan should be 
      redesigned in a manner which is fair to both Coca-Cola shareholders and 
      Coca-Cola management. Existing Coca-Cola equity plans contain more than 
      66 million shares which should be more than adequate to cover awards for 
      2014. The full text of the letter, which has been sent to Coca-Cola&#8217;s 
      Board of Directors and Coca-Cola&#8217;s largest shareholder Warren Buffett, 
      CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B), is included below.

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dear Coca-Cola Board Members,
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In our prior communications, Wintergreen Advisers, LLC (&#8220;Wintergreen&#8221;) 
      relied solely on The Coca-Cola Company&#8217;s (&#8220;Coca-Cola&#8221; or &#8220;the Company&#8221;) 
      2014 proxy statement and the Company&#8217;s 2014 Equity Plan (the &#8220;Plan&#8221;) to 
      inform ourselves on the issue at hand. The &#8220;single number&#8221; we pulled 
      from the Company&#8217;s proxy statement, the 14.2% potential dilution figure 
      from page 86, is in our minds the single most important number found in 
      the filing, as it represents the portion of shareholder wealth which 
      could be transferred to management for services rendered. With share 
      awards adequate to last for another year available under previous equity 
      plans, we do not believe there is a need for Coca-Cola to seek 
      shareholder approval for a new plan at this time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Let us be very clear &#8211; we love The Coca-Cola Company. It is a solid 
      company with many of the world&#8217;s most valuable brands; it possesses a 
      deep economic moat; and it has generally strong management. It has all 
      the attributes of a wonderful long-term investment, as evidenced by the 
      Company&#8217;s lengthy history as a widely-held public company. But the 
      proposed 2014 Equity Plan is a bad plan. It is bad for all shareholders. 
      It is bad for the approximately 95% of Coca-Cola employees who will not 
      be eligible to participate in this plan. We are perfectly happy to see 
      managers who produce outstanding results be very well compensated. But 
      asking for nearly 8% of the company over the next 4 years, on top of the 
      potential dilution from outstanding equity awards, is simply too much.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      I propose that the Board of Directors (&#8220;the Board&#8221;) withdraw the 2014 
      Equity Plan from consideration at the 2014 Annual Meeting of 
      Shareholders. Coca-Cola&#8217;s Board and Compensation Committee should rely 
      on existing equity plans which, according to the Company&#8217;s proxy 
      statement, have 66,948,651 shares remaining, which should suffice to 
      cover awards for another year. This will provide the Board with time to 
      design an improved plan which can be proposed for a vote at the 2015 
      Shareholders Meeting.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new plan should include many of the same positive attributes that 
      the Board recently touted &#8211; no re-pricing of options, a fungible share 
      pool, and claw-back provisions. It should have publicly disclosed and 
      clearly defined performance hurdles for named executives which must be 
      met to be eligible for awards.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The current Plan discloses only the criteria which may be used as 
      performance goals, but does not disclose the hurdle rate for those 
      criteria. How can shareholders judge the fairness of a performance award 
      if we don&#8217;t know if the executive is required to clear a six inch hurdle 
      or a six foot hurdle? These performance goals should also take the 
      Company&#8217;s amount of debt into consideration, a criteria currently absent 
      from the list. Coca-Cola&#8217;s debt level has increased significantly in 
      recent years, and the impact of that debt should be accounted for when 
      evaluating executive performance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As far as what size is appropriate for a revised equity plan, we think 
      the plan should envision an annual dilution rate at or below the recent 
      annual average of 1.3% rather than the proposed Plan&#8217;s 1.9%. Although 
      the difference between 1.3% and 1.9% dilution may seem trivial on its 
      face, the difference translates into an additional 26 million shares of 
      potential dilution per year. The 2008 Plan authorized a split-adjusted 
      280,000,000 for awards and lasted for approximately six years; the 2014 
      proposal envisions 340,000,000 grants being made over only four years. 
      This is a dramatic increase in the number of potential awards, made over 
      a much shorter number of years. This means increased potential dilution 
      for all shareholders. The 2008 Plan also included a provision that no 
      individual could be awarded more than 5% of the shares authorized by the 
      plan, a clause notably absent from the 2014 Plan. We believe Coca-Cola&#8217;s 
      shareholders would be better served by something much more closely 
      resembling the 2008 Plan in duration and size than the 2014 Plan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      When details of a new equity plan are disclosed, we believe Coca-Cola 
      should present the potential dilutive impact in a more candid manner. 
      Currently, the Company calculates dilution by including &#8220;total award 
      shares&#8221; in addition to current outstanding shares in the denominator, a 
      formula found on page 86 of the Company proxy and which is replicated 
      below.

		&lt;p&gt;
      We believe this is misleading. The true potential dilutive impact of an 
      equity plan is diminished by including award shares in the denominator 
      as opposed to using only current outstanding shares. If potential 
      dilution were to be calculated in a more straightforward manner, by 
      excluding Award Shares from the denominator, the 14.2% figure from page 
      86 of the proxy statement would rise to approximately 16.6%, as shown 
      below.

		&lt;p&gt;
      By calculating potential dilution in the manner the Company has, we 
      believe the combined potential dilutive impact of the prior plans and 
      2014 Plan could be understated by several billion dollars. While 14.2% 
      of Coca-Cola is worth approximately $24 billion at today&#8217;s share price, 
      16.6% is worth approximately $28 billion, an additional $4 billion in 
      potential value that shareholders are being asked to give to management. 
      In 2001 the SEC noted that &#8220;overhang&#8221; from equity compensation plans is 
      &#8220;often expressed as a percentage of the total number of outstanding 
      securities.&#8221; Although this is not a formal SEC rule, it clearly provides 
      a truer picture of the dilutive impact of equity compensation plans than 
      the method currently used by Coca-Cola. General Electric is another 
      prominent American company which has chosen to disclose potential 
      dilution in this manner and we hope that Coca-Cola would follow suit. We 
      believe that the Company should disclose the critically important 
      potential dilution number in a more straightforward and prominent manner 
      - front and center within your proxy statement, rather than burying it 
      86 pages deep where most shareholders are unlikely to see it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      No matter how the potential dilutive impacts of the Coca-Cola&#8217;s equity 
      compensation plans are calculated, the impact is clear &#8211; there will 
      potentially be a staggeringly large transfer of wealth from shareholders 
      to management at a time when we believe Company&#8217;s results have been less 
      than stellar. Between existing plans and the proposed 2014 Plan, there 
      is the potential for several percentage points of dilution each year. 
      This would directly reduce shareholder returns by a similar amount each 
      year. It is hard to see how this proposed Plan is in the best interests 
      of the Coca-Cola Company, its investors, or corporate America, which may 
      mimic such pay practices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We hope these issues can be resolved quickly and to the satisfaction of 
      concerned shareholders so that the Company may get back to the business 
      of growing volumes and profits.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Sincerely,

      ATT, Cisco, GE, IBM and Intel today announce the formation of the 
      Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC), an open membership group focused 
      on breaking down the barriers of technology silos to support better 
      access to big data with improved integration of the physical and digital 
      worlds. The consortium will enable organizations to more easily connect 
      and optimize assets, operations and data to drive agility and to unlock 
      business value across all industrial sectors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      An ecosystem of companies, researchers and public agencies is emerging 
      to help drive adoption of Industrial Internet applications, a 
      foundational element for accelerating the Internet of Things. The IIC is 
      a newly formed not-for-profit group with an open membership that will 
      take the lead in establishing interoperability across various industrial 
      environments for a more connected world. Specifically, the IIC&#8217;s charter 
      will be to encourage innovation by:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Utilizing existing and creating new industry use cases and test beds

      &#8220;We are at the precipice of a major technological shift at the 
      intersection of the cyber and physical worlds, one with broad 
      implications that will lead to substantial benefits, not just for any 
      one organization, but for humanity,&#8221; said Janos Sztipanovits, E. Bronson 
      Ingram Distinguished Professor of Engineering and Director of the 
      Institute for Software Integrated Systems (ISIS), Vanderbilt University. 
      &#8220;Academia and industry understand the need to identify and establish new 
      foundations,&#160;common frameworks and standards for the Industrial 
      Internet, and are looking to the IIC to ensure that these efforts come 
      together into a cohesive whole.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As founding members, ATT, Cisco, GE, IBM and Intel will each hold 
      permanent seats on an elected IIC Steering Committee along with four 
      other elected members. The Steering Committee will provide leadership 
      and governance to help organizations capitalize on this vast opportunity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Given the importance of this technology, the federal government is 
      investing over $100 million/year in RD related to cyberphysical 
      systems, and has been partnering with the private sector on a series of 
      testbeds in areas such as healthcare, transportation, smart cities, and 
      increasing the security of the electric grid.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;By linking physical objects to the full power of cyberspace, the 
      Industrial Internet promises to dramatically reshape how people interact 
      with technology,&#8221; said Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker. &#8220;The 
      Administration looks forward to working with public-private 
      collaborations like the new IIC to turn innovative Industrial Internet 
      products and systems into new jobs in smart manufacturing, health care, 
      transportation and other areas.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The IIC is open to any business, organization or entity with an interest 
      in accelerating the Industrial Internet. In addition to gaining an 
      immediate, visible platform for their opinions, consortium members will 
      join in developing critical relationships with leaders in technology, 
      manufacturing, academia and the government on working committees. The 
      IIC will be managed by Object Management Group (OMG), a nonprofit trade 
      association in Boston, MA. The fee structure and membership application 
      forms are available at www.iiconsortium.org.

They also must submit customer references that demonstrate successful projects (along with implementing a yearly customer satisfaction study), meet a revenue commitment (for most gold competencies), and pass technology and/or sales assessments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From award-winning fax management technology to innovative secure file transfer solutions, Biscom provides organizations worldwide with market-leading tools and services that boast enterprise-class functionality, integration and scalability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This Microsoft Gold Application Development competency showcases our expertise in and commitment to today's technology market and demonstrates our deep knowledge of Microsoft and its products," said Bill Ho, president at Biscom. "We plan to accelerate our customers' success by serving as technology advisors for their business demands."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By achieving a gold competency, partners have demonstrated the highest, most consistent capability and commitment to the latest Microsoft technology," said Phil Sorgen, corporate vice president, Worldwide Partner Group at Microsoft Corp. "These partners have a deep expertise that puts them in the top 1 percent of our partner ecosystem, and their proficiency will help customers drive innovative solutions on the latest Microsoft technology."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earning the Application Development competency helps partners differentiate themselves as a trusted expert to their customers through development and deployment of commercial or custom applications built using core Microsoft technologies like Windows Server and Windows 8 operating systems, the Windows Azure platform, Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 development system, Microsoft BizTalk Server and emerging cloud-based and web business models. By gaining access to a comprehensive set of benefits through the Application Development competency, partners can acquire new customers and help them be more productive and profitable through deployment of business applications, advanced web portals or rich client user interfaces that run on premises or in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft Partner Network helps partners strengthen their capabilities to showcase leadership in the marketplace on the latest technology, to better serve customers and to easily connect with one of the most active, diverse networks in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

			JPMorgan Chase Plans Dividend Increase and $6.5 Billion Capital 
      Repurchase Program
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE:JPM) announced today that, following the 
      Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s release of the 2014 Comprehensive Capital 
      Analysis and Review (CCAR) results, its Board of Directors intends to 
      increase the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.40 per share, 
      effective the second quarter of 2014. The Board has also authorized a 
      common equity repurchase program to repurchase $6.5 billion of common 
      equity between April 1, 2014, and March 31, 2015. This authorization 
      includes shares repurchased to offset issuances under the Firm&#8217;s 
      equity-based compensation plans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Federal Reserve Board informed the Firm that it does not object to 
      the Firm&#8217;s proposed 2014 capital distribution plan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase said:&#160;&#8220;We are pleased 
      that our Board intends to raise the dividend and has authorized us to 
      continue our equity buyback program. We anticipate reaching a Basel III 
      Tier I common ratio of 10% by the end of this year, taking into account 
      these capital actions and our ongoing investments in our growing 
      businesses.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Firm&#8217;s dividends will be subject to the Board&#8217;s approval at the 
      customary times those dividends are declared. The 2014 second quarter 
      dividend, which the Board intends to increase to $0.40 per share, would 
      be for shareholders of record on July 3, 2014, payable on July 31, 2014. 
      Upon the declaration of a dividend in the second quarter of 2014 in an 
      amount in excess of $0.38 per share, the Exercise Price and the Warrant 
      Share Number for the warrants (as defined in the warrants) to purchase 
      shares of common stock of the Firm may be adjusted. Further information 
      regarding the warrants and adjustments to the warrant Exercise Price and 
      the Warrant Share Number is available on the Firm&#8217;s website at jpmorganchase.com, 
      under the heading Investor Relations, Shareholder Information: &#8220;Warrant 
      Information.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Repurchases of equity will be pursuant to the common equity repurchase 
      program of $15.0 billion previously authorized by the Firm&#8217;s Board of 
      Directors on March 13, 2012. As of the date of this press release, $8.3 
      billion of repurchase capacity was remaining under such program. The 
      timing and exact amount of common equity purchased will be consistent 
      with the Firm&#8217;s capital plan and will depend on various factors, 
      including market conditions, the Firm&#8217;s capital position, internal 
      capital generation, alternative investment opportunities, and legal and 
      regulatory considerations; the Firm&#8217;s repurchase program does not 
      include specific price targets or timetables, and may be executed 
      through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, 
      including the use of Rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any 
      time.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STEVENSON, Md., March 28, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brower Piven, A Professional Corporation announces that a class action lawsuit has been commenced in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida on behalf of purchasers of Walter Investment Management Corporation ("Walter Investment" or the "Company") (NYSE:WAC) securities during the period between May 9, 2012 and February 26, 2014, inclusive (the "Class Period").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	If you have suffered a net loss from investment in Walter Investment securities purchased on or after May 9, 2012 and held through the revelation of negative information on March 18, 2013 and/or February 27, 2014, as described below, you may obtain additional information about this lawsuit and your ability to become a lead plaintiff, at no cost to you, by contacting Brower Piven at www.browerpiven.com, by email at hoffman@browerpiven.com, by calling 410/415-6616, or at Brower Piven, A Professional Corporation, 1925 Old Valley Road, Stevenson, Maryland 21153. Attorneys at Brower Piven have combined experience litigating securities and class action cases of over 60 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	No class has yet been certified in the above action. Members of the Class will be represented by the lead plaintiff and counsel chosen by the lead plaintiff.&#160;If you wish to choose counsel to represent you and the Class, you must apply to be appointed lead plaintiff no later than May 6, 2014 and be selected by the Court.&#160;The lead plaintiff will direct the litigation and participate in important decisions including whether to accept a settlement and how much of a settlement to accept for the Class in the action. The lead plaintiff will be selected from among applicants claiming the largest loss from investment in Company units during the Class Period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The complaint accuses the defendants of violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by virtue of the defendants' failure to disclose during the Class Period that the Company lacked adequate internal controls over financial accounting and compliance with applicable laws and that the Company's business practices violated consumer financial protection laws, thereby jeopardizing future revenues and profits such that the Company's financials were false and misleading.&#160; According to the complaint, following the Company's March 18, 2013 disclosure that Company management identified a material weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting and the Company's February 27, 2014 announcement that the FTC issued a Civil Investigation Demand to Company subsidiary Green Tree Servicing LLC requesting information relating to the company's operations, the value of Walter Investment shares declined significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	If you choose to retain counsel, you may retain Brower Piven without financial obligation or cost to you, or you may retain other counsel of your choice.&#160;You need take no action at this time to be a member of the class.&lt;/p&gt;CONTACT: Charles J. Piven

			Pfizer Statement on U.S. FDA Approval of Over-the-Counter Nexium&#174; 
      24HR
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 
      over-the-counter Nexium&#174; 24HR (esomeprazole 20mg) marking a 
      key step towards providing those who suffer from frequent heartburn 
      broader access to a brand doctors and patients have trusted for years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In 2012, Pfizer acquired exclusive global rights from AstraZeneca to 
      market non-prescription Nexium&#174;. The addition of Nexium&#174; 24HR 
      to the Pfizer Consumer Healthcare portfolio expands the breadth of 
      categories in which we help consumers better manage their health, and 
      extends the value of the world&#8217;s leading prescription acid blocker brand.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Switching medicines, whenever appropriate, from prescription to 
      non-prescription status improves access, empowers consumers to care for 
      their own health and is an important strategy for Pfizer,&#8221; said Paul 
      Sturman, President, Pfizer Consumer Healthcare. &#8220;The FDA approval of 
      Nexium&#174; 24HR is a significant milestone in executing against 
      our plan.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We continue to work closely with AstraZeneca and retail partners to make 
      Nexium&#174; 24HR available to consumers in the U.S., with other 
      markets in Europe expected to follow this year.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp, under fire for accessing an employee's private Hotmail account to prove he was leaking computer code to a blogger, has said it will now refer all suspicions of illegal activity on its email services to law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision, announced by head lawyer Brad Smith on Friday, reverses Microsoft's initial reaction to complaints last week, when it laid out a plan to refer such cases to an unidentified former federal judge, and proceed to open a suspect email account only if that person saw evidence to justify it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Effective immediately, if we receive information indicating that someone is using our services to traffic in stolen intellectual or physical property from Microsoft, we will not inspect a customer's private content ourselves," said Smith, in a blog post on the software company's website.

"Therefore, rather than inspect the private content of customers ourselves in these instances, we should turn to law enforcement and their legal procedures."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Tom Brown)&lt;/p&gt;

email account before taking the matter to legal authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said last week its actions were within its legal
rights under the terms of use of its email services, but has now
acknowledged that its actions raised concerns about customer
privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue is poignant for Microsoft, which routinely
criticizes Google Inc for serving up ads based on the
content of users' Gmail correspondence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has also been campaigning for more transparency in the
legal process through which U.S. intelligence agencies can get
access to email accounts following the revelations of former
National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While our own search was clearly within our legal rights,
it seems apparent that we should apply a similar principle and
rely on formal legal processes for our own investigations
involving people who we suspect are stealing from us," said
Smith in his blog. "Therefore, rather than inspect the private
content of customers ourselves in these instances, we should
turn to law enforcement and their legal procedures."

		&lt;p&gt;

      Supports Ongoing Mission Operations --
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Orbital 
      Sciences Corporation (NYSE: ORB), one of the world&#8217;s leading space 
      technology companies, congratulates the Dawn Flight Team, headed by 
      NASA&#8217;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), for its selection as recipients 
      of the 2014 Smithsonian National 
      Air and Space Museum (NASM) Trophy 
      for Current Achievement. This prestigious award recognizes the 
      accomplishments of the Dawn Flight Team for operating the deep-space 
      asteroid exploration spacecraft which reached Vesta in mid-2011, 
      examined the near planet-size asteroid from a low-altitude orbit for 
      over a year, and continued its journey to explore the dwarf planet 
      Ceres, which it will reach in early 2015. Dawn was launched from Cape 
      Canaveral in September 2007.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Orbital designed, built and tested the spacecraft and supports ongoing 
      mission operations. The Dawn spacecraft incorporates a revolutionary ion 
      propulsion system developed by NASA, which enables the spacecraft to 
      continuously accelerate. This key technology made the orbit of two large 
      solar system bodies possible, the first time it will ever have been done 
      by one spacecraft on a single mission.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Drawing upon cost-effective and flight-proven spacecraft technology, 
      Orbital designed and produced the Dawn spacecraft, which measures 20 
      meters (or 65 feet) wide with its solar panels deployed and incorporates 
      instruments provided by mission partners from Italy, Germany and the 
      U.S., at the company&#8217;s manufacturing and test facilities in Dulles, VA. 
      Dawn is Orbital&#8217;s second deep-space planetary mission, following the 
      Deep Space 1 spacecraft built at the company&#8217;s Gilbert, AZ operations 
      and launched in 1999.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About the Dawn Program
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dawn has traveled 4.4 billion kilometers (or 2.7 billion miles) since 
      launch, reaching the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and 
      orbiting its first target. Dawn arrived at Vesta in July 2011. Vesta is 
      the second most massive body in the main belt, the brightest of the 
      asteroids, and the only one visible with the naked eye from Earth. The 
      spacecraft spent over a year orbiting the asteroid, mapping the body and 
      conducting other remote sensing observations using a suite of science 
      instruments. Dawn departed from Vesta&#8217;s orbit in September 2012 and is 
      currently en-route to rendezvous with the largest asteroid, Ceres, in 
      early 2015. Dawn will collect similar scientific data at Ceres to what 
      it gathered at Vesta.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Earth-based studies indicate that these two protoplanets have very 
      different and complementary compositions, providing clues to the 
      conditions and processes of planetary formation. Recent observations by 
      the Herschel Space Observatory confirm the presence of water vapor 
      surrounding Ceres, making the close-up observations planned by Dawn even 
      more intriguing for the science community.

&lt;p&gt;HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe will not attend a European Union-Africa summit next week if his wife is denied a visa to travel with him, his spokesman said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mugabe, 90, and his wife Grace are subject to travel bans by the EU because of allegations about human rights abuses and election-rigging but the union allowed Zimbabwe's sole ruler to attend the meeting after pressure from the African Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two-day summit starts on April 2 in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are sovereign and equals and the EU cannot decide on our delegations. The president, and Zimbabwe will not be there if they continue to hold out on the visa," Mugabe's spokesman George Charamba said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EU ambassador to Zimbabwe Aldo Dell'Ariccia told a local radio station on Friday the bloc had not given a visa to Grace because there was no program for wives of presidents and there was no need for her to attend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by MacDonald Dzirutwe and Cris Chinaka; Editing by Ed Stoddard and Angus MacSwan)&lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Global Hadoop Market 2014-2018: with Cloudera Inc, 
      Hortonworks Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/jwg6xt/global_hadoop) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Hadoop Market 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysts forecast the Global Hadoop market to grow at a CAGR of 
      42.04 percent over the period 2013-2018. One of the key factors 
      contributing to this market growth is the increasing generation of 
      structured and unstructured data. The Global Hadoop market has also been 
      witnessing the increasing consideration for NoSQL by developers. 
      However, the lack of skilled professionals could pose a challenge to the 
      growth of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Key vendors dominating this space are Amazon Web Services Inc., Cloudera 
      Inc., EMC Corp., Hortonworks Inc., IBM Corp., MapR Technologies Inc., 
      and Microsoft Corp.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Other vendors mentioned in the report are Datameer Inc., DataStax Inc., 
      Hadapt Inc., HStreaming llc, Karmasphere Inc., NGDATA Inc., Oracle 
      Corp., Pentaho Corp., Teradata Corp., and Zettaset Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from the team said: The Database 
      industry has long been dominated by relational databases that were 
      capable of meeting end-user requirements. However, with the changing 
      business scenarios and competitive environment, end-users are demanding 
      more effective Big Data solutions that can increase the productivity of 
      the organization. This requirement can be met with NoSQL databases such 
      as Hadoop, Cassandra, and Couchbase servers. With these databases, a 
      more flexible platform is available for developers. Also, scalability 
      issues and complex processing of data is possible with these databases. 
      NoSQL models are also schemaless, making it easier to constantly and 
      rapidly add new datasets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers is the increasing 
      generation of structured and unstructured data.

&lt;p&gt;BUENOS AIRES, March 30 (Reuters) - Argentina is closing in
on a deal to receive around $1 billion in loans from investment
bank Goldman Sachs and is in talks with other
international banks about similar deals, local newspaper
Pagina/12 reported on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper, which has close ties with the government of
President Cristina Fernandez, said the two-year loan would be
announced in the next few days and carry an annual interest rate
of 6.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be the first time in more than a decade the country
has received a substantial loan from international creditors and
comes as the government seeks cash to avoid a further
devaluation of the peso.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Economy Ministry did not provide immediate comment on
the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government wants the new funds to boost its depleted
foreign exchange reserves, the paper said, citing an unnamed
government source. The reserves will see a further improvement
in April with the export of the country's grain harvest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dollars have been scarce in Argentina due to capital flight,
weak exports, and low competitiveness because of high inflation.
The country has also been shut out of international capital
markets since a massive 2002 default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government also hoped securing the Goldman Sachs loan
would demonstrate that its strategy of thawing relations with
international creditors was starting to take effect, said the
paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Argentina has offered to repay a debt of around $9.5 billion
to the Paris Club of creditor nations stemming from the 2002
default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The club had accepted Argentina's initial proposal to pay
back the funds without recourse to the International Monetary
Fund and to request credit lines from the countries it owed
money to, Pagina/12 said in a separate report on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks were continuing over the repayment terms, it added.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Monday named three executives to its cloud, devices and Xbox gaming divisions in one of new Chief Executive Satya Nadella's first management shakeups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a public email, the world's largest software maker promoted Scott Guthrie to head of the cloud and enterprise group, the $20 billion division that Nadella helmed before replacing Steve Ballmer as CEO in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Nokia Oyj chief executive Stephen Elop - at one time considered a candidate to replace Ballmer - will join Microsoft as executive vice president of the devices group, reporting to Nadella, after Microsoft closes its $7.2 billion acquisition of the Finnish device manufacturer. The two companies announced the transaction in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also named Phil Spencer to lead its Xbox operation, reporting to operating systems group chief Terry Myerson. As the head of hardware, Elop will also play a role in developing the Xbox, Nadella said in the memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speculation has mounted for years over the fate of the Xbox business, which has been deemed a potential candidate for a spin-off by some analysts and Microsoft insiders. Bloomberg reported last year during the CEO search that Elop, then the front-runner to replace Ballmer, favored a sale himself, although his thinking may have evolved since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella, who unveiled Office for Apple mobile devices at his first public appearance last week, signaled that he would shift the company's emphasis away from prioritizing its Windows operating system at the expense of other initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As I said on my first day, we need to do everything possible to thrive in a mobile-first, cloud-first world," Nadella said in an email. "The announcements last week, our news this week, the Nokia acquisition closing soon, and the leaders and teams we are putting in place are all great first steps in making this happen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gerry Shih; editing by Andrew Hay)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York judge has allowed Chevron Corp to sue Patton Boggs over claims that the Washington law and lobbying firm engaged in fraud while trying to enforce a multibillion-dollar environmental judgment for a group of Ecuadorean villagers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Adds comment from the general counsel of Patton Boggs)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Casey Sullivan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 31 (Reuters) - A New York judge has allowed
Chevron Corp to sue Patton Boggs over claims that the
Washington law and lobbying firm engaged in fraud while trying
to enforce a multibillion-dollar environmental judgment for a
group of Ecuadorean villagers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan gave his ruling on Monday

Patton Boggs' argument that a New York court did not have
jurisdiction to hear the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is about holding accountable all those who are

Tyrrell leading the enforcement efforts, according to court

bribery, fraud and extortion in pursuit of the multibillion-
dollar judgment, according to court papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Patton Boggs began enforcement efforts, Chevron in May
asked Kaplan if it could bring counterclaims against the firm
that it had concealed Donziger's fraudulent tactics, among other
things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said in court papers that Tyrrell took the case
despite having ethical concerns about its merits but did so
because of "enormous financial pressure at Patton Boggs,"
according to court papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyrrell and Patton Boggs have denied the claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, Patton Boggs claimed the court lacked jurisdiction
because its partners consisted of "stateless" persons stationed
in Dubai, Doha, Abu Dhabi and other foreign locations and could
not be tried in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaplan said on Monday the Patton Boggs partners in question
"at least arguably were domiciliaries of the states of the
United States" and the firm had the burden of proving partners
intended to give up their U.S. domiciles or take up domicile in
a foreign country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That burden has not been sustained here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patton Boggs is in merger talks with the larger firm Squire

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co must face a lawsuit from shareholders accusing it of securities fraud by misleading them about its ability to manage risk, which surfaced when it lost $6.2 billion in the "London Whale" scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge George Daniels in Manhattan said shareholders could pursue claims that JPMorgan, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon and former Chief Financial Officer Douglas Braunstein knowingly hid the increased risks that the bank's Chief Investment Office had been taking in early 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In separate decisions also issued on Monday, the judge also dismissed a lawsuit brought against JPMorgan directors, and a lawsuit by employees over their losses from investing in the bank's stock in their retirement accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $6.2 billion loss was linked to trades by Bruno Iksil, a French national who had worked in a bank office in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniels said shareholders may pursue claims that the bank, Dimon and Braunstein committed fraud by materially understating the bank's "value at risk," and misleading them on an April 13, 2012 earnings call when Dimon labeled as a "tempest in a teapot" reports about a synthetic credit portfolio that Iksil managed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The statements were material as they were made immediately after the financial news media revealed that (the) CIO had amassed a huge position in exotic derivative instruments, and defendants were attempting to reassure investors that those trades were under control," Daniels wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Plaintiffs have adequately alleged that defendants Dimon and Braunstein knew fact or had access to information suggesting that their public statements were not accurate," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniels also dismissed claims against three other JPMorgan officials: Ina Drew, who led the CIO; Mike Cavanagh, who preceded Braunstein as CFO; and Barry Zubrow, who had been the bank's chief risk officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TWO OTHER LAWSUITS ARE DISMISSED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The securities lawsuit was led by pension funds in Arkansas, Ohio, Oregon and Sweden, and seeks class-action status on behalf of the bank's stockholders from February 24, 2010 to May 21, 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jay Eisenhofer and Gerald Silk, lawyers for the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Dan Tierney, a spokesman for Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, said his office is reviewing the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the directors case, Daniels rejected claims by the Wayne County Employees' Retirement System in Detroit that JPMorgan's board improperly condoned the CIO's risk-taking, citing a lack of evidence that it "consciously disregarded red flags."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also dismissed claims brought on behalf of employees that including the bank's stock as an investment option in retirement plans was imprudent, finding "no allegations of when, or even that, JPMorgan was in dire circumstances."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Rosenfeld, a lawyer for the Wayne County pension plan, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacob Zamansky, a lawyer for the employees, said: "We respectfully disagree with Judge Daniels' opinion, and are considering our options on appeal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court will on Wednesday hear arguments in a similar case involving Fifth Third Bancorp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, JPMorgan agreed to pay more than $1 billion to settle U.S. and British regulatory probes into the London Whale losses, and admitted wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two traders at the bank, Javier Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout, were indicted in September for allegedly hiding losses linked to Iksil.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, March 31 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp, the
world's largest publicly traded oil company, said on Monday that
risks related to climate change pose little risk to its oil and
gas reserves because the resources will be needed to meet
expected growth in energy demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to queries from shareholder activists, the
company also said it is "confident" that none of its oil and gas
reserves will lose value or become "stranded" if governments act
to slash carbon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe producing these assets is essential to meeting
growing energy demand worldwide, and in preventing consumers -
especially those in the least developed and most vulnerable
economies - from themselves becoming stranded in the global
pursuit of higher living standards and greater economic
opportunity," Exxon said in a report released in response to
call from activist shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the Irving, Texas-based company agreed
to detail the risks climate change poses to its carbon assets in
exchange for the withdrawal of a shareholder proposal on the
issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resolution, filed by investors from As You Sow and
Arjuna Capital, cited studies suggesting that lower demand or
prices for fossil fuels might emerge in coming years as a result
of climate change or greater carbon regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on its previously published long-term outlook, Exxon
expects the world to require 35 percent more energy by 2040 and
greenhouse gas emissions are expected to plateau in that period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While governments could take action that affects Exxon, the
company said it is "highly unlikely" that governments would
restrict greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent over the next 30
years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To mitigate risk from climate change, Exxon has a "constant
focus on efficiency" and looks for ways to reduce emissions from
its own operations, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also on Monday, the latest report from the United Nations
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in a report that
global warming poses a growing threat to the health, economic
prospects and food and water sources of billions of people.

      All energy sources, including carbon-based fuels, are necessary to meet 
      future global energy demand growth as society manages the risks of

      said today in two reports to shareholders outlining the company&#8217;s

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our analysis and those of independent agencies confirms our 
      long-standing view that all viable energy sources will be essential to 
      meet increasing demand growth that accompanies expanding economies and 
      rising living standards,&#8221; said William Colton, ExxonMobil&#8217;s vice 
      president of corporate strategic planning.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It is equally essential that society manages the risk of climate change 
      by increasing energy efficiency and by investing in research into 
      technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      emissions and works to reduce emissions. They also include information 
      such as distribution of reserves by asset location and type.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The risk of climate change is clear and the risk warrants action,&#8221; said 
      Colton. &#8220;ExxonMobil is taking action by reducing greenhouse gas 
      emissions in its operations, helping consumers reduce their emissions, 
      supporting research that leads to technology breakthroughs and 
      participating in constructive dialogue on policy options.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Release of the reports is part of an ongoing dialogue between ExxonMobil 
      and shareholders about important matters such as the company&#8217;s long-term 
      supply and demand forecasts, business plans and views on climate change. 
      Information included in the reports is available in a variety of 
      existing materials including ExxonMobil&#8217;s Outlook for Energy, its 
      2013 Financial and Operating Review, the company website and in its 
      annual Form 10-K regulatory filing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The reports point out that ExxonMobil&#8217;s Outlook for Energy and 
      all credible forecasts, including that of the International Energy 
      Agency, predict that carbon-based fuels will continue to meet about 
      three-quarters of global energy needs through 2040.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;All of ExxonMobil&#8217;s current hydrocarbon reserves will be needed, along 
      with substantial future industry investments, to address global energy 
      needs,&#8221; said Colton.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The reports also detail ExxonMobil&#8217;s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas 
      emissions through increased efficiency and production of lower-carbon 
      fuels, notably natural gas, and by helping consumers of carbon-based 
      fuels reduce their emissions. The reports can be found at www.exxonmobil.com/climatereports.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 31 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co 
must face a lawsuit in which shareholders accused it of
concealing risks that surfaced when it lost at least $6.2
billion in 2012 over trades made by Bruno Iksil, the so-called
London Whale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge George Daniels in Manhattan said
shareholders adequately alleged that JPMorgan, Chief Executive
Jamie Dimon and former Chief Financial Officer Douglas
Braunstein misled them about the bank's ability to manage risk
before the losses at its Chief Investment Office (CIO) surfaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniels also dismissed related claims against three other
JPMorgan officials: Ina Drew, who led the CIO; Mike Cavanagh,
who preceded Braunstein as CFO; and Barry Zubrow, who had been
the bank's chief risk officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge also dismissed a separate shareholder lawsuit
against JPMorgan directors over the London Whale losses, and a
lawsuit by JPMorgan employees who held the bank's stock in their
retirement accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony declined to comment.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 31 (Reuters) - A New York judge has allowed
Chevron Corp to sue Patton Boggs over claims that the
Washington law and lobbying firm engaged in fraud while trying
to enforce a multibillion-dollar environmental judgment for a
group of Ecuadorean villagers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan gave his ruling on Monday
in Manhattan federal court, saying he had "difficulties" with
Patton Boggs' argument that a New York court did not have
jurisdiction to hear the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is about holding accountable all those who are
responsible for trying to enforce this travesty of justice that
occurred in Ecuador," Chevron's lawyer, Randy Mastro, said in an
interview. "Now there will be the opportunity to hold Patton
Boggs accountable for its role."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, an Ecuadorean judge ruled in favor of plaintiff
lawyer Steven Donziger against Chevron for polluting the
country's rainforest. An award to the villagers for $18 billion
was reduced in 2013 to $9.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patton Boggs was hired by the villagers in 2010 to come up
with a strategy to enforce the judgment, with partner James
Tyrrell leading the enforcement efforts, according to court
records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 4, Kaplan ruled that there was "clear and
convincing evidence" that Donziger's legal team had used
bribery, fraud and extortion in pursuit of the multibillion-
dollar judgment, according to court papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Patton Boggs began enforcement efforts, Chevron in May
asked Kaplan if it could bring counterclaims against the firm
that it had concealed Donziger's fraudulent tactics, among other
things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said in court papers that Tyrrell took the case
despite having ethical concerns about its merits but did so
because of "enormous financial pressure at Patton Boggs,"
according to court papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyrrell and Patton Boggs have denied the claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Patton Boggs spokesman did not immediately respond to a
request for comment. Nor did Tyrrell or a lawyer for Patton
Boggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, Patton Boggs claimed the court lacked jurisdiction
because its partners consisted of "stateless" persons stationed
in Dubai, Doha, Abu Dhabi and other foreign locations and could
not be tried in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaplan said on Monday the Patton Boggs partners in question
"at least arguably were domiciliaries of the states of the
United States" and the firm had the burden of proving partners
intended to give up their U.S. domiciles or take up domicile in
a foreign country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That burden has not been sustained here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patton Boggs is in merger talks with the larger firm Squire
Sanders. Discussions include how to prevent a newly formed firm
from assuming liability related to the Chevron case, two people
with knowledge of the matter said earlier this month, on
condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak
publicly about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Casey Sullivan; Editing by Ted Botha)&lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Global Alzheimer's Drugs Market 2012-2016 with H. 
      Lundbeck A/S, Novartis AG and Pfizer Inc. Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/t6x9wf/global) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Alzheimer's Drugs Market 2012-2016" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysts forecast the Global Alzheimer's Drugs market to grow at a 
      CAGR of 3.26 percent over the period 2012-2016. One of the key factors 
      contributing to this market growth is the increasing aging population. 
      The Global Alzheimer's Drugs market has also been witnessing the 
      availability of improved diagnostics. However, numerous patent expiries 
      could pose a challenge to the growth of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The key vendors dominating this market space include Eisai Co., Ltd., 
      Forest Laboratories Inc., H. Lundbeck A/S., Novartis AG, and Pfizer Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The author recognizes the following companies as the key players in the 
      Global Alzheimer's Drugs Market: Forest Laboratories Inc., Eisai Co. 
      Ltd., Pfizer Inc., Novartis AG, and H. Lundbeck A/S.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from the Healthcare team said: 
      Clinical symptoms are usually observed long after the pathological 
      processes of AD have begun. There are no definitive diagnostic tests for 
      AD. Clinical diagnosis of AD primarily relies on subjective methods such 
      as cognitive testing. There is a significant need for a reliable, 
      cost-effective, and minimally invasive test that could help in early 
      diagnosis of AD. Various companies are engaged in the development of 
      accurate and definitive diagnostic tests that could help in early 
      diagnosis of the disease. Moreover, it is expected that the uptake of 
      new drugs will be aided by the availability of improved diagnostics. For 
      instance, the amyloid-binding agents for use with positron emission 
      tomography imaging will help diagnose patients much earlier in the 
      course of the disease.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. regulator on Monday allowed Exxon Mobil Corp to restart operations on the Texas leg of its Pegasus pipeline, which spilled thousands of barrels of oil into a residential area in Arkansas last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) approved Exxon's restart plan for a 210-mile (338-km) stretch of the pipeline from Corsicana to Nederland at 80 percent of the operating pressure in place before the March 29, 2013 incident in the small town of Mayflower, Arkansas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This margin of safety should allow for the safe operation of the pipeline until the Remedial Work Plan can be approved and implemented," PHMSA said in a letter to Exxon dated and made public on March 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The northern portion of the pipeline, which includes Mayflower, will remain shut down under the terms of a corrective action order, a PHMSA spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pegasus, built in the late 1940s, ruptured near a housing development in Mayflower and spewed around 5,000 barrels of crude. The 95,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) pipeline runs from Patoka, Illinois, to Nederland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unusual for pipelines to leak near or in towns and the incident led to the evacuation of residents, as Exxon launched a huge cleanup operation and paid residents' expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also fueled the debate over the safety of transporting Canadian oil, as this pipeline did, from tar sands, with critics claiming this type of crude was more corrosive to pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November, the U.S. regulator accused Exxon of failure to account for risks in the pipeline and said the oil major could face nearly $2.7 million in fines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The restart of the southern portion of the pipeline will allow Exxon to carry out inspections in the summer, as expected in Exxon's remedial plan, according to PHMSA. The regulator said it will not extend a deadline to submit the plan beyond April 7, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shutdown of the Pegasus line led to a delay late last year of a 40,000-bpd Sunoco Logistics pipeline project that would carry crude from Midland, Texas, to Nederland, a crossroads for several pipelines and home to oil terminals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunoco declined to comment on the project, saying it usually gives updates during earnings calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Timothy Gardner in Washington and Selam Gebrekidan and Sabina Zawadzki in New York; Editing by Franklin Paul, Meredith Mazzilli and Paul Simao)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, March 31 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp 
on Monday named three executives to its cloud, devices and Xbox
gaming divisions in one of new Chief Executive Satya Nadella's
first management shakeups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a public email, the world's largest software maker
promoted Scott Guthrie to head of the cloud and enterprise
group, the $20 billion division that Nadella helmed before
replacing Steve Ballmer as CEO in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Nokia Oyj chief executive Stephen Elop -
at one time considered a candidate to replace Ballmer - will
join Microsoft as executive vice president of the devices group,
reporting to Nadella, after Microsoft closes its $7.2 billion
acquisition of the Finnish device manufacturer. The two
companies announced the transaction in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also named Phil Spencer to lead its Xbox
operation, reporting to operating systems group chief Terry
Myerson. As the head of hardware, Elop will also play a role in
developing the Xbox, Nadella said in the memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speculation has mounted for years over the fate of the Xbox
business, which has been deemed a potential candidate for a
spin-off by some analysts and Microsoft insiders. Bloomberg
reported last year during the CEO search that Elop, then the
front-runner to replace Ballmer, favored a sale himself,
although his thinking may have evolved since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella, who unveiled Office for Apple mobile devices at his
first public appearance last week, signaled that he would shift
the company's emphasis away from prioritizing its Windows
operating system at the expense of other initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As I said on my first day, we need to do everything
possible to thrive in a mobile-first, cloud-first world,"
Nadella said in an email. "The announcements last week, our news
this week, the Nokia acquisition closing soon, and the leaders
and teams we are putting in place are all great first steps in
making this happen."

the payments company said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reduction will come into force from July 1, Visa added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cut in the rate was forced by a law that came into

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;h1&gt;BoxTone Announces Free Mobile HealthCheck for Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync Environments&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Industry's Most Comprehensive Mobile Monitoring Solution Finds and Fixes Issues Hidden in EAS Deployments and Infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;AUSTIN, TX and COLUMBIA, MD--(Marketwired - Mar 31, 2014) -  BoxTone, the monitoring company for the mobile era, announced the availability of its BoxTone Exchange ActiveSync HealthCheck, a free service available to all organizations to identify potentially hazardous issues that degrade mobile performance and impact users. The free HealthCheck is based on the BoxTone for Exchange ActiveSync software, a Mobile Service Management solution that delivers complete mobile infrastructure visibility, enabling enterprises and managed service providers (MSPs) to proactively monitor and support their end-to-end Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) environments. With email an indispensable application for today's mobile workforce, BoxTone for Exchange ActiveSync ensures IT and support teams can quickly and easily find and fix issues hidden in their EAS deployments, often before users are even affected.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The free BoxTone EAS HealthCheck, available at www.boxtone.com/healthcheck, provides a snapshot analysis of CAS logs over 24-hour period to identify lurking issues. Using automated analytics to parse CAS log data, the service ferrets out hundreds of potential problems that can take down users, groups of users and entire environments, such as those caused by mobile device upgrades and poor load balancing across Client Access Servers (CAS).&#160;Once the analysis is complete, BoxTone provides a full diagnostic report, review of key metrics and findings, and recommendations for optimization and immediate improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;To move beyond the one-time snapshot view of the EAS HealthCheck, Microsoft Exchange Professionals who need long-term visibility and control can upgrade to the full BoxTone for Exchange ActiveSync solution.&#160;The most comprehensive solution for real-time mobile monitoring, BoxTone for Exchange ActiveSync uses deep diagnostics for all EAS components, identifying service issues across the entirety of the mobile infrastructure -- from device and wireless carrier, across firewalls and gateways, to Exchange CAS and mailbox servers including MDM and 3rd party gateways/proxies, to other backend infrastructure.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;"Organizations have effectively optimized Exchange for their PC environments.&#160;However, in the new mobile gold rush, with thousands of additional smartphones and tablets now connecting to Exchange, there are frequently unexpected and unpredictable issues that ripple throughout the enterprise. These can significantly degrade or disrupt services, leading to disconnected and disgruntled workers, and ultimately resulting in lost productivity and burdensome spikes on IT support," said Brian Reed, Chief Product Officer of BoxTone. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Even with a highly tuned PC-based Exchange environment, IT staff can find themselves unprepared and ill-equipped to pinpoint and resolve issues as more device types and endpoints access email through growing mobile workforces and BYOD. Support automation built into BoxTone for Exchange ActiveSync lets administrators and front line service desk monitor, proactively troubleshoot and quickly fix issues before mobile email, calendar, contact, task and other functions are affected.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;For wide-scale, mission-critical deployments relying on Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync, organizations can cut the number of service-impacting mobile incidents by 30%; boost first-call resolution rate for mobile issues by 70%; reduce mobile escalations from service desk to Exchange administrators by 70%; and lower the mean-time-to-resolution of Exchange ActiveSync problems by 70%.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;BoxTone is the only platform that delivers patented technology to proactively monitor and support the Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync service in real time -- as well as other mobile services and platforms including BlackBerry, Good Technology, MDM gateways/proxies and more -- across all infrastructure components for all device ownership models.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;"Mobile is no longer a starter project for companies; it's now a de facto standard requirement for productivity with users expecting always-on quality-of-service and experience.&#160;For the maturing mobile enterprise environment, Exchange teams now have a free HealthCheck to get started and a commercial software solution for the long term to pre-emptively address issues before they impact the workforce," Reed added. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Get your free HealthCheck and see live demos at BoxTone Booth #405 at Amplify Microsoft Exchange Conference, March 30 - April 2, 2014 in Austin, Texas. Or register online for a free HealthCheck HERE.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;On February 23, 2014, Good Technology announced the intent to acquire BoxTone: http://www1.good.com/about/press-releases/good-technology-to-acquire-boxtone.html&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;About BoxTone&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;With millions of mobile devices and apps under management, BoxTone's automated Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) platform is trusted by more of the world's leading enterprises, Managed Service Providers and government agencies than any other -- including 42 of the Fortune&#174; 100 and 8 of the Top 10 MSPs -- to ensure maximum mobile performance and security at the lowest cost and risk.

			Splunk Announces New Version of Splunk App for Microsoft&#174; Exchange
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Helps to Ensure Uptime for Critical Enterprise Email Services; New 
      Dashboards Correlate Data from Microsoft Exchange, Active Directory and 
      Windows Operating Systems
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Splunk 
      Inc. (NASDAQ: SPLK), provider of the leading software platform for 
      real-time operational intelligence, today announced version 3.0 of the 
      Splunk&#174; App for Microsoft Exchange. The latest version, combined with 
      Splunk Enterprise, provides real-time visibility into the health of the 
      Microsoft Exchange environment, including message delivery components 
      and the supporting IT infrastructure. New out-of-the-box dashboards and 
      reports in the app correlate Exchange, Active Directory&#174; and Windows&#174; 
      operating systems data to enable proactive monitoring of the email 
      service and provide deep visibility into usage and behavior to better 
      inform capacity planning and maximize uptime. Splunk will demo the new 
      app at booth #805 at the Microsoft Exchange Conference in Austin, TX, 
      from March 31 &#8211; April 2, 2014. Version 3.0 of the Splunk App for 
      Microsoft Exchange will be generally available on April 15, 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The messaging infrastructure is critical to organizations of all sizes. 
      A disruption in email can damage the reputation of an IT department or 
      the entire organization through lost orders, broken customer 
      communications and chaotic internal communications,&#8221; said Leena Joshi, 
      senior director of infrastructure operations marketing, Splunk. &#8220;The new 
      version of the Splunk App for Microsoft Exchange includes pre-built 
      correlations between Microsoft Exchange data and data from supporting 
      infrastructure, specifically Windows OS and Microsoft Active Directory. 
      This delivers the most accurate picture of email service health, 
      performance, security and user experience across the messaging 
      infrastructure.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Splunk App for Microsoft Exchange is bar none the best app we've 
      seen on the market for maintaining optimal Exchange network health. Easy 
      to deploy, it provides extraordinary value to dozens of our customers 
      across industries,&#8221; said Sean Wilkerson, senior security consultant and 
      co-founder, Aplura,&#160;LLC, an IT Security consulting firm. &#8220;Our Exchange 
      administrators and cybersecurity customers appreciate the instant 
      visibility the app provides into their entire enterprise messaging 
      infrastructure, and the ability to correlate information about service 
      health with infrastructure performance. These insights enable customers 
      to proactively resolve issues, avoid service degradation and downtime, 
      and save big on storage costs.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It's easy to dismiss email as a &#8216;keeping the lights on&#8217; concern 
      managed&#160;in the backwaters of IT but the fact is it's a mission-critical 
      service&#160;for almost every business,&#8221; said Michael Cot&#233;, research 
      director,&#160;infrastructure software, 451 Research. &#8220;Companies need tools 
      to monitor&#160;and diagnose problems in their email systems, often down to 
      the smallest&#160;minutia. Splunk typically excels at deep dive analysis and 
      broad-ranging&#160;reporting so their move to provide visibility into the 
      Microsoft Infrastructure, and more specifically, Microsoft Exchange will 
      likely be&#160;helpful for teams beset with keeping email services up and 
      planning future&#160;infrastructure investments.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Features of version 3.0 of the Splunk App for Microsoft Exchange include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Packaged Correlation and Operations Dashboards &#8211; Easily 
        identify relationships among performance, health and security events 
        using prebuilt dashboards and reports that span the email service.
      
			
				Dashboard Builder &#8211; Quickly and easily create, save and share 
        custom reports of related services and components by simple querying 
        on contextual information, such as &#8220;log outs&#8221;, &#8220;performance&#8221;, 
        &#8220;health&#8221;, et cetera.
      
			
				Messaging Tracking &#8211; Provide breakdown of message flow, with 
        dashboard views that provide administrators with important 
        segmentation and load information about message flow, enabling message 
        tracking from the desktop to the gateway.
      
			
				Client Behavior Monitoring and Capacity Planning &#8211; Provide 
        in-depth visibility into how the messaging service is being utilized 
        and display information about messaging volume and number of users the 
        system is handling over time to help plan for growth.
      
			
				End-to-End Visibility &#8211; Correlate data across Exchange and 
        non-Exchange message delivery components such as proxy servers and 
        firewalls to uncover anomalies that can impact performance and 
        security.

&lt;p&gt;Many people see Anurag Thakur, 39, as the youthful face of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the main opposition to the Congress party-led government and the party of prime ministerial hopeful Narendra Modi. He is the son of the former chief minister of Himachal Pradesh, and was named one of the World Economic Forum&#8217;s global young leaders this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Reuters, Thakur spoke about Modi&#8217;s popularity as well as criticisms levelled against him.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, March 31 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's anti-corruption
agency searched an office belonging to a top JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co
 banker in the city who recently resigned, amid a U.S.
investigation into the bank's hiring practices, according to
media reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on
March 26 searched the office of Fang Fang, JPMorgan's outgoing
chief executive officer for China investment banking, seizing
computer records and documents, according to the reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 24, an internal memo said Fang would leave the firm
but gave no reason for his resignation. The Wall Street Journal,
which first reported Fang's departure, said he had emerged as a
key figure for U.S. authorities as they investigate whether the
investment bank violated bribery laws by improperly hiring the
relatives of well-connected Chinese officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do not comment on individual cases," said Alan Tse, a
spokesman for ICAC in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marie Cheung, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for JPMorgan,
declined to comment, while Fang Fang could not be immediately
reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities are examining whether JPMorgan's hiring of
China Everbright Group Chairman Tang Shuangning's son helped the
bank win assignments from Everbright, the Journal said, adding
that JPMorgan has provided U.S. prosecutors with emails from
Fang discussing the hire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has withdrawn from underwriting a $3 billion Hong
Kong listing by China Everbright Bank Co Ltd - one
of two China initial public offerings it has stopped working on
while the investigation is being carried out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other firms that have come under scrutiny for their hiring
practices in Asia include Citigroup, Goldman Sachs 
and Morgan Stanley.
