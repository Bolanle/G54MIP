&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said on Friday 
record oil prices drove second-quarter earnings up 11 percent 
to its highest-ever profit, but weak margins from gasoline 
production led to a big loss at its refining operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; U.S. oil prices averaged slightly less than $125 a barrel 
in the quarter, nearly double prices from a year earlier. But 
gasoline prices only rose 25 percent during that same period, 
resulting in weak profit margins for the fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, the second largest U.S. oil company, said net 
income rose to $5.98 billion, or $2.90 a share, from $5.38 
billion, or $2.52 a share, last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts, on average, expected the company to earn around 
$3.02 a share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), the top U.S. oil company, posted 
the highest-ever quarterly profit by a U.S. company on 
Thursday, bringing in nearly $11.7 billion, but still 
disappointed investors due to weak production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales in the quarter jumped 49 percent to $80.96 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Income from the company's exploration and production 
business nearly doubled to $7.25 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's production fell about 3 percent to 2.54 
million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Chevron said 
production rose slightly, excluding the effect of contracts 
that give a higher share of productions to host countries as 
oil prices rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company posted a $734 million loss at its downstream 
refining and marketing business, versus a profit of $1.3 
billion a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said weak profit margins as well as planned 
refinery maintenance in the United States hurt results at that 
unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Clearly 3 percent lower (gasoline) demand is going to have 
an effect on downstream numbers at least until we see a real 
meaningful correction in the feedstock costs," said Lewis Ropp, 
who helps manage around $60 billion at Barrow, Hanley, 
Mewhinney  Strauss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Ropp said Chevron's profit was impressive due to the 
high oil and natural gas prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The commodity price just overwhelms any weakness in any 
other areas," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earnings from the company's chemicals unit dropped more 
than 60 percent to $41 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron shares rose 25 cents at $84.81 in morning trading 
on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. As of Thursday's 
close, the stock was down about 9.4 percent this year, 
underperforming the Chicago Board Options Exchange's oil index 
.OIX, off about 7.8 percent over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Michael Erman, editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - China's financial hub, Shanghai, is
restricting the issue of business visas, underlining the
lengths to which authorities are going to keep out unwanted
foreigners ahead of the Beijing Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Business groups have already complained about tightened
visa policies ahead of the August Games, which have included a
ban on citizens of 33 countries applying for Chinese visas in
Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Shanghai Foreign Economic Relations and Trade
Commission said it will postpone approval of notification
letters needed for business visas till mid September for all
but essential travel, ruling out visits to carry out
inspections, market research and training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The South China Morning Post on Thursday cited unnamed
sources as saying that authorities in Beijing also have similar
curbs, as have Qingdao, Shenyang and Qinhuangdao -- all of
which will host some Olympic events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Foreigners coming to Shanghai on important business before
then need to get the Chinese organisation that is inviting them
to give detailed supporting documentation, the city commission
said in a notice posted on its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At the same time, (they) should try their best to limit
the number of people coming and the amount of time they spend
in Shanghai," the commission said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said the curbs were being introduced on orders from
above and were meant to "ensure the smooth hosting of the
Olympics and safeguard the city's social stability during the
Olympics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beijing has defended itself against criticism over its
tighter visa policies, saying they are necessary to ensure
security during the Games and keep "hostile forces" out of the
country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But business consultants say the restrictions are starting
to hurt exporters, which in some cases are unable to finalise
contracts because their clients' inspectors are unable to get
into the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jason Subler; Editing by Alan Wheatley)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (For more stories visit our multimedia website "Road to

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Swiss bank UBS AG (UBSN.VX) told
London's High Court that rival start-up Vestra Wealth, backed
by U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N), had illegally poached its
staff and gained a headstart in attracting its clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; On Friday, UBS sought a "springboard" injunction against
Vestra after 75 of UBS's wealth managers resigned for the
start-up since May. Vestra is 20 percent-owned by Goldman and
was set up by UBS's former top private banker in Britain David
Scott.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The injunction, if granted, would stop Vestra from
soliciting or dealing with any of UBS's clients and remaining
employees until October, when a trial can be held.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Vestra's lawyers said a springboard injunction would
resulting Vestra and UBS missing out on business because those
UBS clients wishing to change would leave UBS but would not be
able to move to Vestra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judge is due to make a decision on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman officials were not immediately available for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UBS is also suing four senior employees departing for
Vestra for what it said was a secret plot to encourage more UBS
staff to move to Vestra and to take their clients with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The enormity of the damage created by those wrongs has to
be met with an order that is going to be effective ... to
prevent Vestra from reaping the fruits of its wrongs," UBS's
lawyer Alistair McGregor told the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, a senior UBS executive said the bank, which has
been accused of helping some U.S. clients to evade taxes, would
stop offering cross-border private banking through its
unregulated units to U.S.-domiciled customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Vestra said UBS employees had left for the start-up,
alongside recent departures for other competitors, because of
dissatisfaction with the state of UBS's business and denied
that there was an illegal plan to poach UBS staff and clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are no grounds for preventing Vestra from competing
for the business of UBS's clients. UBS's actions are designed
to destroy the business that I have created," Scott said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UBS Wealth Management in Britain has around 300 client
advisers and roughly 37 billion pounds ($73.38 billion) in
invested assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Toni Reinhold)&lt;/p&gt;

operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, joined
Norway's StatoilHydro ASA (STL.OL) and France's Total SA
(TOTF.PA) in posting huge earnings due to soaring crude

prices only rose 25 percent in that same period, resulting in

the major oil companies that was notable for the magnitude of
the earnings and generally weak output. The huge hauls also
made them targets for environmentalists and politicians, some
of whom called for windfall taxes on oil industry profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crude prices hit as high as $147 a barrel last month, but
since then have dropped precipitously, losing about 15 percent
of their value in just over two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Argus Petroleum analyst Phil Weiss said if crude continues
to drop, oil companies could push through fatter margins at
their refining businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, he noted exploration and production is the core of
their businesses, and a pull-back could mean lower earnings
sequentially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Production is where these companies need to focus," Weiss
said, noting output was also weak at Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N),
the top U.S. oil company, and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L),
the world's second-largest non-government-controlled oil
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The industry as a whole is making lots of money and
generating lots of cash flow," he said. "None of them are in

offshore oil field off the Republic of Congo helped lift
Total's output by 1 percent to 2.353 million barrels of oil

income rose 36 percent to 18.92 billion crowns ($3.7 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Second-quarter production met analysts' average

billion, or $2.52 a share, last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts, on average, expected the company to earn around
$3.02 a share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), the top U.S. oil company, posted
the highest-ever quarterly profit by a U.S. company on
Thursday, bringing in nearly $11.7 billion, but still
disappointed investors due to weak production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales in the quarter jumped 49 percent to $80.96 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Income from the company's exploration and production
business nearly doubled to $7.25 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's production fell about 3 percent to 2.54
million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Chevron said
production rose slightly, excluding the effect of contracts
that give a higher share of productions to host countries as
oil prices rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company posted a $734 million loss at its downstream
refining and marketing business, versus a profit of $1.3
billion a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said weak profit margins as well as planned
refinery maintenance in the United States hurt results at that
unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Clearly 3 percent lower (gasoline) demand is going to have
an effect on downstream numbers at least until we see a real
meaningful correction in the feedstock costs," said Lewis Ropp,
who helps manage around $60 billion at Barrow, Hanley,
Mewhinney  Strauss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Ropp said Chevron's profit was impressive due to the
high oil and natural gas prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The commodity price just overwhelms any weakness in any
other areas," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earnings from the company's chemicals unit dropped more
than 60 percent to $41 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron shares rose 25 cents at $84.81 in morning trading
on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. As of Thursday's
close, the stock was down about 9.4 percent this year,
underperforming the Chicago Board Options Exchange's oil index
.OIX, off about 7.8 percent over the same period.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY and BOSTON, MA, Aug 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and The Bridgespan Group, a nonprofit organization
supporting nonprofits with strategy consulting and executive recruiting,
are teaming to address the shortage of leaders in the nonprofit sector by
helping interested IBM employees transition to second careers in
nonprofits.

    More than 640,000 new nonprofit leaders will be needed by 2016 according
to "The Nonprofit Sector's Leadership Deficit," a Bridgespan study,
largely due to baby boomer retirement and overall sector growth. At the
same time, nonprofits are under increasing pressure to demonstrate
results, which is leading some to reach out for skills that business
leaders might bring.

    "Boomers are planning to work longer than their parents did, and millions
want work that is meaningful, both personally and to society, but the
transition isn't an easy one," says Marc Freedman, founder and CEO of
Civic Ventures, a think tank focused on boomers and work. "This
partnership between IBM and Bridgespan will provide a clear path from the
end of a midlife career to an encore career for the greater good. It's a
great service for employees and a model for other employers to follow."

    IBM and Bridgespan's Bridgestar initiative (www.bridgestar.org) will build
a program and online platform to help IBM employees and retirees
understand the transition into the nonprofit sector. The program will
include access to tools and content that help users assess their
readiness for the transition, identify potential opportunities and skills
required, apply for available job opportunities with nonprofits, and
receive mentoring. After the pilot with IBM, the tools and resources
developed will be made available for other nonprofits and corporations to
start similar initiatives.

    "A balanced management team that combines the best in for profit
management disciplines such as marketing, human resources, information
technology, and finance with those with top expertise in social service
management, program development, research, evaluation, fund development
and nonprofit governance has enabled us to grow dramatically and deliver
the best service," said Judy Vredenburgh, President and Chief Executive
Officer of Big Brothers and Big Sisters. "As an organization that serves
the welfare of children, it is important that we run it in the most
effective and efficient way possible."

    In 2005, IBM launched Transition to Teaching, enabling employees
interested in a second career to become K-12 math and science teachers.
This initiative expands on that and IBM's On Demand Community, a global
volunteer effort in which more than 100,000 employees currently
participate. These employees are sharing their time and talent to improve
their local schools, community organizations and non profits.

    "Our employees have a high level of skills and ability in management and
technology that can be applied to serving our communities," said Stanley
S. Litow, vice president of Corporate Citizenship and Corporate Affairs,
IBM. "We believe that this transition program is the kind of corporate
leadership and partnership with nonprofits that is necessary to make a
significant difference to society, to the employee and to the company."

    According to the Bridgespan Group, identifying and connecting new pools of
talent to sector opportunities is critical to nonprofit organizations'
ability to achieve their missions. Individuals with functional business
skills, such as operations, finance, marketing and communications, and
technology have the potential to be great assets, both as board members
and potential leaders in nonprofit organizations.

    "We are delighted to be partnering with IBM to build on the success of the
On Demand Community," said David L. Simms, managing partner of the
Bridgestar initiative. "IBM and Bridgespan share an important objective:
to educate about the nonprofit sector and connect interested individuals
to opportunities to serve. The program we are jointly building has the
potential to reach and influence a very significant talent pool. We hope
that there will be mutual benefit--IBM employees and retirees contributing
their skills and experiences, and nonprofits able to realize greater
impact as a result."

    The program is an initiative under IBM's Global Citizen's Portfolio
announced last July by Samuel Palmisano, CEO of IBM. The Global Citizen's
Portfolio is a suite of programs to help employees succeed in a globally
integrated economy. The program expands earlier enhanced transitions
services efforts, including a pilot program with the Partnership for
Public Service to match IBM employees with open jobs in the federal
government. This program builds off of the company's original successful
Transition to Teaching initiative. More than 100 employees are
participating in the Transition to Teaching program, and it has been
adopted by other companies and governments.

    Bridgestar

    Bridgestar (www.bridgestar.org), an initiative of the Bridgespan Group,
provides talent-matching services, content, and tools designed to help
organizations build strong leadership teams and individuals pursue career
paths as nonprofit leaders. Bridgestar's goal is to attract, connect, and
support senior talent, leading to greater organizational effectiveness and
social impact.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Aug 1 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs GN.N, who with
accountancy firm Deloitte carried out the restructuring of 
Cheyne Finance structured investment vehicle (SIV), is
considering tranching and rating some of the debt securities
left in the SIV, a source familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman and Deloitte spent months planning the restructuring
of Cheyne Finance, a SIV that relied on short-term funding to
finance purchases of long-term securities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SIVs are struggling and some have gone bust as the global
credit squeeze has cut off funding and depressed asset values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the restructuring, about 21 percent of investors chose
to cash out their money after an auction that paid them 55
percent of their original $7 billion investment, the source
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The other 79 percent of investors chose to swap their debt
for pass-through notes, becoming the holders of a new investment
vehicle that holds the assets at present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These assets may now be tranched again, and rated - so
investors could trade the AAA-rated securities in the secondary
market, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs officials were not immediately available for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deloitte, the receiver, plans to distribute a cash sum of
$375 million before the end of the month, lifting the amount
that Cheyne investors will receive to 60 percent of their
original investment, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SIV was formerly run by British hedge fund Cheyne
Capital.

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Reports Second Quarter Net Income of $6 Billion, Up 11 Percent from $5.4 Billion in Second Quarter 2007

   Sharp Increase in Price of Crude Oil Boosts Income for Upstream
Operations but Erases Profit for Downstream
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today reported net income of $6.0
billion ($2.90 per share - diluted) for the second quarter 2008,
compared with $5.4 billion ($2.52 per share - diluted) in the year-ago
period. Earnings in the 2007 quarter included a net gain of
approximately $500 million on the sale of an investment and redemption
of debt.

   For the first half of 2008, net income was $11.1 billion ($5.38
per share - diluted), up 10 percent from $10.1 billion ($4.70 per
share - diluted) in the first six months of 2007.

   Sales and other operating revenues in the second quarter 2008 were
$81 billion, compared with $54 billion in the year-ago quarter.
First-half 2008 sales and other operating revenues were $146 billion,
versus $101 billion in the corresponding 2007 period.

   "Earnings for our upstream operations benefited from prices for
crude oil that were significantly higher than a year ago," said
Chairman and CEO Dave O'Reilly. "Natural-gas prices also increased
between periods, contributing to a doubling of upstream profits from
last year's second quarter."

   "In our downstream business, the increase in the price of crude
oil had an opposite effect," O'Reilly added. "The higher cost of crude
oil used in the refining process was not fully recovered in the price
of gasoline and other refined products. As a result, our downstream
operations incurred a loss in the second quarter, with most of the
loss taking place in the United States." O'Reilly said the effects of
planned refinery downtime also contributed to the U.S. loss in the
period.

   In the second quarter of this year, the company reported capital
and exploratory expenditures of $5.2 billion, compared with $4.5
billion a year earlier. Common stock buybacks in the 2008 period
totaled $2 billion.

   O'Reilly said continued strong cash flows from operations have
enabled a record-level of reinvestment in the business. Among recent
milestones for the company's major development projects was the
previously announced start-up of the 68 percent-owned Agbami Field in
Nigeria. The total maximum oil-equivalent production at Agbami is
estimated at 250,000 barrels per day by the end of 2009.

   UPSTREAM - EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

   Worldwide oil-equivalent production was 2.54 million barrels per
day in the second quarter 2008, compared with 2.63 million barrels per
day in the corresponding period in 2007. Absent the impact of higher
prices on volumes recoverable under certain production-sharing and
variable-royalty contracts outside the United States, production
increased slightly between periods.

*T

   U.S. upstream income of $2.2 billion in the second quarter 2008
increased nearly $1 billion from the same period last year, driven by
higher prices for crude oil and natural gas. Partially offsetting the
benefit of higher prices were increases in operating expenses, the
impact of lower production and the absence of gains on second quarter
2007 asset sales.

   The average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural gas
liquids was $109 in the second quarter 2008, up from $57 in the
corresponding 2007 period. The average sales price per thousand cubic
feet of natural gas increased $3.28 between quarters to $9.84.

   Net oil-equivalent production was 702,000 barrels per day in the
2008 second quarter, down about 7 percent from a year earlier on
normal field declines. The net liquids component of production was
down 6 percent at 438,000 barrels per day, and net natural-gas
production declined 7 percent to 1.6 billion cubic feet per day.

   International upstream earnings of $5.1 billion in the second
quarter 2008 increased $2.6 billion from the year-ago period due
primarily to higher prices for crude oil. Natural-gas prices also
increased between periods. Partially offsetting the benefit of higher
prices was a reduction of crude-oil sales volumes. Foreign currency
effects benefited earnings by $80 million in the 2008 quarter,
compared with a $111 million reduction to earnings a year earlier.

   The average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural gas
liquids was $110 in the 2008 quarter, up $49 from the year-ago period.
The average sales price per thousand cubic feet of natural gas
increased $1.80 between periods to $5.44.

   Net oil-equivalent production of 1.84 million barrels per day in
the 2008 second quarter was about 2 percent lower than the year-ago
quarter. Absent the impact of higher prices on volumes recoverable
under certain production-sharing and variable-royalty contracts,
production increased between periods. The net liquids component of
production decreased by 95,000 barrels per day to 1.23 million.
Natural-gas production was 3.6 billion cubic feet per day in the 2008

*T

   U.S. downstream incurred a loss of $682 million in the second
quarter 2008, compared with income of $781 million in the year-ago
period. The loss was mainly associated with sharply higher costs of
crude-oil feedstocks used in the refining process that could not be
fully recovered in the sales price of gasoline and other refined
products. Operating expenses were also higher between periods,
including expenses associated with planned shutdowns for refinery
maintenance.

   Refinery crude-input of 816,000 barrels per day in the second
quarter 2008 was 65,000 barrels lower than the year-ago period. The
decline was primarily due to the effects of a planned crude-unit
shutdown for maintenance at the company's refinery in Pascagoula,
Mississippi, and suspension of crude processing for asphalt production
at the refinery in Perth Amboy, New Jersey. Crude-input volumes
increased between periods at the refinery in El Segundo, California.

   Refined-product sales volumes declined 8 percent from the second
quarter of 2007 to 1.38 million barrels per day, primarily the result
of lower gasoline and gas-oil sales. Branded gasoline sales volumes
were down 5 percent between quarters to 596,000 barrels per day.

   International downstream incurred a loss of $52 million in second
quarter 2008, compared with income of $517 million in the
corresponding 2007 period. Margins on the sale of refined products
were significantly lower in most areas, due mainly to an increase in
costs for crude-oil feedstocks. Foreign currency effects benefited
earnings by $46 million in the 2008 quarter, compared with a $35
million reduction in earnings a year earlier.

   Refinery crude-input was 952,000 barrels per day in the 2008
second quarter, up 10,000 from the year-ago period. Volumes increased
at the GS Caltex refinery in South Korea and the company's refinery in
Cape Town, South Africa. Inputs were lower at the company's Pembroke
refinery in the United Kingdom due to unplanned shutdowns.

   Total refined-product sales volumes of 2.07 million barrels per
day in the 2008 second quarter were 6 percent higher than the
corresponding quarter of 2007. Excluding the impact of 2007 asset
sales in Europe, sales volumes were up 8 percent between periods on
increased trading activities.

CPChem margins on the sale of commodity chemicals were squeezed due to
higher feedstock costs. Utility expenses increased as a result of
higher natural-gas prices, and maintenance expenses increased due to
planned shutdowns at various U.S. manufacturing facilities. For the
Oronite subsidiary, margins on sales of lubricant additives and fuel

   CAUTIONARY STATEMENT RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION FOR
THE PURPOSE OF "SAFE HARBOR" PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES
LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

   This press release contains forward-looking statements relating to
Chevron's operations that are based on management's current
expectations, estimates, and projections about the petroleum,
chemicals, and other energy-related industries. Words such as
"anticipates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "targets," "projects,"
"believes," "seeks," "schedules," "estimates," "budgets" and similar
expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.
These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are
subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of
which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Therefore,
actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is
expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. The reader
should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements,
which speak only as of the date of this press release. Unless legally
required, Chevron undertakes no obligation to update publicly any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise.

   Among the important factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are
crude-oil and natural-gas prices; refining, marketing and chemicals
margins; actions of competitors; timing of exploration expenses; the
competitiveness of alternate energy sources or product substitutes;
technological developments; the results of operations and financial
condition of equity affiliates; the inability or failure of the
company's joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and
development activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net
production from existing and future crude-oil and natural-gas
development projects; potential delays in the development,
construction or start-up of planned projects; the potential disruption
or interruption of the company's net production or manufacturing
facilities or delivery/transportation networks due to war, accidents,
political events, civil unrest, severe weather or crude-oil production
quotas that might be imposed by OPEC (Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries); the potential liability for remedial actions or
assessments under existing or future environmental regulations and
litigation; significant investment or product changes under existing
or future environmental statutes, regulations and litigation; the
potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation; the
company's acquisition or disposition of assets; gains and losses from
asset dispositions or impairments; government-mandated sales,
divestitures, recapitalizations, industry-specific taxes, changes in
fiscal terms or restrictions on scope of company operations; foreign
currency movements compared with the U.S. dollar; the effects of
changed accounting rules under generally accepted accounting
principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; and the factors set
forth under the heading "Risk Factors" on pages 32 and 33 of the
company's 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K/A. In addition, such
statements could be affected by general domestic and international
economic and political conditions. Unpredictable or unknown factors
not discussed in this press release could also have material adverse
effects on forward-looking statements.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) is to set up its new
European headquarters at London's Canary Wharf financial hub
after scrapping plans to take space in the City of London,
Britain's historic financial heartland, the bank said on
Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The U.S bank is the latest in a series of global financial
heavyweights to abandon London's Square Mile in favour of
Canary Wharf, which lies a few miles east of the City and is
home to rival banks including Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Citigroup
(C.N), HSBC (HSBA.L) and Bank of America (BAC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The proposed new building will be developed by Canary Wharf
Group at Canary Riverside South, and will enable JPMorgan to
achieve a long-term ambition to consolidate a clutch of
existing London offices at one address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would also serve to integrate employees brought together
following JPMorgan's takeover of collapsed investment bank Bear
Stearns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are delighted to be negotiating with Canary Wharf for a
new building, which we intend to be a premier facility in the
heart of a premier financial district," Bill Winters, co-head
of JPMorgan's Investment Bank, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Canary Wharf has steadily grown in popularity among global
banking sector occupiers, largely due to its size, lower
average rents and capacity to house tenants in bespoke
buildings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said JPMorgan's decision to set up home in Canary
Wharf was also influenced by persistent banking sector turmoil
and its inheritance of another new office building Bear Stearns
had signed up to before its demise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The economic case (to move to the City) is just not there
anymore," one analyst said on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON CITY WOES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier on Friday, Britain's fourth-largest property
company Hammerson (HMSO.L) announced that JPMorgan had pulled
out of talks to occupy a proposed 90,000 square metre building
on the St Alphage House site in London's City financial
district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What it shows is that the City of London is not big enough
to accommodate the mega-banks anymore," a leading London office
lettings agent told Reuters, though he denied it heralded the
beginning of the end of the City as a financial district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), UBS
(UBSN.VX), and Merrill Lynch MER.N still reside in the
historical financial centre of London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "JP Morgan will probably be the last big bank that goes to
Canary Wharf," the lettings agent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nevertheless, news that JPMorgan has turned its back on the
City represents another blow for the local office market, where
average values have fallen by almost 20 percent since the peak
of the UK property boom in June 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many potential tenants are waiting for a recovery in UK
economic conditions. Weak demand has delayed delivery of
several skyline-transforming projects, including Land
Securities' (LAND.L) "Walkie Talkie" scheme at 20 Fenchurch
Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hammerson chief executive John Richards said the St Alphage
site still had potential to house a major modern development
and the partners still intended to develop the site at a later
date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by William Kemble-Diaz, editing by

&lt;p&gt;  RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, NC, Aug 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced today plans to build a $360 million
state-of-the-art data center at its facility in Research Triangle Park
(RTP), North Carolina. The data center will include new technologies and
services that will enable IBM to deliver Cloud Computing capabilities to
clients.

    Cloud computing uses advanced technologies and global delivery mechanisms
to enable individuals to access information and services from any device
with extremely high levels of availability and quality of experience.

    IBM will renovate an existing building on its RTP campus in North Carolina
to create one of the most technologically advanced and energy efficient
data centers in the world. The new data center will be the first in the
world to be built with IBM's New Enterprise Data Center design principles.
Clients using this center will have unparalleled access to massive
internet-scale computing capabilities, while gaining the cost and
environmental protection advantages of IBM's industry-leading energy
efficiency data center design.

    Data centers are the backbone of information technology (IT)
infrastructure for businesses and other organizations, with powerful
servers and storage systems running business-critical technology
including software applications, email and web sites. IBM owns and
operates more than eight million square feet of data center space -- more
than any other company in the world.

    This new RTP data center is a key component in IBM's Project Big Green
initiative to dramatically increase energy efficiency in the data center,
as companies face escalating energy costs and the requirement to handle a
rapidly rising amount of data.

    "This announcement further demonstrates IBM's commitment to our state and
to our people," said Gov. Mike Easley. "I look forward to maintaining this
partnership with IBM for years to come."

    "This new data center is part of IBM's commitment to construct the world's
most advanced data centers," said Bob Greenberg, general manager of IT
Optimization and North Carolina Senior State Executive at IBM. "This is
the latest example of IBM's deep history of innovation in North Carolina.
When we open for business in late 2009, the new IBM data center assures
that Research Triangle Park will be a strategic location for our
outsourcing business for many years to come. I'd like to thank the State
of North Carolina, Durham County, the Durham Chamber of Commerce, and
Duke Energy for their outstanding support that helped make this project
possible."

    "IBM's innovations have been a cornerstone of the Research Triangle Park
and Durham County, and this new state-of-the-art data center certainly
continues that outstanding legacy," said Ellen W. Reckhow, Chairman of the
Durham County Board of Commissioners. Durham County approved allocating
$750,000 in economic development incentives for IBM's new data center.

    Technology features and details on the new RTP data center

    The new RTP data center will use many of the technologies from IBM's
Project Big Green initiative to sharply reduce data center energy
consumption. Following the first phase of 60,000 square feet of raised
floor data center space, this site can potentially be expanded in standard
modular increments. In IBM's new Data Center Family of services, design is
typically performed in advance on an entire project, so the additional
capacity can be added as client demand dictates. With a modular approach,
it's easier to grow the space and defer significant capital costs.

    Along with the recently commissioned Boulder data center, the new RTP
facility will be IBM's first truly adaptive data center, where facilities
equipment is designed to adjust its operation to the needs of IT equipment
in the data center. These data centers will be specially designed for a
heterogeneous mix of computer hardware and software.

    IBM will also incorporate its High Density Zone solution into the data
center design. This will enable IBM to support the latest water-cooled
equipment and energy requirements, as well as to optimize its
infrastructure for traditional and new air-cooled equipment.

    Some other key design features:

--  IBM goals include reusing 95 percent of the original building's shell,
    recycling 90 percent of materials from the original building, with 20
    percent of newly purchased material to be from recycled products.
--  IBM plans to install high density computing systems utilizing
    virtualization technology, which reduces energy costs by running multiple
    software applications on the same servers. This technology, along with
    IBM's Cool Blue portfolio of energy efficient technologies and a modular
    data center design, will allow the RTP facility to offer IBM's clients up
    to three times more computing capacity per square foot than the average
    data center.
--  The data center will leverage an industry-leading integrated cooling
    system allowing it to respond to varying cooling requirements of the IT
    equipment in real time.
--  During colder months, the data center can switch to free-cooling mode,
    utilizing a water economizer to dramatically reduce energy consumption.
--  The data center's mechanical system design is 50 percent more
    efficient than the industry average, equating to a reduction of
    approximately 31,799 tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year.
--  The facility is planned to be partially powered by alternative energy
    sources, resulting in a targeted reduction of approximately one million
    pounds of carbon dioxide emissions per year.
--  The data center will provide dual-site backup and recovery offerings
    from IBM's Business Continuity and Resiliency Services, in conjunction with
    IBM's recently enhanced Boulder, Colorado data center.
--  The facility will use energy efficient lighting, and all critical
    systems will be monitored and alarmed to security and maintenance 24x7x365.
    

    
These technologies, in conjunction with the energy efficient design
and construction, will allow IBM to reduce its overall carbon footprint
compared to standard data centers.

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Accused of Misleading Investors over $16 Billion Litigation Risk on Eve of Earnings Report

     Lawsuit's Plaintiffs Claim Oil Giant Avoiding Full Disclosure
QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
In advance of Chevron's quarterly earnings report, representatives
of Amazon indigenous leaders are warning oil industry analysts and the
public markets that Chevron's management is downplaying the company's
$16 billion litigation risk in a historic environmental case in
Ecuador.

   Representatives of the indigenous groups that brought the case say
that Chevron's recent 10-Q filing was full of "misrepresentations and
obfuscations" about the liability, which could consume almost a year
of Chevron's robust profits should the plaintiffs prevail as the oil
giant expects.

   In non-public documents obtained by the plaintiffs, Chevron said
in February of this year that it expects "a near-term unfavorable
ruling" in Ecuador resulting in "enormous liability." Yet the company
never has disclosed this internal risk assessment in its public
filings to the SEC.

   "We want to share our opinion with analysts and shareholders that
Chevron's last quarterly report does not accurately present the risk
factors the company is facing in Ecuador, nor does it reflect the
company's own internal risk assessment which is far more negative that
what it has revealed publicly," said Luis Yanza, the coordinator of
the case for the 30,000 Amazon residents who live in Chevron's former
concession area.

   Julio Prieto, a legal advisor to the plaintiffs, said Chevron's
10-Q filing "raises serious questions about a possible deliberate
strategy to hide Chevron's litigation risk in Ecuador from
shareholders."

   Chevron has been under increasing pressure from large shareholders
and environmental groups to more fully disclose the litigation risk in
Ecuador. In March, the environmental group Amazon Watch urged the SEC
to impose a "substantial" fine on Chevron for misrepresenting the
lawsuit to shareholders. The group said the oil giant has "spoon fed"
Chevron shareholders a "series of falsifications, exaggerations,
omissions, and misleading public statements..." regarding the
environmental case.

   The Amazon Watch letter to the SEC can be seen at
www.chevrontoxico.com. Separately, the New York City pension fund -
which owns roughly $600 million of Chevron stock -- has sponsored
shareholder's resolutions urging the company to reassess its approach
to the Ecuador litigation.

   Events for Chevron took an ominous turn in March when an
independent, court-appointed special master found that environmental
and other damages were between $7.2 billion and $16.3 billion. As the
party found responsible for the contamination, Chevron would have to
pay 100% of the damages if the judge accepts the report.

   The release of the special master report prompted Chevron for the
first time to disclose its potential liability in a May filing with
the SEC. In that report, Chevron claimed the lawsuit "lacks legal or
factual merit" and that the special master report cannot be used as a
basis for calculating Chevron's potential exposure even though the
practice is customary in Ecuadorian jurisprudence.

   Yet three months earlier, in a non-public document submitted to
the United States Trade Representative, Chevron presented an entirely
different and more negative spin on its litigation risk. That's where
Chevron said it expects an "enormous financial liability" in the near
term from the case. Chevron has requested that USTR cancel Ecuador's
trade preferences to pressure the government of Ecuador to have the
lawsuit dismissed.

   The legal battle has become bitter as the plaintiffs assert
hundreds of rainforest residents have died of cancer and other
diseases because Texaco (bought by Chevron in 2001) used sub-standard
practices in the rainforest. The company had admitted it dumped more
than 18 billion gallons of toxic waste into Amazon waterways and
gouged roughly 1,000 unlined toxic waste pits out of the jungle floor,
which the plaintiffs assert are still leeching toxins in soils and
groundwater.

   Texaco operated a 1,700 square mile concession in Ecuador's
Amazon, containing more than 350 wells, from 1964 to 1990.

   As the case in Ecuador comes to a close, Chevron has hired several
A-list Washington lobbyists to convince the Bush Administration to
cancel Ecuador's trade preferences as retaliation for letting the
lawsuit proceed. The plaintiffs have accused Chevron of trying to
undermine the rule of the law in both Ecuador and the U.S. by
misleading the USTR and Congress. Indigenous leaders are planning a
trip to Washington in September to counter Chevron's inaccurate
information.

   Because of the extent of the contamination, locals call the
concession where Texaco operated the "Rainforest Chernobyl". A final

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com releases the latest Analyst Interview. Today's interview
is with senior analyst Jason Napodano, who discusses Genentech (NYSE:

   So will this M activity continue? Who's next?

   Well, M activity usually breeds more M activity. I liken
large-cap pharmaceutical companies to a herd of cattle - they seem to
just follow each other around. Sometimes they are like lemmings and
follow each other off the cliff, but to answer your question, yes, I
think we will continue to see a high level of M for the remainder of
2008. Big pharma is well-capitalized and in desperate need of drugs to
fill its pipeline.

   As far as who's next, it could be anyone. The Roche bid for
Genentech (NYSE: DNA) shows us that no one is too big to be acquired.
Other large biotech firms like Biogen Idec (Nasdaq: BIIB), Gilead
(Nasdaq: GILD) and Celgene (Nasdaq: CELG) could all be targets of big
pharma names like Pfizer (NYSE: PFE).

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst
Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest
news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks
recently featured in the blog include: LoopNet Inc. (Nasdaq: LOOP),
Coca-Cola FEMSA S.A. de C.V. (NYSE: KOF), Fomento Economico Mexicano
SAB de C.V. (NYSE: FMX), Corrections Corporation of America (NYSE:
CXW) and Lexicon Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq: LXRX).

   Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst Blog:

   LoopNet Sell Rating Reiterated

   We reiterate our Sell rating on shares of LoopNet (Nasdaq: LOOP)
following the release of second-quarter financial results. Although
the company owns the leading online commercial real estate
marketplace, we believe that a challenging near-term operating
environment will curtail share price appreciation.

   Continuing macro-economic challenges will likely put stress on the
commercial real estate sector, in our opinion, as slower economic
growth combined with tight access to debt capital may limit
transaction activity. Various key operating metrics began to weaken
during the second quarter, and we believe that a lower multiple is
appropriate at this time.

   FEMSA Has Plenty of Pop Left

   We are keeping our Buy recommendation on Coca-Cola FEMSA S.A. de
C.V. (NYSE: KOF). The company posted slightly better-than-expected
results for the second quarter, and the results in the Mercosur
division were particularly impressive. Going forward, we believe new
lines of business combined with the recent acquisition will enhance
topline growth despite the difficult economic environment throughout
the world, including Mexico.

   Currently, Coca-Cola FEMSA is trading at 14.6x our 2008 earnings
estimates, close to industry mean. We think the shares have a
considerable upside potential and have used a P/E multiple of 17x our
2008 earnings estimate, closer to the valuation of its parent company
Fomento Economico (NYSE: FMX). Our target price is $67.50.

   Corrections Corp. to Benefit

   Corrections Corporation of America (NYSE: CXW) is the largest
private owner and operator of correctional and detention facilities in
the United States. We view the company's long-term prospects
favorably.

   The company holds a significant market share advantage over its
peers, with a substantial pipeline of additional capacity scheduled to
be added to the portfolio over the next two years. CXW is the clear
leader in an industry with a strong outlook, supported by favorable
economic and demographic trends.

   Lexicon Has "Knockout" Punch

   Based on its proprietary "gene knockout" technology, Lexicon
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq: LXRX) has attracted both drug-based
collaborations and strategic equity investors. We are also optimistic
about the company's pipeline.

   Lexicon recently announced that it is focusing its operations on
drug discovery and development activities related to its 10TO10
Program (advancing 10 drug candidates into human clinical trials by
2010) following the scheduled completion of Genome 5000 project. The
company has four candidates in clinical studies and its cash position
is also relatively strong.

Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/85dfe8/pfizer_partnering)
has announced the addition of the "Pfizer Partnering Guide 2008"
company profile to their offering.

biopharma companies.

   This report provides all the information you require to better
understand Pfizer and its partnering interests and activities over the
past five years.

   One of the key aspects of partnering is finding those companies
that are potential partners for the development and commercialization
of the next generation of therapies as developed by innovative
biopharma R companies. A lot of resources are spent on finding
partners, identifying their interests and making contact to initiate
discussions.

   Using this report, dealmakers will effectively and efficiently
determine the suitablility of Pfizer as a prospective partner, their
business development objectives, interests and recent partnering
activity, key partnering contacts, and partnering contract documents
signed with their recent partners.

   The report provides a firm basis for initial due diligence into
Pfizer as a prospective partner company.

   The initial chapters of this report provide an orientation of
bigpharma's dealmaking and business activities.

   Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the report, whilst chapter 2
lists the top 50 leading biopharma companies based on 2007
pharmaceutical revenues. Chapter 3 analyses the most active dealmakers
between 2005 and 2007 in M and partnering deals announced, whilst
chapter 4 identifies the top deals of 2005-7 according to reported
deal size.

   Chapter 5 provides details on how to approach bigpharma companies
with partnering opportunities whilst chapter 6 lists forthcoming
partnering events and conferences where bigpharma companies will be
present to discuss opportunities face to face.

   Chapter 7 provides a series of matrices that summarize the
company's activity in terms of marketed and pipeline products,
partnering interests and partnering activity by therapeutic area.

   The main body of the report is provided in chapter 8. An in-depth
profile of the company provides everything required to assess the
suitability of a company as a prospective partner. This includes a
company overview, detailed analysis of the company's marketed and
pipeline disease targets, partnering interests, partnering activity
according to deal type, phase of development, therapy area. The
profile also includes in-depth contact information for individuals
within the business development function.

of contract documents available in the public domain. The listing is
sorted by deal type - therefore co-promotion deals are listed
separately to licensing, M and supply deals, and so on.

   Each deal title links via Weblink to an online version of the
actual contract document, providing easy access to each contract
document on demand.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - U.S bank JPMorgan (JPM.N) said on Friday that it has agreed plans to set up its new European headquarters in London's Canary Wharf financial district.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed building, which will be developed by Canary Wharf Group, will be located at Canary Riverside South and will enable JPMorgan to achieve a long-term ambition to consolidate existing London offices at one site, a statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Friday, UK real estate investment trust Hammerson (HMSO.L) said JPMorgan had pulled out of negotiations to occupy a proposed bespoke building in London's City financial district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sinead Cruise; Editing by David Cowell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former Bear Stearns Chief Executive Alan Schwartz, who was forced to sell his hobbled investment bank to JPMorgan Chase, will leave the bank after the summer, JPMorgan said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schwartz had been offered a position as a senior deal maker , but is leaving to pursue "other career interests," according to an internal memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Schwartz, who came to prominence as a star MA advisor, had been working on deals at JPMorgan (JPM.N), he did not have a specific role and so he will not be replaced, according to someone familiar with the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After 32 years with Bear Stearns, the time is right for me to look toward the next phase of my career," Schwartz said in a memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz was named Bear's chief executive in January, succeeding long-time chief James "Jimmy" Cayne, who stepped down to become chairman after presiding over heavy subprime mortgage losses last year. At the time, Schwartz was adamant about the investment bank not being for sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Being acquired is not a strategy," he told Reuters in a telephone interview at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But weeks later, Bear Stearns faced a run on the bank and Schwartz sold the firm at a bargain price to JPMorgan Chase with the encouragement of the U.S. government. More than 7,000 Bear Stearns employees were laid off as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz shot to Wall Street fame advising on large MA deals, such as Disney's 1996 acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC Inc for $19 billion (9.5 billion pounds).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan completed its purchase of Bear Stearns in May for $1.4 billion, a huge discount from where it traded only months earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) broke 
its own record for the highest-ever quarterly profit for a U.S. 
company on Thursday, but it was lower than Wall Street expected 
largely due to lost output from Venezuela and Nigeria and lower 
yields from some oil fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The average price of a barrel of oil was slightly less than 
$125 in the quarter, nearly double last year, which also 
increased earnings reported by three of Europe's largest oil 
companies, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), Eni (ENI.MI) and Repsol 
(REP.MC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's second-quarter net income rose 14 percent to $11.68 
billion, or $2.22 a share, in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, after excluding one-time items, Exxon earned $2.27 
a share, more than 10 percent below analysts' expectations, 
according to Reuters Estimates. The miss led to a 4.7 percent 
slide in Exxon's shares, a major factor in a decline in U.S. 
stocks on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shell, the world's second-largest non-government controlled 
oil company by market value, reported a 5 percent rise in 
second-quarter earnings to $7.9 billion, and said that 
excluding one-time items, it beat analysts' forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies' oil and gas exploration and production units 
were the main profit drivers because of high oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But despite billions of dollars in capital spending in the 
quarter, oil and gas production was sluggish. That, along with 
weak profit margins from refining, restrained the companies' 
earnings somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Western oil companies' output has fallen in recent years 
and oil producing countries now prefer to award their richest 
fields to their own national oil companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The problem is that all these companies have no place to 
go to drill and no place to put their money," said Oppenheimer 
 Co analyst Fadel Gheit. "Access to resources is closing very, 
very fast."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's oil and gas production fell 8 percent from a year 
earlier, mostly due to the loss of assets taken over by 
Venezuela, a labor strike in Nigeria, and contracts that give 
host countries a larger share of production as oil prices rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shell said output fell 1.6 percent in the second quarter to 
3.126 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) 
compared to the same quarter last year, while Repsol's 
production fell 19.7 percent to 335,000 boepd in the first 
half.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PROFITS DRAW CRITICISM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The enormous profits drew criticism from politicians 
because of the high gasoline prices being paid by consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama termed Exxon's 
earnings "outrageous" and called for an end to the "tyranny of 
oil."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are making very large profits, I know that," Shell 
Chief Executive Jeroen van der Veer told reporters on a 
conference call. "But we are making very large investments," he 
said, referring to investments in exploration and production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Italy's Eni SpA posted a 4.4 percent rise in second-quarter 
adjusted net profit, below analysts' forecasts, as higher taxes 
weighed on its results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eni said second-quarter production was 1.77 million boepd, 
up 2.1 percent from the year before, and added that based on 
lower oil prices output would rise 2 percent in 2008, compared 
to an earlier forecast of 3.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adjusted net profit strips out gains from changes in the

rose 15 percent to 1.883 billion euros ($2.94 billion), well 
ahead of analysts' forecasts, because of high oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Downstream refining and marketing profits fell sharply at

Shell's downstream results fell 70 percent. Eni said refining

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former Bear Stearns Cos Chief
Executive Alan Schwartz, who was forced to sell his hobbled
investment bank to JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), will leave the
bank after the summer, JPMorgan said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Schwartz had been offered a position as a senior deal maker
, but is leaving to pursue "other career interests," according
to an internal memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although Schwartz, who came to prominence as a star MA
advisor, had been working on deals at JPMorgan, he did not have
a specific role and so he will not be replaced, according to
someone familiar with the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "After 32 years with Bear Stearns, the time is right for me
to look toward the next phase of my career," Schwartz said in a
memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Schwartz was named Bear's chief executive in January,
succeeding long-time chief James "Jimmy" Cayne, who stepped
down to become chairman after presiding over heavy subprime
mortgage losses last year. At the time, Schwartz was adamant
about the investment bank not being for sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Being acquired is not a strategy," he told Reuters in a
telephone interview at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But weeks later, Bear Stearns faced a run on the bank and
Schwartz sold the firm at a bargain price to JPMorgan Chase
with the encouragement of the U.S. government. More than 7,000
Bear Stearns employees were laid off as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Schwartz shot to Wall Street fame advising on large MA
deals, such as Disney's 1996 acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC
Inc for $19 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan completed its purchase of Bear Stearns in May for
$1.4 billion, a huge discount from where it traded only months
earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Elinor Comlay; editing by John Wallace and

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 3 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) stock
is trading at a discount amid investor worries that economic
malaise will hurt theme park attendance, but brighter long-term
prospects could put the shares in the high $30 range, Barron's
reported on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Disney demonstrates that in tough times, companies with the
best brands and most disciplined management prove their value,
though Wall Street has so far failed to notice, Barron's
reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's cable networks, including the Disney Channel
and ESPN, have produced more than half the company's profits,
and third fiscal quarter earnings narrowly exceeded analysts'
estimates, the business weekly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theme park bookings for the rest of the year have been
running flat compared with a year ago, contradicting concern
that a weak job market and high gas prices would stop people
from visiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, cautious comments on broadcast advertising pressures
at the ABC television network helped deepen the discount in
Disney's shares, which are trading at about 13 times projected
profits for this fiscal year, which ends in September, Barron's
reported, adding that it is a "generational low."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the company's favor is management's discipline about
targeting high returns on capital and its vigilance in using
its $5 billion in annual free cash flow to buy back stock and
cut debt, Barron's said.

WAIKOLOA, Hawaii--(Business Wire)--
Certiport today announced Chawanat Nakasan, 16, from from Thailand
and Penporn Koanantakool, 20, also from Thailand as this year's World
Champions for Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel(R), respectively, at
the 2008 Worldwide Competition on Microsoft(R) Office. More than
56,000 students from around the globe participated in multiple rounds
of testing, capped by the world championship round held in Hawaii,
USA, to determine this year's winners. The two world champions were
ceremoniously recognized for their accomplishments during the
Certiport PATHWAYS(TM) conference on Hawaii's Big Island where 44
finalists competed.

   "I was so glad to hear my name announced at the Word Champion,"
said Chawanat Nakasan. "Having these skills means doing better in our
jobs and living better."

   "I'm very happy," stated Penporn Koanantakool. "Even now I'm so
excited. This certifies that I know a lot in Excel. It's going to help
me a lot in the future."

   Both students expressed gratitude to parents and friends who
helped them reach this milestone accomplishment. They both agree this
Microsoft credential and their award will assist them as they progress
in school and the workplace.

easy feat. The World Champions--along with more than 56,000 students
from 47 countries--participated in multiple rounds of local, national
and regional competitions in the Worldwide Competition on Microsoft
Office from October 2007 to May 2008. The criteria for selecting
Country Champions are excellent exam scores and quick completion
times. Students who outperformed their peers to make the final round
of the Competition generally had perfect or near perfect exam scores
and completion times well below the allotted examination time.

   After compiling results from the Championship Round, these student
winners earned the prestigious title of World Champions in Microsoft
Word and Excel. Both World Champions, recognized at a Gala ceremony,
and received a grand-prize technology package worth $6,500 USD.

&lt;p&gt;Ribbon-Cutting Ceremony Features Congressional and Defense
                              Leadership
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
In recognition of the tremendous sacrifices made by our military
community, the Armed Forces Foundation (AFF) donated over $50,000 in
renovations to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC). Project
Facelift successfully achieved its goal of renovating areas designated
for terminally ill children and the families of Wounded Warriors, and
culminated with WRAMC receiving two fully renovated Nurses' break
rooms, a teen lounge, and a sprawling Surgical Waiting Room dedicated
on behalf of Congressman Bill Young and his wife Beverly Young.

   "The Armed Forces Foundation would like to thank its dedicated
volunteers, corporate donors, and the WRAMC staff for their generous
contributions to Project Facelift," said Patricia Driscoll, President
of the Armed Forces Foundation. "As an organization we strive to
provide our nation's heroes with the best possible support, and these
renovations will go a long way in improving their rehabilitation
process."

   On Saturday, May 3, 2008, the Armed Forces Foundation (AFF) and
over 30 volunteers met at WRAMC to begin the project. The campaign to
renew outdated facilities for children and military families received
a huge assist from Sony, who generously donated 5 flat screen
televisions. Additional donations, including furniture and volunteers
were provided by General Dynamics, the Armed Forces Family Foundation,
the Bechtel Corporation, Shoemaker Country and US Steel Corporation.

   The Armed Forces Foundation, along with Congressman Bill Young and
wife Beverly Young, formally unveiled the renovations at WRAMC on
Monday, August 4, 2008 at 10am. The ribbon-cutting ceremony featured
both military and Department of Defense leadership. Besides providing
patients and visiting families with improved facilities, the rooms
also serve as a thank you to WRAMC staff for their tireless efforts in
supporting America's injured Service Members and their families.

   About The Armed Forces Foundation:

   In 2001 the Armed Forces Foundation (AFF) was established as a
501(c)3 organization under the U.S. Department of Defense's America
Supports You program. AFF offers vital assistance to active-duty and
retired personnel, National Guard, Reserve Components and military
families as they cope with difficult circumstances. Through a
multitude of programs the Armed Forces Foundation assists military
families with utilities and rent; hotel and travel costs; holiday
gifts for military children; and therapeutic recreational activities.
The Armed Forces Foundation has been recognized by the President of
the United States, the Department of Defense, the Department of
Veterans Affairs, the Department of Education and the Department of
Energy for its dedication to America's Service Members.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers widened their 
2008 loss estimates for General Motors Corp (GM.N), after the 
No. 1 U.S. automaker's disappointing quarterly results as North 
American sales dropped by 20 percent and resale prices for SUVs 
coming off lease plunged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman widened its 2008 loss-per-share estimate for the 
company to $18.41 from $6.74, while Lehman now sees a loss of 
$14.51 per share, compared with its earlier loss view of $6.60 
per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said liquidity will remain an important concern 
among investors as 2008 second-half cash flow is likely to 
remain negative for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman said GM may need $3 billion to $4 billion of 
additional secured funding or asset sales, to remain above the 
company's $11 billion to $14 billion of minimum working cash 
needs. It estimated that the company should end 2009 with $12.7 
billion of cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman said with its revised 14.0 million unit SAAR 
(seasonally adjusted annual rate) for 2008, it sees more 
downside risk to the automaker's earnings and cash flow, with 
growing pressure to complete a financing and asset sale plan to 
provide sufficient liquidity through the downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAAR is a closely tracked indicator of auto industry 
demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman cut its price target on GM stock to $11 from $19.50. 
It has an "equal weight" rating on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman lowered its 6-month price target on the stock to $8 
from $9, while maintaining its "sell" rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of GM, which are down 59 percent since the start of 
the year, closed at $10.23 Friday on the New York Stock 
Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Dilipp S. Nag in Bangalore; Editing by

   The rating actions are a result of continued available credit
enhancement in excess of stressed remaining losses and the attainment
of class credit enhancement targets. Current principal allocation and
expected future cash flows are also contributing factors.

   The collateral continues to perform within Fitch's base case
expectations. Currently, under the credit enhancement structure, the
securities can withstand stress scenarios consistent with the ratings
assigned and still make full payments of interest and principal in
accordance with the terms of the documents.

   As before, the ratings on the notes are based on their respective
levels of credit. The securities are backed by a pool of prime retail
installment sales contracts secured by new and used automobiles and
light duty trucks from a diverse pool of manufacturers. All ratings
reflect the transaction's sound legal structure and the high quality
of the retail auto receivables originated by Huntington National Bank,
Ford Motor Credit Co., and Ohio Savings Bank, and serviced by System
and Services Technologies, Inc.

&lt;p&gt;Disney Star Selena Gomez and General Growth Properties Give Teens a Voice in the 2008 Presidential Campaign

    UR Votes Count Nationwide Campaign Events Capture the Pulse of
                        America's Future Voters
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
As the 2008 presidential election approaches, all eyes are on the
candidates and how voters will respond. Would the outcome be the same
if teens under the age of 18 had the chance to voice their opinions?
This summer, Disney star Selena Gomez and General Growth Properties,
Inc. (NYSE:GGP), owner/developer of shopping centers worldwide and
premier entertainment venues for teens, engage America's youth on
issues that impact their future through a unique, interactive teen
election, UR Votes Count.

   UR Votes Count is a one-of-a-kind experience that educates and
engages teens on timely, relevant issues facing the nation and the
world. It also allows teens to cast their vote for who they would
elect as president of the United States. The campaign provides teens
an opportunity to speak in one voice, potentially influencing this
year's election and making a critical impact in the 2012 election when
most of today's teens will be eligible to vote.

   Disney star Selena Gomez kicks off UR Votes Count on August 16 at
noon at Glendale Galleria (2148 Glendale Galleria in Glendale,
California). UR Votes Count takes place at 150 malls across America in
42 states over six weeks. The events begin August 16, 2008 and run
through September 21, 2008. For a complete list of UR Votes Count
dates and locations visit www.urvotescount.com.

   "I think it's so important for kids to vote and be heard," said UR
Votes Count national spokesperson and actress/singer Selena Gomez.
"Being a teen myself, I think it's really important we are educated on
the issues that affect us all; so when we're eligible, we're fully
prepared to take on one of our greatest privileges and
responsibilities - voting."

   UR Votes Count provides teens a national forum on topics, such as
the environment, healthcare, the Iraq war, social security, national
security and education. After reviewing the facts on the featured
topics, teens will have the opportunity to cast their votes on the
issues, as well as their choice for president of the United States. In
a charity component, teens also can choose which charity will receive
a $15,000, $7,500 or $2,500 donation from GGP. Once mall participants
cast their vote they will receive instant giveaways and retailer
offers, as well as become eligible for a sweepstakes that includes a
$5,000 GGP mall shopping spree; entertainment package, including
laptop computer, digital camera, flat screen TV, a sound system, a
digital video camera and a $250 Discover gift card; and a fall
wardrobe package, which includes items from the fall line of C7P, a
Chip &amp; Pepper Production, and a $1,000 GGP mall shopping spree.(a)

   Starting August 16, teens unable to attend their local UR Votes
Count campaign event can text the last name of their choice for
president of the U.S. to 77812 (Barr, McCain, Nader, Obama). To
confirm their vote participants must text back their year of birth and
zip code.(b)

   "With so much interest being taken in this year's presidential
election, it is the perfect time to engage teens in the issues and the
election process so when they are able to vote, the political process
and climate is not a foreign one to them," said Wally Brewster, senior
vice president, Marketing &amp; Communications, General Growth Properties.
"Educating teens on the issues and the candidates and then giving them
the opportunity to vote, helps them realize just how powerful their
voices can be. There's no doubt the country will take notice when the
results are announced at the end of the UR Votes Count campaign."

   To support UR Votes Count, GGP partnered with Envision EMI, LLC,
the world's largest creator of leadership and success programs for
high achieving young people, as well as Declare Yourself, a national
nonpartisan, nonprofit campaign to empower and encourage every
eligible 18-year-old in America to register and vote in the
presidential primaries and 2008 election.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Chemical today announced that it has completed a major
expansion to increase halobutyl manufacturing capacity at its plant in
Baytown, Texas.

   The expansion is part of the company's commitment to help meet
growing demand for halobutyl rubber. By adding equipment and modifying
existing facilities, the Baytown plant has increased its capacity to
produce EXXON(TM) Bromobutyl rubber (brominated butyl rubber) by 60
percent.

   "ExxonMobil Chemical continues to invest in halobutyl
manufacturing at our facilities worldwide. In the Baytown complex
alone, our project investment has exceeded $400 million since 2000,"
said Art Sullivan, vice president of ExxonMobil Chemical's Butyl
Polymers Business. "This further demonstrates our continued global
supply commitment to customers in the tire industry, supported by more
than 70 years of experience in butyl rubber research and development
and product know-how."

   The ability of halobutyl to be vulcanized with other rubbers,
along with its unique properties, such as low air permeability, high
heat resistance, and excellent flex cracking resistance makes it
valuable in tire inner liner applications. Since halobutyl retains air
far better than other elastomers, more than 80 percent of the rubber
in most premium-grade tire inner liners is halobutyl.

   ExxonMobil Chemical is a major supplier of halobutyl rubber to the
global tire industry, greatly expanding its capacity to produce this
polymer in the last decade and affirming its commitment to supporting
industry growth. In fact, since 1995 ExxonMobil has more than doubled
its global halobutyl capacity.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aug 4 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities resumed coverage
of Sirius XM Radio Inc (SIRI.O) with a "cautious" neutral
rating, saying it expects the post-merger company to survive
and have new flexibility to make the most of opportunities in
the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, Sirius Satellite Radio completed its purchase of
rival XM Satellite Radio to form Sirius XM Radio, a
broadcasting company that competes with traditional radio as
well as digital audio players like iPods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said it expects cost savings to help the
company slightly exceed the $400 million expected from merger
combinations in 2009, which will increase in subsequent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "However, Sirius XM faces a trifecta of macro, valuation,
and capital structure concerns likely to weigh on shares near
term, making us more cautious than when we last covered the
pre-merger companies 1.5 years ago, rating them both
overweight," the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Satellite radio is obviously discretionary, a clear
headwind in a weakening economy," the brokerage said in a note
to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company, which has more than 18.5 million subscribers,
has $1.09 billion of debt due in 2009 which it should be able
to refinance given a stronger business and if credit markets do
not deteriorate, J.P. Morgan added.

news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks

   Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:

   Patni Reliant on U.S. Market

   Patni Computer Systems, Ltd. (NYSE: PTI) reported in-line revenues
and earnings in the second quarter of 2008, aided by higher other
income. The company also benefited from a lower-than-expected
effective tax rate in the quarter.

   Partnership with Trillium Software and appointment of a Senior
Vice President of Manufacturing Services will serve the company well
in times of a possible slowdown of the U.S. economy, India's biggest
software exports destination. Also, introduction of Enablement
Services to help independent software vendors make the transition to
an Oracle-based 'Software as a Service' platform will help generate
additional revenues.

   Incyte Biotech a Near-Term Hold

   The discontinuation of dexelvucitabine, the most advanced
candidate for HIV/AIDS was a big setback for Incyte Corp. (Nasdaq:
INCY). However, we are pleased to see the progress in the company's
other product candidates. In our opinion, these are valuable assets,
which have the potential to drive growth forward at Incyte.

   The company received a major boost recently with the announcement
of a collaboration agreement with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) on CCR2
antagonist program. We view this collaboration as a major positive for
Incyte. Positive clinical development could validate the company's
research approach and drive the shares higher thanks to Pfizer's
marketing muscle.

   ICICI Bank at Fair Value

   We are maintaining our Hold recommendation on ICICI Bank Limited
(NYSE: IBN). The company reported 2009 fiscal first quarter (June 30)
earnings down 6% year over year to Rs7.28 billion, below our estimate
as noninterest income growth slumped 21%.

   This reflected the negative impact of Rs 5,940 million on IBN's
securities and trading portfolios due to a sharp increase in interest
rates and adverse market conditions. We are cutting our fiscal year
(March 31) EPADS estimates to $2.00 from $2.20 for 2009. Our initial
2010 estimate is $2.45. Results should benefit from solid loan growth
on strong economic gains in India, partially offset by rising
provisions.

   Tractor Supply -- Take Profits

   We are downgrading Tractor Supply Co.'s (Nasdaq: TSCO) shares from
a Buy to a Hold. The shares are up 40% in just over two weeks, and we
think it makes sense to take profits right here. The shares look
fairly valued at 15.5x our 2008 EPS estimate and 14.0x our 2009 EPS
estimate. Our target goes from $39 to $40, which is 14x our 2009 EPS
estimate.

   On July 23, the company reported better-than-expected results for
the second quarter, beating the consensus estimate by $0.05. The
management reiterated its sales and EPS guidance for full-year 2008.
Despite the difficult macro conditions, including higher food and
energy prices and weak consumer confidence, Tractor Supply's focus on
sales growth and cost controls is enabling the company to deliver
solid results.

&lt;p&gt; (Corrects Aug 1 story to make clear in 2nd paragraph the size
of Goldman's stake in Vestra Wealth is around 5 percent, not 20
percent, after Vestra corrects numbers)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Olesya Dmitracova&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON Aug 1 (Reuters) - Swiss bank UBS AG (UBSN.VX) told
London's High Court that rival start-up Vestra Wealth, backed by
U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N), had illegally poached its staff
and gained a headstart in attracting its clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Friday, UBS sought a "springboard" injunction against
Vestra after 75 of UBS's wealth managers resigned for the
start-up since May. Vestra is 5-percent owned by Goldman and was
set up by UBS's former top private banker in Britain David
Scott.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The injunction, if granted, would stop Vestra from
soliciting or dealing with any of UBS's clients and remaining
employees until October, when a trial can be held.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Vestra's lawyers said a springboard injunction would result
in Vestra and UBS missing out on business because those UBS
clients wishing to change would leave UBS but would not be able
to move to Vestra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judge is due to make a decision on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UBS is also suing four senior employees departing for Vestra
for what it said was a secret plot to encourage more UBS staff
to move to Vestra and to take their clients with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The enormity of the damage created by those wrongs has to
be met with an order that is going to be effective ... to
prevent Vestra from reaping the fruits of its wrongs," UBS's
lawyer Alistair McGregor told the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, a senior UBS executive said the bank, which has
been accused of helping some U.S. clients to evade taxes, would
stop offering cross-border private banking through its
unregulated units to U.S.-domiciled customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Vestra said UBS employees had left for the start-up,
alongside recent departures for other competitors, because of
dissatisfaction with the state of UBS's business and denied that
there was an illegal plan to poach UBS staff and clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are no grounds for preventing Vestra from competing
for the business of UBS's clients. UBS's actions are designed to
destroy the business that I have created," Scott said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UBS Wealth Management in Britain has around 300 client
advisers and roughly 37 billion pounds ($73.38 billion) in
invested assets.

&lt;p&gt;  GRENOBLE, FRANCE, Aug 04 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
TRANGO Virtual Processors(R), the leading provider of embedded
virtualization IP, announces that it now supports Windows Embedded CE
6.0. By combining the rich features of the Windows Embedded CE 6.0 kernel
with the TRANGO Hypervisor's ability to create separate and highly secure
execution environments, designers and developers can now provide the rich
user experience that customers want, with the security that
enterprise-grade applications demand.

    Virtualization is a software technology that allows developers to create
multiple simultaneous execution environments. In practical terms that
means that application software executing within each environment behaves
as though it is the sole owner and proprietor of the SoC, when, in fact,
execution is occurring on a virtual representation of the underlying
hardware.

    Running in their own secure execution environments, isolated and protected
from the rich and open environment, business-critical applications such as
DRM, payment, and enterprise applications execute as though they are
running on their own dedicated CPU, thus allowing the safe deployment of a
wide variety of valued added services. A key benefit is the ability to
certify a business-critical application and its attendant hardware
independently from Windows Embedded CE 6.0, enabling large validation and
certification cost savings.

    "In designing today's smart, connected devices, choices must often be made
concerning hardware, software, and the functionality that will be
implemented. Some choices will inevitably conflict with others, either
from a resource standpoint or from the standpoint of acceptable security,"
stated Pierre Coulombeau, Chief Operating Officer at TRANGO Virtual
Processors. "With the TRANGO Hypervisor, customers benefit from the
built-in security that virtualization provides, and the rich user
experience and broad ecosystem of Windows Embedded CE 6.0."

    "The TRANGO Hypervisor helps fuel the development of compelling solutions
for the fast-evolving market for service-oriented devices," Ilya
Bukshteyn, director of marketing, Windows Embedded Business, Microsoft
Corp. "We are delighted to work with one of the leading providers of
secure embedded virtualization, as security is a critical consideration
for customers who wish to integrate richer features into their new
connected devices."

    TRANGO Virtual Processors demonstrated a highly secure Windows Embedded CE
6.0 environment running simultaneously with a real-time OS on a TI OMAP
3430 at Expo Comm Wireless Japan two weeks ago.

    The TRANGO Hypervisor is available immediately on the ARMv5/ARMv6/ARMv7
and MIPS32/MIPS64 embedded architectures, in both single and multi-core
variants. It supports a broad choice of operating systems and is shipped
with a complete SDK and Eclipse-based tools suite.

    TRANGO Virtual Processors is the leading provider of virtualization IP for
embedded processors, licensing the TRANGO Hypervisor to major
semiconductor and device manufacturers. The company helps customers build
robust and secure architectures, deploy new value added services, and

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - John "Junior" Gotti, the accused Mafia boss who beat federal charges three times by having cases end in mistrials, was indicted again on Tuesday on conspiracy charges including murder and cocaine trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A magistrate-judge denied Gotti bail after federal authorities arrested him at his Long Island home on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic cocaine and murder three men between 1988 and 1991. The indictment was unsealed in Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday, and Gotti could be moved there to face trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A defense lawyer denied the allegations and accused federal prosecutors of seeking revenge against Gotti for successfully fighting past charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five other suspects were also indicted by a Tampa grand jury as a result of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and local police in New York and Tampa, the Justice Department said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gotti, 44, three times escaped conviction on racketeering charges linked to his late father's crime organization, the latest coming in 2006 when a judge declared a mistrial because jurors were deadlocked. Two previous trials also were voided when juries failed to reach a verdict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all three trials, Gotti said he had quit the Gambino crime family after taking control from his father. A defense lawyer reiterated that assertion on Tuesday and said Gotti has been law-abiding for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At this point it seems to be more personal than professional," defense lawyer Charles Carnesi told reporters of the prosecutors' quest to convict his client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a case based on drug dealers who want to avoid going to jail," Carnesi later told a magistrate-judge, referring to prosecution witnesses who have been convicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But federal prosecutors allege Gotti and the Gambinos, largely based in New York, have been involved in murder, kidnapping, bribery, extortion, gambling, jury tampering and other crimes nonstop from 1983 to the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have the Gambino crime family reaching out to Tampa, Florida," U.S. Attorney Robert O'Neill told a news conference in Tampa, saying the indictments were the result of a nearly 10-year investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new charges allege Gotti has held several roles in the family including de facto boss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're old crimes but the defense he used the last time -- that he resigned from the mob -- doesn't work in this case. There's no statute of limitations on murder," said Randy Mastro, a former federal prosecutor who is now a crisis management consultant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His father, John J. Gotti, was known as the "Teflon Don" for escaping conviction three times. The elder Gotti was eventually convicted of racketeering charges and died in prison in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest indictment alleges the family publicly shot, stabbed, beat and murdered people in order to "create and maintain fear and dread in others."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other five defendants are a Tampa resident, a New York state prison inmate and three New York state residents who are suspected of cocaine trafficking, murder and other charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Robert Green in Tampa and Edith Honan in New York; Writing by Daniel Trotta; Editing by David Wiessler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * To invest $1 billion in Asia property over three years&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Split between funding Indian and Chinese developers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Likes mezzanine loans and preferred equity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Dominic Whiting, Asia property correspondent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HONG KONG (Reuters) - JPMorgan plans to invest more than $1
billion in Asian real estate over the next three years, hoping
to fill a gap as Indian and Chinese developers crave funds and
rival investors recoil from property markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The investment bank, which has fared better than some Wall
Street rivals because of smaller exposure to U.S. subprime
mortgage investments, is using its special opportunities group
to finance Asian property firms and their projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a fantastic opportunity for us at a time when a lot
of our competitors are scaling down because of difficulties
accessing their balance sheet," the group's Asia real estate
head, Bryan Southergill, told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many Chinese and Indian developers are struggling to
complete ambitious projects because local banks have clamped
down on lending to the construction industry and a stock market
slump has closed off equity raising through initial public
offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Foreign investors are also shying away from markets where
risks, as well as returns, are traditionally high. But because
of a shortage of funds, developers are starting to offer plum
deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Last year many private equity players were clamouring for
exposure in India and China but it was hard to get in,"
Southergill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Now, sellers' expectations have come down and what they're
asking for is much more reasonable, but the private equity and
hedge funds have really pulled back and are more cautious."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In China, the lending clampdown was inspired by a
government bent on cooling a market where average home prices
have doubled since 2002 and high-end apartments prices have
risen much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beijing has also raised interest rates, imposed taxes on
capital gains and land appreciation, stopped non-residents from
buying apartments and employed a "use it or lose it" policy to
deter land speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In India, banks are banned from lending for land purchases
and the central bank has raised interest rates and bank reserve
ratios and clamped down on developers borrowing offshore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Housing markets that were booming have slowed, with prices
in the New Delhi area and the southern Chinese cities of
Guangzhou and Shenzhen dropping as much as 25 percent in the
last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "CAUTIOUS"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Southergill, who worked for Morgan Stanley's property
investment arm before joining JPMorgan, struck a cautious note
despite his ambitious spending plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In the next three years we aim to invest north of a
billion dollars in this part of the world, if market conditions
allow," Southergill said, adding the investment would be split
roughly equally between India and China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're cautious about equity, aggressive on mezzanine
financing, and we'll take our time during this period of market
consolidation to build long-term relationships with companies
we're going to invest with."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan has taken two, $50 million equity stakes in Indian
IPO-hopefuls EMAAR-MGF Land and BPTP Ltd, a developer in the
New Delhi region that has also garnered funding from Citigroup
(C.N) and Merrill Lynch MER.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank also gave a bridge loan to Bangalore developer
Prestige Group and a mezzanine loan for Mumbai-based Lodha
Group, but the central bank has since closed off such offshore
deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In India we're looking at conservative, preferred-equity
type structures," Southergill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In China, JPMorgan gave a pre-IPO bridge loan to Greentown
China Holdings Ltd (3900.HK) and another to Fineland Real
Estate, which is still waiting to launch an IPO, as well as a
$75 million mezzanine loan for Asia Pacific Land Ltd's
APLA.KL acquisition of a Shanghai building from Hutchison
Harbour Ring Ltd (0715.HK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan also planned to open a property investment desk in
Japan, Southergill said. But with stock markets gloomy and
banks cutting exposure to property across the region, he
dismissed the idea that Asian property markets were immune from
the global economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Last year people were saying that the global credit crunch
wouldn't affect Asia much, but as the saying goes, when the
U.S. sneezes, the world catches a cold," Southergill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The U.S. has got pneumonia right now."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Aug 05 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
For the first time, IBM (NYSE: IBM) and leading Linux distributors
Canonical/Ubuntu, Novell and Red Hat will join forces globally with their
hardware partners to deliver Microsoft-free personal computing choices
with Lotus Notes and Lotus Symphony in the one billion-unit desktop
market worldwide by 2009.

    Citing shifting market forces and the growing demand for economical
alternatives to costly Windows and Office-based computers, the four
leaders sense an ideal set of circumstances allowing Linux-based desktops
to proliferate in the coming year. Linux is far more profitable for a PC
vendor and the operating system is better equipped to work with lower cost
hardware than new Microsoft technology.

    "The slow adoption of Vista among businesses and budget-conscious CIOs,
coupled with the proven success of a new type of Microsoft-free PC in
every region, provides an extraordinary window of opportunity for Linux,"
said Kevin Cavanaugh, vice president for IBM Lotus Software. "We'll work
to unlock the desktop to save our customers money and give freedom of
choice by offering this industry-leading solution."

    The four leaders are working with their local business partners in markets
around the world to build and distribute a pre-loaded PC offering that
features IBM's Open Collaboration Client Solution (OCCS)
(http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/lotus/library/occs-overview/) including
Lotus Notes, Lotus Symphony and Lotus Sametime; the Linux operating system
of each distributor; and software applications and installation services
from the local partners in each market. The final product will be branded
by the local IT firms that bring it to market. In addition, customers,
independent software vendors (ISVs) and systems integrators have the
choice of developing applications using Lotus Expeditor based on the open
source Eclipse programming model.

    These solutions would be tailored to the needs of customers in specific
industries and sectors. For example, one type of solution for government
buyers may support key ISV applications for document/case management,
crisis management, and citizen services. Another version for Banks would
account for support for virtual thin clients that bring together the
infrastructure and applications along with Lotus social software for
branch bank front office and contact center transformation. The emphasis
for use in schools would be giving students and faculty a low cost open
platform that can capitalize on the strengths of Lotus collaboration and
social software. Understanding of such distinct customer preferences has
been accumulated from customized, local engagements around the world.

    "IBM software and Linux on desktop combined is not just a better
price/performance substitute for the Microsoft offering, but it provides a
new platform for customers and business partners to add true value by
creating tailor-made solutions," said Milan Prohaska, General Manager of
Austria-based VDEL. "The combined power of Eclipse and Lotus -- offered in
a stable and secure Linux environment at less then half the cost of the
equivalent Microsoft offering -- will create a new ecosystem for solution
providers and developers, and set new standards in value-for-the-money for
the customers."

    IBM and its Linux partners are inspired by the success of this Linux-based
package locally in both established and developing markets. Austrian IT
firm VDEL debuted the first such offering named OpenReferent in Eastern
Europe earlier this year with IBM's OCCS on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The
reception, particularly in the expansive Russian market, was very strong.
Diverse commercial and government organizations such as Russia Post
(Russian postal service) and Rushotel have piloted and phased in the new
desktops, saving 30-35 percent of the cost of the Microsoft equivalent.
VDEL has extended OpenReferent to include IBM Tivoli desktop management
and security capabilities as well.

    "We are pleased with the uptake among customers including enterprises,
governments, small businesses, and partners adopting OCCS powered by Red
Hat's enterprise Linux desktop," said Scott Crenshaw, Vice President,
Platform Business Unit at Red Hat. "Customers are demanding a
Microsoft-less PC, and we have responded with our reliable, secure Linux
solution through our top channel partners worldwide, building on the
success we've seen in Eastern Europe and other markets."

    Novell launched a similar solution based on IBM's collaboration software
and SUSE Linux Enterprise with Avnet UK, the largest IT distributor in the
United Kingdom, and its local business partners.

    "Novell is excited to partner with IBM to drive desktop innovation and
deliver the open collaboration client solution to enterprises worldwide,"
said Roger Levy, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Open
Platform Solutions at Novell. "As the best-engineered and most
interoperable Linux from the desktop to the data center, SUSE Linux
Enterprise is a strong fit for IBM. The unique combination of IBM's Lotus
software powered by SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop enables enterprises to
strengthen security, improve flexibility, and dramatically lower costs
compared to Vista. In addition, deployment is made very easy with a
seamless one-click installation feature."

    The popularity of IBM OCCS on each Linux variant has grown dramatically in
the past year. Thousands of people are working today on OCCS-powered Linux
PCs across North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. In North America,
public school systems, local governments and IT firms such as the
Government of Quebec Ministry of service, CSS Corp. and IBM itself rely on
OCCS. In Europe, customers include Radbound University in Netherlands;
Constructora San Jose of Spain; and Dotriver in France, among others. In
the eastern hemisphere, Safran Aerospace of India, SMB Outsourcing Park of
China and Kennards Hire (manufacturing) of Australia are among the growing
legions of MS-free advocates.

    Canonical, which sells subscription support for Ubuntu, a Linux operating
system that scores high marks on usability and "the cool factor," will
re-distribute Lotus Symphony via their repositories. Symphony 1.1 will be
available through the Ubuntu repositories by the end of August. General
availability will coincide with the Lotus Symphony 1.2 release expected to
be available by the end of October 2008.

    "We are excited about distributing Lotus Symphony from Canonical online
store," said Malcom Yates, Vice President, Canonical. "Open Collaboration
Client Solution powered by Ubuntu that includes Lotus Notes and Symphony
gives us the opportunity to deliver a complete Microsoft desktop
alternative to our customers. We look forward to working with our hardware
partners to expand their solution offerings."

    Value Added Distributors (VAD) and resellers will be offering the IBM Open
Collaboration Client Solution to their customers worldwide. For example
more than 12 VADs worldwide are offering OCCS powered by SUSE Linux
Enterprise Desktop from Novell to their resellers. Examples include Arrow
in the US and Avnet in the UK. Some, such as VDEL, combined OCCS powered
by RedHat with their own applications. Systems Integrators such as CSScorp
offer required services.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of International Business
Machines Corporation (IBM) and IBM International Group Capital LLC
(IIGC), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary whose debt is fully and
unconditionally guaranteed by IBM, as follows:

   IBM:

   --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+';

   --Senior unsecured bank credit facility at 'A+';

   --Senior unsecured debt at 'A+';

   --Short-Term IDR at 'F1'; and

   --Commercial paper (CP) rating of 'F1'.

   IIGC:

   --Long-Term IDR at 'A+';

   --Senior unsecured debt at 'A+';

   --Short-Term IDR at 'F1'; and

   --CP paper rating of 'F1'.

   Furthermore, Fitch has withdrawn the ratings for IBM International
Finance N.V. since the entity no longer has any outstanding debt.

   The Rating Outlook is Stable. Approximately $44 billion of debt,
including the company's undrawn $10 billion credit facility, is
affected by Fitch's action.

   The Ratings and Outlook reflect IBM's:

   ---Strong liquidity supported by a solid cash position and
consistent and increasing free cash flow;

   ---Significant percentage of recurring revenue from information
technology (IT) services, software and financing, which in aggregate
account for approximately 50% of total revenue and mitigate revenue
and profit volatility;

   ---Highly diverse customer base from both an industry and
geographic perspective;

   ---Breadth and quality of product and service offerings, including
leading market share in IT services, middleware software, servers and
storage.

   Ratings concerns include:

   ---Further expansion of core debt in order to achieve financial
and/or business objectives, such as sizable debt-financed share
repurchases and/or acquisitions, which result in a material reduction
of credit protection measures;

   ---Consistent, material increases in cash dividends long-term,
which could potentially pressure free cash flow and financial
flexibility, necessitating further increases in core debt to fund
acquisitions and/or share repurchases.

   ---Capital expenditure requirements for volatile semiconductor
segment.

   IBM has ample financial flexibility and liquidity due to a solid
balance sheet with $9.8 billion of cash and equivalents as of June 30,
2008. Liquidity is further supported by strong, consistent and
increasing free cash flow (post-dividends), which increased to $10.1
billion for the latest 12 months (LTM) ended June 30, 2008 from an
average of approximately $8.5 billion for the prior three fiscal
years. IBM also has an undrawn $10 billion revolving credit facility
that expires on June 28, 2012. Fitch expects IBM to continue to use
free cash flow to aggressively repurchase shares, pursue acquisitions
to further strengthen its position in the software and services
industries and, to an increasing degree, pay cash dividends to
shareholders.

   Total debt was approximately $34.2 billion as of June 30, 2008,
consisting of approximately $12.7 billion of short-term debt,
including $3.6 billion of CP, and $21.5 billion of long-term debt.
Fitch estimates $25.1 billion, or 73%, of total debt is attributable
to IBM's global financing business with the remaining debt
attributable to core (non-financing) operations. IBM has significant
upcoming debt maturities in the next 18 months, the vast majority of
which occur in 2009. Fitch estimates upcoming debt maturities of
approximately $2.3 billion in the second half of 2008 and $8.3 billion
in 2009. Fitch believes IBM will refinance the vast majority of the
upcoming debt maturities in order to maintain a targeted debt/equity
ratio of approximately seven times for the financing business and a
core debt to core capitalization ratio of approximately 20%-30%.

   Fitch estimates total leverage (total debt to operating EBITDA)
was 1.5 times (x) at June 30, 2008 compared with 1.8x in the prior
year. Total interest coverage (operating EBITDA/total interest
expense) remains solid at nearly 15x for the LTM ended June 30, 2008
compared with approximately 17x in the year-ago period due to
increased interest expense from maintaining higher financial leverage.
Core leverage was approximately 0.4x at June 30, 2008 compared with
0.7x in the prior year due to core debt reduction of nearly $2.8
billion and core EBITDA growth of nearly 17%. Core interest coverage
remains strong at nearly 30x for the LTM ended June 30, 2008 compared
with approximately 52x in the year-ago period.

   Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings
are available on the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Aug 05 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
At the opening of the LinuxWorld tradeshow today, IBM (NYSE: IBM)
introduced a series of new products, services and initiatives that
further expand IBM's commitment to Linux and open source by enabling the
next generation of Linux.

    As the company marks ten years of support for Linux, IBM announced a
number of cross-company initiatives to drive the next generation of Linux.
Attributes of next-generation Linux include its role in green IT; use of
Linux in business-critical workloads; use of Linux by midmarket customers;
use of Linux on the desktop client of the future; and using the
innovation-through-collaboration approach of the Linux community to bring
technology advances to customers.

    The announcements include the first contribution of open-source software
for supercomputers based on Linux; a new ISV software appliance toolkit
that will expand the reach of Linux into the midmarket; pre-loading of
Novell SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 in Lotus Foundations, a hardware
and software bundle geared for businesses from five employees on up; an
expansion of its real-time Linux initiative; the introduction of a new
version of z/VM with a dynamic memory upgrade feature available for Linux
users; a planned initiative with Canonical/Ubuntu, Novell and Red Hat
around Lotus Notes and Lotus Symphony; and more.

    "IBM has been a major supporter of Linux and open source for ten years,
helping to drive the adoption of Linux by millions of users, across tens
of thousands of devices and applications," said Inna Kuznetsova, director
of Linux at IBM. "Linux is clearly main stream. We look forward to the
next ten years, where Linux will continue to increasingly drive
business-critical workloads for all sizes of organizations, while
empowering the new enterprise data center through virtualization,
real-time Linux, cloud computing and other advances, including liberating
the desktop."

    IBM Contributes Key Open-Source Code for Linux Supercomputers

    IBM today released its first certified package of open-source software for
supercomputers based on Linux. The IBM HPC Open Software Stack is designed
to make "clusters" -- servers linked together to form a single super-fast
system -- more productive and easier to manage. Included in the new open
stack is IBM's Extreme Cluster Administration Toolkit (xCAT). The IBM HPC
Stack is available through a software repository hosted by the University
of Illinois' National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), home
to some of the largest cluster systems in the world. The repository is
available at: ftp://linuxpatch.ncsa.uiuc.edu/. (See separate
announcement.)

    Linux-Based Software Appliances for SMBs

    IBM today announced that it is enabling ISVs to deliver Linux-based
software appliances to midmarket customers through an ISV software
appliance toolkit.

    Software appliances are ready-to-use, fully integrated solutions that can
be delivered on DVDs or USB drives, reducing a company's level of IT
skills required to deploy the solutions, which can be installed in as few
as one-to-five clicks. This is viewed as a great benefit to midmarket
customers who are seeking ways to automate operations, but find
traditional software deployments are often too complex and expensive for
their resources and budgets. Linux-based software appliances have all the
necessary software components in a single compact package.

    The company also announced a preconfigured version of SUSE Linux
Enterprise Server 10 in Lotus Foundations and a toolkit that opens new
opportunities for Domino software vendors (ISVs) to deliver their
applications on a software appliance to the smallest businesses. IBM's
first hardware and software bundle geared for businesses from five to
five hundred employees, Lotus Foundations is a line of self-managing
appliance servers that allow small companies to focus on running their
business instead of their IT operations. Now by agreement with Novell, it
just got even easier for SMBs to use Lotus Foundations and capitalize on
the cost-efficiencies, reliability and stability of Linux. (See separate
announcement.)

    IBM System z

    Also today, IBM announced a new release of z/VM with more dynamic and
robust virtualization and connectivity enhancements to support rapid
business growth without additional overhead. Most notably, customers will
benefit from a new dynamic memory upgrade feature that allows users to add
extra memory for sharing across every virtual server, without a system
outage. With z/VM V5.4, customers can now grow their z/VM-hosted virtual
server environment by adding hardware assets like CPU and memory without
disruption. This supports IBM's Big Green Linux initiative.

    "With a worldwide 24/7 SAP implementation, downtime is not an option. The
new z/VM release allows us to continue to add and grow our system without
any outages," said Mark Shackelford, Vice President of Information
Services at Baldor Electric. "Running z/VM along with the IBM System z
Linux implementation of SAP has allowed us to support our recently
expanded company with little additional resources. z/VM 5.4 continues to
allow us to manage very large servers and application functionality with
a minimum of effort."

    Real-Time Linux

    IBM is building on its support for real-time Linux, adding support for
Novell's SUSE Linux Enterprise Real Time Linux with select IBM BladeCenter
servers, and with WebSphere Real Time, which extends the business benefits
of Java to time-critical applications. Real-time was traditionally a
proprietary approach used for predictable, deadline oriented functions
like financial trading or air-traffic control. IBM worked closely with
Novell, Red Hat and the broader open-source community to develop
real-time Linux and real-time Java, which brings openness, affordability,
reusability, and scalability to this important computing function.

    The predictable performance of real-time software is increasingly
important for time-critical systems in every industry, from defense to
financial markets, manufacturing, energy and utilities, and
telecommunications. Earlier this year IBM announced similar WebSphere
Real Time and BladeCenter support for Red Hat Enterprise MRG, and won the
Red Hat Innovator of the Year 2008 Award along with Raytheon Integrated
Defense Systems for their joint real-time work with the US Navy. This
supports IBM's emerging-technologies-for-Linux initiative.

    IBM Power Systems

    Linux is also helping to drive IBM Power Systems. The company is reporting
a threefold increase in customer adoption of virtualization on its unified
Power Systems line of servers that is being fueled by customers
consolidating additional Linux partitions onto existing servers. This
significant leap in the uptake of virtualization exceeds by a large margin
levels common on x86 systems

    Analysis of IBM's configuration data for systems shipped to customers
shows that year-to-year the new POWER6(TM)-based Power Systems had a
PowerVM(TM) virtualization attach rate of 64 percent in the second
quarter compared to just 21 percent in the same quarter last year. (1)
Using Gartner estimates of shipment data, IBM has calculated that only
1.7% of new x86 servers shipped in 2007 were configured with
virtualization. (2)

    The 21-percent adoption rate for PowerVM last year was already more than
10x the virtualization attach rate on x86 systems, but PowerVM acceptance
has tripled in a year to a level likely to exceed x86 estimated
virtualization attach rates by an even higher margin.

    IBM has found many customers are moving Linux to Power Systems to simplify
their computing environments by collapsing the web or application tiers
with the back-end database tiers. UNIX(R), Linux and i customers are
choosing a shared infrastructure computing model to increase their asset
utilization, simplify their environment and drive down cost of operations,
management and energy. That value proposition is winning in the
marketplace as businesses move Linux compute tiers usually found on x86
-- in addition to Sun and HP UNIX -- to the Power Systems shared
infrastructure model.

    A sizable number of Power servers configured with Linux partitions also
have data and/or transactions running on an AIX(R) or i partition. This
two-tier-in-a-box saves money with the promise of generally higher server
utilization and simplifies the environment by collapsing two tiers onto
one physical server.

    Lotus Notes and Lotus Symphony

    In other news, IBM and leading Linux distributors Canonical/Ubuntu, Novell
and Red Hat are planning to work together with their hardware partners to
deliver Microsoft-free personal computing choices with Lotus Notes and
Lotus Symphony in the one billion-unit desktop market worldwide by 2009.
(See separate announcement.)

    WebSphere Application Server Community Edition

    IBM is introducing a new version of WebSphere Application Server Community
Edition (WAS CE), based on the popular open source Apache Geronimo. WAS CE
Version 2.1 makes it easier to develop, deploy and manage applications and
includes enhanced server monitoring capabilities. The improved
administration console simplifies and automates the application deployment
process by providing an interactive deployment creation tool and the
capability to deploy applications on a group of servers. Version 2.1 also
offers the capability to create custom application servers with only the
components needed to run a particular application, providing additional
agility and flexibility.

    WAS CE reduces the complexity of application development by
pre-integrating Tomcat and the most commonly used open-source components,
such as database, web service, security, authentication, messaging, and
web tier clustering. WAS CE is available for download and use at
http://www-306.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/community/. IBM also
offers its partners sales, marketing and technical support to use WAS
Community Edition and more than 400 partners currently offer solutions on
IBM's open-source based application server. Technical support is offered
through an annual subscription. This supports IBM's business-critical
workloads initiative.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Aug 05 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today released its first certified package of open-source
software for supercomputers based on Linux(R). The IBM HPC Open Software
Stack is designed to make "clusters" -- servers linked together to form a
single super-fast system -- more productive and easier to manage.

    The announcement was made at the opening of the LinuxWorld/NGDC tradeshow
in San Francisco.

    Supercomputing, or high-performance computing (HPC), is experiencing rapid
growth as companies of all sizes begin to exploit the technology.
Increasingly, different processor types are being added to form "hybrid"
clusters that exploit the strengths of the different processors to gain
maximum efficiency or power. Many IT staffs lack sufficient experience
programming cluster-style installations. The IBM HPC Open Software
Stack(R) -- integrated and tested by IBM -- is meant to ease deployment of
supercomputing clusters. Users can also mix the open-source code with
other IBM software for a quicker, pre-integrated build-up.

    The IBM HPC Open Source Software Stack can help develop and execute
applications as well as manage and monitor a system. Included in the new
open stack is IBM's Extreme Cluster Administration Toolkit (xCAT). This
toolkit, originally developed for large x86-based clusters, has been
enhanced for Power(R)-based clusters and is used to manage the world's
most powerful computer -- a hybrid cluster built for the National Nuclear
Security Administration's roadrunner project at Los Alamos National
Laboratory in New Mexico (www.top500.org).

    The stack is planned to be initially available for systems built on IBM
Power6(R) processors. IBM plans to support IBM Power 575 supercomputing
servers and IBM x86 platforms including IBM System x 3450 servers, IBM
BladeCenter servers and IBM System x iDataPlex servers. The IBM HPC Open
Software Stack complements IBM's existing fee-based offerings for HPC
software.

    "IBM's HPC Open Source Stack results from long experience with keeping
large-scale computing systems running like clockwork," said Dave Turek, VP
of Deep Computing for IBM. "As more and more computing tasks migrate to
supercomputer style clusters, there is a need for software that can
effectively utilize and manage the large number of processors found in
these systems."

    The IBM HPC Stack is available through a software repository hosted by the
University of Illinois' National Center for Supercomputing Applications
(NCSA), home to some of the largest cluster systems in the world. The
repository is available at: ftp://linuxpatch.ncsa.uiuc.edu/.

    "Managing thousands of processor cores and multiple types of processors is
a challenge we see every day, and it will only grow in the future," said
Rob Pennington, NCSA's deputy director. "The IBM HPC Stack and other items
in the repository help open-source supercomputer users and systems
managers keep pace with the rapid advances in cluster computing. They are
in constant need of improved software components since the hardware
advances so quickly."

    Selected highlights of IBM's HPC Open Software Stack, V1, which is
supported on Red Hat(TM) Enterprise Linux 5.2, include: Advance Toolchain
for POWER(TM) Systems 1.1; IBM HPC Open Source Software Stack install
scripts; Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) version
1.3.1 and Extreme Cluster Administration Toolkit (xCAT) version 2.0

    IBM is the supercomputing industry leader with 232 systems on the current
TOP500 list representing a wide variety of platforms and technology. More

&lt;p&gt;  TORONTO, ONTARIO, Aug 05 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Editors Note: A photo is included with this press release.

    Alongside the coaches, family members and fans cheering from the stands
at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games will be four very excited young artists
from across Canada. Today, Canadian winners of the Visa Olympics of the
Imagination (VOI) art competition will depart for Beijing for the
vacation of a lifetime - a trip for two to experience the sights, sounds
and delights of the Olympic Games.

    Created for children ages 10 to 14, VOI encourages budding artists to
think creatively and explore the history and values of the Olympic Games.
The winners of the VOI 2008 competition were chosen following their
submission of an original piece of art that communicated the theme of
this year's Games - "One World, One Dream". Winners, along with their
respective parent, will spend one week in Beijing attending Olympic Games
events and participating in cultural and sightseeing activities.

    Visa Canada would like to congratulate the following first prize winners
representing Western Canada, Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada:

    - Brianna Hartness, age 13, Regina, SK

    - Maia Desjardins, age 14, Port Hope, ON

    - Cang Yi Yan, age 12, Quebec City, QC

    - Danyka Leclair, age 11, Campbellton, NB

    These four Canadians are among the 30 youth from 18 participating
countries who will attend the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games as guests of
Visa, a worldwide sponsor of the Olympic Games.

    Ontario winner Maia Desjardins painted children uniting around a
traditional Chinese dragon in her "Olympic Spirit" watercolour.
Fourteen-year-old Brianna Hartness from Regina, SK titled her drawing
"'World Win' of Dreams", which showed flags - symbolizing people and
cultures coming together from around the world - whirling into China.
Cambellton, NB's Danyka Leclair and Quebec City, QC's Cang Yi Yan, both
12, were also first prize winners. Both captured the values and history
of the Olympic Games in their individual artwork titled "Dare to Dream"
and "Tous reunis pour la victoire", respectively.

    "Brianna, Maia, Cang Yi and Danyka demonstrated the 'One World, One

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers widened their 
2008 loss estimates for General Motors Corp (GM.N), after the 
No. 1 U.S. automaker's disappointing quarterly results as North 
American sales dropped by 20 percent and resale prices for SUVs 
coming off lease plunged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman widened its 2008 loss-per-share estimate for the 
company to $18.41 from $6.74, while Lehman now sees a loss of 
$14.51 per share, compared with its earlier loss view of $6.60 
per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said liquidity will remain an important concern 
among investors as 2008 second-half cash flow is likely to 
remain negative for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman said GM may need $3 billion to $4 billion of 
additional secured funding or asset sales, to remain above the 
company's $11 billion to $14 billion of minimum working cash 
needs. It estimated that the company should end 2009 with $12.7 
billion of cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman said with its revised 14.0 million unit SAAR 
(seasonally adjusted annual rate) for 2008, it sees more 
downside risk to the automaker's earnings and cash flow, with 
growing pressure to complete a financing and asset sale plan to 
provide sufficient liquidity through the downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAAR is a closely tracked indicator of auto industry 
demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman cut its price target on GM stock to $11 from $19.50. 
It has an "equal weight" rating on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman lowered its 6-month price target on the stock to $8 
from $9, while maintaining its "sell" rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of GM, which are down 59 percent since the start of 
the year, closed at $10.23 Friday on the New York Stock 
Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Dilipp S. Nag in Bangalore; Editing by

&lt;p&gt;Zacks Releases Four Powerful ''Buy'' Stocks: Visa, Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Axsys Technologies and Murphy Oil Corporation

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Four free stock picks are being made available today on Zacks.com.
The industry's leading independent research firm highlights one Zacks
#1 Rank Strong Buy or a Zacks #2 Rank Buy stock for each of the four
main styles of investing: Aggressive Growth, Growth &amp; Income,
Momentum, and Value.

   The four highlighted picks are: Visa, Inc. (NYSE: V), Occidental
Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY), Axsys Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq:
AXYS) and Murphy Oil Corporation (NYSE: MUR).

   Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Four
daily picks are offered free at http://at.zacks.com/?id=88

   Zacks #1 Rank Stocks have nearly tripled the S 500 since 1988,
producing an average annual return of +30%. Performance has been
notable even during volatile and down times. For example, during the
last bear market, 2000-2002, the market tumbled -37.6% - but Zacks #1
Rank stocks gained +43.8%.

   Here is a summary of today's selected stocks that are now highly
rated by Zacks:

   Aggressive Growth - Visa, Inc. (NYSE: V)

   Visa, Inc. has positioned itself to benefit from strong
international growth opportunities in areas such as Asia and Europe.
The company reported 38% growth rate in volumes from these markets,
helping to temper the effect of the weakened domestic consumer
environment.

   Growth &amp; Income - Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY)

   Occidental Petroleum Corporation recently announced a record
second quarter. Earnings per share of $2.79 exceeded the consensus
estimate by 3% and more than doubled the year-prior result. Revenue of
$7.12 billion climbed from last year's $4.41 billion.

   Momentum - Axsys Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: AXYS)

   Axsys Technologies, Inc. share price is up after the company
reported strong second-quarter results on July 22 in which income grew
more than 60% from last year. Estimates are on the rise and this stock
continues to pressure a key, short-term level of resistance.

   Zacks Guide to Momentum Investing (free!):
http://at.zacks.com/?id=4311

   Value - Murphy Oil Corporation (NYSE: MUR)

   Murphy Oil saw its earnings nearly triple from a year ago as
income from its exploration segment soared and more than made up for
the decline in refining. The company has surprised on estimates 4
consecutive quarters by an average of 18.74%. Murphy Oil has a forward
P/E of only 7.52.

   How to Regularly Access Picks from the Zacks Rank Discovery for
Free: http://at.zacks.com/?id=88

   Underlying the four free stock picks is a simple truth that first
appeared in a Financial Analysts Journal article published in 1979.
Leonard Zacks, a Ph.D. in Mathematics from M.I.T. found that "earnings
estimate revisions are the most powerful force impacting stock
prices." Zacks #1 Rank is awarded to a stock when analysts sharply
upgrade their estimates of what the company will earn.

   Today, Zacks is promoting its stock recommendations by offering
four daily picks free to those who register at

&lt;p&gt;  SCOTTSDALE, AZ, Aug 05 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
PetroSun, Inc. (PINKSHEETS: PSUD) announced today that the company has
notified Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) that it is
withdrawing as a team member as it relates to the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA) BAA08-07 Biofuels-Cellulosic and Algae
Feedstocks program.

    "Although it was an honor to be selected as a team member with such an
elite group of companies, PetroSun has chosen to go down a separate path
in order to expedite the potential of algae being processed into a
commercial jet fuel," stated Gordon LeBlanc, Jr., CEO of PetroSun, Inc.
"The DARPA program has been stalled due to a protest that was filed on
May 29th by a firm that was excluded from the DARPA decision. Our
withdrawal was prompted by the uncertainty of the award process, combined
with an opportunity to initiate a project with a renewable fuel refiner
and a commercial jet fuel end-user. PetroSun's corporate position
acknowledges a true sense of urgency to prove that algae-to-biofuels can
become an immediate part of the solution for our nation's energy
independence."

    About PetroSun

    PetroSun's operations include oil and gas exploration, development,
production, oilfield tubular sales and algae-to-algal oil alternative
biofuel production. The oil and gas division is focused on the exploration
of the Holbrook Basin of Arizona, the San Juan Basin of New Mexico,
Australian based prospects and the development of oil and gas reserves in
Louisiana. PetroSun Oilfield, a wholly owned subsidiary, is engaged in the
importing of tubing and casing from China for marketing and distribution
within the US market. The alternative fuels division has entered the
commercial stage of its algae-to-biofuels production technology. The
Company plans to establish algae farms and algal oil extraction plants in
Louisiana, Texas, Arizona, Mexico and Central America during 2008. The
algal oil product will be marketed as feedstock to existing biodiesel
refiners and planned company owned refineries. PetroSun is headquartered
in Scottsdale, Arizona with field offices in Shreveport, Louisiana and Rio
Hondo, Texas. For more information about PetroSun visit the company's

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - The global economy contracted for the second month in a row in July as output declined in both manufacturing and services companies hit by slower demand and high energy costs, a survey suggested on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Global Total Output index, produced by JP Morgan with research and supply management organizations, fell to 49.0 in July from 49.4 in June, below the 50.0 mark that separates growth and contraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the first time since early 2003 that the index has posted two consecutive numbers below the 50.0 mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Global Services index eased to 48.9 in July from 49.3 in June as new business fell to its lowest point in seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier the U.S. ISM index beat expectations, jumping back to 49.5 from 48.2 in June, beating the 48.5 forecast by economists. But that still showed the service sector in contraction for the second month in a row.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a global scale, weaker growth again contrasted with stubbornly high inflation. The input prices index covering the manufacturing and services sectors eased to 76.4, but still remains close to the survey high of 78.2 hit in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Recent PMI data indicate that the global economy has downshifted considerably at mid-year," said David Hensley at JP Morgan in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The index combines survey data from countries including the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) - The price of a standard

&lt;p&gt; The price of a one-day, one-park adult ticket had stood at

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Aug 05 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today introduced new Enterprise Content Management (ECM)
software designed to help clients meet challenging legal discovery
requirements. The new IBM eDiscovery solutions extend IBM's ECM software
platform to enable organizations to proactively take control of
electronically stored information across the enterprise, helping to
reduce eDiscovery costs and improve responsiveness to litigation.

    IBM's eDiscovery software helps companies manage the entire eDiscovery
process by enabling them to automate the collecting, searching and
classifying critical information across multiple content sources, while
maintaining security and the ability to track changes. The software will
allow companies to move from scattered, point-solution approaches to a
disciplined approach that controls electronic information, helps support
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) compliance, manages risk and
delivers ongoing operational benefits.

    "In today's litigious environment, legal discovery and industry
regulations are driving us to address the way we store, manage and
retrieve information," said Rashid Mahmood, Lotus Notes Systems Manager,
The Thomas Miller Group. "IBM's eDiscovery offerings will help us manage
the rapidly growing in-house requirements for litigation-driven
electronic discovery, while helping us alleviate corporate compliance
concerns."

    IBM's eDiscovery software is the first to leverage a complete ECM platform
to transform the process of eDiscovery by proactively managing
electronically stored evidence. The new eDiscovery software integrates
with IBM's auto-classification and records management technology to help
IT departments manage information for compliance and electronic discovery
requests. IBM eDiscovery software also integrates with IBM's
content-centric business process management (BPM) capabilities to help
organizations standardize, control and automate legal discovery workflows
and enable third-party components as needed.

    The cornerstone component of IBM's solution is the new IBM eDiscovery
Manager, which enables organizations to better control the eDiscovery
process by bringing key eDiscovery tasks in house. This helps clients more
easily manage electronically stored information; provide earlier insights
into collected evidence; and prioritize downstream evidence review,
analysis and production.

    eDiscovery Manager helps authorized IT and legal users search, cull, hold
and export case-relevant email evidence. Utilizing IBM's ECM technology as
a base, eDiscovery Manager helps customers address the crushing volumes of
uncontrolled, electronically stored information and enable a more
productive, agile response to litigation.

    "The explosion of electronic content presents challenges for organizations
to retain and produce information efficiently and accurately when needed,"
said Ken Bisconti, vice president, product and strategy, IBM Enterprise
Content Management. "Our eDiscovery offerings enable customers to have
insight into knowing what information exists, where it is stored, how long
it must be kept and how to locate it."

    IBM eDiscovery Manager utilizes IBM's email archiving solutions, leverages
IBM's ECM repositories, and supports an easy-to-use interface that is
optimized for high performance search and retrieval for improved user
productivity. IBM's capabilities complement each other without significant
development and integration costs, allowing for faster deployment of a
security-rich, extendable and scalable enterprise platform that can be
used to achieve legal compliance, but without the risks and costs of point
solutions or placing the burden of integration on business users.

    IBM eDiscovery software is an integral part of the IBM Compliance
Warehouse for Legal Control. This solution combines software, hardware
and services to enable organizations to achieve, sustain and prove
compliance with multiple legal and compliance mandates, while reducing
cost, complexity and risk. The combination of IBM eDiscovery software and
IBM Compliance Warehouse for Legal Control provides the robust foundation
necessary to implement a complete solution for evidence preservation.

    IBM eDiscovery also supports IBM's broader Information Governance
strategy, which helps clients define, enforce and monitor policies
related to the control and quality of information.

    IBM eDiscovery Manager will be available at the end of August. For more
information on IBM's eDiscovery software, visit
http://www.ibm.com/software/data/content-management/ediscovery.html.

    Each IBM customer is responsible for ensuring its own compliance with
legal requirements. It is the customer's sole responsibility to obtain
advice of competent legal counsel as to the identification and
interpretation of any relevant laws and regulatory requirements that may
affect the customer's business and any actions the customer may need to
take to comply with such laws. IBM does not provide legal advice or
represent or warrant that its services or products will ensure that the
customer is in compliance with any law.

&lt;p&gt;GAZA (Reuters) - Three Palestinians who won prestigious scholarships to study in the United States have had their American entry visas revoked after "new information" was received about them, a U.S. diplomat said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had previously championed efforts by the three Fulbright scholars, residents of the Gaza Strip, to secure exit permits from Israel, which maintains a tight blockade on the Hamas-controlled territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We discovered new information that led us to revoke those visas prudentially," said an official at the U.S. consulate in Jerusalem, without disclosing the information or where it came from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three scholars, Zuhair Abu Shaban, Fida Abed and Osama Daoud, received visas after being interviewed and fingerprinted by U.S. consular officials last month at Erez, a passenger terminal on Gaza's border with Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They gave us the visas on July 30 and two days later we were told the visas were not valid," Shaban, who wants to pursue a second degree in electrical engineering, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a great shock. We had hoped to complete our studies, especially after we were granted the visas. We were packing our bags."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Shaban, Abed had flown to the United States via to Jordan, only to be turned back at the airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three were among seven Gazans awarded Fulbright scholarships this year. The U.S. government at first withdrew them because Israel did not grant the Palestinians exit permits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following media reports on the case, the Fulbrights were restored and the United States formally asked Israel to allow the scholars to leave Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel let four of the seven students travel to the U.S. consulate in Jerusalem for visa interviews but, citing security needs, denied permits to Shaban, Abed and Daoud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. consulate official said another Palestinian who planned to study under a different program in the United States had also had his visa revoked. All four students could reapply at a later date, the U.S. official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Dan Williams, editing by Alistair Lyon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REDMOND, Wash. &amp; MCLEAN, Va.--(Business Wire)--
Microsoft Corp. and BearingPoint, Inc. (NYSE:BE), one of the
world's largest management and technology consulting firms, today
announced the BearingPoint Enterprise Governance, Risk and Compliance
(EGRC) solution.

   With Microsoft, BearingPoint has created a risk-based compliance
solution based on Microsoft technology that builds on the companies'
long-standing alliance and helps organizations identify areas of risk,
assess and remediate control deficiencies, and strengthen compliance
without compromising profitability.

   Built on Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007, this technology
solution includes the necessary software and management tools to help
organizations effectively manage risk and compliance through the use
of alerts and analytics. For example, an organization can set alerts
so that if key risk indicators or compliance metrics are exceeded,
email notifications are triggered and workflow steps are initiated,
forcing employee actions to address the activity. These reactions are
documented and audit trails maintained to assist companies in
validating that appropriate and timely actions are taking place.

   The collaboration combines Microsoft's "people-ready" software
that strengthens the capabilities and connections of users with
BearingPoint's leadership in business strategy, management consulting
and systems integration.

   "In so many organizations, compliance and risk management are
treated as silos of responsibility, supported by costly, reactive
point solutions," said J.R. Reagan, vice president and managing
director, Global Risk, Compliance and Security, BearingPoint. "By
merging our deep experience in risk and compliance management with
Microsoft's technology, we are delivering a powerful, compelling and
cost-effective solution for clients worldwide."

   "Initially developed for the public sector, the risk-based
compliance solution now addresses the business-critical risk and
compliance management needs of our enterprise clients across a number
of industries," said Brian Scott, Vice President of Worldwide
Industries, Microsoft. "The global competitive environment continues
to become more challenging, and the competitive pressure is
substantially increased by the need to meet more demanding regulatory
requirements. To help meet global competitive and regulatory
challenges, we have teamed up with BearingPoint to develop a solution
that provides the seamless communications, connections and
collaboration needed to break down today's barriers between operations
and compliance."

   The new risk-based compliance solution will address the unique
needs of clients across all industries as they work to keep pace with
today's increasingly complex regulations. Initially, the companies
will aggressively market to pharmaceutical, energy, and financial
services companies as well as government agencies.

   Pharmaceutical organizations which store information in a wide
range of isolated systems will be better able to retrieve and
synthesize data and collaborate to support regulatory compliance.

   Energy companies, including power and utilities, which need to
comply with unprecedented levels of regulatory stridency in an
increasingly fast-moving business environment will be able to take a
more proactive approach in addressing issues such as market
operations, code of conduct, security, reliability and environmental
health and safety.

   Clients within the financial services industry, who have been
under pressure to meet increasingly rigid compliance requirements
ranging from stronger anti-money laundering regulations worldwide,
Sarbanes-Oxley, J-SOX and Markets in Financial Instruments Directive
(MIFD), will benefit from the solution's fully integrated
collaboration, workflow and document management tools.

   The BearingPoint EGRC solution builds on BearingPoint's EMEA ECM
and Compliance solutions established at more than a dozen clients
in six European countries and the Integrated Financial Control and
Compliance solution (iFiCCS) designed for and used by US government
clients. For almost 10 years, BearingPoint and Microsoft have
maintained an alliance to develop and deliver integrated solutions to
mutual clients. These solutions deliver a lower total cost of
ownership and generate greater productivity for clients--from process
improvement to managing suppliers; to developing new methods of
collaboration and communication.

&lt;p&gt;  WALTHAM, MA, Aug 05 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Enterprise and mid-size companies are challenged with complying to
corporate policies and government regulations associated with governance
of documents, records and processes. Many lines of business, including
IT, have groups operating with ad hoc processes and undocumented
procedures. Executives have a growing need to reign in business units and
teams to standardize key document lifecycles, store and protect corporate
records, and enforce compliance processes.

    Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) 2007 presents a platform for
companies to gain better control and predictability over business line
areas, including IT, finance, and R As a collaborative knowledge and
workflow platform, MOSS can safeguard the information supporting a
company's compliance program and reporting protocols. Integrated
protection and control features manage data access and authorization.
Further, using MOSS to support IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL)
initiatives indirectly delivers compliance support.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--

   What are you looking for in companies that show some upside
potential?

   Some of the factors which should help median EPS growth are share
repurchases, which though have slowed in recent months, will still
reflect what happened last year. Oddly, increased share counts will
also help boost EPS among the Financials. Since the ones that have
increased their share counts the most (by going hat-in-hand to the
sovereign wealth funds looking for new capital) are also the ones that
are likely to reports losses, so the loss per share will be less.

   In addition, to the extent that firms have large operations
overseas, they should benefit from the currency translation effects of
the weak dollar. The weak dollar has also boosted those companies that
export a substantial portion of their sales.

   Keep in mind that median growth rates are inherently equally
weighted, so the growth rate for Cabot Oil and Gas (NYSE: COG) is just
as significant to the results for the Energy sector as the growth rate
for Exxon (NYSE: XOM).

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - JPMorgan plans to invest more than $1 billion in Asian real estate over the next three years, hoping to fill a gap as Indian and Chinese developers crave funds and rival investors recoil from property markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The investment bank, which has fared better than some Wall Street rivals because of smaller exposure to U.S. subprime mortgage investments, is using its special opportunities group to finance Asian property firms and their projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a fantastic opportunity for us at a time when a lot of our competitors are scaling down because of difficulties accessing their balance sheet," the group's Asia real estate head, Bryan Southergill, told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Chinese and Indian developers are struggling to complete ambitious projects because local banks have clamped down on lending to the construction industry and a stock market slump has closed off equity raising through initial public offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign investors are also shying away from markets where risks, as well as returns, are traditionally high. But because of a shortage of funds, developers are starting to offer plum deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Last year many private equity players were clamoring for exposure in India and China but it was hard to get in," Southergill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now, sellers' expectations have come down and what they're asking for is much more reasonable, but the private equity and hedge funds have really pulled back and are more cautious."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In China, the lending clampdown was inspired by a government bent on cooling a market where average home prices have doubled since 2002 and high-end apartments prices have risen much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beijing has also raised interest rates, imposed taxes on capital gains and land appreciation, stopped non-residents from buying apartments and employed a "use it or lose it" policy to deter land speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In India, banks are banned from lending for land purchases and the central bank has raised interest rates and bank reserve ratios and clamped down on developers borrowing offshore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Housing markets that were booming have slowed, with prices in the New Delhi area and the southern Chinese cities of Guangzhou and Shenzhen dropping as much as 25 percent in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CAUTIOUS"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Southergill, who worked for Morgan Stanley's property investment arm before joining JPMorgan, struck a cautious note despite his ambitious spending plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the next three years we aim to invest north of a billion dollars in this part of the world, if market conditions allow," Southergill said, adding the investment would be split roughly equally between India and China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're cautious about equity, aggressive on mezzanine financing, and we'll take our time during this period of market consolidation to build long-term relationships with companies we're going to invest with."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has taken two, $50 million equity stakes in Indian IPO-hopefuls EMAAR-MGF Land and BPTP Ltd, a developer in the New Delhi region that has also garnered funding from Citigroup (C.N) and Merrill Lynch MER.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank also gave a bridge loan to Bangalore developer Prestige Group and a mezzanine loan for Mumbai-based Lodha Group, but the central bank has since closed off such offshore deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In India we're looking at conservative, preferred-equity type structures," Southergill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In China, JPMorgan gave a pre-IPO bridge loan to Greentown China Holdings Ltd (3900.HK) and another to Fineland Real Estate, which is still waiting to launch an IPO, as well as a $75 million mezzanine loan for Asia Pacific Land Ltd's APLA.KL acquisition of a Shanghai building from Hutchison Harbour Ring Ltd (0715.HK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also planned to open a property investment desk in Japan, Southergill said. But with stock markets gloomy and banks cutting exposure to property across the region, he dismissed the idea that Asian property markets were immune from the global economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Last year people were saying that the global credit crunch wouldn't affect Asia much, but as the saying goes, when the U.S. sneezes, the world catches a cold," Southergill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The U.S. has got pneumonia right now."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) plans to buy back as much as $20 billion of its stock to boost its flagging share price, Bloomberg News quoted a top-rated software analyst as saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of the giant software company rose 2 percent. Microsoft declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS analyst Heather Bellini expects Microsoft to complete the repurchase over the next three months, and said the amount is at least five times larger than its average share buyback per quarter in the last fiscal year, according to the Wednesday Bloomberg article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bellini in a July 25 note, after Microsoft met with analysts, had said the company should pursue accelerated share repurchases. "We continue to expect noise on this front at some point during F1Q09 (potentially as far out as when Microsoft announces September quarter results on October 23rd)," Bellini wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bellini was ranked the best software analyst by Institutional Investor magazine last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have been debating how Microsoft might revive its share price, which is down 26 percent so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been aggressive in buying back shares. It has roughly $3 billion remaining of a $36.2 billion five-year share repurchase program it started in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friedman, Billings, Ramsey  Co analyst David Hilal suggested late last month that Microsoft should issue debt for the first time in its history to fund a buyback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hilal's research showed that a $20 billion leveraged share buyback would boost its calendar 2009 earnings 7 cents a share. A $35 billion repurchase would add 13 cents and a $50 billion buyback would add 20 cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares rose to $26.74 on Nasdaq in afternoon trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Christopher Kaufman and Peter Henderson, with additional reporting by Christopher Kaufman in New York; Editing by Derek Caney and Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;Quad-Core AMD Opteron(TM) Processors Offer ''Best-of-Breed'' Platform for Microsoft SQL Server 2008

    World-Record Benchmark Scores Showcase the Premier Solution to
    Help Businesses Manage Critical Data and Scale More Efficiently
SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
AMD (NYSE: AMD) today announced its support for the Microsoft
Corp. Release to Manufacturing (RTM) of SQL Server 2008, its
next-generation data and analysis platform. SQL Server 2008 running on
Quad-Core AMD Opteron(TM) processors promises to provide customers
with a "best-of-breed" platform for their data-intensive business
applications, even during peak workloads. AMD today is also
highlighting the record-breaking data management and analysis
benchmark tests of the HP ProLiant DL785 G5 server featuring Quad-Core
AMD Opteron processors running SQL Server 2008; these results
underscore the performance and scalability promise of this
AMD-Microsoft solution.

   "Now, more than ever, it is imperative to offer customers a
forward-looking database solution that enables the full capability of
the SQL Server Data Platform today, and that also scales for the
future," said Dan Neault, marketing general manager, SQL Server at
Microsoft Corp. "AMD Opteron processors provide a robust, scalable and
power-efficient platform in order to offer our joint customers an
optimized solution that will run high capacity, business critical
applications with outstanding performance."

   The exceptional scalability and performance of AMD's Direct
Connect Architecture is evident in two unique benchmark tests
conducted by HP using Quad-Core AMD Opteron processor-based 8-socket
HP ProLiant servers running Microsoft SQL Server 2008. These tests
demonstrate that customers can deploy large decision support and
enterprise resource planning solutions at competitive pricing with
optimum scalability and performance.

   --  An HP ProLiant DL785 G5 running Microsoft(R) Windows Server(R)
        2008 x64 operating system and Microsoft SQL Server 2008
        Enterprise x64 Edition database has achieved a world record on
        the TPC-H@300 GB decision support benchmark.(1)

   --  Further, the HP ProLiant DL785 G5 8-socket server with
        Quad-Core AMD Opteron(TM) processors Model 2360 SE also
        achieved first place on the two-tier SAP(R) Sales and
        Distribution Standard Application Benchmark among 8-processor,
        32-core x86 class servers with similar configurations and
        workloads. At the time of testing, the server was running
        Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Enterprise Edition operating
        system, Microsoft SQL Server 2008 x64 database and the SAP
        Enterprise Resource Planning application.(2)

   "In conjunction with the launch of Microsoft SQL Server 2008, AMD
is proud to offer customers a comprehensive database platform that
offers outstanding performance-per-watt and scalability capabilities,"
said Patrick Patla, general manager, Server and Workstation Business,
AMD. "When customers leverage the power of a Quad-Core AMD Opteron
processor for two-socket servers and higher, they know that they have
a dynamic solution that will handle the most demanding database
workloads, evolve with their business needs and empower them to make
real-time decisions."

   "As one of the top ten real estate Multiple Listing Services in
the country, and with over 30,000 active users, our IT infrastructure
needs to be able to scale to handle heavy workloads during peak
hours," said Matt Levallee, director of technology, MLS Property
Information Network, Inc. "With that in mind, we are eager to upgrade
to SQL Server 2008 from SQL Server 2005 running on AMD Opteron(TM)
processor-based systems, as we realize it offers an optimal
combination of performance, scalability and efficiency for our money.
We are also quite pleased with the fact that the technology we're
implementing can grow with us as our business thrives--that is
something AMD uniquely offers."

   In addition to posting top database-related scores with SQL Server
2008 and HP ProLiant DL785, the HP ProLiant DL 585 G5 servers based on
Quad-Core AMD Opteron processors also hold top TPC-C scores among
4-processor, 16-core systems,(3) and top SAP SD two-tier benchmark
scores among 4-processor, 16-core systems,(4) with SQL Server 2005.

&lt;p&gt;Unisys Extends Leadership in Delivering High-Performance Solutions Based on Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Technology

   Unisys services and solutions offer Smead Manufacturing Company
and other enterprises record-setting performance for business-critical
applications
BLUE BELL, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
Unisys Corporation (NYSE:UIS) announced today that It has extended
its position as a leader in the market for high-performance solutions
that maximize the power of Microsoft SQL Server 2008, which was
released to manufacturing today. Unisys High Performance SQL Server
solution offers clients record-setting speed and power to drive their
critical applications across their enterprise today. It also provides
a foundation for the future support of other technologies such as
Microsoft Hyper-V virtualization platform in a real-time
infrastructure that dynamically supports emerging business demands.

   Smead Manufacturing Company, a Minnesota-based manufacturer and
worldwide distributor of office supplies, is looking forward to taking
advantage of the Unisys and Microsoft powered solutions. "We've been
using Unisys ES7000 Enterprise Servers and Microsoft SQL Server for
many years to support our critical PeopleSoft applications," says
Joseph Vossen, vice president of information services at Smead. "With
the release of SQL Server 2008, we expect to see a significant
improvement in performance and reliability. As our data requirements
grow, we know that we can rely on Unisys and Microsoft to provide a
scalable platform for our business operations."

   A key Microsoft alliance company, Unisys has more than 15 years of
experience in deploying Microsoft technology for high-volume,
mission-critical applications. Unisys is also one of the largest
enterprise users of Microsoft technologies, benefiting clients with
its deep understanding of Microsoft's software solutions. With SQL
Server 2008 now progressing to general availability, Unisys is
expanding its already-extensive portfolio of Microsoft services and
solutions to help customers quickly capitalize on the benefits of new
features introduced in SQL Server 2008, such as enhanced security,
data compression, Resource Governor and support for new data types.
Additionally, Unisys is building on the leadership SQL Server 2008
extract, transform, load (ETL) benchmarking already established.

   Best Practices for SQL Server 2008

   In delivering services to assist customers in deploying SQL Server
2008 in high transaction environments, Unisys has compiled a number of
best practices for optimizing the loading and storage of data. These
best practices give many enterprises a head start in maximizing their
investments in Microsoft SQL Server 2008.

   "Microsoft is delighted to continue its close work with Unisys to
deliver enterprise performance on the SQL Server 2008 data platform,"
said Dan Neault, general manager of SQL Server at Microsoft Corp.
"Performance benchmarks like the ETL benchmark demonstrate the
benefits that our joint customers will enjoy when deploying Microsoft
and Unisys technologies together."

   Broad Testing with Hyper-V

   As part of its ongoing joint engineering development with
Microsoft - especially in its Bellevue, Wash. Solutions Alliance
Technology Center - Unisys virtualization experts have been
extensively testing Hyper-V across Unisys line of enterprise servers.
Many Unisys customers have already announced plans to conduct testing
with SQL Server 2008 and Hyper-V on their ES7000 servers.

   "Unisys believes that SQL Server 2008 and Hyper-V present a
cost-effective platform for most Microsoft applications," said Mark
Feverston, general manager, Microsoft Solutions, Unisys. "It's
extremely encouraging to hear many of our customers' intentions to use
SQL Server 2008 and Hyper-V in a virtualized environment as part of a
real-time infrastructure. We will continue to help them maximize their
business objectives."

   Record-Breaking Benchmark

   Earlier in 2008, Unisys and Microsoft presented benchmark test
results that demonstrate the strength of the joint Unisys and
Microsoft solution. Using a 64-core Unisys ES7000 Enterprise Server
system, Unisys and Microsoft engineers successfully loaded one
terabyte of data using SQL Server 2008 Integration Services in less
than 30 minutes -- a new record (and 33 percent faster than
previous/other results). Overall, the extract, transform, load (ETL)
tools included in SQL Server 2008 performed better than comparable
tools from other database vendors in similar workloads.

   In addition to this ETL benchmark, Unisys and Microsoft also
announced earlier this year the results of a performance and
scalability test of Microsoft Dynamics CRM 4.0 on the Unisys ES7000
Enterprise Server platform. As part of the testing, computers were
configured using Microsoft Windows Server 2008 and Microsoft SQL
Server 2008 to simulate an environment consisting of 24,000 concurrent
users executing more than 169,000 transactions per hour. The benchmark
results from this study demonstrated that a single Microsoft Dynamics
CRM 4.0 instance on the Unisys ES7000 platform can achieve sub-second
response times with a heavy workload against a large, complex
database.

   These results remain unmatched by any other vendor. Results like
these illustrate that Unisys highly scalable line of enterprise
servers is one of the world's fastest performing database platforms
for SQL Server 2008, and is optimized for business intelligence and
other data-intensive applications.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aug 6 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded Pacer
International Inc PACR.O to "underweight" from "neutral,"
saying it expects the logistics provider to lose earnings
momentum in the second half of 2008 due to lower fuel prices
and weak volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The greater issue for Pacer is risk from the repricing of
its primary rail service contract with Union Pacific Corp
(UNP.N) in 2011, the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan lowered its earnings estimates on Pacer for the
second half of 2008 and for 2009, saying while other intermodal
providers showed solid volumes, the company's intermodal
volumes fell and Pacer seems to be losing traction in the
market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday, Pacer reported better-than-expected quarterly
results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said Pacer's second-quarter earnings growth
was mainly driven by a timing mismatch between the fuel
surcharge it pays and the customer fuel surcharge it receives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Intermodal transport, which uses multiple modes of
transportation, is the biggest contributor to the company's
revenue.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, analyst comment, share price)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Angeliki Koutantou&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATHENS Aug 6 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Hellenic (CCH) HLB.AT,
the world's No.2 Coke drinks bottler, on Wednesday clinched a
deal to buy family-owned Italian peer Socib SpA for 270 million
euros ($418.5 million), expanding in its second largest market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said the acquisition was a good strategic move that
may help offset profit concerns after CCH and other soft drink
bottlers cut forecasts on fears of a downturn in consumer
spending, rising energy costs and high inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "CCH has the cash to proceed with buyouts and it is positive
that they are sticking to long-term growth plans despite the
crisis in the beverage sector," said one Athens-based analyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Greek bottler, 23.3 percent owned by Coca-Cola (KO.N)
will buy Italy's second largest Coke bottler, adding 5 regions
in southern Italy with a population of nearly 14 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In June, CCH cut 2008 guidance, citing rising costs and
adverse conditions in some of its markets, a move which prompted
a series of downgrades from brokerages and hitting its shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Italy is CCH's second biggest market in terms of volume and
has not reached maturity yet. The deal gives CCH opportunities
to improve its profit margins in the medium term," he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Socib sells bottled Coke in the south of Italy, while the
local unit of Coca-Cola Hellenic (CCH) operates in the north of
the country. The acquisition will increase sales volume in Italy
by approximately 25 percent, CCH said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CCH said the buyout of Socib would not seriously impact its
2008 profit, as it will be finalised in the year's last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By 1310 GMT, CCH's shares were 1.6 percent down to 17.06
euros, underperforming Athens bourse's general index .ATG
which gained 0.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CCH trades at about 13 times its estimated 2008 earnings, on
a par with Coca-Cola Enterprises, the world's No.1 Coke bottler,
and at a discount to Australia's Coca-Cola Amatil which trades
at 15 times.

&lt;p&gt;Earthquake Commission of New Zealand Partners with IBM in Successful Deployment of Guidewire ClaimCenter

   IBM-led engagement brings Guidewire ClaimCenter to New Zealand's
   Earthquake Commission in order to improve natural disaster claims
                         handling capabilities
SAN MATEO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
The Earthquake Commission of New Zealand (EQC), IBM(R), and
Guidewire Software(R), today announced that EQC, in an IBM led
implementation, have successfully deployed Guidewire ClaimCenter(R) to
swiftly assess and manage natural disaster claim demands.

   EQC is a government-owned Crown Entity responsible for providing
residential natural disaster insurance coverage throughout New
Zealand. To function at its best EQC needs a single claims system with
flexible functionality, which is easy to use - and has a short
learning curve for new users.

   Its previous claims management system was nearing the end of its
lifespan and could not provide the functionality and flexibility that
met the Commission's strategic direction. EQC sought to improve its
claims capabilities with an "anytime/anywhere" web-based claims system
that was easily accessible by a remote workforce - regardless of their
location - and could instantly scale as its business demanded. EQC's
claims volume can surge from an average of 3,000- 4,000 claims
annually to 100,000-200,000 in the event of a large-scale natural
disaster in an urban area.

   EQC selected IBM to lead this strategic claims project which
included solution design and development as well as software
selection, configuration and deployment. After extensive and careful
evaluation, IBM had selected Guidewire ClaimCenter because it is a
proven, modern, end-to-end claims management system that can be
readily configured to meet EQC's specific requirements. EQC also
selected IBM to host and manage their ClaimCenter Implementation for
an initial term of 10 years.

   "We found the Guidewire application to be easy to configure and
straightforward to implement and integrate with EQC's other systems,"
said Bill Doak, IBM global business services partner, Asia-Pacific.
"This is a great example of IBM's ability to provide
software-as-a-service and it highlights the real value proposition IBM
provide clients."

   The result is proving to be an ideal fit for EQC. "Our adjusters,
claims staff and managers absolutely love the system and all the
functionality improvements that have come with it," says EQC's
insurance manager Lance Dixon. "ClaimCenter's electronic claim file,
and online notes, keeps everyone updated on a claim's status, freeing
the adjuster to focus on managing the EQC/claimant relationship
instead of continuously providing status reports."

   An aspect of EQC's implementation, and a good example of
ClaimCenter's flexibility, is the integration of ClaimCenter's
catastrophe management functionality with GeoNet, a New Zealand
Government organization that details all earthquake activity in New
Zealand and the integration of ESRI's geographic information system
(GIS). When an earthquake occurs in New Zealand, GeoNet seismographs
record the event and send earthquake event details to EQC who create a
new event in ClaimCenter. Then a boundary is automatically drawn by
the GIS so that relevant claims within the boundary can be
automatically linked to that event. Events of significant magnitude
result in event work plan creation and the set-up and assignment of
property inspection teams, including remote offices (EQC is a single
site organization with just 23 staff) to manage claims for the
specific event.

   The IBM-configured ClaimCenter system is providing EQC the ability
to:

   --  Use modern technology to support and advance its business
        processes - technology limitations no longer dictate or limit
        how business is conducted.

   --  Modernize its technology platform to ensure cost effective and
        flexible system support.

   --  Better manage claim activities and adjuster workflows through
        automated activity-driven task assignments.

   --  Gain visibility into adjuster workloads and claim status.

   --  Reduce training times for new users.

   In addition, and a world first, EQC has integrated ESRI's ArcGIS
Server within ClaimCenter to:-

   --  Assist with address matching claims as they are registered.

   --  Provide the tools for drawing the event boundary.

   --  Allow loss adjusters and other field staff to see their daily
        activities on a map.

   --  Provide map based management reports to EQC's executive team.

   --  Provide maps to the web for public viewing of events.

   "IBM's global depth and breadth of expertise proved invaluable in
developing the right solution for EQC and we commend IBM for being the
first Guidewire Alliances partner outside of North America to
successfully implement ClaimCenter," said Ian Tavener, vice president,
International Operations, Guidewire Software. "We are also very proud
that our technology is playing a key role in EQC's claims business and
helping them to better serve the people of New Zealand."

&lt;p&gt;Soundtrack to Disney Channel Original Movie The Cheetah Girls One World Set for Release on August 19

            First Soundtrack to Be Released in CDVU+ Format

           Radio Disney's PLANET PREMIERE Set for August 16

           Disney Channel Original Movie Premieres August 22
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
The soundtrack to the highly anticipated The Cheetah Girls One
World Disney Channel Original Movie will be released by Walt Disney
Records on August 19. The disc features hip-hop, R and
Indian-influenced songs performed by kid and tween superstars Adrienne
Bailon, Kiely Williams and Sabrina Bryan. The Cheetah Girls One World
premieres Friday, August 22 on Disney Channel; its anthem song and the
soundtrack's lead single, "One World" made its Radio Disney debut in
July.

   The album is being released in the CDVU+ format, a new musical
experience that "reads" like a digital magazine full of exclusive
content - video footage (interviews, dance steps), photos and lyrics
-- that can be accessed both on and offline. CDVU+ replaces the
traditional CD booklet/jewel case with eco-friendly packaging (100%
recyclable, 35% post-consumer) while still offering an unprecedented
amount of content for a soundtrack.

   Radio Disney will present the world premiere of the soundtrack on
Saturday, August 16 (7:00 p.m. ET/4:00 p.m. PT) during Radio Disney's
PLANET PREMIERE, a regular feature presentation from the authority
on the music kids love and parents trust. The soundtrack will be
replayed on Sunday, August 17 (1:00 p.m. ET/10:00 a.m. PT). Radio
Disney's Top 30 chart currently features the singles "One World" and
"Dance Me If You Can."

   The Cheetah Girls One World, follows Chanel, Aqua and Dorinda -The
Cheetah Girls--as they travel from New York to India to star in a film
directed by an aspiring Bollywood movie director. Upon arriving in
India, they are shocked to learn their movie's producer has a role for
only one Cheetah Girl. Dreams and friendships are tested as they begin
to compete against one another for the title role. Before long, the
three girls begin to question their commitment to 'The Cheetah Girls'
dream and each must weigh her own aspirations against the group's
future.

   The soundtrack features songs written by hit-makers Andy Dodd,
Adam Watts, Antonina Armato, Tim James, Jamie Houston, Robbie Nevil,
Matthew Gerrard, Nikki Hassman, Adam Anders and Kara DioGuardi. The
underscore was composed by David Lawrence ("High School Musical,"
"High School Musical 2"). Additionally, each Cheetah co-wrote a song
for the album: "Stand Up"--written by Adrienne Bailon, Matthew
Gerrard, and Robbie Nevil; "Crazy on the Dance Floor"--written by
Sabrina Bryan, Sebastian Jacome, and Karl Cameron; "Circle
Game"--written by Kiely Williams, Antonina Armato, and Tim James.

   The Cheetah Girls began as a 2003 Disney Channel Original Movie
based on the best-selling book series for kids and tweens written by
award-winning author Deborah Gregory (Jump at the Sun/Hyperion Books
for Children). Within two years of the movie's debut, the group gained
a large fan base, topped the soundtrack charts with a double-platinum
soundtrack and enjoyed a highly-rated DVD release. In 2006, "The
Cheetah Girls 2" made its debut and was the #1 basic cable movie that
year among Kids 6-11 and Tweens 9-14. The soundtrack entered the top
ten on The Billboard 200, topped the soundtrack chart and was
certified platinum. The group embarked on an 86-date concert tour
which was among the Top 10 most successful tours of the 2006/2007,
grossed $26 million and helped set a new record for the largest sales
in the history of the Houston Rodeo in 2007 with an impressive 73,200
tickets sold (a record previously held by Brooks &amp; Dunn).

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Olympic Gold Medalist Joey Cheek, co-founder of Team Darfur, will not attend the Beijing Olympics because China has revoked his visa, his organization said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheek, a speedskater who competed in the 2006 Winter Games in Turin, had planned to travel to Beijing on Wednesday, to support Olympic athletes who are members of Team Darfur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international coalition of athletes campaigns to call attention to the humanitarian crisis in Sudan's Darfur region where, according to international experts, some 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million been driven from their homes since rebels took up arms against the government five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China is a major investor in Sudan's oil industry and is its largest weapons supplier. In the runup to the Olympics, Beijing has come under international pressure to help end the conflict in Darfur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington-based Team Darfur said the Chinese Embassy revoked Cheek's visa on Tuesday with no explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheek said he was sad he would not be able to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite the fact that I've always spoken positively of the Olympic ideal, and never called for a boycott or asked an athlete to break an IOC (International Olympic Committee) rule, my visa was revoked less than 24 hours before my scheduled departure," Cheek said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The denial of my visa is a part of a systemic effort by the Chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of Darfur."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A representative of the Chinese Embassy in Washington could not be immediately reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheek announced in 2006 he would donate his Gold Medal bonuses to relief in Darfur and encouraged other athletes and sponsors to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joanne Allen, editing by Alan Elsner)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Georgia Tech, Bryn Mawr College and Microsoft Fund New Curriculum Using Personal Robots at 28 Schools

    Institute for Personal Robotics in Education Shares Successful
          Recipe for Attracting Students to Computer Science
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Through the Institute for Personal Robots in Education (IPRE)--a
partnership between Georgia Tech College of Computing, Bryn Mawr
College and Microsoft Research--28 high schools and universities are
being provided the opportunity to enhance their introductory Computer
Science curriculum using personal robots as a context for teaching
foundational computing skills. Winners will share $250,000 and receive
paperback book-sized robots called Scribblers, enhanced with special
IPRE hardware technology, along with the IPRE software and class text.

   Awards were presented to schools whose goals closely matched
IPRE's mission. Additional grant criteria included the technical
quality of the proposed program, chances for successful implementation
and potential to support students in groups that are not traditionally
well represented in computing.

   "Many students, especially non-majors, used to think Computer
Science was boring, and now they love it. We found that bringing
personal robots into the classroom creates a dynamic context for
learning the foundations of Computer Science and makes computing a
more social and creative activity," said Dr. Tucker Balch, director of
IPRE and professor of interactive computing at the Georgia Tech
College of Computing. "During a time of declining student interest in
science and technology, our goal is to get as many schools as possible
to adopt the curriculum and help reverse that trend."

   The award winners are: Arkansas Tech University, Austin College,
Brooklyn College, Canisius College, Fayetteville State University,
Florida Virtual School, Georgia State University, Haddonfield Memorial
High School, Hammond School, Harvey Mudd College, Indiana University,
Ithaca College, Olin University, Park University, Phillips Exeter
Academy, Presbyterian College, Rochester Institute of Technology,
Rollins College, Rowan University, St. Xavier University, Stetson
University, Tecnologico de Monterrey, Texas Tech University,
University of Delaware, University of Georgia, University of Minnesota
- Morris, University of Minnesota - Twin Cities and University of
Tennessee. Fifty-five universities, colleges and high schools in the
U.S. and abroad applied for the funding.

   "Robots are a compelling way to stimulate students and spark their
imaginations to consider the endless possibilities of careers in
Computer Science," said Dr. Stewart Tansley, senior program manager at
Microsoft Research. "With these awards, our continued partnership with
Georgia Tech and Bryn Mawr College, and new technologies such as the
Microsoft Robotics Developer Studio, we hope to accelerate the broad
development of robotics programs, making computer science more
immediate, relevant and significant for students and professors
everywhere."

   IPRE was created in 2006 to reinvigorate Computer Science through
robotics. Today's awards were made possible through a gift from
Microsoft Research.

   To date, results from IPRE's work have proven the draw of personal
robots as a way to attract students to degrees and careers in
computing. In fall 2007, more than 400 students at Georgia Tech chose
to enroll in the robotics-based courses, which showed a higher pass
rate than the traditional programming course. In surveys, students in
the robotics-based courses reported that they were more excited about
computers than before, liked working with the robots and had spent
extra time on at least one homework assignment because they "thought
it was cool."

   At Bryn Mawr, a liberal arts college for women, the enrollment of
upper level Computer Science classes has more than quadrupled since
introducing the robot in the first course, a sign that students are
staying in the field beyond the introduction.

   "We have found that students are really enjoying and learning
using the personal robot in the classroom. It's interactive, engaging
and fun. Our numbers of majors and students in Computer Science is at
a record high. This is especially encouraging since women have
traditionally been underrepresented in the field. We hope that these
awards can help other institutions make a difference in exploring
robots in education," said Prof. Doug Blank, co-director of IPRE and
chair of the Computer Science Department at Bryn Mawr College.

   Winners of the grant may adopt the curricula, software and text
developed by IPRE, which is now used in about half the introductory
Computer Science classes at Georgia Tech, or they can adapt their own.
Any school can buy the enhanced Scribblers used at Georgia Tech and
Bryn Mawr College--an upgraded version of an off-the-shelf product--
which cost about the same as a typical introductory computer science
textbook, are made of blue molded plastic equipped with three wheels,
two motors, light sensors and a speaker. They contain a circuit board
that allows for more complex programming, a camera and wireless
connectivity so students can program and control the robots from their
computers. Scribblers are packaged with the software and the class
text.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Disneyland Resort in California will close three "quick service" restaurants that serve McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) fast food as part of a "planned refurbishment," a Disneyland spokeswoman said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three walk-up kiosks will close on September 2 and will reopen at an undisclosed date "with other theming and branding," Disneyland spokeswoman Lisa Haines said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are considering a number of different concept options," Haines said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), which ended a long-time movie promotions partnership with McDonald's after the 2006 release of "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," will continue to operate three McDonald's-branded eateries at its Walt Disney World resort in Florida, Haines said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Disney has launched a healthy snack foods line for children and has broadened the meal menus at its parks to include healthy choices such as sliced fruits instead of french fries or potato chips, and waters in place of sodas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While McDonald's and other fast food chains have taken steps to make their food healthier, the Center for Science and the Public Interest reported this week that 90 percent of their kids' meals have too many calories and too much fat and salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gina Keating; Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annual Banking Survey Reveals Goldman #1 Again, Deutsche Bank
Cracking the Top 10 for the First Time and Citi Dropping Four Spots to
                                  #11
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Career information media company Vault.com, Inc. (www.vault.com)
has just released the latest edition of the Vault Guide to the Top 50
Banking Employers, and for the ninth straight year Goldman Sachs has
been ranked #1.

   As part of Vault's annual Banking Survey, from January through
March of this year, over 1,100 banking professionals were asked to
rate banking firms on a scale of 1 to 10 based on prestige (they were
unable to rate their own firms, and asked to only rate firms with
which they were familiar). According to survey respondents, Goldman
Sachs, the #1 firm nine years running, is still the "best of the
best," "they do everything well" and the bank is likely the "greatest
of our time."

   The top 10 firms as ranked in the Vault Guide to the Top 50
Banking Employers are:

-0-

1.  Goldman Sachs                                         New York, NY
2.  The Blackstone Group                                  New York, NY
3.  Morgan Stanley                                        New York, NY
4.  Lehman Brothers                                       New York, NY
5.  J. P. Morgan Investment Bank.                         New York, NY
6.  Merrill Lynch                                         New York, NY

10. UBS Investment Bank                                   New York, NY
*T

   This year's rankings featured some notable movement in the top 10,
with Deutsche Bank making it onto the coveted list for the first time,
moving up three spots to #9 from #12. Moving in the opposite direction
is Citi Institutional Clients Group (Citi's investment banking unit),
which dropped out of the top 10, falling four spots from #7 to #11. In
addition, just a month before its demise, Bear Stearns ranked #16 in
prestige, showing that no one predicted what would happen to the 5th
biggest securities firm on Wall Street (this was, though, a drop from
a year before, when Bear ranked #13).

   "The big news at the top of the rankings this year was Deutsche
Bank cracking the top 10 for the first time and Citi Institutional
Clients Group falling out of it," said Derek Loosvelt, Vault finance
editor. "Survey respondents told us that Frankfurt-based Deutsche has
'made good strides in the US,' are 'up and coming globally' and has
'great deal flow.' Meanwhile, respondents said 'poor management
destroyed' Citi, whose 'massive layoffs spell problems.'"

   The Banking Survey also revealed some current industry-wide
trends. At many banks, diversity is on the rise, as employers are
finding "that diversity of opinion and background leads to a better
end product for clients." In addition, collaboration is key at many
firms, as insiders say their firms are "teamwork-focused" and
"collegial, with an emphasis on working with other teams." Of course,
many survey respondents also noted that some top banks "have not done
well in the market downturn" and "have had troubles lately." Some are
even in serious "turmoil" and have become "sinking ships."

   In addition to the top prestige rankings, the Vault Guide to the
Top 50 Banking Employers features quality of life rankings for firms,
in categories such as compensation, training, hours, offices and
diversity, straight from employees that work there. The guide also
contains profiles that give readers an insider's perspective of each
firm, revealing information on practice areas, revenue, uppers and
downers of working for the firm, employment contacts and "The
Buzz,"--overall perceptions of each firm. The Vault Guide to the Top
50 Banking Employers is available at bookstores nationwide or by
ordering through Vault.com.

&lt;p&gt;LAGOS Aug 7 (Reuters) - A Nigerian court has ordered the
local unit of U.S. energy group Chevron Corp (CVX.N) to suspend
the sale of its 60 percent equity in its fuel retailing arm,
court papers obtained on Thursday showed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The oil major had called for bids in Chevron Oil Nigeria
CHEV.LG, formerly Texaco Plc, but the planned sale was
challenged by local firm Zenon Petroleum and Gas Ltd, which
holds a 19 percent stake in the gasoline marketer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zenon argues in a suit filed last week at a Federal High
Court in Lagos that Chevron did not obtain approval from the
Securities and Exchange Commission and minority shareholders
before it received bids from at least four suitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bidders include fuel marketers Oando UNIP.LG, Habit
Oil, Acorn Oil and African Petroleum APET.LG, in which Zenon
holds a majority stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "An order of interim injunction is granted restraining the
respondents ... from bidding, selling, alienating, transferring,
disposing and or parting with the possession of the shares," the
court papers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Judge Lambo Akanbi adjourned the case to Sept. 30, when
Chevron is expected to respond to claims by Zenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zenon said it is worried its interests would be adversely
affected if Chevron sells the downstream unit to an "incompetent
bidder," especially after the unit reported a loss in the first
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Not only would the financial interests of the petitioner as
well as the other shareholders ... continue to dwindle, but it
would ultimately have a negative impact on the Nigerian
economy," Zenon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zenon is a big importer of refined products in Nigeria, an
OPEC member which is still largely dependent on fuel imports
because of its shoddy refineries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's planned divestment from the downstream sector of
Africa's top oil producer has been controversial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nigeria's main oil unions, which had initially indicated
interest in acquiring Chevron's equity, have also expressed
concern over the bidding process being handled by BNP Paribas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Babatunde Ogun, national president of senior oil workers'
union PENGASSAN, said the union was not confident that the
evaluation process of potential buyers would select the best
suitors for the company.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Aug 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that Princess Cruises, a subsidiary of
Carnival Corporation (NYSE: CCL) (NYSE: CUK) and one of the world's
premier cruise lines, will deploy IBM InfoSphere Warehouse software to
analyze and improve the effectiveness of the company's marketing and
promotional initiatives.

    Complementing its consumer marketing campaign, Princess Cruises will use
InfoSphere Warehouse to analyze data to determine which marketing tactics
were the most and least successful in drawing passengers to its 17 ships.

    "We chose InfoSphere Warehouse because it was compatible with our existing
infrastructure, and we believe its proven high performance will provide
some added tools to help us evaluate our marketing and management
tactics," said Lou Fournier, Vice President, information systems
technology for Princess Cruises. "InfoSphere also addresses IT
requirements to ensure the most critical applications. For instance,
processing that once took 10 hours, will now take only 10 minutes. In
addition, the software's DB2 deep compression capability can drastically
reduce the amount of physical storage capacity by 70%."

    "Our relationship with Princess Cruises demonstrates IBM's commitment to
help companies achieve high performance through data management
innovations," said Inhi Cho, Vice President, IBM Data Management
Marketing. "There's a shift underway in the database software market as
our partners and clients increasingly choose IBM. IBM InfoSphere
Warehouse helps clients unlock the value of key business data, which is
what IBM's Information on Demand strategy is all about."

    InfoSphere Warehouse software is based on IBM DB2 "Viper" data server
software, which provides features and capabilities that support growing
customer demand for analytics and Information on Demand.

&lt;p&gt;  BUDAPEST, HUNGARY, Aug 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Hungarian Electricity Transmission System Operator Inc. (MAVIR ZRt)
has selected IBM (NYSE: IBM) to provide the information technology (IT)
infrastructure to upgrade its operations and improve its asset management
system. The agreement, worth more than Hungarian Forint (HUF) 1.7 billion
(approximately USD$10 million), aims to support the safe and
uninterrupted operation of the electricity transmission network -- in
line with the latest international practices.

    Electricity in Hungary is supplied through a common wire system by several
vendors. MAVIR secures the power supply for 5 million households and
300,000 businesses. MAVIR's electricity transmission assets such as
transmission line networks and transformers are worth more than HUF 200
billion.

    The IBM solution will register network assets, store data related to their
maintenance, schedule and assign maintenance work efficiently based on
resources, coordinate groups working in the field, and track costs while
optimizing expenses. The work and asset management system will be based on
IBM's asset management software, Tivoli Maximo, and IBM will provide
technology and consultancy services including implementation, system
integration and application of industry best practices.

    The establishment of the new work and asset management system will be done
at the same time as the renewal of the Hungarian power transmission
network to be completed by 2010. This renewal will further extend
operation safety while reduce cost of operations and maintenance.

    Gabor Tari, CEO of MAVIR, said, "We are not simply taking an IBM product
off the shelf. We are contracted for cooperation, in which both parties
are committed to rendering their best knowledge. At the same time, this
relationship provides opportunity for both leading MAVIR and IBM experts
to exchange ideas and share experience about information technology and
energy and develop innovative solutions together."

    Peter Paal, CEO of IBM Hungary, said, "The project is backed by IBM's
global knowledge. Our unique approach is taking and localizing proven
solutions which use a combination of software, technology, and business
consulting. The solution we will deliver to MAVIR requires an
understanding not only of technology, but also of the business processes
inherent in energy business. MAVIR will leverage IBM's world-class
expertise within the energy and utilities sector, and we will help
satisfy their needs for high quality, secure, and efficient service."

    The agreement was signed in July 2008.

&lt;p&gt;Portland General Electric Reports Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Results; Increases Earnings Guidance

   Second Quarter Financial and Operating Highlights

   --  PGE is increasing its full-year 2008 earnings guidance to
        $1.85 - $1.95 from $1.75 - $1.85 per diluted share.

   --  Achieved net income of $39 million, or $0.63 per diluted
        share, for the second quarter of 2008 compared to $46 million,
        or $0.73 per diluted share, in 2007.

   --  Received regulatory approval of the smart-metering project and
        are currently implementing systems testing.

   --  Construction of Biglow Canyon Phase II has begun, with
        completion expected by the end of 2009.
PORTLAND, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
Portland General Electric Company (NYSE:POR) today reported net
income of $39 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, for the three
months ended June 30, 2008, compared to $46 million, or $0.73 per
diluted share, for 2007. Results were driven by an increase in retail
energy deliveries and the Company's return on its investment in Phase
I of the Biglow Canyon wind project. These positive results were
offset primarily by a decrease in the fair market value of
non-qualified benefit plan trust assets and higher operating expenses.

   Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2008, was $67
million, or $1.07 per diluted share, compared to $101 million, or
$1.61 per diluted share for 2007.

   "Our system continues to operate well, and we're in the process of
executing plans to add additional resources for our growing customer
base," said Peggy Fowler, CEO and president of Portland General
Electric (PGE). "We're moving forward with significant capital
projects including Phase II of the Biglow Canyon Wind Farm and our new
smart-metering technology."

   2008 Earnings Guidance

   PGE is increasing its full-year 2008 earnings guidance to $1.85 -
$1.95 per diluted share. This is an increase from $1.75 - $1.85 per
diluted share and is based on continued solid operations and gains on
the sale of fuel oil inventory at the Beaver thermal plant. PGE is
also reaffirming its long-term annual earnings growth expectation of 6
to 8 percent beginning with 2008.

   2009 General Rate Case

   Regulatory review of the Company's general rate case and proposed
tariffs, filed with the Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) in
late February 2008, is continuing under a procedural schedule that
currently provides for new rates to become effective on January 1,
2009. PGE's initial filing proposed an 8.9 percent average price
increase related to higher purchased power and fuel costs, increased
investment in utility plant and higher operating expenses.

   Beginning on June 5, 2008, PGE, OPUC staff and interveners have
held a series of settlement conferences. As a result, parties have
reached settlement agreements on two major items: One is for cost of
capital and the other for net variable power cost (NVPC). The cost of
capital stipulation provides for a return on common equity of 10.1
percent on a capital structure of 50 percent equity and 50 percent
debt and a weighted average cost of capital of 8.33 percent. This
stipulation results in a reduction to the proposed revenue requirement
of approximately $13 million.

   The NVPC agreement stipulates to a number of modeling assumptions
and other adjustments which result in an approximate $5 million
reduction to the forecast of 2009 NVPC. On July 11, 2008, as part of
PGE's annual power cost update process, the Company submitted an
updated forecast of 2009 NVPC. This filing, together with the
stipulation, resulted in a revenue requirement increase for 2009 NVPC
of $151 million. The two settlement agreements and the July NVPC
update result in a proposed total average price increase of
approximately 14 percent. The proposed increase remains subject to
change as the ratemaking process before the OPUC continues on
non-settled issues. Also, NVPC will be updated later this year
according to a procedural schedule established by the OPUC.

   Next steps in the procedural schedule include PGE's August 15,
2008, rebuttal testimony, followed by additional rounds of testimony,
with an order from the OPUC expected by year end.

   The following table indicates the revenue requirement increase as
originally filed on February 27, 2008, and PGE's updated revenue
requirement increase based on the settlement agreements and the July
11, 2008, NVPC update:

        Initial Filing     Update(1)

 and stipulations to date.

   Biglow Canyon Wind Farm

   In March 2008, PGE executed agreements to purchase 141 wind
turbines for Phases II and III of Biglow Canyon, and in July 2008, the
Company entered into contracts on the related construction.
Construction of Phase II has begun, with completion expected by the
end of 2009. Phase III is expected to be completed in 2010. Total cost
of the two phases is expected to be $740 million - $780 million,
including allowance for funds used during construction. The two phases
will have a combined installed capacity of approximately 324 MW,
further increasing the diversity of the Company's generating resource
portfolio.

   Smart Meters

   On May 5, 2008, the OPUC approved the Company's smart-metering
project, which will be deployed for residential and commercial
customers. A new tariff, effective from June 1, 2008, through December
31, 2010, will provide for recovery of the costs, including the net
book value of existing meters, during this period. Approximately
16,000 new meters are being installed as part of the project's
six-month systems testing phase, with the remaining meters to be
installed by the end of 2010. PGE expects the smart-metering project
to provide improved services as well as operational efficiencies and
cost savings.

   Capital Expenditures

   Capital expenditures in 2008 are estimated to be $415 million.
This includes $229 million for ongoing production, transmission and
distribution facilities; $98 million for Phases II and III of the
Biglow Canyon Wind Farm; $62 million for hydro relicensing projects;
$23 million for smart meters; and $3 million for Boardman emissions
controls.

   Second Quarter 2008 Results Compared to Second Quarter 2007

   --  Total retail customers served increased 1.4 percent to
        approximately 813,000 as of June 30, 2008, compared to
        approximately 802,000 as of June 30, 2007.

   --  Total revenues increased by $23 million due primarily to the
        net effect of the following key factors:

-0-
*T
         -- A 2.6 percent increase in total retail energy deliveries,
             primarily due to cooler weather and an increase in the
             average number of customers served.

         -- A 2.8 percent price increase for cost recovery of the Port
             Westward Power Plant, effective in June 2007.

         -- A 0.6 percent price increase for cost recovery of Biglow
             Canyon Phase I, effective January 1, 2008.

         -- A 0.3 percent price decrease, effective January 1, 2008,
             for changes in forecasted 2008 power and fuel costs.

         -- A $3 million decrease related to Senate Bill 408.

         -- A $10 million increase in other operating revenues due
             primarily to the sale of fuel oil at the Beaver thermal
             plant. Pursuant to an assessment of reliability
             requirements for operation on oil at Beaver, PGE is
             reducing oil inventory levels, which has resulted in a
             net pre-tax gain of $7 million.
*T

   --  Purchased power and fuel expense increased by $10 million due
        primarily to the net effect of the following key factors:

-0-
*T

         -- A $29 million increase in the cost of natural gas-fired
             production, primarily due to increased generation from
             Port Westward, which went into service in June 2007, and
             higher natural gas prices.

         -- A $4 million increase in the estimated amount recorded for
             potential future refund to customers under the power cost
             adjustment mechanism (PCAM). In the second quarter of
             2008, PGE recorded a $7 million regulatory liability,
             with a corresponding increase in power costs, compared to
             a $3 million regulatory liability recorded in the second
             quarter of 2007.

         -- A $23 million decrease in the cost of purchased power,
             resulting primarily from a 19 percent reduction in
             electricity purchases, related primarily to an increase
             in natural gas, hydro and wind generation.
*T

   --  Production and distribution expense increased by $5 million
        due primarily to a $3 million increase in operating costs at
        the Company's generating facilities, including Port Westward
        and Biglow Canyon Phase I. The remaining increase is related
        to repair and maintenance work completed at Boardman during
        the plant's scheduled outage.

   --  Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $7 million
        primarily due to increased depreciation from the 2007
        completion of Port Westward and Biglow Canyon Phase I.

   --  Other income decreased by $5 million primarily due to a
        decrease in income from non-qualified benefit plan trust
        assets.

   --  Interest expense increased by $5 million primarily due to a
        higher level of outstanding long-term debt and lower AFDC debt
        resulting from lower CWIP balances.

   --  Income taxes decreased by $6 million, with an effective tax
        rate of 30 percent. This decrease was primarily the result of
        lower taxable income and an increase of $3 million in federal
        energy tax credits generated from the operation of Biglow
        Canyon Phase I in the second quarter of 2008.

   Year-to-Date 2008

   Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2008, was $67
million, or $1.07 per diluted share, compared to $101 million, or
$1.61 per diluted share, for 2007. The decrease is primarily due to
the deferral in 2007 of a portion of Boardman replacement power costs
(including accrued interest) for potential future collection from
customers; decreased fair market values on non-qualified benefit plan
assets; a reduction in potential customer collections related to prior
year income taxes (pursuant to Senate Bill 408); higher operating
expenses; and the favorable impact of a 2007 settlement between PGE
and certain California parties related to wholesale energy
transactions in the Western energy markets during 2000-2001. Such
results were partially offset by an increase in retail energy
deliveries and the Company's return on its investment in Biglow Canyon
Phase I.

   Year-to-Date 2008 Results Compared to Year-to-Date 2007

   --  Total revenues increased by $58 million due to the net effect
        of the following key factors:

-0-
*T
         -- A 3.4 percent increase in total retail energy deliveries
             (1.3 percent weather-adjusted), due to both cooler
             weather and an increase in the average number of
             customers served.

         -- Price increases for cost recovery of Port Westward and
             Biglow Canyon Phase I.

         -- A 0.3 percent price decrease, effective January 1, 2008,
             for changes in forecasted 2008 power and fuel costs.

         -- A $6 million decrease related to Senate Bill 408.

         -- An $11 million increase in wholesale revenues due to a 48
             percent increase in the average power price, partially
             offset by a 23 percent reduction in wholesale energy
             sales. The price increase was driven by both higher
             natural gas prices and lower hydro availability.

         -- A $10 million increase in other operating revenues due
             primarily to the sale of fuel oil inventory.
*T

   --  Purchased power and fuel expense increased by $57 million due
        primarily to the net effect of the following key factors:

-0-
*T
         -- An $88 million increase in the cost of thermal (primarily
             natural gas-fired) production, due to increases in both
             generation and natural gas prices.

         -- A $20 million increase related to the deferral of excess
             Boardman power costs incurred from late 2005 to early
             2006 in the first quarter of 2007.

         -- A $12 million increase related to settled natural gas swap
             agreements entered into in conjunction with PGE's
             management of its net power costs.

         -- A $6 million increase due to a reduction in the Company's
             wholesale credit reserve in the first half of 2007, as a
             result of a settlement with certain California parties
             involving transactions in 2000-2001.

         -- A $4 million increase in the estimated amount recorded for
             potential future refund to customers under the PCAM.

         -- A $76 million decrease due to a 25 percent reduction in
             power purchases, related primarily to an increase in
             thermal and wind generation.
*T

   --  Production and distribution expense increased by $12 million
        due primarily to the following:

-0-
*T
         -- A $6 million increase in operating costs at Port Westward
             and Biglow Canyon Phase I.

         -- A $3 million increase related to repair and maintenance
             activities completed at Boardman and Beaver during the
             plants' scheduled outages in 2008.

         -- A $2 million increase in distribution labor, contractor
             and tree trimming costs.
*T

   --  Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $12
        million primarily due to increased depreciation of $10 million
        as a result of Port Westward and Biglow Canyon Phase I.

   --  Other income decreased by $15 million primarily due to the
        following:

-0-
*T
         -- A $10 million decrease in income from non-qualified
             benefit plan trust assets resulting from the recognition
             of a $5 million unrealized loss on the plan assets during
             the six months ended June 30, 2008, compared to a $5
             million unrealized gain in the comparable period of 2007.

         -- A $5 million decrease in AFDC equity, which resulted from
             lower CWIP balances during the second quarter of 2008 due
             to the completion of both Port Westward and Biglow Canyon
             Phase I.
*T

   --  Interest expense increased by $11 million primarily due to a
        higher level of outstanding long-term debt and lower AFDC debt
        resulting from lower CWIP balances.

   --  Income taxes decreased by $22 million, with an effective tax
        rate of 29 percent. These decreases are primarily the result
        of lower taxable income and an increase of $5 million in
        federal energy tax credits generated from the operation of
        Biglow Canyon Phase I in the first half of 2008.

&lt;p&gt;Lipitor 80 mg Reduced the Risk of Heart Attack and Stroke in Patients with Heart Disease, Type 2 Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc announced today that, in patients with heart disease, type 2 diabetes
and chronic kidney disease, Lipitor(R) (atorvastatin calcium) 80 mg
significantly reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events, including heart
attack and stroke, by 35 percent compared with Lipitor 10 mg. This finding is
from a subanalysis designed and completed following the closure of the five-year
Treating to New Targets (TNT) study in patients with existing coronary heart
disease. The results were published in the August issue of Mayo Clinic
Proceedings.

"As the rates of diabetes in the U.S. have risen, we have seen a dramatic
increase in the number of cases of chronic kidney disease," said Dr. James
Shepherd, clinical academic consultant, department of pathological biochemistry,
University of Glasgow Medical School and a member of the TNT steering committee.
"This trend is alarming, since patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease
are much more likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke than patients with
diabetes alone, increasing the urgency to treat. The study's findings support
existing guidelines that recommend aggressively lowering LDL cholesterol using
statin therapy, such as Lipitor 80 mg, to reduce the likelihood of a heart
attack or stroke in these high-risk patients."

In patients with heart disease and type 2 diabetes but without chronic kidney
disease, Lipitor 80 mg reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by 10
percent compared to Lipitor 10 mg, which did not reach significance.

Both doses of Lipitor (80 mg and 10 mg) were generally well tolerated.

About the TNT Study

The TNT study was an investigator-led trial coordinated by an independent
steering committee and funded by Pfizer. The study enrolled 10,001 men and women
with coronary heart disease aged 35 years to 75 years in 14 countries and
followed them for an average of five years.

The primary endpoint of the TNT study was the occurrence of a first major
cardiovascular event, defined as death from heart disease, non-fatal heart
attacks, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or fatal or non-fatal strokes.

This post-hoc subanalysis studied the effect of Lipitor 80 mg on the incidence
of major cardiovascular events compared with Lipitor 10 mg in patients with
heart disease and type 2 diabetes, with chronic kidney disease (n=546) and
without chronic kidney disease (n=885). Patients with chronic kidney disease
were defined as having a baseline glomerular filtration rate below 60
mL/min/1.73 m2 using a standard measure of kidney function. Lipitor 80 mg is not
a starting dose.

About Type 2 Diabetes

Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, according to the American
Diabetes Association, and is reaching epidemic proportions across the world.
Europe alone counts more than 25 million people with type 2 diabetes. In the
U.S., nearly 24 million people have type 2 diabetes, equating to almost eight
percent of the population.

According to the Centers for Disease Control, heart disease and stroke account
for about 65 percent of deaths in people with type 2 diabetes in the U.S. Adults
with type 2 diabetes have heart disease death rates that are approximately two
to four times higher than that of adults without diabetes.

About Type 2 Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease

Diabetes is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease in the U.S. and accounts
for about 38 percent of Americans being treated for kidney failure. Patients
with chronic kidney disease do not effectively filter toxins from the blood.
When chronic kidney disease progresses to kidney failure, either dialysis or a
kidney transplant is needed.

According to the National Kidney Foundation guidelines, the outlook for those
with both diabetes and chronic kidney disease is far worse than for patients
with either condition alone, as the combination is a powerful predictor of major
cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke.

About Lipitor

Only Lipitor offers these three benefits important in a statin: FDA approval to
reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes and certain types of heart surgery in
patients with cardiovascular risk or with heart disease; the ability to reduce
"bad" cholesterol (LDL) by 39 percent to 60 percent; and a well-established
safety profile across a broad range of patients.

It is the most prescribed branded cholesterol-lowering therapy in the world,
with more than 151 million patient-years of experience. Lipitor is supported by
a 16-year clinical trial program involving more than 400 ongoing and completed
trials with more than 80,000 patients.

Important U.S. Prescribing Information

Lipitor is a prescription medication. It is used in patients with multiple risk
factors for heart disease such as family history, high blood pressure, age, low
HDL ("good" cholesterol) or smoking to reduce the risk of a heart attack,
stroke, certain types of heart surgery and chest pain.

Lipitor is also used in patients with type 2 diabetes and at least one other
risk factor for heart disease such as high blood pressure, smoking or
complications of diabetes, including eye disease and protein in urine, to reduce
the risk of heart attack and stroke.

Lipitor is used in patients with existing coronary heart disease to reduce the
risk of heart attack, stroke, certain kinds of heart surgery, hospitalization
for heart failure, and chest pain.

When diet and exercise alone are not enough, Lipitor is used along with a
low-fat diet and exercise to lower cholesterol.

Lipitor is not for everyone. It is not for those with liver problems. And it is
not for women who are nursing, pregnant or may become pregnant.

Patients taking Lipitor should tell their doctors if they feel any new muscle
pain or weakness. This could be a sign of rare but serious muscle side effects.
Patients should tell their doctors about all medications they take. This may
help avoid serious drug interactions. Doctors should do blood tests to check
liver function before and during treatment and may adjust the dose. The most
common side effects are gas, constipation, stomach pain and heartburn. They tend
to be mild and often go away.

&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's state oil company Petrobras (PETR4.SA) (PBR.N) said on Friday it signed a deal to buy Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) stake in Esso Chile Petrolera distribution assets for $400 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petrobras will take a controlling stake in the company in the second quarter of 2009, the Brazilian company said in a statement to local securities regulator CVM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The deal is part of Petrobras's strategy of consolidating its presence in South America," Jorge Luiz Zelada, Petrobras's international director, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He denied Petrobras was also negotiating to buy Exxon's operations in Uruguay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zelada said the Chile deal would raise to 8,000 the number of gasoline stations that Petrobras operates in South America, where it already has distribution operations in Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia and Paraguay as well as Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal covers 230 gasoline stations in Chile, the distribution and sale of fuel at 11 airports, and six distribution terminals -- four of them wholly owned and two that are joint ventures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The operations had sales volumes of 134 million cubic meters per month in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chile move is in line with Exxon's shift away from its distribution businesses as sky-high crude oil prices have squeezed profit margins on the sale of refined products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past two years, Exxon has sold distribution businesses in Brazil and Venezuela, and announced that it is getting out of the retail gasoline business in the United States. Exxon could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petrobras earlier this year said it was in talks with Exxon to buy its Brazil distribution assets, which were later bought buy Brazilian ethanol producer Cosan (CSAN3.SA) for $826 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Reese Ewing and Stuart Grudgings, additional reporting by Michael Erman in New York, editing by Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Kevin Matras explains why growth stocks seem to do well in both up
and down markets. Stocks in this week's article are Walter Industries
(NYSE: WLT), Aeropostale, Inc. (NYSE: ARO) and Oriental Financial
Group, Inc. (NYSE: OFG). Click here for the full story exclusively on
Zacks.com: http://at.zacks.com/?id=109

   Screen of the Week written by Kevin Matras of Zacks Investment
Research:

   When it comes right down to it, a company's fortunes will rise and
fall on its ability to grow business and earn profits.

   In down markets, there seems to be fewer stocks with strong growth
rates. And even fewer still with prices responding to these growth
rates.

   The reason why I think these kinds of stocks do so well in down
markets is that there are fewer of them. There are fewer stocks
competing for investors' attention. As more investors search out the
best performing companies, you've got more money going into fewer top
stocks. I believe that pushes the price up even more.

   So does one just look for the companies with the largest growth
rates? You'd think that would make sense. But it doesn't.

   Stocks with growth rates that are too low just aren't growth
stocks at all and don't perform that well. But stocks with crazy high
growth rates don't test that well either.

   One of the easiest ways to find the right balance is to search for
companies that are projecting growth rates greater than the average
for its industry.

   Every industry's average growth rate is different, so trying to
find the top companies in those industries - the best of breed if you
will in terms of growth projections - is a sure way to avoid companies
with growth rates that are too low.

   What's interesting though, is that in my testing I've found that
very high growth rates perform almost as bad as poor growth rates.

   And all growth rates are not equal. A growth rate of 20% in an
industry with an average growth rate of 40%, for example, isn't that
great. But a growth rate of 20% in an industry with an average growth
rate of 10% is excellent. Moreover, if a stock is growing at 100% in a
20% industry, is this 100% growth rate really sustainable? The answer
is probably not.

   And that's why comparing the growth rates to their industries and
sticking with the stocks above their industry's average (or their
peers) works so well.

   As for how to make sure their growth rates aren't 'too high'; I
like to look at their valuations.

   Two ratios I look at are Price to Sales and the PEG ratio. The PEG
ratio is particularly interesting when used with growth stocks because
it takes into account the growth rate. Basically, it shows you how
much you're paying for each unit of growth.

   The PEG ratio is simply the P/E ratio divided by the Future Growth
Rate. A lower PEG ratio is considered better than a higher PEG ratio.
For example: if the P/E or multiple is lower than the growth rate,
that's considered a good value. The higher the P/E ratio is vs. the
Growth Rate, the higher the PEG ratio will be and the more
'overvalued' it might be considered.

   So by concentrating on lower valuations, you're able to keep these
big growth rate stocks in check, meaning they haven't been too bid up
already. And you're getting in on the ones with the most potential to
go higher.

   So you have a strong growth component and good valuations.

   It's true that some valuation plays get overlooked sometimes. But
I believe that's because there may not be a compelling enough growth
story behind it. But by demanding good growth, you avoid the problem.

   I've also found that by making sure the stocks have been robust
price movers over the last 12 weeks shows they're in demand and
investors are pouring in their money.

   Of course, making sure these companies also have a Zacks #1 Rank
is a sure way to get people's attention.

   As you know, the Zacks Rank is one of the best rating systems out
there, showing an average annual return of over 30% per year over the
last 20 years.

   And statistics have proven that companies receiving upward
earnings estimate revisions outperform the market. And of course,
that's one of the things that the Zacks Rank looks for.

   I put a lot of the above ideas together into several screens and
tested them. And the results were pretty impressive.

   I tested this strategy from the beginning of 2000 through the
first quarter of 2008 using a 4-week rebalancing period and running it
over multiple start dates to verify its robustness.

   The average Compounded Annual Growth Rate was 57.2% per year.
That's over a 4,000% total compounded return over a little more than
an 8-year period.

   Even during the bearish years of 2000, 2001 and 2002, while the
S 500 was down more than -37%, the strategy significantly
outperformed the market.

   What's really impressive is that it continues to find some of the
top performers over many different industries regardless of what the
market is doing.

   In fact, when I first started creating this strategy, I set out to
find stocks that would do great in both up and down markets. And I
knew that one of the keys was going to be the projected growth rate.

   Of course the Zacks Rank, the different valuations, the price
responsiveness and etc., are all very important too. And together,
they form a very powerful combination.

   In fact, this strategy is so impressive, it became the stock
picking model for our new Growth Trader service.

   Some recent winners include Walter Industries (WLT), Aeropostale,
Inc. (ARO) and Oriental Financial Group, Inc. (OFG).

&lt;p&gt;CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated (NASDAQ: COKE) today announced
it earned $15.2 million, or basic net income per share of $1.66, in
the second quarter of 2008 compared to net income of $11.7 million, or
basic net income per share of $1.28, in the second quarter of 2007.
For the first six months of 2008, the Company earned $10.8 million, or
basic net income per share of $1.18, compared to net income of $16.3
million, or basic net income per share of $1.79, for the first six
months of 2007. The first half 2007 results include after-tax costs of
$1.5 million, or basic net income per share of $.16, related to a
simplification of the Company's operating management structure and
reduction in workforce.

   J. Frank Harrison, III, Chairman and CEO, said, "We are pleased
with these second quarter financial results, especially considering
the difficult cost and economic environment. While commodity costs
continue to be extremely challenging, we have been able to offset some
of these increased costs with a combination of operating expense
reductions and price increases. We are intensely focused on
maintaining gross margin and streamlining operations in order to
improve our operating results. I commend our employees for their
steadfast commitment during these tough economic times."

   William B. Elmore, President and COO, added, "We have implemented
a plan of continuous improvement and are challenging our entire
organization and leaders to find new and better ways to execute our
business plan. In the face of continued extraordinary raw material
cost increases, we are working diligently to redesign our
brand/package/channel pricing architecture as this is the key driver
of both revenue and gross margin. The second half of 2008 will
continue to be a very challenging operating environment with the
sluggish economy and increased commodity costs although we do expect
substantial savings from our recently announced restructuring plan as
we enter the second half of 2008."

   The Company anticipates the restructuring plan to be completed by
the end of the third quarter and estimates incurring a related expense
of approximately $4 million to $5 million. In addition, the Company
has reached a tentative agreement with striking employees in Mobile,
Alabama, represented by the Teamsters, and these employees have
returned to work. The agreement allows the Company to fix its
liability to the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension
Fund, a multi-employer pension fund, while preserving pension benefits
previously earned by the employees. As a result, the Company
anticipates recording a charge of approximately $13 million to $15
million in the third quarter of 2008. In addition, the Company will
make future contributions on behalf of these employees to the Southern
States Savings and Retirement Plan, a multi-employer defined
contribution plan.

   J. Frank Harrison, III summarized, "We continue to be faithful to
the mission and values of our Company, which have provided a strong
foundation for many years. Difficult times, such as the current
operating environment, make us work smarter and more efficiently and I
believe we continue to position ourselves for long-term success."

   Cautionary Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

   Included in this news release and other information that we make
publicly available from time to time are forward-looking management
comments and other statements that reflect management's current
outlook for future periods. These statements include, among others,
statements regarding our expectation regarding the operating
environment, economy and increased commodity costs in the second half
of 2008, expectation of substantial savings in the second half of 2008
from our recently announced restructuring plan, anticipation of the
restructuring plan to be completed by the end of the third quarter and
incurring a related expense of approximately $4 million to $5 million,
anticipation of recording a charge in the range of $13 million to $15
million in the third quarter of 2008 as a result of fixing our
liability with the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas
Pension Fund, and beliefs regarding our work to position ourselves for
long-term success.

   These statements and expectations are based on currently available
competitive, financial and economic data along with our operating
plans, and are subject to future events and uncertainties that could
cause anticipated events not to occur or actual results to differ
materially from historical or anticipated results. Among the events or

our products; changes in public and consumer preferences related to
nonalcoholic beverages; unfavorable changes in the general economy;

higher selling prices, increased bottle/can sales volume or reduced
expenses; sustained increases in fuel costs or our inability to secure
adequate supplies of fuel; sustained increases in workers'
compensation, employment practices and vehicle accident costs;
sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits; product
liability claims or product recalls; technology failures; changes in

and packaging; additional taxes resulting from tax audits; natural
disasters and unfavorable weather; issues surrounding labor relations;
recent bottler litigation; our use of estimates and assumptions;
public policy challenges regarding the sale of soft drinks in schools;
and the concentration of our capital stock ownership. The
forward-looking statements in this news release should be read in
conjunction with the more detailed descriptions of the above factors
located in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
30, 2007 under Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors." The Company undertakes
no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements
contained in this release as a result of new information or future
events or developments.

&lt;p&gt;Newly Released InstallAware 8 Automatically Creates and Builds
 Setup Projects for Solutions inside the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE,
  Adds Support for De-Elevating Applications on Windows Vista, Offers
 Dual-Mode Web Updates, and Allows Granular Installation of Microsoft
                     .NET Framework 3.5 Components
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
InstallAware Software Corporation has released InstallAware 8, a
setup authoring tool for ISVs and enterprises deploying products,
patches, and web updates. InstallAware 8 creates Windows Installer
setup packages with support for the latest technologies, including
Windows Installer 4.5, Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5, Microsoft SQL
Server Express 2005 Service Pack 2, Windows Server 2008, and 64 bit
operating systems.

   InstallAware 8 is the first InstallAware version to feature Visual
Studio integration. Users of Visual Studio versions 2003, 2005, and
2008 may now access InstallAware functionality within their native
environment; automatically creating and building setup projects
without ever leaving the Visual Studio IDE. Setup projects created by
InstallAware 8's new Visual Studio Add-In may of course be further
edited inside the main InstallAware IDE, while continuing to be
seamlessly refreshed by the Add-In as projects are inserted to or
removed from the Visual Studio solution.

   The InstallAware IDE itself has been fortified with major
enhancements. "We've exposed even more of InstallAware's core
functionality, already available in the MSIcode script, on our IDE's
visual design surfaces," says Agustin K-ballo Berge, Vice President of
Research and Development at InstallAware. "Of course, the underlying
MSIcode script which the visual designers emit remains fully
accessible - making InstallAware a true visual setup development
tool." For instance, the IDE's "Assemblies" design view now sports
four new options for one-click .NET assembly registration, native
image generation, installer class execution, and forced removal of
assemblies from the GAC.

   InstallAware 8 keeps developers up to date with Microsoft's
constantly evolving technologies. Native IIS 7 support makes it a snap
to create websites, virtual folders, and application pools on Windows
Server 2008 and Windows Vista without IIS 6 metabase compatibility. A
single check-box in the Run Programs window is all it takes to
"de-elevate" applications when User Account Control is enabled,
letting freshly installed software start in a user context instead of
an administrator context. The monolithic Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5
runtime has been granularized into stand-alone runtimes for .NET 2
SP1, .NET 3 SP1, and .NET 3.5 - offering the ultimate flexibility for
developers in choosing exactly the technologies they require when
publishing their applications - and saving them valuable space in
their product install. Best of all, existing InstallAware projects can
automatically take advantage of all these new features with just a
recompile.

   Also new in InstallAware 8 is dual-mode web updates. Developers
may now toggle between scheduled updates, mimicking the way Windows
Update works; or manual updates, which are installed on-demand. Again,
a single check-box in the InstallAware IDE is sufficient to toggle the
web update mode, and to publish royalty free updates for an unlimited
number of software products. At no time does InstallAware ever install
a service, even when scheduled updates are being used - helping
conserve system resources, while also reducing the attack surface on
the target machine.

   Among other time and money saving InstallAware benefits are, up to
67% smaller setup packages, building setups with partially web
deployed segments (such as for application runtimes), a one-click
patch authoring process which builds binary patches simply by
referencing old installer versions, full support for all Windows
versions from the original release of Windows 95 Gold to the latest 64
bit version of Windows Server 2008, fully customizable dialogs,
interactive HTML or Flash content as progress billboards, custom Vista
Aero Glass regions, and unattended deployment via Active Directory
Group Policy or other network deployment technologies.

   InstallAware is available in four editions, with prices starting
at US$399. A time limited trial and more information is available at
http://www.installaware.com/.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Aug 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that it has been positioned in the
"Leaders" quadrant in Gartner, Inc.'s Magic Quadrant for Storage
Professional and Support Services.(1)

    The ability to execute and completeness of vision were examined while
positioning each storage professional and support services provider.
According to Gartner, Inc., "Leaders are performing well today, have a
clear vision of market direction and are actively building competencies to
sustain their leadership position in the market. Service providers in this
quadrant have a strong worldwide presence, provide a broad range of
services, invest in innovative service tools and technologies and
articulate a clear vision of current and future customer requirements and
storage service solutions."

    With key market drivers including the explosion of the volume of
information and data, regulatory and compliance concerns and escalating
information technology (IT) management costs, IBM Global Technology
Services has unmatched worldwide scope of storage services delivery
capabilities, and strategic outsourcing leadership.

    In the past year, IBM Global Technology Services made three strategic
acquisitions to build on its strategy of providing standardized storage
and information protection services which deliver high value and more
predictable business results to clients.


--  In the first quarter of 2007, IBM acquired privately held data
migration specialist Softek Storage Solutions Corp. Through this
acquisition, IBM has assembled the most complete and unified data mobility
offerings and worldwide delivery expertise for managing data in storage
array, host, and virtualized information technology (IT) environments.

--  In October 2007, IBM acquired storage solutions company NovusCG to
provide clients with improved access to business information, enable
stronger regulatory and corporate compliance, and boost their overall
information technology performance.

--  In January 2008, IBM acquired privately held information protection
company Arsenal Digital Solutions to better align managed backup with
business continuity and disaster recovery facilities for mid-market
customers. 

    
"IBM's unique approach to storage and data services is founded on a
client view of the problems they are trying to solve. Therefore, we
integrate across our company -- with IBM Research and Development, the
many recent IBM acquisitions like XiV, Diligent, and Cognos -- and with
our robust partner network to provide end-to-end client solutions," said
Paul Fried, vice president for Storage and Data Services, IBM Global
Technology Services. "In my opinion, this honor from Gartner shows that
IBM's evolving winning and well executed strategy is paying off, and
demonstrates our continued commitment to helping clients more efficiently
store, manage and understand, and leverage data so they can align their
IT and business strategies to grow their respective businesses."

    IBM is the largest storage services provider worldwide and has over 100
System Storage Solution Centers. IBM Global Technology Services uses
methodologies and prior engagement experiences to offer solutions that
help maximize operational effectiveness and gain competitive advantage
while minimizing costs for clients.

    Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Storage Professional and Support Services is
available to Gartner clients at www.Gartner.com.

&lt;p&gt;  SAO PAULO, BRAZIL, Aug 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that Saint-Gobain, one of the largest
industrial groups in Latin America, has signed an agreement with IBM in
Brazil to outsource its entire IT infrastructure. Through the agreement,
with an initial duration of five years, Saint-Gobain expects to ensure
predictability of IT costs, with focus on cost reduction and strict
control, as well as support the fast growth of its business in Brazil,
Argentina and Chile.

    Saint-Gobain conducted a study that demonstrated feasibility of
outsourcing, and chose IBM as the most efficient service provider to meet
its identified needs. "Because it is a dynamic environment, where new
demands arise all the time, we decided to replicate here the service
outsourcing model implemented in the headquarters in France. This will
allow us to gain more flexibility, and focus our efforts and investments
on our core business," explains Jose Luiz Machado, Saint-Gobain CIO in
Brazil. "The contract was signed using the unit price times quantity used
pricing model, in which Saint-Gobain will perform monthly payments
according to the service utilization."

    IBM will be responsible for storage on demand hosting services,
administration, support and IT systems management. The contract also
includes migration of all servers installed at Saint-Gobain headquarters
in Sao Paulo to two datacenters of IBM's Global Delivery Center (GDC), in
Hortolandia. "Thus, all the critical applications supporting the business
will run in our service provision center," says Marcio Corte Fior, IBM
Brazil project executive.

    In addition to providing more business flexibility, the project will
reduce operational risks through quality improvement and a better control
of the services provided by IBM, and provide cost reduction and support
to the expected Group's growth in the next years. Saint-Gobain plans to
gradually start using IBM's infrastructure, located in Hortolandia, in
October 2008, and fully deactivate its two datacenters by March 2009. The
current Saint-Gobain infrastructure team, which currently has 37
professionals responsible for IT Operations including production,
support, architecture and projects, will now focus on business expansion,
identifying needs and defining strategies.

    The agreement was signed in June of 2008.

&lt;p&gt;VILLA 14 DE SEPTIEMBRE, Bolivia (Reuters) - Coca farmers in the verdant Chapare region, where Bolivian President Evo Morales rose to prominence as a fiery union leader, are confident he will win a recall vote on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

But analysts say the political crisis gripping the impoverished country will continue whatever the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're all proud because this is his home turf, where he learned about politics and trade unions, and thanks to his struggle there have been important changes," said farmer Edgar Torres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people in Chapare, which lies in the central Cochabamba region, as well as in western, Andean provinces are likely to vote for Morales to stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm going to vote for Evo because he's always going to support us," said Fortuna Fernandez, 58, near the polling station where Morales is set to cast his ballot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in opposition-controlled eastern regions, many people are disenchanted with his leftist reforms and say he is only governing for his indigenous power base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since taking office in 2006, Morales has sought to raise state revenue from the country's natural resources, particularly natural gas, and distribute some of the extra profits among the poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He remains head of Bolivia's largest coca growers' union and has a "zero cocaine, but not zero coca" policy on drugs in the world's No. 3 cocaine producer. That involves fighting the drug trade but promoting legal coca uses, such as tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of coca farmers are each allowed to cultivate an area the size of a third of a soccer field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States says the policy has led to an increase in coca cultivation.

&lt;p&gt;STANFORD, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
"Economics, more than anything else, is a way of thinking," says
economist and syndicated columnist Walter E. Williams. In his new book
Liberty versus the Tyranny of Socialism (Hoover Institution Press,
September 2008), Williams has compiled a selected collection of his
newspaper columns from the past few years that offer insights into
analyzing issues from an economic frame of mind. "Many of my columns
focus on the growth of government and our loss of liberty, but many
other columns demonstrate how the tools of economics can be used in
ways that ordinary people can understand," said Williams.

   The columns included in Liberty versus the Tyranny of Socialism
are divided into sections titled education, environment and health,
government, income, international, law and society, potpourri, and
race. Each section is introduced by Williams's review of the main
points of those columns. In a special addendum, titled "Economics for
the Citizens," Williams discusses his basic economic principles.

   Williams has been a member of the faculty of George Mason
University in Fairfax, Virginia, as John M. Olin Distinguished
Professor of Economics since 1980; from 1995 to 2001, he served as
department chairman. He holds a B.A. in economics from California
State University, Los Angeles, and M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in economics
from University of California, Los Angeles.

   The author of more than 150 publications that have appeared in
scholarly journals such as Economic Inquiry, American Economic Review,
and popular publications such as Newsweek, Williams has also written
six books: America: A Minority Viewpoint; The State against Blacks,
which was later made into the PBS documentary Good Intentions; All It
Takes Is Guts: South Africa's War against Capitalism, which was later
revised for publication in South Africa; Do the Right Thing: The
People's Economist Speaks; and More Liberty Means Less Government.

   Williams writes a nationally syndicated weekly column that is
carried by approximately 140 newspapers and several websites. He has
made frequent radio and television appearance on such shows as
Nightline and Firing Line. He is also occasional substitute host of
the Rush Limbaugh Show.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG/SEOUL Aug 12 (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) said on
Tuesday it has won a licence to market and trade over-the-counter
derivatives in South Korea, which will broaden the U.S. bank's
product range as the country's securities market deregulates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The licence enables JPMorgan to deal onshore in
over-the-counter won-denominated derivatives of all asset classes
including equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, credit and
commodities and products. JPMorgan can also act as a liquidity
provider for equity-linked warrants in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan joins five other foreign houses and 15 domestic
firms with over-the-counter derivatives licences. The other
overseas players are Macquarie (MQG.AX), Citigroup (C.N), Credit
Suisse (CSGN.VX), Merrill Lynch MER.N and Lehman Bros LEH.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Capital Markets Integration Act, which is set to take
effect in February, has raised hopes for further growth in South
Korea's securities market by making it easier for companies to
package and sell derivatives and develop in-house funds.

&lt;p&gt;Disney Launches Global Research &amp; Development Labs with Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich)

LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
Disney (NYSE:DIS) announced a major Research and Development
initiative to engage top technology universities to conduct research
and development for its Parks &amp; Resorts division, Disney Media
Networks, ESPN, Walt Disney Feature Animation, Walt Disney Studios
Motion Pictures, Disney Interactive Media Group and Pixar Animation
Studios.

   Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the Swiss Federal Institute
of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich), known for their leading-edge work
in computer science and technology, are to establish collaborative
labs with Disney in Pittsburgh and Zurich.

   "Creating the next generation of sophisticated technologies
requires long-term vision and collaboration with world-class
innovators," said Ed Catmull, president, Disney and Pixar Animation
Studios, making the announcement at SIGGRAPH, the world's largest
computer graphics conference. "We are strengthening our commitment to
R throughout Disney by establishing labs with Carnegie Mellon
University and ETH Zurich," he said.

   The labs will connect Disney with renowned academic partners who
have world class science and technology talent. The labs will engage
in R on computer animation, computational cinematography, autonomous
interactive characters, robotics and user interfaces, among other
initiatives. They will be located at Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh and
ETH Zurich. Each lab represents a five-year commitment from Disney to
fund a Director and seven to eight principal investigators. Additional
staff will include professors, academic interns, scientific
consultants and collaborators.

   "Extending our R efforts to these top-notch university partners
will take our internal initiatives to a new level," said Joe Marks,
Vice President of R for Walt Disney Imagineering Research &amp;
Development. Marks is leading the Disney launch of the project and
will oversee the labs for Disney.

   Carnegie Mellon University is home to some of the world's leading
researchers in computer science and engineering, entertainment
technology and robotics, areas of particular interest to Disney.
Jessica Hodgins, CMU professor of computer science and robotics and
Director of Disney Research, Pittsburgh, said one of the lab's first
projects will be developing methods for people to interact with
autonomous characters, either virtual or robotic. "We'll be looking
for ways to sense what a person is doing or thinking so that the
character can respond appropriately," she said. "Whether the character
is a robot or a virtual creation, the interaction issues are the same.
We need to figure out what sensors to build and how to interpret and
respond to human behavior."

   The Disney Research lab's offices are situated little more than a
block away from Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science complex.
Hodgins said she expects that most projects will include faculty and
student collaborators from Carnegie Mellon. Staff members also will be
encouraged to teach classes at the university.

   "The access Disney provides to real-world problems and data will
enable us to do research with greater impact than is typically
possible within a purely academic environment," Hodgins said. "At the
same time, Disney Research in Pittsburgh can tap expertise at Carnegie
Mellon that can be applied to problems that cut across all of Disney's
business units." In addition to work on autonomous characters, she
anticipates projects involving databases, machine learning and
visualization.

   ETH Zurich has a strong tradition of research in computational
methods and computer systems. It is one of the most renowned locations
for research in computer science, and as such, a strong partner for
Disney. Professor Markus Gross, Head of ETH Zurich's Computer Graphics
Laboratory in the Department of Computer Science calls the
collaboration with Disney "on the cusp of the cutting-edge." "We have
been looking for a partner like Disney to create synergies that will
open up a wide spectrum of different fields in entertainment
technology," he says. He adds that, "Our research will explore novel
algorithms to bring both traditional animation and 3D computer
animation to the next level of perfection. We will investigate how
artistic knowledge and rules can be incorporated into
computer-assisted production and content creation. Additionally, we
plan to design the next generation of cinematographic technology." The
applied research and joint intellectual properties that will result
from the technology transfer will offer new and creative opportunities
to strengthen ETH Zurich's talent, potential and ability to make an
impact on industry.

   The Disney Research lab in Zurich will work with faculty members
from the Department of Computer Science, specifically with Visual
Computing and the Computer Graphics Laboratory, to conduct the highest
level applied research in areas including computer animation, image
synthesis, computational photography, and artificial intelligence.

   Joint Ph.D projects and research contracts, as well as teaching
services from senior Disney researchers, are part of the advantages
and synergies to be drawn from the collaboration. Professor Markus
Gross will head Disney Research in Zurich.

   The individual R programs at Disney Parks &amp; Resorts, Pixar and
Disney Animation Studios, Interactive Games, Disney's television and
motion picture studios and ImageMovers Digital and their existing
university alliances with schools throughout the globe will continue.
The Pittsburgh and Zurich labs will focus on areas of research that
span multiple business units across the company.

   Carnegie Mellon is a private research university with a
distinctive mix of programs in engineering, computer science,
robotics, business, public policy, fine arts and the humanities. More
than 10,000 undergraduate and graduate students receive an education
characterized by its focus on creating and implementing solutions for
real problems, interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation. A small
student-to-faculty ratio provides an opportunity for close interaction
between students and professors. While technology is pervasive on its
144-acre campus, Carnegie Mellon is also distinctive among leading
research universities for the world-renowned programs in its College
of Fine Arts. For more, see www.cmu.edu.

   ETH Zurich (The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich)
focuses primarily on engineering sciences, architecture,
system-oriented sciences, mathematics and natural sciences. It
conducts research that is highly valued worldwide. On a yearly basis,
ETH Zurich applies for 80-100 patents and directly supports the
founding of up to 20 spin-off companies. More than 360 professors,
largely of international origin, teach a student body of 14,000 from
more than 90 nations. The university is distinguished by the successes
of 21 Nobel laureates, and committed to providing its students with
unparalleled education and outstanding leadership skills.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - As proposed buyouts sweep 
through the drug sector, Pfizer's failure in recent years to 
buy another big rival has surprised many investors, some of 
whom say its too late for a big acquisition to rescue the No. 1 
drugmaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Investors had long expected Pfizer to acquire another large 
drugmaker or sizable biotechnology companies to gain rights to 
new medicines before it loses U.S. patent protection on its 
Lipitor cholesterol fighter in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The hole created by generic forms of Lipitor will be so 
gapingly big that it's hard to argue convincingly for an 
acquisition," said Scott Richter, a portfolio manager with 
Fifth Third Asset Management. He noted that other Pfizer drugs 
will also lose patent protection soon after Lipitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company, which rakes in $13 billion a year for Lipitor, 
also badly needs new products to offset sales declines for 
drugs already facing generic competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, which became the industry leader by buying 
Pharmacia Corp and Warner-Lambert Corp over the past decade, is 
trading at 11-year-lows because its laboratories have failed to 
produce important drugs. Pfizer edged up 1 cent to $19.85 on 
the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Richter said other drugmakers are facing similar problems, 
including a poor record of developing new drugs or getting them 
approved. "So Wall Street would be super-skeptical about the 
success of bringing two problem children together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moreover, Richter said, Pfizer would probably need to 
repatriate many billions of dollars in overseas profits to 
finance a big deal. That would greatly raise its tax rate, he 
cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's inaction has been underscored in recent weeks by 
Roche Holding AG's (ROG.VX) $44 billion offer for all 
outstanding shares of its U.S. partner, Genentech Inc DNA.N, 
and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's (BMY.N) $4.5 billion bid for 
cancer-drug partner ImClone Systems Inc IMCL.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Business development continues to be a focus and is part 
of all of our revenue growth strategies," Pfizer said in a 
statement. "We continue to be selective and diligent on the 
assets we pursue, which is essential to any successful business 
development effort."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it has been focusing on deals in the past 
18 months, including a global licensing deal in April with 
Avant Immunotherapeutics Inc AVAN.O for a promising brain 
cancer treatment in mid-stage trials. "These strategic deals 
add depth to our pipeline and the potential for new, innovative 
medicines," Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, with annual revenue of about $48 billion and a 
market capitalization of $130 billion, would need to buy a 
company with enough revenue "to move the needle," said Chris 
Armbruster, an analyst with Al Frank Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Armbruster said suitors that might make sense are Wyeth 
WYE.N and Biogen Idec Inc (BIIB.O) because of their ample 
size and focus on lucrative biologics -- medicines made in 
living cells that narrowly target disease-causing proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Wyeth and Biogen, with market capitalizations of $57 
billion and $15 billion, respectively, are grappling with big 
recent setbacks for their medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Pfizer can fine-tune their focus and make focused 
acquisitions, but it would be hard to imagine a massive, 
transformational deal," said one investment banker who asked 
not be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Pfizer hasn't done anything wrong; it's not like they 
missed this great 'aha!' moment," the banker said. "It's just a 
long, slow process changing a company of this size in this 
market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another investment banker expressed doubt that mergers and 
acquisitions would turn the tide for Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given their size, they can make any number of small 
acquisitions but that still won't make a meaningful difference 
to their bottom line and research and development pipeline," 
the banker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's not one magic answer for them. It's not like they 
missed doing that one step that would have made all the 
difference. They are so big and so complicated that there's no 
easy solution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jay Markowitz, a research analyst at T. Rowe Price 
Associates, said it will be very hard for Pfizer to deal with 
Lipitor's downturn. "How do you replace $12 billion in 
revenue?" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although big merger deals can provide cost savings and 
other benefits in the short term, he said they typically 
destroy shareholder value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead of going that route, he recommended that Pfizer 
focus instead on "beating the bushes" to acquire small and 
mid-size companies, or promising individual drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He suggested that Pfizer acquire more medicines in 
mid-stage trials -- a point where they are more expensive than 
untested early-stage drugs but far less costly than drugs that 
have already proven their worth in bigger studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is a reluctance to make bets on compounds that still 
have clinical risks," Markowitz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York,

&lt;p&gt;University of California Program to Receive $3.5 million
IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) announced today a $3.5-million
grant to the Global Health Group at the University of California, San
Francisco (UCSF), to expand its core support for an unprecedented
malaria elimination effort in southern Africa.

   "To win the fight against malaria we must attack the disease on
many fronts," said Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive
officer. "ExxonMobil is committed to this battle, which is why we're
doing everything we are -- from helping to develop new drugs,
facilitating the delivery of insecticide treated bed nets to places
where they are desperately needed and supporting programs that prevent
the spread of the disease."

   The UCSF Global Health Group and its partners currently provide
significant support to Botswana and Swaziland in the development of
strategic plans to eliminate malaria from those countries. The Group
will use today's funding from ExxonMobil to build on this support, and
expand it to additional southern African countries such as Namibia and
Zanzibar. This work, conducted in partnership with the Clinton
Foundation, is a cornerstone of the Global Health Group's Malaria
Elimination Initiative, which seeks to eliminate the disease in
several countries around the world, working inward from the natural
global borders of the disease.

   Funding will also allow the Global Health Group - Clinton
Foundation partnership to support development and enhancement of
critical cross-border initiatives between countries with low levels of
malaria and their more heavily-affected neighbors, helping to control
the disease and pave the way for elimination. Resources will also be
used to support rigorous monitoring and evaluation, and sharing of
lessons and experiences with the broader malaria elimination
community. These efforts are conducted in support of the Southern
African Development Community's (SADC) goal of eliminating malaria
from the region.

   "ExxonMobil has been a corporate leader in the fight against
malaria and we are delighted by their support for our work," said Sir
Richard Feachem, KBE, DSc(Med), PhD, director of the Global Health
Group. "This funding will greatly strengthen the pioneering malaria
control and elimination efforts under way in southern Africa and link
them more effectively to similar work in other parts of the world."

   Dr. Steven Phillips, medical projects director for ExxonMobil said
it is vital to take a new regional approach if the battle against
malaria is to be successfully transitioned from one aimed at
controlling the disease to outright elimination.

   "Malaria knows no borders, it cannot be eliminated in any one
country unless we tackle it together as a regional strategy," said Dr.
Phillips. "Elimination of this disease requires new levels of regional
and international cooperation."

   The funding to UCSF will bring ExxonMobil's commitment to
organizations engaged in important community and social development
projects in Africa to more than $130 million, which includes more than
$50 million committed through the company's Africa Health Initiative.

   The Africa Health Initiative was established in 2000 in support of
the Abuja Declaration on Roll Back Malaria in Africa and its goal to
halve malaria deaths by 2010. Since then, ExxonMobil has developed
on-the-ground public-private partnerships to fight malaria at the
community level, progress treatment and vaccine research and raise
awareness and international support.

   As part of those relationships, Dr. Phillips serves on the board
of Malaria No More and as an advisor to the UN Special Envoy on
Malaria.

   Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by a parasite and
transmitted to humans by the bite of a mosquito. With between 1
million and 3 million deaths annually and 3,000 children deaths daily,
it remains one of the globe's leading infectious killers. The majority
of its victims are children under the age of five and pregnant women.

   Today's announcement brings to a total of twelve countries in
Africa where anti-malaria efforts are being supported by ExxonMobil,
the largest non-pharmaceutical corporate donor to malaria research and
development efforts. The others are Angola, Nigeria, Equatorial
Guinea, Chad, Cameroon, Kenya and Uganda.

   About Exxon Mobil Corporation

   Exxon Mobil Corporation and ExxonMobil Foundation, the primary
philanthropic arm of Exxon Mobil Corporation in the United States,
engage in a range of philanthropic activities that advance education,
health and public policy in the communities where ExxonMobil has
significant operations. In the United States, ExxonMobil supports
initiatives to improve math and science education at the K-12 and
higher education levels. Globally, ExxonMobil provides funding to
improve basic education and combat malaria and other infectious
diseases in developing countries. In 2007, together with its employees
and retirees, Exxon Mobil Corporation, its divisions and affiliates,
and ExxonMobil Foundation provided $207 million in contributions
worldwide. Additional information on ExxonMobil's community
partnerships and contributions programs is available at

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Microsoft's Zune is looking to Hollywood to gain an edge on Apple's iPod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft executives have been making the rounds at talent agencies and production companies in recent months in hopes of licensing exclusive original video programming for the portable media player, which has struggled to gain traction in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft has denied persistent rumors that Zune would expand into communications a la Apple's iPhone, the company confirmed being in an "exploratory phase" regarding supplementing the TV content it already licenses from studios with Zune-only fare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But rather than just stock up on traditional formats like sitcoms, Zune is looking for nonconventional programming that can capitalize on the device's social networking platform, according to Richard Winn, director of entertainment development at Zune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we would be looking to do with any form of original content is the added component that Zune could provide that iTunes or any competing service couldn't," Winn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exclusivity could mean either locking up content that only appears on the Zune platform or syndicating content that appears first on Zune before moving elsewhere with Zune branding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding some point of distinction is becoming paramount for Zune as it strives to come anywhere close to the market share that iPod has amassed among portable media players. In May, Microsoft said that just 2 million Zunes had been sold since the product's launch in November 2006, whereas Apple reportedly averages 3.5 million iPod sales per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the iPod has no exclusive content. Becoming the only hand-held device to boast exclusive programming could represent either a bold reinvention of Zune or a last-ditch effort to stave off extinction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been dogged by rumors that Zune will be scrapped. Robbie Bach, president of entertainment and devices division at Microsoft, raised eyebrows last month among Microsoft watchers by barely mentioning Zune in a session with analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Winn said Zune is in no such danger. Rather, the product plays a key role in Microsoft's buildout of an interconnected ecosystem where content seamlessly flows among all company-owned platforms like Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's that gaming console that inspired Microsoft to think differently about Zune, Winn said. He cites "Halo," the popular video game franchise that helped establish Xbox as a tool for remote multiplayer action as opposed to single-player mode. Similarly, Winn sees Zune as poised to redefine video consumption -- from the traditional solitary pursuit to the backbone for a more communal experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key to that strategy is Zune Social, which connects Zune users through social networking software that, among other capabilities, lets fellow subscribers know the last song consumed. By Winn's thinking, the characters in an original program conceivably could have playlists of their own that could automatically load into users' devices -- deepening connections between users and content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The thing we've all been looking for is, 'What can we do that is a little more interesting than just looking at a piece of video?' " Winn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a far cry from when Zune launched nearly two years ago as a music player. But Microsoft has broadened its utility just as iPod has, introducing a video marketplace in May with a few select content partners including NBC Universal and MTV Networks. Gaming also is slowly being added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Zune is looking to not only add programming that iTunes doesn't deliver but also take the same programming it does and supplement it with Zune Social. Microsoft already has begun experimenting with adding extra features to video game "Ninja Gaiden II" and NBC series "Heroes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--
The International Association of Fire Fighters has announced the
launch of a new initiative to help fire fighters, family members and
friends to quit smoking cigarettes.

   "Our goal is to help make the IAFF the first smoke-free union,"
IAFF General President Harold Schaitberger said in his address to
delegates at the IAFF 49th Convention.

   The IAFF is collaborating with pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc.
to promote smoking cessation. Schaitberger and Pfizer CEO Jeff Kindler
first announced the joint initiative at the IAFF Health and Safety
Conference in Chicago, Illinois, in October 2007.

   The campaign includes materials designed to help fire fighters
understand the risks of smoking and provide information on how to
quit. These and other resources are available on a new web site at
www.iaff.org/smokefree. In the coming weeks, the campaign will add new
resources, including a DVD featuring stories from fire fighters about
how they quit smoking. The web site and other materials are available
to assist IAFF affiliates across North America in reaching out to
members, families and communities to promote and encourage smoking
cessation.

   Smoking is a major health risk for fire fighters who are already
at high risk for illnesses, including heart disease, respiratory
disease and certain cancers. In addition, smoking is the leading cause
of fires and a significant occupational risk for fire fighters.

   "We congratulate the IAFF for its commitment to this campaign and
look forward to working together toward the goal of a smoke-free
union," Kindler said. "Fire fighters are respected leaders in their
communities, and this program on smoking cessation reaffirms that
leadership."

   "Fire fighters place themselves in harm's way, confront dangerous
environments, high heat and flames, and exposure to burning
materials," Schaitberger said. "It's stressful work and some respond
to stress by smoking. Yet smoking increases the health risks fire
fighters face. We want to help prevent that."

   The International Association of Fire Fighters, headquartered in
Washington, DC, represents more than 288,000 full-time professional
fire fighters and paramedics who protect 85 percent of the nation's
population. More information is available at www.iaff.org

   Pfizer discovers and develops innovative medicines to treat and
help prevent disease for both people and animals. We also partner with
healthcare providers, governments and local communities around the
world to expand access to our medicines and to provide better quality
healthcare and health system support.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aug 11 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities took a "neutral"
stance on the U.S. electric utilities sector, citing a number
of concerns such as falling natural gas prices that have
emerged in the past few weeks to pressure the group, and
downgraded American Electric Power and Consolidated Edison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, which said it had been wrong to recommend a
positive stance on the sector earlier this year, added it would
now stick with bellwether names like FPL Group (FPL.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expected ongoing uncertainty about the U.S. economy
coupled with the strong fundamentals and earnings momentum of
the utilities group to support the stocks through the year. We
were wrong," JP Morgan analyst Andrew Smith wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smith downgraded American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP.N) to
"neutral" from "overweight" and Consolidated Edison Inc (ED.N)
to "underweight" from "neutral," while it upgraded FPL Group
Inc to "overweight" from "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smith said American Electric currently trades at a modest
discount to the group, adding that he expects this to persist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst downgraded Consolidated Edison, citing a
difficult regulatory environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Falling natural gas prices pressure power prices as natural
gas is the input fuel that determines power prices in a number
of U.S. markets, Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors are also concerned about Texas oil billionaire T.
Boone Pickens' campaign, which suggests that the United States
should invest $1 trillion in wind power to displace natural gas
consumption for power generation in favor of natural gas
consumption as a transportation fuel, Smith added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "However, we believe the time horizon for investment of
this magnitude is extremely long. In the near term, the level
of wind farm development in the U.S. has not increased
materially," Smith wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of American Electric were down 34 cents at $38.76 in
morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated
Edison shares were up 11 cents $41.02, while FPL shares were up
14 cents at $60.19

Ensim Corporation, the leading provider of user provisioning and access
control software, today announced its support for the Microsoft Solution
for Hosted Messaging and Collaboration Version 4.5 (HMC 4.5).

    As a participant in Microsoft's Technical Adoption Program (TAP), Ensim
extends Microsoft's technology with its Ensim Unify Shared Edition, a
single, centralized software application that simplifies the day-to-day
burden of activating, configuring and managing a service provider's hosted
infrastructure. The latest edition of Unify Shared Edition, Version 4.5,
can be installed in a wide range of deployment scenarios, including the
new HMC 4.5, HMC 4.0, and homegrown infrastructures.

    Some of the features available in Ensim Unify 4.5 are:

    Support for Microsoft HMC 4.5: Ensim is pleased to announce that Unify
Platform 4.5 is compatible with the latest release of Microsoft's HMC
product

    Control Panel Customization Using Role Management: With Unify's role
management feature set, service providers and reseller administrators gain
granular control over all operations performed by the system
administrators.

    Support for Ensim Migration Tool: Service providers can now use the
Ensim's Migration Tool (EMT) to connect to existing organizations,
resellers, and users that were created using Microsoft's HMC solution.
This feature can also be used to migrate organizations (OUs) and users
(created using a legacy solution) to Ensim Unify without having to
re-create them.

    New Password Management Enhancements: Service providers can now configure
Unify to accept more than one password hint question.

    Support for Microsoft .NET 3.0: In Unify platform 4.5.0, the Unify
provisioning engine and control panel servers use Microsoft .NET Framework
3.0.

    New Web Services Methods: Unify platform 4.5.0 includes 50+ new web
service methods.

    Confirmation for Organization and Reseller Removal: As an added safety
precaution, when enabled, this feature requires administrators to enter an
authentication password before being able to delete any organization or
reseller.

    Infrastructure tested on Windows Server 2008

    "We remain committed to giving our customers the tools that keep them
ahead of the curve by supporting a variety of the latest applications,"
said Francois Depayras, vice president of marketing and alliances at Ensim
Corporation. "With Unify, service provider customers can focus on
delivering their hosted services as opposed to developing them, and are
afforded the convenience of deploying these services over any type of
infrastructure, whether it be the new HMC 4.5 or a homegrown platform."

Compugen has become one of a very few Charter Members of Microsoft's
Desktop Deployment Planning Services Distinguished DDPS Partner Program.

ongoing commitment to DDPS engagements and demonstrate excellence with
desktop deployment for customers worldwide.

toolkits and associated risk management strategies delivered to Microsoft
licensing customers who have associated software assurance benefits and
choose to engage Microsoft partners to deliver the benefits. They are

interaction time required to install desktop applications and operating
systems. Customers receiving the services are able to enter into
deployments of business desktop software and hardware with advanced tools
and knowledge to execute in a low-risk and economical way, leading to
increased software usage and productivity, lower deployment and operating
costs and improved return on software investment.

    Charter members of this elite Program have delivered DDPS services to
many customers, have a minimum number of fully trained personnel, and
maintain their Program membership through ongoing qualification, service
delivery and evidence of customer satisfaction. They also commit to
deploying the technology within their own operations, and developing case
studies in cooperation with selected DDPS customers.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE/DUBAI (Reuters) - The Dubai Mercantile Exchange
(DME) has enlisted six international energy traders and
investment banks as new co-owners to help it attract liquidity,
selling them up to 20 percent in the exchange, it said on
Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The DME, a joint venture between Oman, Dubai and the New
York Mercantile Exchange NMX.N, sold stakes to Morgan Stanley
(MS.N), Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Concord Energy, oil trader Vitol,
Chicago-based Casa Energy Trading, and a company owned by Royal
Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), it said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We look forward to leveraging these new relationships to
expand and diversify our customers base," said Ahmad Sharad,
Chairman of the DME, but declined to give the financial details
of the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The DME declined to specify whether the six new
shareholders held the total 20 percent stake, or if other
parties may also be involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NYMEX, Dubai's state-owned Tatweer and the Oman government
now each owns 25 percent of the DME, while DME floor members
continue to hold the remaining 5 percent, DME Chief Operating
Officer Thomas Leaver told reporters in a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The DME launched trading in June 2007 with a sour Middle
East crude futures contract, aiming to become the benchmark for
pricing in the world's top oil exporting region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But volumes on the flagship Oman contract have failed to
take off and physical delivery has been high, showing that many
traders used the exchange as a means to buy and sell physical
Oman crude, rather than to speculate on future prices or
hedging their exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even the introduction of two financial contracts has not
made much difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEEDS LIQUIDITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The physical contract has survived longer than past
attempts to launch sour crude futures, but has yet to establish
itself as a viable benchmark for the vast and growing exports
of Middle East crude to Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They really needed to create some liquidity. Bringing in
these guys may be a start," a trader said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A successful and liquid futures exchange linked to energy
products in the region will help us to better manage some of
the risks inherent in our own business and those of our
clients," said Goran Trapp, head of commodities for Europe,
Middle East and Africa for Morgan Stanley. "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NYMEX reached a deal in March to merge with the CME Group
Inc (CME.O), the world's largest derivatives exchange. One
source said in May the DME would like to push through the stake
sale before the CME merger was completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NYMEX Chief Executive James Newsome told Dubai Eye radio on
May 13 that the DME was also considering an initial public
offering as one of its options for future growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company declined to talk about that on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They have not ruled out an IPO yet, but they want to see
first what is the outcome of this stake sale," an industry
source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But many doubt that their move will bring liquidity to the
contracts, and maybe it will if the new shareholders were asked
to pump up liquidity," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Ramthan Hussain)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X1 Technologies Unveils Unique SharePoint 2007 Enterprise Search
                        Strategy for Customers
PASADENA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
X1 Technologies, Inc., the innovator in enterprise search
solutions, today announced its strategy for customers who require a
unified enterprise search solution that encompasses Microsoft
SharePoint 2007. The strategy consists of two new X1 Content
Connectors for Microsoft SharePoint 2007, one server based and one
that connects directly to the X1 Professional Client. The first to be
generally available is the new X1 Content Connector for Microsoft
SharePoint 2007 that works in conjunction with the X1 Enterprise
Server to provide a centralized search solution for the enterprise.
This new Content Connector goes beyond the functionality of the
Connector for Microsoft SharePoint 2003 by indexing all data stored
within SharePoint while providing a unified (a.k.a Federated) method
for searching data both within SharePoint and throughout the
enterprise. Enterprises can effortlessly search for any type of
content that may reside in SharePoint, email, personal computers, file
servers or enterprise applications, all from a simple yet elegant
interface.

   Congruent to the server based Content Connector for Microsoft
SharePoint 2007 is the new client-side Content Connector, now
available for beta, that allows users of the X1 Professional Client to
directly query the Microsoft SharePoint 2007 search engine without the
need for a server component. The difference with this direct query to
SharePoint 2007 versus the server based connector is in the indexing
and controls over the viewable data. The Content Connector for the X1
Professional Client will be limited to the access provided by
Microsoft SharePoint query protocols and does not provide the full X1
query language capabilities. In contrast, the new server based Content
Connector provides indexing and full X1 search capabilities to all
data (over 400 file types) within Microsoft SharePoint 2007.

   "Microsoft SharePoint is an immensely popular solution for
collaboration and content management and is one of the most popular
applications we provide a Content Connector for," said John Waller,
President and COO X1 Technologies. "Our dual path approach is unique
within the industry in that we are allowing customers to choose how
they search Microsoft SharePoint 2007 in their environment."

   About X1 Technologies

   X1 Technologies, the innovator in enterprise search solutions, was
founded in 2003 with the vision of providing a single user interface
capable of previewing and acting upon data anywhere in the enterprise.
X1's patented search technology scales from a single server to tens of
thousands of desktops. Innovations pioneered by X1 include
fast-as-you-type searching along with unified, actionable search. X1
is a technology partner with leading companies such as Microsoft,
Oracle and Symantec. Headquartered in Pasadena California, X1 is an
operating company of Idealab. For more information, visit

&lt;p&gt;Hitachi Completes Storage Compatibility Testing for IBM Next-Generation Mainframe Environments

     Successful Testing Results Highlight Maximum Availability and
         Reliability for Hitachi's Enterprise Storage Products
SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Hitachi Data Systems Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Hitachi, Ltd. (NYSE: HIT) today announced the successful completion of
compatibility and interoperability testing for the IBM System z10
Enterprise Class server, the IBM next-generation mainframe which IBM
announced earlier this year.

   Product interoperability testing included the Hitachi Universal
Storage Platform V and the Hitachi Universal Storage Platform VM. The
successful interoperability tests demonstrate how the combination of
Hitachi's enterprise-class storage systems with IBM's next-generation
mainframe can deliver the performance, reliability and availability
for the most demanding applications. In addition, the testing
completion results in a greater degree of compatibility and
interoperability and makes it easier for customers to install both
Hitachi Data Systems and IBM products in their environments.

   Hitachi Data Systems continues to deliver virtualization solutions
for mainframe storage environments, effectively enabling customers to
store non-critical mainframe data on low-cost SATA systems. Hitachi's
approach allows enterprises to centrally deliver and manage storage
services such as data migration and replication, as opposed to
utilizing multiple isolated islands of storage to attempt to perform
similar functions.

   "Mainframe remains the mission-critical environment for many
businesses today and because of this, the mainframe systems must meet
the satisfaction of high reliability and availability," said John
Mansfield, senior vice president, Global Solutions Strategy and
Development, Hitachi Data Systems. "Hitachi has a deep history in
supporting mainframe environments and has seen increased customer
satisfaction since agreeing to conduct interoperability testing.
Meeting the business-critical data storage needs of our mainframe
customers around the globe is priority number one. In addition, we
offer them opportunities to further consolidate and reduce the number
of disparate storage platforms they must manage."

   The successful testing was conducted for Hitachi's support of
Enterprise System Connection(TM) (ESCON(R)), Fiber Connection
(FICON(R)) and Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP) connectivity for select
configurations of IBM System z10 Enterprise Class (z10 EC), z9
Enterprise Class (z9 EC), zSeries(R) 800, 900 and 990 systems running
operating systems including z/OS(R) 1.9, z/VM 5.3, z/VSE4.1 and Linux
on System z Novell SUSE SLES 9 and SLES 10.

   As a result of successful completion of compatibility and
interoperability testing, a Letter of Qualification was issued by IBM
and posted on its Web site at:
http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/z/hardware/connectivity/products/.

WHAT:  Technical Presentation
       DataDirect Technologies (www.datadirect.com), the unparalleled
        leader in data connectivity and mainframe integration and an
        operating company of Progress Software Corporation (Nasdaq:
        PRGS), will review the company's unique approach for
        leveraging IBM's mainframe specialty engines for integrating
        mainframe data and application environments with Service-
        Oriented Architectures (SOA) and composite application
        development initiatives.

       Gregg Willhoit, Chief Software Architect of the DataDirect(R)
        Shadow(R) mainframe integration platform will detail the
        latest advances in middleware architecture, including the
        creation of a new hybrid thread type called the Logical
        Dispatchable Unit (LDU). The presentation will explain how the
        combination of LDUs and new Work Load Management (WLM)
        techniques to exploit the zIIP allows organizations to offload
        significant portions of its mainframe SOAs and data processing
        to the zIIP's unmeasured, non-speed restricted environment.
        With this information, users can develop more effective
        strategies for lowering mainframe TCO and how to integrate
        mainframe systems into SOAs and business intelligence
        initiatives.

&lt;p&gt;Visa Data Reveals Olympic Games Opening Day Spending Gives Multi-Million Dollar Boost to China

BEIJING--(Business Wire)--
The international tourists who have joined the more than 11,000
athletes from 204 participating National Olympic Committees(1) in
China for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games have had an immediate impact
on the nation's economy, including nearly US$10 million spent on Visa
cards on the opening day of the Games. The money spent by tourists on
their Visa credit, debit and prepaid cards on 8 August 2008 showed an
increase of 11 percent over last year (8 August 2007).

   Opening Day's biggest Visa spenders were from USA, followed by
Japan, Hong Kong SAR, South Korea and the United Kingdom. Visitors
from these five locations accounted for more than half of all Visa
card spend on 8 August 2008.

   Not surprisingly, Visa cards were used primarily to pay for
accommodation and to make retail purchases.

   Richard Chang, Executive Vice President and General Manager,
Greater China and the Philippines for Visa said, "China has almost
spared no expense to welcome visitors to the Games. The message sent
at the Opening Ceremony was loud and strong, drawing attention to the
country's rich history and culture through the most innovative,
creative program that most of us have ever seen. And that message went
far and wide, even reaching record levels of television audiences in
the USA(2). Here in China, their compatriots were also the biggest
spenders on Visa cards that same day."

&lt;p&gt;Visa Celebrates Record-Setting Olympic Performance with New Michael Phelps "Go World" Commercial

SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), a Worldwide Olympic Partner for more than two
decades, today released a special edition commercial commemorating
Michael Phelps' historic achievement of winning ten Olympic gold
medals, setting the all-time record for most career Olympic gold
medals. The spot, entitled "Congratulations Phelps," aired on NBC
during the first commercial break following his win in the 200 meter
butterfly at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games.

   The latest installment of the Visa "Go World" campaign follows the
same creative treatment as previous spots, using striking sepia tones
combined with dramatic still photography. The spot closes with an
already memorable image of Phelps celebrating the U.S. team's gold
medal performance in the 4 x 100 meter freestyle relay from earlier in
the Beijing Olympic Games competition.

   "Michael Phelps truly embodies the spirit of our 'Go World'
campaign that celebrates memorable Olympic moments and the
extraordinary athletes who achieve them," said Kevin Burke, head of
global consumer marketing of Visa Inc. "We congratulate Michael on
this momentous achievement and wish him the best as he continues his
march towards Olympic history."

   The spot marks the latest extension of Visa's U.S. advertising
campaign "Go World." The campaign evokes the emotion and memories of
unforgettable moments in Olympic history and features current Olympic
and Paralympic athletes and Olympic legends. The integrated campaign
includes national television commercials, print and online
advertisements, and an online microsite.

   Visa has had a long standing relationship with Phelps through its
Team Visa program, featuring him in two previous national television
commercials ("Lap" and "Fish"), and partnering with him to grow the
sport of swimming around the world through domestic and international
goodwill tours.

   Fans can visit www.visa.com/GoWorld to view ads, learn more about
the heroic feats of Olympians past and present, and submit stories

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co said it has racked up $1.5 billion of losses so far this quarter on mortgage-linked assets, reflecting deepening turmoil in credit markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of the third-largest U.S. bank by assets fell 9.5 percent, as investors grew increasingly disappointed with a bank that had largely sidestepped the worst of the credit crunch, and analysts cut their profit estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has kept JPMorgan profitable even as rivals such as Citigroup Inc and Merrill Lynch  Co posted a series of multi-billion dollar quarterly losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're a huge global trading house, it's very hard to hide from the devastation," said Steve Persky, chief executive at Dalton Investments in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's shares fell as the broader financial sector dropped. Lehman Brothers fell 12 percent to $16.21, while Bank of America Corp, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs all fell more than 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan revealed the losses in a regulatory filing late Monday. The bank said trading conditions have "substantially deteriorated" in the third quarter, and mortgage-backed securities and loans have weakened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank also has substantial exposure to credit cards and other consumer debt that looks increasingly vulnerable as the U.S. economy grows slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Financial Times said JPMorgan was under pressure to write down mortgage assets, in part because of Merrill's decision to sell $30.6 billion of repackaged debt to a private equity fund at 22 cents on the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of June 30, JPMorgan held $19.5 billion of prime and Alt-A mortgage exposure, $1.9 billion of subprime mortgage exposure, and $11.6 billion of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) exposure, the filing showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These mortgage exposures could be adversely affected by worsening market conditions, further deterioration in the housing market and market activity reflecting distressed sellers," JPMorgan said. Loss estimates exclude hedging, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trading results could also be hit if the bank's own debt became more valuable. That could theoretically make it more expensive to buy back its own debt, resulting in an accounting charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyst Richard Bove at Ladenburg Thalmann argued that JPMorgan's difficulties raised questions about the reason for the bank's current mix of businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, formed through a series of acquisitions over the last decade, was supposed to have consumer banking and capital markets businesses that complemented each other: when one was doing poorly, the other was supposed to be doing well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately, the first time this concept was tested, it did not work. Both (businesses) seem to be declining in tandem with each other," Bove wrote in a note to clients. Bove cut his estimates for the bank's earnings for 2008 through 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank did return calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares fell $3.97, or 9.5 percent, to $37.92 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAUTIOUS OUTLOOK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, JPMorgan posted a smaller-than-expected 53 percent decline in quarterly earnings on resilient stock and bond underwriting revenue but cautioned that the mortgage market and the economy were getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the filing, JPMorgan said that it expected continued credit deterioration in its consumer portfolio, requiring more reserves for losses, during the rest of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also said home equity charge-offs could keep rising this year, while prime and subprime mortgage net charge-offs would likely rise "significantly." It said further mortgage deterioration was likely into 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan held $16.3 billion of unplaced loans funding buyouts and unfunded commitments for loans as of June 30, the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Leveraged loans and unfunded commitments are difficult to hedge effectively, and if market conditions further deteriorate, additional markdowns may be necessary," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Inc analysts on Tuesday cut their 2008 profit forecast for JPMorgan to $2.30 a share from $2.60, but kept an "overweight" rating and $50 share price target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Dan Wilchins in Washington; additional reporting by Tenzin Pema in Bangalore; Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;Sourcefire Vulnerability Research Team Protects Users from Latest
             Microsoft Windows and Office Vulnerabilities
COLUMBIA, Md.--(Business Wire)--
Open source innovator and SNORT(R) creator, Sourcefire, Inc.
(Nasdaq:FIRE), a leader in Enterprise Threat Management, announced
that the Sourcefire(R) Vulnerability Research Team (VRT) has delivered
rules to protect Sourcefire customers and Snort users from 9 Microsoft
vulnerabilities disclosed today. These vulnerabilities impact
Microsoft Windows, Windows Messenger, Office, Internet Explorer and
Outlook Express.

   "During the Black Hat Conference last week, a lot of vendors were
talking about the importance of immediate detection and early
disclosure, and while this is critical, it is only half the story,"
said Matt Watchinski, Director of the Sourcefire Vulnerability
Research Team. "By developing an early disclosure policy, Microsoft is
taking the necessary steps to protect its users. Now the vendor
community needs to deliver on its responsibility of delivering the
most effective protection possible. Sourcefire takes proactive
protection extremely seriously, and we will continue to focus on both
the quality of our rules, as well as the speed at which we address new
threats."

   Following Microsoft's disclosure earlier today, the Sourcefire VRT
created, tested and delivered Snort rules designed to detect attacks
targeting the Microsoft vulnerabilities listed below. These new rules
are included in the latest Sourcefire Security Enhancement Update
(SEU) released today.

   --  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-041 - Critical vulnerability
        in the ActiveX control for the Snapshot Viewer for Microsoft
        Access. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by
        constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views
        the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code
        execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this
        vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on
        user.

   --  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-043 - Critical
        vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Excel could allow remote
        code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Excel file.
        An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities
        could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker
        could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or
        create new accounts with full user rights.

   --  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-044 - Five critical
        vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user
        viewed a specially crafted image file using Microsoft Office.

   --  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-045 - Five critical
        vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user
        views a specially crafted Web page using Internet Explorer.

   --  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-046 - Critical vulnerability
        in the Microsoft Image Color Management (ICM) system could
        allow remote code execution in the context of the current
        user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights,
        an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability
        could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker
        could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or
        create new accounts with full user rights.

   --  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-048 - Important vulnerability
        in Outlook Express and Windows Mail could allow information
        disclosure if a user visits a specially crafted Web page using
        Internet Explorer.

   --  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-049 - Two important
        vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows Event System could allow
        remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited
        these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an
        affected system. An attacker could then install programs;
        view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full
        administrative rights.

   --  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-050 - Important vulnerability
        in supported versions of Windows Messenger. As a result of
        this vulnerability, scripting of an ActiveX control could
        allow information disclosure in the context of the logged-on
        user. An attacker could change state, get contact information,
        and initiate audio and video chat sessions without the
        knowledge of the logged-on user. An attacker could also
        capture the user's logon ID and remotely log on to the user's
        Messenger client impersonating that user.

   --  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-051 - Three critical
        vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office PowerPoint and Microsoft
        Office PowerPoint Viewer could allow remote code execution if
        a user opens a specially crafted PowerPoint file. An attacker
        who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could
        take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could
        then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create
        new accounts with full user rights.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Microsoft's Zune is looking to Hollywood to gain an edge on Apple's iPod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft executives have been making the rounds at talent agencies and production companies in recent months in hopes of licensing exclusive original video programming for the portable media player, which has struggled to gain traction in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft has denied persistent rumors that Zune would expand into communications a la Apple's iPhone, the company confirmed being in an "exploratory phase" regarding supplementing the TV content it already licenses from studios with Zune-only fare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But rather than just stock up on traditional formats like sitcoms, Zune is looking for nonconventional programming that can capitalize on the device's social networking platform, according to Richard Winn, director of entertainment development at Zune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we would be looking to do with any form of original content is the added component that Zune could provide that iTunes or any competing service couldn't," Winn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exclusivity could mean either locking up content that only appears on the Zune platform or syndicating content that appears first on Zune before moving elsewhere with Zune branding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding some point of distinction is becoming paramount for Zune as it strives to come anywhere close to the market share that iPod has amassed among portable media players. In May, Microsoft said that just 2 million Zunes had been sold since the product's launch in November 2006, whereas Apple reportedly averages 3.5 million iPod sales per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the iPod has no exclusive content. Becoming the only hand-held device to boast exclusive programming could represent either a bold reinvention of Zune or a last-ditch effort to stave off extinction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been dogged by rumors that Zune will be scrapped. Robbie Bach, president of entertainment and devices division at Microsoft, raised eyebrows last month among Microsoft watchers by barely mentioning Zune in a session with analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Winn said Zune is in no such danger. Rather, the product plays a key role in Microsoft's buildout of an interconnected ecosystem where content seamlessly flows among all company-owned platforms like Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's that gaming console that inspired Microsoft to think differently about Zune, Winn said. He cites "Halo," the popular video game franchise that helped establish Xbox as a tool for remote multiplayer action as opposed to single-player mode. Similarly, Winn sees Zune as poised to redefine video consumption -- from the traditional solitary pursuit to the backbone for a more communal experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key to that strategy is Zune Social, which connects Zune users through social networking software that, among other capabilities, lets fellow subscribers know the last song consumed. By Winn's thinking, the characters in an original program conceivably could have playlists of their own that could automatically load into users' devices -- deepening connections between users and content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The thing we've all been looking for is, 'What can we do that is a little more interesting than just looking at a piece of video?' " Winn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a far cry from when Zune launched nearly two years ago as a music player. But Microsoft has broadened its utility just as iPod has, introducing a video marketplace in May with a few select content partners including NBC Universal and MTV Networks. Gaming also is slowly being added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Zune is looking to not only add programming that iTunes doesn't deliver but also take the same programming it does and supplement it with Zune Social. Microsoft already has begun experimenting with adding extra features to video game "Ninja Gaiden II" and NBC series "Heroes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) said it
has racked up $1.5 billion of losses so far this quarter on
mortgage-linked assets, reflecting deepening turmoil in credit
markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Shares of the third-largest U.S. bank by assets fell 9.5
percent, as investors grew increasingly disappointed with a
bank that had largely sidestepped the worst of the credit
crunch, and analysts cut their profit estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has kept JPMorgan profitable
even as rivals such as Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Merrill Lynch 
Co MER.N posted a series of multi-billion dollar quarterly
losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If you're a huge global trading house, it's very hard to
hide from the devastation," said Steve Persky, chief executive
at Dalton Investments in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's shares fell as the broader financial sector
dropped. Lehman Brothers LEH.N fell 12 percent to $16.21,
while Bank of America Corp, (BAC.N) Citigroup, and Goldman
Sachs (GS.N) all fell more than 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan revealed the losses in a regulatory filing late
Monday. The bank said trading conditions have "substantially
deteriorated" in the third quarter, and mortgage-backed
securities and loans have weakened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York-based bank also has substantial exposure to
credit cards and other consumer debt that looks increasingly
vulnerable as the U.S. economy grows slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Financial Times said JPMorgan was under pressure to
write down mortgage assets, in part because of Merrill's
decision to sell $30.6 billion of repackaged debt to a private
equity fund at 22 cents on the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As of June 30, JPMorgan held $19.5 billion of prime and
Alt-A mortgage exposure, $1.9 billion of subprime mortgage
exposure, and $11.6 billion of commercial mortgage-backed
securities (CMBS) exposure, the filing showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These mortgage exposures could be adversely affected by
worsening market conditions, further deterioration in the
housing market and market activity reflecting distressed
sellers," JPMorgan said. Loss estimates exclude hedging, it
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trading results could also be hit if the bank's own debt
became more valuable. That could theoretically make it more
expensive to buy back its own debt, resulting in an accounting
charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Richard Bove at Ladenburg Thalmann argued that
JPMorgan's difficulties raised questions about the reason for
the bank's current mix of businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, formed through a series of acquisitions over the
last decade, was supposed to have consumer banking and capital
markets businesses that complemented each other: when one was
doing poorly, the other was supposed to be doing well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Unfortunately, the first time this concept was tested, it
did not work. Both (businesses) seem to be declining in tandem
with each other," Bove wrote in a note to clients. Bove cut his
estimates for the bank's earnings for 2008 through 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank did return calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan shares fell $3.97, or 9.5 percent, to $37.92 on
the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CAUTIOUS OUTLOOK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, JPMorgan posted a smaller-than-expected 53
percent decline in quarterly earnings on resilient stock and
bond underwriting revenue but cautioned that the mortgage
market and the economy were getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the filing, JPMorgan said that it expected continued
credit deterioration in its consumer portfolio, requiring more
reserves for losses, during the rest of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also said home equity charge-offs could keep rising this
year, while prime and subprime mortgage net charge-offs would
likely rise "significantly." It said further mortgage
deterioration was likely into 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan held $16.3 billion of unplaced loans funding
buyouts and unfunded commitments for loans as of June 30, the

hedge effectively, and if market conditions further
deteriorate, additional markdowns may be necessary," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman Brothers Inc analysts on Tuesday cut their 2008
profit forecast for JPMorgan to $2.30 a share from $2.60, but
kept an "overweight" rating and $50 share price target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Dan Wilchins in Washington; additional

&lt;p&gt;LA PAZ (Reuters) - Frustrated by the way the United States spends money to fight cocaine production in Bolivia, the government has decided to take over the program, the country's anti-drug tsar said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We're planning to nationalize the war against drug trafficking," Felipe Caceres told Reuters. "We will still welcome cooperation in the future, but the Bolivian government will decide how that money will be spent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a question of sovereignty, of dignity," added Caceres, President Evo Morales' deputy minister of social defense and controlled substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caceres, who like Morales owns a plot for growing coca, the raw material used to make cocaine, advocates cultivation of the plant for traditional uses such as making tea and fighting altitude sickness and hunger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as South America's poorest country distances itself from its colonial past with Morales' reforms and seeks to break away from U.S. influence, the government also wants to be the leading voice in the domestic war against narcotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bolivia is the world No.3 cocaine producer after Colombia and Peru.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States has contributed about $25 million to interdiction efforts this year. It also funds programs to encourage coca farmers to switch to alternative crops like peppers, bananas, citrus fruits and coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The policy of the U.S. government means that of all the money that should go into helping improve conditions for coca farmers, 85 percent of it goes into vehicles, salaries, they live in hotels with swimming pools ... it goes into their pockets," Caceres said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are not rejecting U.S. aid. But the aid is not going to the coca farmers, who are prepared to produce other products and leave the coca leaf behind," he added. "At the moment, the U.S. cooperation is autonomous. ... We want to reverse that situation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caceres said Bolivia was looking to other potential partners like Russia for hardware like helicopters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We welcome the idea that the Bolivian authorities will be willing and able to put forward funds from Bolivia to also deal with this issue," said David T. Johnson, visiting from the U.S. Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, after meeting Morales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our data shows that approximately 88 percent of our funding goes directly to assist Bolivian authorities and working to deal with counter-narcotics issues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COCA CULTIVATION GROWING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morales has adopted a "zero cocaine, but not zero coca" policy, which gives tens of thousands of farmers permission to grow their own coca plot for legal uses, which the United States has described as "permissive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the United Nations, Bolivia allows the cultivation of 12,000 hectares (nearly 30,000 acres) of coca for traditional uses, though output is nearly 29,000 hectares (71,660 acres), or approximately 104 metric tons of coca a year. That compares with 48,600 hectares (120,000 acres) farmed in the mid-1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caceres estimates that 65 percent of coca production is for traditional, legal uses. The balance goes into the cocaine trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morales believes that 20,000 hectares (49,000 acres) is an appropriate production level. Caceres says it will take at least five years to reduce the national crop to that amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says demand for Bolivian cocaine has surged, with much of it destined for Latin American countries and Europe. But he says much of the cocaine confiscated in Bolivia is from Peru, bound for Brazil, the United States and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca is prevalent in Bolivia. It is sold at street markets by women in bowler hats and colorful shawls. Indigenous people in the Andes often have a wad of coca bulging in their cheek like chewing tobacco. Witch doctors use the leaves to tell fortunes. In the building where Caceres' office is located, pictures of dark green coca leaves and a poster advertising a coca festival adorn the walls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caceres would like Bolivia to find ways to export coca legally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are 14 alkaloids in the coca leaf. Only one of them is cocaine. If we take cocaine out of coca, then we can export it. That is the plan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For more stories on Bolivia's recall election and political crisis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BERLIN Aug 12 (Reuters) - Police probing multi-billion euro
losses at German bank SachsenLB raided offices and apartments
across Germany and in Dublin on Tuesday, prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; SachsenLB, a state-owned regional bank from eastern Germany,
was one of Europe's biggest casualties of the U.S. subprime
mortgage crisis. Its peer Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg (LBBW)
took it over late last year after it needed a 17 billion euro
($25.3 billion) bail-out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Five former SachsenLB board members, active at various
points between 2006 and 2007, have been under investigation
since October for acting in bad faith and misrepresentation of
annual accounts, said Ricardo Schulz, a spokesman for
prosecutors in SachsenLB's home town of Leipzig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is a suspicion that the former board members put the
existence of the bank at risk through expanding business, for
which the bank was ultimately jointly liable, with only limited
equity," Leipzig prosecutors said in a joint statement with
Germany's federal criminal investigation bureau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The debt financing that the managers used in their deals
stood out of all proportion to the risks they assumed and the
profits they expected to make," the statement continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prosecutors added that the managers' lack of transparency
about their activities and failure to publish them in
SachsenLB's annual accounts stopped other executives taking
timely measures to mitigate the risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Schulz declined to name the individual board members being
investigated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Police raided 28 offices and flats across Germany and in
Dublin, including some belonging to the suspects, and seized
documents, correspondence, computers and electronic data as
evidence, prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Much of SachsenLB's losses came from two Irish special-
purpose vehicles with investments in U.S. mortgage-backed
securities, Ormond Quay Funding plc and Georges Quay Funding I
Ltd, which were worth 23 billion euros in the second half of
2007, prosecutors added.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Aug 12 (Reuters) - European shares ended with losses
on Tuesday as the region's financial stocks suffered following
further writedowns from U.S. peer JPMorgan (JPM.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 of top European shares
provisionally closed 0.4 percent lower at 1,208.58, having
traded between 1,202.55 and 1,216.40 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan (JPM.N), the third-largest bank in the United
States, traded 6.2 percent lower on Wall Street after saying it
had taken another $1.5 billion in writedowns in the current
quarter as wider credit spreads, lower levels of liquidity and
further disruption in the credit and mortgage markets took a
toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The DJ Stoxx European banks .SX7P fell 1.1 percent with
BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), Deustche Postbank (DPBGn.DE) and Societe
Generale (SOGN.PA) all down more than 3 percent. Natixis
(CNAT.PA) lost 9.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The market is doubting whether the U.S. rate cuts are
having an effect," said strategist Andreas Huerkamp at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The U.S. had a steep yield curve since January, which
usually has a positive effect on the equity markets, but now 7
months have passed and we are still experiencing negative news
in the financial sector," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UBS ended 2.4 percent lower after a rollercoaster session,
which saw the stock gaining as much as 4.2 percent and falling
as much as 2.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Swiss bank announced new management as well as a split
of its business into three units. While the group missed
consensus estimates with its quarterly results, analysts praised
its improved Tier 1 ratio as well as its focus on reducing its
exposure to risky asset classes.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) was downgraded to "hold" from "buy" by Deutsche Bank analyst Mike Mayo, who said the largest U.S. securities firm was not immune to capital market pressures, especially given its exposure to weaker European growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares were down $7.16 at $170.84 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. They have lost more than 17 percent of their value since the start of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman earns a fourth of its revenue from the euro zone and UK, and the expected slowdown in the regions mean the firm's non-U.S. business is not as strong as before, Mayo said. Deutsche's European economics team believes both regions are or will soon be in recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also has among the highest exposures to equities during a period of more significant equity market declines, including areas of expansion such as China, Mayo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is likely to be weaker-than-expected earnings, the analyst added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent weakness in terms of equity underwriting, equities trading and private equity was hitting Goldman at its core strength, Mayo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He expects Goldman to "trade at a discount to its five-year average multiple given cyclical headwinds, the deteriorating credit environment, below average return on equity and newer regulatory uncertainty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oppenheimer  Co's influential analyst Meredith Whitney said as Goldman's revenue is more equity-linked than its broker peers, the fact that broad global equity market indices are all down double-digits will have a meaningful effect on the company's earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both analysts cut their third-quarter and full-year profit forecast for Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brokerage actions on Goldman and an announcement by JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) that it has lost $1.5 billion in the third quarter so far sent most of the financial stocks down on Tuesday, with the SP 500 Financial Index .GSPF falling 7.89 points to 291.68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MSCI global index .MIWD00000PUS, which has lost almost 15 percent year-to-date, was down 2.63 points at 341.84.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THIRD-QUARTER, 2008 ESTIMATES CUT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the third quarter will not be terrible on a relative basis, it could still be one of Goldman's worst as a public company, and the favorable tailwinds the firm has experienced, compared with the industry, may no longer be as strong as before, Mayo wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman is no longer as much in the right place at the right time, at least compared to the past year," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mayo cut his third-quarter profit estimate for the firm to $2.40 a share from $3.25 and his 2008 estimate to $14.60 a share from $16.25. He cut his price target on the stock to $192 from $209.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, Goldman had posted an 11 percent fall in second-quarter earnings as market turmoil hit trading and slowed investment banking, but the firm topped expectations by avoiding major losses on assets slammed by the credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitney also cut her third-quarter earnings estimate for Goldman to $2.15 a share from $3.54 and 2008 estimate to $14.32 a share from $15.75.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyst said main drivers behind the estimate cuts were customer volumes, overall weak global equity markets, and weak advisory and underwriting revenues of the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ramya Dilip in Bangalore; Editing by Himani Sarkar)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Updates with market extending losses)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday,
led lower by financial shares on worries about further losses
stemming from the mortgage crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; News that JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) , the No. 3 U.S. bank, has
taken another $1.5 billion of write-downs in the current
quarter to date suggested the fall-out from the housing slump
is far from over. For details, see [ID:nBNG180409]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Additionally, Goldman Sachs (GS.N) was hit by several stock
rating downgrades. Shares of JPMorgan, down more than 6 percent
at $39.03 on the New York Stock Exchange, were a top drag on
the Dow and the SP 500, as shares of Goldman declined more
than 4 percent to $170.64.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 111.30 points,
or 0.94 percent, to 11,671.05. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index
.SPX declined 9.30 points, or 0.71 percent, to 1,296.02. The
Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC fell 10.29 points, or 0.42
percent, to 2,429.66.

&lt;p&gt;Aug 12 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co's (KO.N) earnings could
come under pressure, UBS said, citing slowing U.S. fast-food
industry trends, a stronger U.S. dollar, and macroeconomic
challenges in the United States and mainland Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a note to clients, UBS said it cut its price target on
the stock to $67 from $70 and also reduced its 2008 earnings
view on the company to $3.08 per share from $3.10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It maintained a "buy" rating on the world's largest
soft-drink maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, however, said Coca-Cola should offset most
of these challenges as it benefits from the Beijing Olympics,
emerging markets and cost savings programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Coca-Cola were down about 2 percent at $54.33 in
morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Newest Independent Software Vendor (ISV) Solution From TMW Geared
        Toward Streamlining Financial Management and Operations
CLEVELAND--(Business Wire)--
TMW Systems, North America's largest provider of enterprise
management software designed specifically for the transportation
services industry, today announced that it has passed rigorous
Microsoft certification testing for a new Cash Receipts software
module that extends Dynamics GP's cash management capabilities. The
certification program identifies applications available for Microsoft
Dynamics(TM) that have been tested for quality and compatibility and
are supported by positive customer references. The new module, TMW GP
Cash Receipt Add-In, is designed to streamline cash receipt processing
for customers in high-volume invoice environments, a description that
fits many TMW clients using Microsoft's Dynamics GP today.

   "We are pleased to offer this business solution for a frequently
painful accounting function that saves time and improves clerical
accuracy," said David Mook, TMW chief operating officer and chief
technology officer.

   According to TMW Software Engineer Ken Mader, existing GP
functionality can be cumbersome for clients operating in a high
invoice volume environment. The TMW GP Cash Receipt Add-In facilitates
rapid input of cash receipts and employs 10-Key Data Entry to process
and pay multiple invoices. A quick-pick list feature permits partial
data entry of invoice numbers for faster record retrieval. Reference
number support provides flexibility for TMW customers to process cash
receipts by purchase order numbers or other references instead of only
by invoice numbers. With the TMW GP Cash Receipt Add-In, Dynamics GP
customers can increase the speed and accuracy of cash receipt data
input.

   TMW Systems was awarded Microsoft certification after careful
scrutiny of their product development requirements process, the
availability of user assistance and documentation for the product,
overall user experience and product usability assessments, and the
development technology, configuration, and platform used, as well as
support for product customization, upgrade and ongoing maintenance.
The new application has been fully tested and validated by more than
one dozen TMW customers.

   For TMW, the new certification is in addition to its existing
Microsoft Gold Certified Partner status, attained in 2005.

   "We have extended the powerful financial capabilities of Microsoft
Dynamics GP with specialized development to address the unique
business needs of the transportation services sector. This complements
our successful work in enterprise software development covering
operations, dispatch, asset management, fleet maintenance and
optimization. Securing this external certification with Microsoft
demonstrates our commitment to deliver enterprise-class software
applications of proven quality to our customers," concluded Mook.

solutions that help companies take better advantage of market
opportunities, improve asset productivity and gain a better return on

&lt;p&gt;Diocese of Saint Augustine Selects Microsoft Dynamics GP as Enterprise Resource Planning Solution

NORCROSS, Ga. &amp; ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
I.B.I.S., Inc., Gold Certified Microsoft Partner, and the Diocese
of Saint Augustine announce the selection of Microsoft Dynamics GP for
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) functions at the Diocese. Founded
in 1870, in St. Augustine, FL, the Diocese of St. Augustine is
comprised of land where Catholicism first touched the shores of North
America. The growth of the church in Florida from this Mother Diocese
to six additional dioceses and more than two million Catholics is a
significant part of the story of the Catholic Church in the United
States.

   Key challenges for the organization are streamlining property
management in their insurance program, and improving Accounts
Receivable for parish billing. Moreover, the Diocese needed user
friendly enterprise software that their entire financial team could
access.

   After conducting in-depth research and viewing the Microsoft
Dynamics GP demonstration, it became clear to the Diocese that
Microsoft Dynamics GP addresses all major challenges and will best
meet the organization's needs.

   "Ending data duplication is my main objective," Ronda Stevens,
Accounting Systems Supervisor at the Diocese of Saint Augustine
stated. She continues, "There will be many opportunities for us to
analyze our work flow and use Microsoft Dynamics GP to streamline many
daily functions."

   Only one of the six member financial team at the Diocese of Saint
Augustine was a trained user on their former JD Edwards solution. When
only one team member can run the company's financial system, day to
day functions become complicated for not only that lone user, but for
the other team members who cannot fully access the system. "Having the
entire fiscal office trained in the Microsoft Dynamics GP system will
be a huge benefit," Stevens said.

   I.B.I.S. Inc., a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner that specializes
in implementing large-scale installations was selected as the 2007
Worldwide Microsoft Dynamics GP Partner of the Year, will implement
the new solution.

   "The Diocese of Saint Augustine needed a full-service financial
solution," said Andy Vabulas, I.B.I.S. CEO. "This includes access to
the expertise they need both before and after implementation. With our
track record of success, and robust Enterprise Resource Planning
solution, Microsoft Dynamics GP, the Diocese of Saint Augustine will
see a dynamic change within their Finance and Accounting
organization."

   About The Diocese of Saint Augustine

encompasses land where Catholicism first touched the shores of North

significant part of the story of the Catholic Church in the United

   Today, the Diocese of St. Augustine embraces 17 counties spanning
the northeast section of Florida from the Gulf of Mexico to the
Atlantic Ocean. It covers 11,032 square miles and serves more than the
164,484 registered Catholics. Please go to www.dosafl.com to read more

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Aug 12 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that Winn-Dixie Stores Inc., one of the
nation's largest food retailers, has consolidated its IT infrastructure
to a System z9 Enterprise Class (z9 EC) mainframe to drive more
efficiency from current business-critical processes and data such as
store operations, finance, human resources and Web content.

    As a longtime mainframe user, Winn-Dixie evaluated the benefits of
consolidating its mainframe operations versus other potential solutions
and found the mainframe with its reliability, security, and expandability
to offer the best total cost of ownership for both the short and long
term.

    Winn-Dixie took delivery of the z9 EC featuring specialty processors --
the System z9 Integrated Information Processor (zIIP) and the Integrated
Facility for Linux (IFL) processor -- and migrated its data and
applications to the new solution. Today, the company is reaping the
benefits of the IBM mainframe with increased business efficiency.

    "Cost was the driving factor in our decision to deploy the IBM System z9
EC," said Charlie Weston, Group Vice President of Information Technology
at Winn-Dixie. "We've cut our operating costs significantly while ensuring
that the z9 has sufficient processor capability to support Winn Dixie for
years to come. The use of the mainframe is integral to our success as we
continue getting better all the time."

    "Winn-Dixie is one of the many System z clients who have told us that the
mainframe helps them attack any TCO challenge. For System z clients and
prospects, TCO stands for 'take costs out,'" said Anne Altman, IBM general
manager, System z.

    Winn-Dixie is using its IFL processors for back-end applications and the
zIIP processors for eligible DB2 for z/OS offload. Taking advantage of
IBM's initiative to drive Linux and other new workloads to the mainframe,
the IBM solution allows Winn-Dixie to run enterprise Linux applications
and databases with current resources, such as PeopleSoft for finance and
human resources, Retalix for grocery retailers and Tomax for scheduling
labor.

    Specifically, Winn-Dixie took advantage of the following IBM benefits to
gain stronger economic returns from their IT infrastructure:


--   IBM DB2 Connect and its Portal Application helps Winn-Dixie avoid
running disparate applications for each business function. The software
provides a central point of entry, higher security and information
integration. A custom-built information "store" combines information from
18 databases to offer its employees a single point of access to critical
information, such as lease and operational information. 
--   IBM DB2 for z/OS as the primary database to capitalize on IBM's New
Application License Charge (NALC) -- a more competitive software pricing
model for new workloads. Also, zIIP specialty engines run eligible DB2 for
z/OS workload, freeing up capacity on the general purpose engines for other
z/OS work. 
--   IBM Global Financing with flexible terms and conditions to consolidate
from two older generation mainframes to the System z9 Enterprise Class.


    
Since Winn-Dixie's initial investment of System z, the company has
also implemented additional resources including an increase in specialty
engines.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aug 12 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Securities said it remained
cautious on the electrical equipment and multi-industry sector
for the next six to nine months as fundamental challenges
around inflation and global credit crisis are likely to depress
growth to below-consensus levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the rising corporate credit cycle and slowing demand
globally, the brokerage expects a more pronounced deterioration
in corporate capital expense trends, a key driver for the
sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage downgraded ITT Corp (ITT.N) to "underweight"
from "neutral," and both Dover Corp (DOV.N) and Tyco
International Ltd (TYC.N) to "neutral" from "overweight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While ITT has been hitting strong quarters recently, the
brokerage said the stock's premium valuation ignores potential
fundamental risks to growth in 2009 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over the past year and year-to-date, the stock has
outperformed the group by nearly 550 basis points, the
brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Dover, the brokerage said the diversified manufacturer's
recent performance has been "stellar." The stock has gained 8
percent year-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "On valuation and sentiment, we acknowledge that Dover is
not expensive, though at a 5 percent discount to the group,
it's no longer "dirt cheap"," the brokerage said in a research
note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan downgraded Tyco, saying it sees more balanced
risks to recently raised 2009 consensus in a challenging
macroeconomic  environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of ITT closed at $67.59, while those of Tyco closed
at $45.15 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. Dover shares
closed at $49.75.

&lt;p&gt;SAN JOSE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Force10 Networks(R), the pioneer in building and securing reliable
networks, today announced that its C-Series family of resilient

   "High performance cluster environments are no longer the exclusive
domain of supercomputing and other research-oriented environments,"
said Sergio Amoni, Director System x Marketing, IBM. "By integrating
the Force10 C-Series with the System x portfolio, we are in a unique
position to extend the value of the solution to a broad array of
enterprise-level customers that require cost-effective, high density
clustering across a wide range of applications."

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details) Aug 12 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Securities
downgraded Wynn Resorts (WYNN.O), a casino chain owner which
also operates prominently in Macau, to "neutral" from
"overweight," on valuation, but upgraded smaller player Penn
National Gaming Inc (PENN.O).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Wynn shares have gained 65 percent since July after the
company posted preliminary second-quarter results, the
brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While we think fundamentals are solid in Macau and Wynn
has an excellent balance sheet with no external financing
issues, we think all of these positives are currently embedded
in the stock's valuation," analyst Joseph Greff said in a note
to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The brokerage said it suspended its end-June 2009 price
target of $115 on Wynn stock but maintained its estimates for
the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wynn shares closed at $114.67 Monday on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan upgraded Penn National to "overweight" from
"neutral," citing its attractive and fully funded development
pipeline, and said the company's strong balance sheet may be
used to boost earnings growth through acquisitions and
greenfield development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said the stock's valuation is inexpensive
with room to expand. It set a price target of $39 on the stock,
which closed at $31.53 Monday on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - As proposed buyouts sweep 
through the drug sector, Pfizer's failure in recent years to 
buy another big rival has surprised many investors, some of 
whom say its too late for a big acquisition to rescue the No. 1 
drugmaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Investors had long expected Pfizer to acquire another large 
drugmaker or sizable biotechnology companies to gain rights to 
new medicines before it loses U.S. patent protection on its 
Lipitor cholesterol fighter in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The hole created by generic forms of Lipitor will be so 
gapingly big that it's hard to argue convincingly for an 
acquisition," said Scott Richter, a portfolio manager with 
Fifth Third Asset Management. He noted that other Pfizer drugs 
will also lose patent protection soon after Lipitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company, which rakes in $13 billion a year for Lipitor, 
also badly needs new products to offset sales declines for 
drugs already facing generic competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, which became the industry leader by buying 
Pharmacia Corp and Warner-Lambert Corp over the past decade, is 
trading at 11-year-lows because its laboratories have failed to 
produce important drugs. Pfizer edged up 1 cent to $19.85 on 
the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Richter said other drugmakers are facing similar problems, 
including a poor record of developing new drugs or getting them 
approved. "So Wall Street would be super-skeptical about the 
success of bringing two problem children together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moreover, Richter said, Pfizer would probably need to 
repatriate many billions of dollars in overseas profits to 
finance a big deal. That would greatly raise its tax rate, he 
cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's inaction has been underscored in recent weeks by 
Roche Holding AG's (ROG.VX) $44 billion offer for all 
outstanding shares of its U.S. partner, Genentech Inc DNA.N, 
and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's (BMY.N) $4.5 billion bid for 
cancer-drug partner ImClone Systems Inc IMCL.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Business development continues to be a focus and is part 
of all of our revenue growth strategies," Pfizer said in a 
statement. "We continue to be selective and diligent on the 
assets we pursue, which is essential to any successful business 
development effort."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it has been focusing on deals in the past 
18 months, including a global licensing deal in April with 
Avant Immunotherapeutics Inc AVAN.O for a promising brain 
cancer treatment in mid-stage trials. "These strategic deals 
add depth to our pipeline and the potential for new, innovative 
medicines," Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, with annual revenue of about $48 billion and a 
market capitalization of $130 billion, would need to buy a 
company with enough revenue "to move the needle," said Chris 
Armbruster, an analyst with Al Frank Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Armbruster said suitors that might make sense are Wyeth 
WYE.N and Biogen Idec Inc (BIIB.O) because of their ample 
size and focus on lucrative biologics -- medicines made in 
living cells that narrowly target disease-causing proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Wyeth and Biogen, with market capitalizations of $57 
billion and $15 billion, respectively, are grappling with big 
recent setbacks for their medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Pfizer can fine-tune their focus and make focused 
acquisitions, but it would be hard to imagine a massive, 
transformational deal," said one investment banker who asked 
not be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Pfizer hasn't done anything wrong; it's not like they 
missed this great 'aha!' moment," the banker said. "It's just a 
long, slow process changing a company of this size in this 
market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another investment banker expressed doubt that mergers and 
acquisitions would turn the tide for Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given their size, they can make any number of small 
acquisitions but that still won't make a meaningful difference 
to their bottom line and research and development pipeline," 
the banker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's not one magic answer for them. It's not like they 
missed doing that one step that would have made all the 
difference. They are so big and so complicated that there's no 
easy solution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jay Markowitz, a research analyst at T. Rowe Price 
Associates, said it will be very hard for Pfizer to deal with 
Lipitor's downturn. "How do you replace $12 billion in 
revenue?" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although big merger deals can provide cost savings and 
other benefits in the short term, he said they typically 
destroy shareholder value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead of going that route, he recommended that Pfizer 
focus instead on "beating the bushes" to acquire small and 
mid-size companies, or promising individual drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He suggested that Pfizer acquire more medicines in 
mid-stage trials -- a point where they are more expensive than 
untested early-stage drugs but far less costly than drugs that 
have already proven their worth in bigger studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is a reluctance to make bets on compounds that still 
have clinical risks," Markowitz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York,

&lt;p&gt;PERTH Aug 12 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp, operator of the
proposed Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) project off Western
Australia, said project partners for Gorgon have secured about
A$1 billion to start preliminary work in tapping one of the
country's biggest gas fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The U.S. energy giant (CVX.N) is hopeful it can secure all
the necessary approvals for the multi-billion dollar project
within 12 months and it will make a final investment decision
after receiving the approvals, Chevron Australia General
Manager Colin Beckett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is a significant amount of money, enough to support our
current project team and 1,200 more people over the next 12
months. We are spending at a considerable rate," Beckett told
Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Gorgon project, which has seen repeated delays due to
environmental issues, could help alleviate tight global LNG
supplies, which are forecast to peak at around 2014-2016 before
new projects come online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron holds a 50 percent stake in the project, while
Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) each
have 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beckett added that Chevron was also meeting with supply
groups over an initial round of contracts worth US$300 million
and it will be issuing further invitations to bid and contracts
that will run into the billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beckett declined to comment on the expected cost of the
proposed 15 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) project, which some
analysts have estimated to cost over $30 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron estimated three years ago that the Gorgon project
would cost about $10 billion. That was when the plant was
proposed to have a smaller production capacity of 10 mtpa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said the venture also plans to build a 300
terajoule per day domestic gas plant onshore that would consume
about 2 million tonnes of gas a year. The plant will be ready
for start-up around the time of the commissioning of the third
LNG processing train.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beckett said the Gorgon venture would not be cutting back
on its LNG production and most of the gas needed for the
domestic gas plant would be sourced separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Gorgon gas fields, first discovered in 1981, have
certified gas reserves of over 40 trillion cubic feet.

&lt;p&gt; (Updates third and fourth paragraphs to include expanded

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG/SEOUL Aug 12 (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) said on
Tuesday it has won a licence to market and trade
over-the-counter derivatives in South Korea, which will broaden
the U.S. bank's product range as the country's securities market
deregulates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The licence enables JPMorgan to deal onshore in
over-the-counter won-denominated derivatives of all asset
classes including equities, interest rates, foreign exchange,
credit and commodities and products. JPMorgan can also act as a
liquidity provider for equity-linked warrants in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan joins 19 domestic firms and nine other foreign
firms with over-the-counter derivatives licences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overseas players include Macquarie (MQG.AX), Citigroup
(C.N), Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX), Merrill Lynch MER.N, Lehman
Bros LEH.N, Nomura Holdings Inc (8604.T), Deutsche Bank
(DBKGn.DE), Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and UBS (UBSN.VX).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Capital Markets Integration Act, which is set to take
effect in February, has raised hopes for further growth in South
Korea's securities market by making it easier for companies to
package and sell derivatives and develop in-house funds.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Aug 14 (Reuters) - UK-based private equity firm
Permira [PERM.UL] said it has tapped a longtime Goldman Sachs
(GS.N) banker as its head for Greater China, becoming the latest
global buyout firm to beef up its presence in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Henry Chen, who spent the last nine years with Goldman sachs,
most recently as co-head of the general industries group for Asia
excluding Japan, will run Permira's office in Hong Kong, which
opened in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Permira, which opened its other Asian office in Tokyo in
2005, has made two deals in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year, Permira struck a deal to pay about 250 billion yen
($2.29 billion) for Japanese agrichemical firm Arysta LifeScience
Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also last year, it paid roughly $840 million for a 20 percent
stake in Macau hotel and casino operator Galaxy Entertainment
Group (0027.HK), which is planning to build the world's
second-largest casino.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While buyout firms are attracted to Asia's high-growth
economies, they have been frustrated by a dearth of opportunities
to buy control of companies in a region where many of the biggest
targets are run by families or governments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In China and elsewhere, private equity firms have typically
settled for minority stakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, global heavyweights are building out their operations
in the region. Earlier this month, U.S. private equity firm
Blackstone Group (BX.N) said it was opening a Beijing office and
hired a former government official as its chief representative
there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Permira advises funds with committed capital of roughly $30
billion.

&lt;p&gt;QUITO (Reuters) - Ecuador is willing to mediate a settlement between Chevron Corp and 30,000 Amazon jungle dwellers suing the oil company for up to $16 billion in environmental damages, the country's top attorney said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peasants and Indians are suing the U.S. company in an Ecuadorean court over charges its Texaco unit polluted the jungle and damaged their health by dumping 18 billion gallons&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;of oil-laden water from 1972 to 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case, which Chevron calls a "judicial farce" plagued by government interference, has dragged on for more than a decade, but the plaintiffs expect a ruling by early next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecuador Inspector General Diego Garcia told Reuters his government could help both parties reach an out-of-court settlement in a case that has spotted the image of the second-largest U.S. petroleum producer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are willing to facilitate an agreement," Garcia said from his Quito office. "We are not part of the process ... the message is that we will only step in as a facilitator if both sides want us to."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both parties have not ruled out a settlement, but experts say a deal is unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs accuse Chevron of pressuring the Ecuadorean government into the case by asking Washington not to renew key trade preference tariffs on the Andean country's products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron is playing dirty politics in Washington to drag the (Ecuadorean) government into the case," said the plaintiffs' attorney, Pablo Fajardo. "However, we are not ruling out a settlement, but that will depend more on Chevron that on us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texaco, bought by Chevron in 2001, denies its operations affected the health of Amazon communities. The company has argued it was released from any liability because it paid $40 million for an environmental cleanup in the 1990s and blames state oil company Petroecuador for much of the pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are open to any conversation, but the government needs to recognize that they have unfulfilled obligations," said Kent Robertson, a Chevron spokesman in California.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - As proposed buyouts sweep 
through the drug sector, Pfizer's failure in recent years to 
buy another big rival has surprised many investors, some of 
whom say its too late for a big acquisition to rescue the No. 1 
drugmaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Investors had long expected Pfizer to acquire another large 
drugmaker or sizable biotechnology companies to gain rights to 
new medicines before it loses U.S. patent protection on its 
Lipitor cholesterol fighter in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The hole created by generic forms of Lipitor will be so 
gapingly big that it's hard to argue convincingly for an 
acquisition," said Scott Richter, a portfolio manager with 
Fifth Third Asset Management. He noted that other Pfizer drugs 
will also lose patent protection soon after Lipitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company, which rakes in $13 billion a year for Lipitor, 
also badly needs new products to offset sales declines for 
drugs already facing generic competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, which became the industry leader by buying 
Pharmacia Corp and Warner-Lambert Corp over the past decade, is 
trading at 11-year-lows because its laboratories have failed to 
produce important drugs. Pfizer edged up 1 cent to $19.85 on 
the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Richter said other drugmakers are facing similar problems, 
including a poor record of developing new drugs or getting them 
approved. "So Wall Street would be super-skeptical about the 
success of bringing two problem children together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moreover, Richter said, Pfizer would probably need to 
repatriate many billions of dollars in overseas profits to 
finance a big deal. That would greatly raise its tax rate, he 
cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's inaction has been underscored in recent weeks by 
Roche Holding AG's (ROG.VX) $44 billion offer for all 
outstanding shares of its U.S. partner, Genentech Inc DNA.N, 
and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's (BMY.N) $4.5 billion bid for 
cancer-drug partner ImClone Systems Inc IMCL.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Business development continues to be a focus and is part 
of all of our revenue growth strategies," Pfizer said in a 
statement. "We continue to be selective and diligent on the 
assets we pursue, which is essential to any successful business 
development effort."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it has been focusing on deals in the past 
18 months, including a global licensing deal in April with 
Avant Immunotherapeutics Inc AVAN.O for a promising brain 
cancer treatment in mid-stage trials. "These strategic deals 
add depth to our pipeline and the potential for new, innovative 
medicines," Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, with annual revenue of about $48 billion and a 
market capitalization of $130 billion, would need to buy a 
company with enough revenue "to move the needle," said Chris 
Armbruster, an analyst with Al Frank Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Armbruster said suitors that might make sense are Wyeth 
WYE.N and Biogen Idec Inc (BIIB.O) because of their ample 
size and focus on lucrative biologics -- medicines made in 
living cells that narrowly target disease-causing proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Wyeth and Biogen, with market capitalizations of $57 
billion and $15 billion, respectively, are grappling with big 
recent setbacks for their medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Pfizer can fine-tune their focus and make focused 
acquisitions, but it would be hard to imagine a massive, 
transformational deal," said one investment banker who asked 
not be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Pfizer hasn't done anything wrong; it's not like they 
missed this great 'aha!' moment," the banker said. "It's just a 
long, slow process changing a company of this size in this 
market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another investment banker expressed doubt that mergers and 
acquisitions would turn the tide for Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given their size, they can make any number of small 
acquisitions but that still won't make a meaningful difference 
to their bottom line and research and development pipeline," 
the banker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's not one magic answer for them. It's not like they 
missed doing that one step that would have made all the 
difference. They are so big and so complicated that there's no 
easy solution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jay Markowitz, a research analyst at T. Rowe Price 
Associates, said it will be very hard for Pfizer to deal with 
Lipitor's downturn. "How do you replace $12 billion in 
revenue?" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although big merger deals can provide cost savings and 
other benefits in the short term, he said they typically 
destroy shareholder value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead of going that route, he recommended that Pfizer 
focus instead on "beating the bushes" to acquire small and 
mid-size companies, or promising individual drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He suggested that Pfizer acquire more medicines in 
mid-stage trials -- a point where they are more expensive than 
untested early-stage drugs but far less costly than drugs that 
have already proven their worth in bigger studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is a reluctance to make bets on compounds that still 
have clinical risks," Markowitz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York,

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Four of Wall Street's biggest investment banks were downgraded on Wednesday by an analyst at Merrill Lynch  Co, who said the global credit crisis has worsened and may prompt investors to try to avoid the carnage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc (C.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N were downgraded to "underperform" and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) was cut to "neutral" by Merrill analyst Guy Moszkowski.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyst also cut his third-quarter and 2008 earnings forecasts and his price targets for the banks, and also for JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N). He maintained a "neutral" rating on JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Conditions have deteriorated significantly from July," Moszkowski wrote. "The typical summer slowdown has been exacerbated by renewed fear over credit, the direction of the economy, and home price depreciation, along with the sudden about-face in the oil price and hedge-fund losses on unusual market patterns."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moszkowski said many investors now find it too difficult to value assets that banks hold. He said this has caused many "to just give up for the time being, pulling in their horns in an attempt to avoid further damage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The downgrades came a day after JPMorgan shares fell 9.5 percent following the bank's surprise disclosure of $1.5 billion of losses this quarter alone stemming from wider yield premiums on mortgage-backed securities and loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had so far sidestepped some of the problems that prompted rivals such as Citigroup, Wachovia Corp WB.N and Merrill itself to raise billions of dollars of capital to shore up their balance sheets. Many financial services companies have also slashed their dividends to preserve capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The reality of the credit crisis isn't over," said Bart DiLiddo, chairman of VectorVest Inc, an Akron, Ohio-based research firm. "The housing market hasn't bottomed yet. These banks aren't going to become real money-makers for a while."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts including Oppenheimer  Co's Meredith Whitney, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc's Michael Mayo and Lehman's Jason Goldberg have also lowered their earnings forecasts for various banks this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Wednesday marked the first day of trading after the expiration of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rule to protect 19 financial services companies by thwarting a form of short selling, a bet that stocks will decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to Wednesday, Moszkowski had rated Goldman and Morgan Stanley "buy," and Citigroup and Lehman "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In afternoon trading, shares of Citigroup were down 62 cents, or 3.3 percent, at $17.92; Goldman fell $1.86, or 1.1 percent, to $165.44; Lehman was down 65 cents, or 4 percent, at $15.56; Morgan Stanley dropped $2.28, or 5.4 percent, to $40.22, and JPMorgan fell 73 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $37.19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Deepa Seetharaman; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - A consortium led by Goldman Sachs (GS.N) has purchased a portfolio of private equity holdings formerly owned by Dutch bank ABN AMRO at a discount, a source familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The portfolio of 21 UK, Dutch and Nordic companies, owned by AAC Capital Partners -- formerly ABN AMRO Capital -- was valued at 700 million euros ($1.05 billion), but bought at a 10 to 20 percent discount to its face value, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal indicates the growing appetite of investors for distressed or discounted assets as the credit crunch is starting to hurt the wider economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's consortium included Alpinvest and the Canada Pension Plan, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consortium also injected another 450 million euros ($673.9 million) in AAC Capital Partners for a new northern Europe buy-out fund, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABN AMRO was sold to a consortium of three banks last year and its new owners -- Banco Santander (SAN.MC), Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) and Fortis FOR.BR -- have injected 500 million euros in the fund, bringing the total to about 1 billion euros, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal said on Wednesday a consortium led by Goldman Sachs had agreed to pay about $1.5 billion for a number of ABN AMRO's private equity assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Belgian-Dutch financial services group Fortis said that together with Britain's Royal Bank of Scotland Group and Santander, it had sold a number of ABN AMRO private equity assets to a Goldman Sachs-led consortium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, a Fortis spokeswoman said the assets sold were in companies located in Scandinavia, Britain and the Netherlands, but declined to give any further details on the transaction.

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Defense Coalition: Chevron Rebukes Own Washington Lobbyist for Embarrassing Comments on Ecuador Legal Case

    Suggested U.S. Government Shouldn't Allow "Little Countries" To
                   "Screw Around" With Big Companies
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
With pressure mounting from a major environmental lawsuit in
Ecuador, Chevron has publicly rebuked one of its Washington lobbyists
who had suggested "little countries" like Ecuador shouldn't be allowed
by the U.S. government to "screw around" with large companies by
letting lawsuits proceed against them in foreign courts.

   The anonymous lobbyist was quoted in a Newsweek article about
Chevron's high-pressure campaign in Congress to cut Ecuador's trade
preferences for allowing the lawsuit to proceed in Ecuador's courts. A
court-appointed Special Master in Ecuador recently submitted a
4,000-page study that found that Chevron faces a liability of up to
$16.3 billion for dumping 18.5 billion gallons of toxic waste into
Amazon waterways, causing an outbreak of cancers and the decimation of
five indigenous groups.

   Scientific experts have called the area of the rainforest where
Texaco (now Chevron) operated from 1964 to 1990 the "Amazon
Chernobyl". Ironically, much of the evidence of contamination relied
on by the Special Master - which includes tens of thousands of
sampling results verified by independent laboratories -- was provided
by Chevron's technical team from sites that had been operated
exclusively by the company.

   For nine years Chevron's lawyers had pressed a U.S. federal judge
in New York, where the case was originally filed, to send the matter
to Ecuador over the objections of the plaintiffs. When the U.S. judge
granted Chevron's motion in 2002, the company voluntarily submitted
itself to jurisdiction in Ecuador and is likely bound by any ruling.

   According to the Newsweek article - titled "A $16 Billion Problem"
and written by Michael Isikoff - once the damages assessment became
known Chevron hired a team of A-list Washington lobbyists to "squeeze"
Ecuador by convincing Congress to cut free trade preferences for the
four Andean nations (Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia). The trade
preferences expire on December 31 unless Congress votes to extend
them.

   Newsweek reported that Chevron's lobbying team on the issue
includes Wayne Berman, national finance director of the McCain
campaign, former Senators Trent Lott and John Breaux, and Mac McLarty,
who served as Chief of Staff in the Clinton White House.

   In a letter to Newsweek signed by Dave Samson, Chevron's General
Manager for Public Affairs, the company said "comments attributed to
an unnamed lobbyist working for Chevron do not reflect our company's
view regarding the Ecuador case. They were not approved by the company
and will not be tolerated."

   The comment by Chevron's lobbyist was blasted by an indigenous
leader in Ecuador, who accused the company of trying to undermine the
rule of law.

   "We believe that the arrogance reflected in the anonymous comment
accurately reflects a pervasive attitude within Chevron's culture that
led to the destruction of our precious rainforest," said Humberto
Piaguaje, a leader of the Secoya indigenous group.

   The comment also "confirms how Chevron cares little for the rule
of law in any country where it might be held accountable, be it
Ecuador or the U.S.," he added. "No court that actually hears the
evidence appears to be good enough for Chevron."

   Leaders of the 80 communities and five indigenous groups behind
the lawsuit plan to travel to Washington, DC in September to meet with
members of Congress and the U.S. Trade Representative. The leaders
have accused Berman of misleading Congress by claiming a release
Chevron received in 1995 from Ecuador's government covers private
claims of the sort being used in the current lawsuit, when in fact it
does not.

   No court in either the U.S. or Ecuador ever has accepted Chevron's
expansive interpretation of the release.

   Indigenous leaders also charge that Chevron's so-called
remediation (for which the limited release was given before any work
was actually done) covered less than 1% of the actual damage and in
any event simply amounted to dumping dirt over open waste pits.
Chevron's remedial work has been the subject of a fraud investigation
in Ecuador.

   "Not a single court in the world ever has agreed with Chevron's
interpretation of this release, but that has not stopped Chevron's
lobbying team from playing judge and jury to the U.S. Congress," said
Pablo Fajardo, the Ecuadorian lawyer for the plaintiffs.

Amazon region. The mission of the Coalition is to protect the

&lt;p&gt;Sheraton Hotels in Five U.S. Cities Debut Microsoft Surface,
  Putting a Virtual Concierge and Unique Entertainment Experiences at

WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. and REDMOND, Wash.--(Business Wire)--
Sheraton Hotels &amp; Resorts and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT)
today introduced an entirely new hotel guest experience with its debut
of Microsoft Surface, Microsoft's first commercially available surface
computer. Featuring easy-to-use technology and a natural way of
accessing information, Surface units will be placed in the lobbies of
select Sheraton hotels in Boston, Chicago, New York, San Francisco and
Seattle. Microsoft Surface breaks down the traditional barriers
between people and technology, providing simple and instant access to
information and entertainment. Sheraton will be the first hotel to
offer Microsoft Surface, creating a new Sheraton brand experience that
will bring interaction, connectivity and a social setting to the
lobby, providing guests with an entirely new way to explore local
tourist highlights and enhance their hotel stay.

   Microsoft Surface is a 30-inch display in a table-like form factor
that several guests can use simultaneously. The intuitive user
interface works without a traditional mouse or keyboard, allowing
people to interact with content and information in a more natural and
familiar way, by using their hands and gestures. Sheraton will unveil
Surface today at five hotels: Sheraton Boston Hotel, Sheraton Chicago
Hotel &amp; Towers, Sheraton New York Hotel &amp; Towers, Sheraton Gateway San
Francisco Airport Hotel and Sheraton Seattle Hotel.

   With each unit, Sheraton is offering a customized version of the
Microsoft Surface developed suite of applications to provide
entertainment and information about local attractions. Surface, and
these unique applications, are designed to serve the needs of the
brand's core guests who are social individuals seeking to share the
travel experience with each other. The placement of the Surface units
in Sheraton lobbies enables guests to leverage and experience the
offerings in a social way.

         based digital jukebox, enabling guests to create personal
         music playlists by choosing selections from Sheraton's
         exclusive offering of Sony BMG artists, including John

president for Sheraton. "We are proud to partner with Microsoft to
offer the groundbreaking Microsoft Surface product, which will enable
our guests to stay informed, connected and entertained while
traveling."

   "We're excited to be working with Sheraton in its efforts to
feature innovation and redefine the guest experience in its hotel
properties," said Pete Thompson, general manager, Microsoft Surface.
"Surface takes a common activity, such as looking up information about
a local city, and transforms it into an intuitive and social way for
hotel guests to plan their visit. We believe this is just the
beginning of how Surface will completely change the hotel guest
experience."

&lt;p&gt;Buena Vista Concerts and Walt Disney Records Announce the Launch of The Cheetah Girls One World Tour

     Multi-Platinum Recording Artists Embark on 50-City Nationwide
                             Concert Tour
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Disney's multi-platinum recording group The Cheetah Girls
(Adrienne Bailon, Sabrina Bryan and Kiely Williams) will launch their
nationwide "The Cheetah Girls One World Tour" this Fall. The 50-date
nationwide concert tour follows the soundtrack and third Disney
Channel Original Movie, "The Cheetah Girls One World." The tour
embarks October 8 in Austin, Texas and concludes in San Diego,
California on December 21. Most tickets go on sale Saturday, August 23
at 10:00 a.m. through Ticketmaster and online at
CheetahGirls.AEGLIVE.com but check your local venue's information.

   "The Cheetah Girls One World" premieres Friday, August 22 as part
of the hugely successful Disney Channel Original Movie franchise. Its
soundtrack features 12 hip-hop, R, Indian-influenced tracks
performed by the tween superstars. The movie's anthem song and the
soundtrack's lead single, "One World" will be featured in The Cheetah
Girls' set, along with favorites from the first two movies and
soundtracks.

   The Cheetah Girls began as a 2003 Disney Channel Original Movie
based on the best-selling book series for kids and tweens written by
award-winning author Deborah Gregory (Jump at the Sun/Hyperion Books
for Children). Within two years of the movie's debut, the group gained
a large fan base, topped the soundtrack charts with a double-platinum
soundtrack and enjoyed a highly-rated DVD release. In 2006, "The
Cheetah Girls 2" made its debut and was the #1 basic cable movie among
Kids 6-11 and Tweens 9-14. The soundtrack entered in the top ten on
The Billboard 200, topped the soundtrack chart and was certified
platinum.

   Following the success of The Cheetah Girls 2 soundtrack and movie,
the group embarked on their first national tour that grossed $26
million over 86 concert dates, broke tour merchandise records,
and helped set a new record for the largest sales in the history
of the Houston Rodeo in 2007 with an impressive 73,200 tickets sold
(a record previously held by Brooks &amp; Dunn).

   Here are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog:

   Exxon: Defensive Play with Growth

   We are maintaining our Buy recommendation and price objective on
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) shares following the company's
strong second-quarter results. The company performed strongly in the
upstream business, earning $10 billion during the quarter, reaping the
benefits of high commodity prices.

   Exxon also remained active in returning capital to shareholders
during the quarter, paying out over $10 billion through share
repurchases and dividend payments. We continue to like the company for
its best-in-class upstream business, a chemicals business that is
fully integrated with its quality refining assets, an exceptionally
strong balance sheet rated AAA, and a track record of returning
significant capital to shareholders.

   MBIA a Sell on Rating Downgrades

   Following two quarters of heavy losses, MBIA Inc. (NYSE: MBI)
posted positive results for 2Q08 driven by $3.3 billion in pretax
unrealized gains on insured credit derivatives.

   However, ratings downgrades by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's
should impact MBI's asset management business and its ability to write
new insurance business. We believe that resumption of share repurchase
program, suspended a year ago, will provide some support to the
shares. But until the global credit markets stabilize, we expect
continued whipsawing of the financial markets for the rest of 2008,
and perhaps into 2009.

   Universal Forest with Headwinds

   Universal Forest Products, Inc. (Nasdaq: UFPI) reported second
quarter earnings of $0.61 per share versus $0.86 per share in the
prior-year quarter, due to ongoing weakness in the lumber market and
weak consumer spending. However, UFPI remains on track for market
share gains in the industrial unit and among the big box retailers.
Market share gains are critical to offset the slowing sales growth
related to housing.

   We expect a continued drop in housing starts and home equity
withdrawal to negatively impact building product sales to the
site-built and retail channels. We reiterate our Hold recommendation
on shares of UFPI with a target price of $28.50.

   Philippine Telecom a Buy to $72

   As the leading provider of telecom services (both fixed line and
wireless) in the Philippines, Philippine Long Distance Telephone
Company (NYSE: PHI) stands to benefit from the positive networking
effect of the largest subscriber base in the country. The company
continues to generate substantial free cash flow enabling higher cash
dividend payout and acquisitions.

   It has successfully reduced its total debt balance from $3.80
billion in 2002 to $1.5 billion as of June 2008. Consolidated Net Debt
is down to $782 million. Smart Communications, the company's wireless
subsidiary, continues to maintain its position in terms of subscriber
base and profitability. Wireless subscribers by the end of June 2008
stood at over 33.2 million. However, rising fuel and food prices could
unfavorably affect revenue growth rate as these compete with telecom
services for a share of consumer expenditure.

   United Nat'l Foods Nicely Priced

   United Natural Foods Inc. (Nasdaq: UNFI) continues to experience
broad-based revenue growth and stable-to-improving operating margins
ex one-time items. Benefiting from the positive trends in the natural
foods industry and improved distribution capacity, the company is
expected to continue to grow in terms of sales.

   United Natural Foods is well positioned to deliver consistent
double-digit topline growth in fiscal 2008. The near-tern earnings
dilution from the Millbrook acquisition has created a valuation-based
buying opportunity. The Buy rating is maintained.

&lt;p&gt;Kizomba C Fields Expected to Produce 200,000 Barrels of Oil Per
                                  Day
IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) announced today that its
subsidiary, Esso Exploration Angola (Block 15) Limited (Esso Angola),
has started production from the Saxi and Batuque fields as part of the
development progression of the Kizomba C project.

   Combined with a third Kizomba C field, Mondo, which came on stream
in January, the project is anticipated to reach a total production
rate of 200,000 barrels of oil per day later this year. The Kizomba C
development is designed to produce a total of approximately 600
million barrels of oil over the life of the three producing fields,
which are located approximately 90 miles (145 kilometers) off the
coast of Angola in water depths of nearly 2,400 feet (800 meters).

   The Kizomba C development includes two floating production,
storage, and offloading (FPSO) vessels and 36 subsea wells, making it
the largest subsea development operated by an ExxonMobil affiliate
worldwide. The twin FPSO vessels are the fourth and fifth production
hubs on Block 15, following Xikomba in 2003, Kizomba A in 2004, and
Kizomba B in 2005. Total Block 15 production is expected to total
approximately 700,000 barrels a day when the Saxi and Batuque fields
reach peak production.

   "This is another example of integrating ExxonMobil's project
management capabilities with developing Angolan businesses and
suppliers to deliver exceptional value," said Mark Albers, senior vice
president of Exxon Mobil Corporation. "The timely and cost-efficient
development of this resource provides additional production to help
meet the world's growing energy demand. Working closely with Sonangol,
we have reached another milestone in developing Angola's significant
petroleum resources in a manner that maximizes the value of the
resource for Angola, co-venturers, and our shareholders."

   Nearly $1.5 billion has been spent on local goods and services for
Kizomba C, including contracts for in-country fabrication, logistics
support, and training and development of Angolan personnel. Angolan
participation in the project has increased significantly over time as
local companies, working with ExxonMobil and Esso Angola, have
developed their capabilities to perform the work required for such
complex projects.

   The Saxi and Batuque start-up follow other ExxonMobil projects
which started producing in 2008: Kizomba C Mondo (Angola), Volve
(Norway), Starling (UK), ACG Phase 3 (Azerbaijan), and East Area
Natural Gas Liquids II (Nigeria).

   With global energy demand growing, and new supplies increasingly
found far from the world's major consuming nations, Kizomba C and
these other new projects are vital additions to an increasingly
interdependent global energy supply network.

   In addition to Esso Angola (operator, 40 percent), other
co-venturers in Block 15 are BP Exploration (Angola) Limited (26.67
percent), ENI Angola Exploration B.V. (20 percent) and Statoil Angola
Block 15 A.S. (13.33 percent). Sonangol is the Concessionaire.

   CAUTIONARY STATEMENT: Estimates, expectations, and business plans
in this release are forward-looking statements. Actual future results,
including resource recoveries, production rates, and project plans and
schedules, could differ materially due to changes in market conditions
affecting the oil and gas industry or long-term oil and gas price
levels; political or regulatory developments; reservoir performance;
timely completion of development projects; technical or operating
factors; and other factors discussed under the heading "Factors
Affecting Future Results" in the Investor Information section of our
website (www.exxonmobil.com) and in Item 1A of our most recent Form
10-K. References to "resources", "barrels of oil", and similar terms
include quantities of oil and gas that are not yet classified as
proved reserves but that we believe will be produced in the future.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, adds comments from Credit Suisse analyst
(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) was downgraded to "hold"
from "buy" by Deutsche Bank analyst Mike Mayo, who said the
largest U.S. securities firm was not immune to capital market
pressures, especially given its exposure to weaker European
growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares were down $7.06 at $170.94 in morning trade
on the New York Stock Exchange. They have lost more than 17
percent of their value since the start of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman earns a fourth of its revenue from the euro zone
and UK, and the expected slowdown in the regions mean the
firm's non-U.S. business is not as strong as before, Mayo said.
Deutsche's European economics team believes both regions are or
will soon be in recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also has among the highest exposures to equities
during a period of more significant equity market declines,
including areas of expansion such as China, Mayo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result is likely to be weaker-than-expected earnings,
the analyst added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Recent weakness in terms of equity underwriting, equities
trading and private equity was hitting Goldman at its core
strength, Mayo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He expects Goldman to "trade at a discount to its five-year
average multiple given cyclical headwinds, the deteriorating
credit environment, below average return on equity and newer
regulatory uncertainty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oppenheimer  Co's influential analyst Meredith Whitney
said as Goldman's revenue is more equity-linked than its broker
peers, the fact that broad global equity market indices are all
down double-digits will have a meaningful effect on the
company's earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit Suisse analyst Susan Katzke said market conditions
remain challenging, more so this quarter, with capital markets
volumes, volatility and asset prices reflecting incremental
slowing in global GDP growth and growth prospects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All three analysts cut their third-quarter and full-year
profit forecast for Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage actions on Goldman and an announcement by
JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) that it has lost $1.5 billion in the
third quarter so far sent most of the financial stocks down on
Tuesday, with the SP 500 Financial Index .GSPF falling 8.08
points to 291.49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The MSCI global index .MIWD00000PUS, which has lost
almost 15 percent year-to-date, was down 2.02 points at 342.45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THIRD-QUARTER, 2008 ESTIMATES CUT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the third quarter will not be terrible on a relative
basis, it could still be one of Goldman's worst as a public
company, and the favorable tailwinds the firm has experienced,
compared with the industry, may no longer be as strong as
before, Mayo wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman is no longer as much in the right place at the
right time, at least compared to the past year," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mayo cut his third-quarter profit estimate for the firm to
$2.40 a share from $3.25 and his 2008 estimate to $14.60 a
share from $16.25. He cut his price target on the stock to $192
from $209.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In June, Goldman had posted an 11 percent fall in
second-quarter earnings as market turmoil hit trading and
slowed investment banking, but the firm topped expectations by
avoiding major losses on assets slammed by the credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whitney also cut her third-quarter earnings estimate for
Goldman to $2.15 a share from $3.54 and 2008 estimate to $14.32
a share from $15.75.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst said main drivers behind the estimate cuts were
customer volumes, overall weak global equity markets, and weak
advisory and underwriting revenues of the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit Suisse's Katzke said Goldman's third quarter may be
weaker than forecast, but added that she expects it to remain
better than peer group performance, with the firm best
positioned to profit in a recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Katzke cut her third-quarter profit estimate for the firm
to $2.15 a share from $3.75 and 2008 view to $14.50 a share
from $18.50. She lowered her price target range on the stock to
between $225 and $250 from a range of $250 to $275.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Ramya Dilip in Bangalore; Editing by Himani

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) said it
has racked up $1.5 billion of losses so far this quarter on
mortgage-linked assets, reflecting deepening turmoil in credit
markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Shares of the third-largest U.S. bank by assets fell 9.5
percent, as investors grew increasingly disappointed with a
bank that had largely sidestepped the worst of the credit
crunch, and analysts cut their profit estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has kept JPMorgan profitable
even as rivals such as Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Merrill Lynch 
Co MER.N posted a series of multi-billion dollar quarterly
losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If you're a huge global trading house, it's very hard to
hide from the devastation," said Steve Persky, chief executive
at Dalton Investments in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's shares fell as the broader financial sector
dropped. Lehman Brothers LEH.N fell 12 percent to $16.21,
while Bank of America Corp, (BAC.N) Citigroup, and Goldman
Sachs (GS.N) all fell more than 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan revealed the losses in a regulatory filing late
Monday. The bank said trading conditions have "substantially
deteriorated" in the third quarter, and mortgage-backed
securities and loans have weakened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York-based bank also has substantial exposure to
credit cards and other consumer debt that looks increasingly
vulnerable as the U.S. economy grows slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Financial Times said JPMorgan was under pressure to
write down mortgage assets, in part because of Merrill's
decision to sell $30.6 billion of repackaged debt to a private
equity fund at 22 cents on the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As of June 30, JPMorgan held $19.5 billion of prime and
Alt-A mortgage exposure, $1.9 billion of subprime mortgage
exposure, and $11.6 billion of commercial mortgage-backed
securities (CMBS) exposure, the filing showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These mortgage exposures could be adversely affected by
worsening market conditions, further deterioration in the
housing market and market activity reflecting distressed
sellers," JPMorgan said. Loss estimates exclude hedging, it
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trading results could also be hit if the bank's own debt
became more valuable. That could theoretically make it more
expensive to buy back its own debt, resulting in an accounting
charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Richard Bove at Ladenburg Thalmann argued that
JPMorgan's difficulties raised questions about the reason for
the bank's current mix of businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, formed through a series of acquisitions over the
last decade, was supposed to have consumer banking and capital
markets businesses that complemented each other: when one was
doing poorly, the other was supposed to be doing well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Unfortunately, the first time this concept was tested, it
did not work. Both (businesses) seem to be declining in tandem
with each other," Bove wrote in a note to clients. Bove cut his
estimates for the bank's earnings for 2008 through 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank did return calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan shares fell $3.97, or 9.5 percent, to $37.92 on
the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CAUTIOUS OUTLOOK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, JPMorgan posted a smaller-than-expected 53
percent decline in quarterly earnings on resilient stock and
bond underwriting revenue but cautioned that the mortgage
market and the economy were getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the filing, JPMorgan said that it expected continued
credit deterioration in its consumer portfolio, requiring more
reserves for losses, during the rest of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also said home equity charge-offs could keep rising this
year, while prime and subprime mortgage net charge-offs would

deteriorate, additional markdowns may be necessary," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman Brothers Inc analysts on Tuesday cut their 2008
profit forecast for JPMorgan to $2.30 a share from $2.60, but
kept an "overweight" rating and $50 share price target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Dan Wilchins in Washington; additional

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and JPMorgan 
Chase  Co (JPM.N) agreed to buy back billions of dollars of 
illiquid auction-rate securities and pay fines to settle 
charges that they misled investors about the debt's risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The banks are the third and fourth to reach auction-rate 
settlements with New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, 
joining Citigroup Inc (C.N) and UBS AG (UBSN.VX), which settled 
last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley agreed to buy back $4.5 billion of debt and 
pay a $35 million fine, while JPMorgan agreed to buy back $3 
billion of debt and pay a $25 million fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regulators say brokerages misled investors into believing 
that auction-rate debt, which has rates that reset in periodic 
auctions, was safe and the equivalent of cash. Much of the $330 
billion market has been frozen since February, when brokerages 
abandoned their traditional role as buyers of last resort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You have hundreds of thousands of people being caught in a 
financial nightmare," Cuomo said at a news conference 
announcing the settlements. "I believe we have crossed the 
Rubicon and established the premise that the investors will be 
helped. The nightmare will end."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup and UBS agreed to buy back a combined $26 billion 
of the debt and pay $250 million in fines. Other banks are also 
being examined in what Cuomo called an "industrywide" probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, UBS was the target Thursday of a lawsuit by New 
Hampshire securities regulators, who said the Swiss bank misled 
the state's student loan agency about auction-rate debt, 
resulting in less money available to help college students.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BAD PUBLICITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley will buy back its auction-rate debt from 
retail customers, charities and small to mid-sized businesses 
by December 11, while JPMorgan will do so by November 12. Both 
will reimburse customers who sold debt at a loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said its buyback may result in a $400 million 
pretax charge. Its settlement also covers debt sold by the 
former Bear Stearns Cos, which JPMorgan acquired in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thursday's settlements may add to pressure on Merrill Lynch 
 Co MER.N, Wachovia Corp WB.N, and other companies that 
sold auction-rate securities, to settle with regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The publicity is already bad enough for these banks," said 
Joseph Gordon, president of Gordon Asset Management LLC in 
Durham, North Carolina. "There is no incentive to drag it out 
and run up legal bills."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was not part of 
the Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan settlements, unlike the 
Citigroup and UBS settlements, but said its investigation into 
the auction-rate debt market was continuing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Under the SEC's longstanding policy, it's better for 
everyone when harmed investors get their money back before 
investigations are completed," SEC spokesman John Nester said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was not immediately clear how investors who bought 
now-illiquid auction-rate debt from discount brokerages or 
mutual fund companies would be treated.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WACHOVIA, MERRILL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wachovia may be close to an accord with regulators relating 
to $9.5 billion of auction-rate debt, according to Ryan Hobart, 
a spokesman for Missouri Secretary of State Robin Carnahan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, Wachovia set aside $500 million of reserves for 
a possible auction-rate settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill, meanwhile, has offered to buy back as much as $12 
billion of the debt but has not settled with regulators. Cuomo 
called the offer "a good thing" but said it wasn't enough. He 
said he has had talks with Merrill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wachovia spokeswoman Christy Phillips-Brown and Merrill 
spokesman Mark Herr declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) declined to address a report 
in the Wall Street Journal that it is refusing to buy back 
auction-rate debt from its wealthy clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spokeswoman Andrea Raphael said Goldman "has been working 
with clients to address their liquidity needs" and is 
cooperating with regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Thursday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares 
of Morgan Stanley closed up 49 cents at $40.64, while JPMorgan 
rose 90 cents to $37.81.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Joan Gralla, Martha Graybow, Grant

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has taken various rating actions on the CWALT Alt-A
RMBS transaction listed below:

   --Series 2006-36CB.

   This transaction had previous rating actions published within a
week.

   The rating actions reflect the upgrade of two super-senior classes
which, upon a subsequent review of all super-seniors, were determined
to be particularly sensitive to Fitch's cashflow assumption that the
servicer will not advance on defaulted loans in the month of
liquidation. While Fitch uses a five-year mortgage default curve to
assess the risk of a bond default for Alt-A super-seniors, shortfalls
from liquidations without servicer advancing were projected to result
in unrecovered principal under an 'AAA' stress at deal maturity for
some super-senior classes despite having maintained credit protection
at the end of the stressed five-year mortgage default period. Today's
rating revisions consider those classes' sensitivity to that
particular cashflow assumption. The two super-senior classes upgraded
reverted to their initial 'AAA' rating.

   A spreadsheet detailing Fitch's rating actions on the transactions
in question is available on the Fitch Ratings web site at
www.fitchratings.com under the following headers:

   Structured Finance then RMBS then Special Reports

   The rating actions taken today reflect Fitch's analysis of
expected default and loss from delinquent loans, in addition to
projected losses from the currently performing pool. Fitch generates
its expectations using its ResiLogic default and loss model. These
expectations are adjusted based on actual performance to-date versus
model projected performance. The model incorporates the impact of
historical home price movements on mortgage performance, in addition
to projecting further stress for many regions of the U.S. The model
also reflects the demonstrated high default rates for loans that
exhibit risk-layering.

   Fitch is nearing completion of its review of the 2005-2007 Alt-A
transactions. This review was completed in two separate phases. The
first phase reviewed all mezzanine and subordinated bonds. The second
phase, which is nearly completed, reviewed the senior bonds that, in
many instances, required additional cash flow analysis to evaluate the
risk of the various individual classes within the senior tranche. Most
notably, the use of super-senior structures was considered in
evaluating senior bonds.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs slashed its forecast on gold prices on Thursday, citing overvalued bullion and expected strength of the dollar against major currencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. brokerage said it lowered its 3-month gold outlook to $745 an ounce from its previous view of $890 an ounce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The US dollar has recently begun to show initial signs of strength as the fundamental picture for the dollar has improved substantially in recent weeks," Goldman told clients in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said that according to its model, gold had overshot its fair value over the past few weeks and the metal is now trading near its price estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also cut its gold forecast to $810 from $905 on a 6-month basis, and to $740 from $810 on a 12-month basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dollar has recently soared against the euro -- which fell below $1.48 to its weakest level since February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the price of gold has tumbled in the past 30 days. It traded at $812 an ounce on Thursday, sharply below its recent high of $987.75 set on July 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A higher greenback makes dollar-denominated gold more expensive for investors holding other currencies. Gold is also used as a hedge against the falling U.S. dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday, UBS investment Bank also cut its one-month gold forecast by 15 percent to $850 an ounce from $1,000 an ounce, citing improving risk appetite, stronger equities and a firmer dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last November, Goldman told investors to sell gold in 2008 to take advantage of the falling prices as the dollar steadied, and it named the strategy as one of its top 10 tips for this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Frank Tang; Editing by Christian Wiessner)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stabilizing U.S. economic growth, falling oil prices and a deteriorating outlook outside the United States have led Goldman Sachs to abandon its ten-year bearish stance on the U.S. dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a research note on Thursday, the largest U.S. investment bank said the dollar's long-term downtrend has ended and its undervaluation could lead to a substantial improvement in the U.S. balance of payments position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is time to say goodbye to our long-held dollar bearish stance. For about 10 years we have been negative on the dollar, occasionally wrong but mostly right," Goldman Sachs wrote in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But now the valuation and growth-driven improvements that we have been observing for a while have reached the point where they notably improve the medium to long-term outlook for the dollar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It added, however, the dollar could still face some challenges in the near term such as market positioning, volatility in oil prices and weaker U.S. consumer spending. But the "powerful improvements in the real trade balance suggest the dollar has bottomed." The bank expects capital inflows to start improving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman revised its forecasts for several U.S. dollar pairings. It now sees the euro falling to $1.45 in three months, compared with estimates of $1.56. The euro should drop further to $1.40 over the next 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, the euro traded a near-six-month low at $1.4779, according to Reuters data. The dollar has gained more than 5 percent against the euro so far this month, reaching its highest since February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On dollar/yen, the bank said it forecasts the pair hitting 110 yen in three months from its original estimate of 106. Over the course of one year, Goldman said the dollar should rise to 114 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A big part of Goldman's change in stance on the dollar was the more widespread weakness in economies outside the United States, which has led to sizable interest rate differentials in the greenback's favor. Interest rate markets have priced in rate cuts for major central banks, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, which should diminish their currencies' appeal to global investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from rate differentials, Goldman said the U.S. economy is finally adjusting favorably to an undervalued dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The impact of valuation has become much clearer and more powerful -- increasing our confidence that strong, underlying forces will lead to continued improvement in dollar fundamentals in the next couple of years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It added that a strong U.S. export performance and signs of growing inflows from mergers and acquisitions should clearly boost the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About other currencies, Goldman said it has become more upbeat on the outlook for the Brazilian real and Mexican peso.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Certainly the growth story in Brazil and firm balance of payments surplus should allow the currency to shrug off the broader U.S. dollar strength," said Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Kenneth Barry)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Biotechnology company ImClone Systems Inc, which rebuffed a $60-per-share takeover offer from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N), said on Thursday it hired JP Morgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) as its financial adviser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan will help ImClone IMCL.O study Bristol's offer in more detail, and weigh a possible plan to split ImClone into two businesses, sources familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formal talks between ImClone and Bristol have not yet begun, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan and Bristol declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, ImClone rejected as too low Bristol's offer to acquire the shares of ImClone it did not already own in a deal that valued the company at $5.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ImClone, meanwhile, said its board had been discussing the possibility of separating its Erbitux cancer treatment business and its drug-development pipeline operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erbitux is approved for colorectal and head and neck cancer in the United States and Canada, while a recent approval for the drug in Japan and new lung cancer data are expected to drive sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ImClone said it believed the pipeline business "may be extremely valuable and significantly increase stockholder value as a separate business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activist investor Carl Icahn, chairman of ImClone and a large shareholder of the company, had said he opposed Bristol-Myers' offer because he believes it "greatly undervalues the company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also up for debate is an ImClone antibody, IMC-11F8, that is under development. If approved for sale, ImClone has said the antibody "might have a significant competitive effect on Erbitux," and Bristol-Myers may have no rights to market that product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bristol previously termed its offer for ImClone "full and fair" and said it believed it has rights to the follow-on drug to Erbitux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ImClone shares fell 25 cents to $63.70 on Nasdaq, while Bristol gained 11 cents to $22.09 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Toni Clarke and Jessica Hall; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Maureen Bavdek)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase to Settle with State Securities Regulators and Offer to Purchase Certain Customers' Auction Rate Securities

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. ("JPMorgan Chase") announced today that, as part of the
Firm's ongoing commitment to the its customers and as part of an agreement in
principle to settle investigations by the New York State Attorney General's
Office and the Office of Financial Regulation of the State of Florida (on behalf
of the North American Securities Administrators Association ("NASAA")), it will
offer to purchase at par auction rate securities ("ARS") that are held by
individual customers and certain charities and small-to-medium-sized businesses
and that were purchased through the Firm prior to February 12, 2008. In addition
to announcing its agreement with the state securities regulators, JPMorgan Chase
acknowledges the important role that the Securities and Exchange Commission
("SEC") has played in helping to resolve the unprecedented liquidity issues that
arose earlier this year in connection with these securities. JPMorgan Chase has
informed the SEC of its agreement with the states and continues to fully
cooperate with the SEC's ongoing investigation.

The offer will cover an estimated $3 billion in ARS. JPMorgan Chase will offer
to purchase at par all ARS held by its individual customers (other than the
Firm's financial advisors and registered representatives and current and former
senior management), as well as by those charities and small-to-medium-sized
businesses with account values and household values of no more than $10 million
(collectively, "individual customers") that were purchased through J.P. Morgan
Securities Inc., Chase Investment Services Corp. or Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. Inc.
prior to February 12, 2008, for ARS where auctions have failed to clear since
February 12, 2008. The Firm will purchase the ARS that are tendered under the
program on or before November 12, 2008.

Based on current market conditions and on assumptions about the rate at which
individual customers will tender securities, the Firm's preliminary estimate of
the difference between the aggregate purchase price and market value of the
securities it purchases under the program will be in the range of approximately
$400 million on a pre-tax basis. The actual figure may vary significantly from
this preliminary estimate and will depend, among other things, on market
conditions and the amount of securities purchased.

Additional settlement terms include the following:

    --  JPMorgan Chase will compensate individual customers who purchased ARS
        through the Firm prior to Feb. 12, 2008, and sold such securities at a
        loss between that date and the date of this announcement.

    --  To the extent that an individual customer has incurred consequential
        damages beyond the loss of liquidity in the individual customer's
        holdings of ARS or loss based on a sale at less than par, JPMorgan Chase
        will participate in a special arbitration process that the individual
        customer may elect, and that will be overseen by FINRA, whereby JPMorgan
        Chase will not (solely for the purpose of the individual arbitrations)
        contest liability for any alleged misrepresentations and omissions
        concerning the ARS, but may challenge the existence or amount of any
        consequential damages; the arbitration claim will be heard by a single,
        non-industry arbitrator.

    --  JPMorgan Chase will continue to use its best efforts to provide
        liquidity solutions for its institutional investor base, including
        continuing to work with issuers and other interested parties on capital
        markets solutions, financing options and market liquidity, with the goal
        of resolving institutional investor customers' liquidity concerns no
        later than the end of 2009. JPMorgan Chase will periodically advise the
        New York State Attorney General and the NASAA of its progress in
        identifying market solutions for institutional investors.

    --  JPMorgan Chase will refund refinancing fees that JPMorgan Chase has
        received from municipal ARS issuers that issued ARS in the primary
        market through JPMorgan Chase between August 1, 2007 and February 12,
        2008, and refinanced those securities through JPMorgan Chase after
        February 12, 2008.

    --  JPMorgan Chase will pay a $25 million penalty.

    --  JPMorgan Chase neither admits nor denies allegations of wrongdoing.

&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto Networks Discovers Two Vulnerabilities in This Week's Microsoft Security Bulletin

    Brings Total Microsoft Vulnerability Discoveries to Five in 12
                                Months
SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Palo Alto Networks today announced that its Threat Research Team
discovered two of the 11 vulnerabilities discovered in Microsoft's
Patch Tuesday security bulletin this week.

   The first discovery is an Internet Explorer vulnerability rated
"critical." Microsoft credited Palo Alto Networks exclusively for the
"HTML Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability" (CVE-2008-2254), which
could enable an attacker to exploit the vulnerability by constructing
a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the
vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who
successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user
rights as the logged-on user.

   The second vulnerability, also exclusively credited to Palo Alto
Networks, the "Microsoft Event System Vulnerability" (CVE-2008-1456)
is rated "important" and could be used by an attacker to take complete
control of an affected system. An attacker could then install
programs; view, change or delete data; or create new accounts with
full administrative rights.

   These vulnerabilities represent the fourth and fifth
Microsoft-related discoveries for the Palo Alto Networks Threat
Research Team in the last 12 months. The previous three
vulnerabilities were all rated "critical" and could result in remote
code execution. They include:

   --  Agent Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2007-3040)

   --  GDI Heap Overflow Vulnerabilities (CVE-2008-1083)

   --  GDI Stack Overflow Vulnerabilities (CVE-2008-1087)

   Palo Alto Networks' family of next-generation firewalls protects
enterprises from any exploits that take advantage of these
vulnerabilities, as well as a broad range of other threats. The Palo
Alto Networks Threat Research Team is active in the research
community, aggressively pursuing both new vulnerability research and
mitigation of all types of threats.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Ultrapar CEO and analyst comments, details, byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Inae Riveras&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO Aug 14 (Reuters) - Brazil's Ultrapar
Participacoes UGPA4.SA said on Thursday it will buy Texaco's
fuel distribution assets in Brazil for about $720 million, in
the latest shake-up of the country's gas-station business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ultrapar, a holding company with fuel and natural gas
assets, said it will pay 1.16 billion reais, to be funded from
existing cash resources for Texaco Inc's network of about 2,000
service stations and 48 terminal operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Brazil entered a new phase recently, with stronger
economic growth and changes in distribution of income. In this
sense, this acquisition is an investment in the renewed
strength of the Brazilian market," Ultrapar's CEO Pedro
Wongtschowski, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Texaco Inc is a part of Chevron Corp (CVX.N), which in just
over a year has sold its marketing businesses in Uruguay,
Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Oil majors have been
shedding marketing networks around the world as high oil prices
have squeezed margins on gasoline sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the deal, Ultrapar will have more than 5,000 service
stations throughout the country, which will give it about 23
percent of Brazil's fuel market and national coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The merging of the networks will bring economies of scale
in the distribution terminals and sales process as well as
other business areas, Ultrapar said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The deal is a step into Ultra's consolidation as the
second-largest fuels distributor. (Texaco's network) is a good
one as it is situated in cities with high sales," said Nelson
Matos, an analyst at Banco do Brasil Investimentos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal will be completed after the segregation of
Chevron's lubricant and oil exploration activities, which are
not included in the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHANGING HANDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ultrapar's move follows a series of deals in Brazil's fuels
distribution sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In April, Brazilian ethanol producer Cosan (CSAN3.SA)
agreed to buy ExxonMobil's (XOM.N) distribution and marketing
assets in the country for $826 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ultrapar bought in 2007 Brazil's second-largest fuel
distributor, Ipiranga, in a joint deal with state-run oil
company Petrobras (PETR4.SA)(PBR.N) and petrochemical company
Braskem SA (BRKM5.SA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Profit margins are thin, it's a very competitive market,
and you still have adulteration problems," Banco do Brasil's
Matos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ultrapar said in the statement it will continue using
Texaco's brand name for up to five years "to ensure a gradual
re-branding" of the whole network to Ipiranga.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Aug 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) has cut the
price of its covenant lite loan to German yacht maker Bavaria
Yachtbau GmbH in the secondary loan market in a renewed effort
to sell the paper as banks around the world come under pressure
to clean their books, banking sources said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Loan traders told Reuters LPC on Thursday that Goldman
Sachs, which is reporting on Aug. 19, had offered the senior
debt at 30 percent of face value last week, but found few
takers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's deeply subordinated payment-in-kind (PIK) loan
was said to have been offered at 5 percent of face value,
traders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs and Dresdner Kleinwort underwrote a 875
million euro financing package backing the 1.3 billion euro
purchase of the company by private equity firm Bain Capital in
June 2007 before the credit crunch, RLPC data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The aggressive loan had high leverage of nearly ten times
total debt to EBITDA and was structured with senior debt, second
lien, PIK and mezzanine loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal was part of the 75-80 billion euro pipeline of
aggressively priced and structured leveraged loans that were
unable to be sold and left on banks balance sheets as the credit
crisis intensified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks have been forced to discount the paper to sell it and
Bavaria was one of Europe's first discounted loan sales in
March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, which owns most of the junior debt, tried to sell
the senior debt at 65 percent of face value and sold around 100
million euros of its position at that time, banking sources
said. The loan was quoted recently at 50 percent of face value,
according to RLPC data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dresdner, which owns half of the senior and second lien
debt, opted not to sell and has not been a recent seller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Now, they're (Goldman) are desperately trying to sell it,"
one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bavaria has struggled as consumers have cut down on luxury
purchases such as yachts. The highly leveraged company has
underperformed its business plan but traders said that the
secondary loan price also reflects Goldman's desire to sell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is recovery value in there - 30 is pretty harsh, Bain
is a reasonable sponsor. They overpaid and overlevered the
business and the equity is underwater but Bain is an experienced
sponsor," a secondary loan trader said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bavaria's overall debt facility initially included 650
million euros of senior debt, 157 million of mezzanine and 85
million of PIK notes, one of the sources said.

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase to Settle with State Securities Regulators and Offer to Purchase Certain Customers' Auction Rate Securities

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. ("JPMorgan Chase") announced today that, as
part of the Firm's ongoing commitment to the its customers and as part
of an agreement in principle to settle investigations by the New York
State Attorney General's Office and the Office of Financial Regulation
of the State of Florida (on behalf of the North American Securities
Administrators Association ("NASAA")), it will offer to purchase at
par auction rate securities ("ARS") that are held by individual

        of this announcement.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
With canine motion sickness the leading reason pet owners are not able to take
their dogs on day trips or vacation, Pfizer is encouraging more people to talk
with their veterinarians about managing travel with their dog before the summer
ends.

Since Pfizer's Cerenia(TM) (maropitant citrate) became the first-and-only
veterinary approved canine medication in America, Europe and Canada to prevent
vomiting from a wide range of causes, including motion sickness, Pfizer has seen
thousands of dogs successfully treated by their veterinarians. Now, Pfizer is
sharing lessons-learned with tips on managing motion sickness while traveling.

In the U.S., traveling with dogs is becoming easier. More airlines are catering
to pets and more hotels are providing pet-friendly accommodations. Still, one in
six American dogs - an estimated 7.2 million - will suffer from vomiting caused
by motion sickness.

"This past year, more families have been able to enjoy the company of their dog
as they take day trips or longer vacations," said Pfizer's George Fennell, vice
president, U.S. Companion Animal Division. "Our experience is that, with a
little pre-trip planning and with the benefits of Cerenia, motion sickness no
longer needs to be a reason to leave the family dog behind."

About Cerenia

When dogs travel, their balance can be affected by movement. Or, they may just
feel anxious about the traveling itself. In the past, canine motion sickness has
been treated with a variety of products designed for people, often with a
sedating effect. Cerenia is available by prescription only from veterinarians in
easy-to-give, once-daily tablets that will not cause sedation. Cerenia works to
prevent vomiting due to motion sickness as well as treat and prevent acute
emesis. Because Cerenia does not cause drowsiness, dogs will be alert during and
upon arrival, making travel a more positive experience for the entire family.

The safe use of Cerenia has not been evaluated in dogs for breeding, pregnant or
lactating bitches, dogs with gastrointestinal obstruction, or dogs that have
ingested toxins. Cerenia is recommended for use in dogs 16 weeks and older. Use
caution in dogs with hepatic dysfunction. The most common adverse reactions
noted during clinical studies were hypersalivation, drowsiness, lethargy,
anorexia and diarrhea. Cerenia is not for use in humans. For more information,
visit www.Cerenia.com.

pharmaceutical company, also is a world leader in discovering and developing
innovative animal prescription medicines and vaccines. Pfizer Animal Health is

Don't Leave Your Dog Behind This Vacation

1. Visit your veterinarian to make sure your dog's vaccines are up-to-date
before you travel. Talk about medications to manage motion sickness, especially
medications like Cerenia(TM) that are non-sedating and easy-to-administer while
vacationing.

2. Try to gradually acclimate your dog to a car trip. Start simply by sitting
with your dog in a parked car, then, driving around the block. Test short trips
before taking a long vacation. Puppies that are exposed to car trips also will
better able to travel as they grow.

3. When you're ready, avoid feeding your dog 1-2 hours before traveling. And
allow your dog to relieve itself.

4. Make sure your dog has enough room to lie down. Motion sickness can be made
worse by sitting or standing. Consider a large crate or carrier. If your dog is
nervous or excited, this can be a quiet place to rest.

5. Be sure your dog can get some fresh air while traveling.

6. Make sure your dog can see out a window. Just like us, dogs tend to feel less
nauseous when looking at the horizon.

7. If you're driving, try to be extra careful making sharp turns or driving
winding roads or downhill.

8. On longer road trips, take a break at a rest stop every 2-3 hours so that
your dog can stretch its legs, have a drink and avoid becoming dehydrated.

9. Never leave your dog alone in the car or on a boat. Even if the windows or
entrances are slightly open, the temperature can rise quickly and can cause
severe health problems such as hyperthermia or heat stroke.

10. When flying, remember that each airline has slightly different rules and
services for dogs including requirements regarding crate size and how to reserve
a spot -- for your pet. Consult the airline in advance to avoid surprises at the
last minute.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aug 14 (Reuters) - Defense contractor General Dynamics Corp
(GD.N) was downgraded to "neutral" from "overweight" by J.P.
Morgan Securities on the brokerage's concern that earnings
momentum will slow on supplemental exposure to war spending,
and slower demand for business jets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said it expects supplemental war spending
budgets to decline with Iraq troop levels, which would be a
formidable headwind for the company's Combat Systems segment in
the 2010 to 2011 timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, sources familiar with the situation said the
U.S. Army plans to cut billions of dollars from the Abrams tank
built by General Dynamics and other vehicle programs to fund
its Future Combat Systems modernization effort and other
technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said defense stocks should do well in the
near term but could suffer in 2009 as the economy recovers,
which could coincide with a painful rotation out of defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The next administration will face a tough budget
environment that could result in a reduced spending growth
outlook," J.P. Morgan said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage pared back its large cap defense
recommendations to two from three. It rates Northrop Grumman
Corp (NOC.N) and Raytheon Co (RTN.N) "overweight".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It rates Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan said that earnings growth opportunity from
General Dynamics' Gulfstream G550 business jet segment has been
priced into market expectations, and a weakening business jet
market should eventually catch up with the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also said it sees fewer catalysts for the company, which
trades at a premium following a strong run driven by solid
results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company were trading down 2 percent at $91.58
in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;  TORONTO, ONTARIO, Aug 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The University of Toronto's SciNet Consortium and IBM (NYSE: IBM) today
announced an agreement to build Canada's most powerful and
energy-efficient supercomputer.

    The consortium, which includes the University of Toronto and associated
research hospitals, will enhance SciNet's competitive position in
globally important research projects. These include ground-breaking
research in aerospace, astrophysics, bioinformatics, chemical physics,
climate change prediction, medical imaging and the global ATLAS project,
which is investigating the forces that govern the universe.

    Capable of performing 360 trillion calculations per second, the
supercomputer will pioneer an innovative hybrid design containing two
systems that can work together or independently, connected to a massive
five petabyte storage complex. Because it is a hybrid using IBM's highly
efficient iDataPlex system, as well as IBM's advanced POWER6
architecture, the machine is extremely flexible, capable of running a
wide range of software at a high level of performance.

    As a premier academic research system, the machine is expected to be
among the top 20 fastest supercomputers in the world; 30 times faster
than the peak performance of Canada's current largest research system. It
also represents the second largest system ever built on a university
campus, and the largest supercomputer outside the United States.

    "The University of Toronto has partnered with IBM to become one of the
world's premier computational research institutions - a collaboration
that will attract researchers from around the world," said Dr. Richard
Peltier, Scientific Director of SciNet and Director of the Centre for
Global Change Science.

    As a physicist whose interests are focused on planetary physics and
climate change prediction, Dr. Peltier's work includes research on the
impacts of greenhouse gas-induced global warming, which will be greatly
enhanced by this system. The SciNet facility will be one of the world's
most advanced supercomputers for analyzing high-resolution global models
to predict future risks, such as the accelerating decrease in Artic sea
ice. An immediate project will be the construction of regional climate
change predictions for the Province of Ontario and Great Lakes watershed
region.

    Another area of research for this system will be to explore the modern
scientific mystery of why matter has mass and what constitutes the mass
of the universe. Beginning in September, the Large Hadron Collider
project based in Geneva, the most powerful particle accelerator ever
built, will produce vast quantities of data, which scientists hope will
be begin to unlock these mysteries. SciNet's computing power and storage
capacity will be a significant contributor to the data analysis.

    "SciNet will have one of the best facilities in the world that will allow
Canadian physicists to participate in the adventure of the Large Hadron
Collider," said Dr. Pierre Savard, a member of the Canadian group working
at CERN, Geneva. "This research may change our view of matter and the
universe."

    This facility will involve the largest implementation of IBM's iDataPlex
system, which holds twice as many processors per unit as standard systems
and is entirely water cooled. More than 4,000 servers will be linked
together in this multi-platform solution, including one of the world's
largest POWER6 clusters and Intel x86-based clusters. This IBM
supercomputer will be one of the first systems to use Future Intel(R)
Nehalem processor families, being introduced in early 2009.

    "A system this complex could only be designed by bringing together the
best minds from the University of Toronto and IBM," said Chris Pratt,
Strategic Initiatives Executive, IBM Canada. "This is a tremendous
example of public and private collaboration that will benefit the
Canadian research community for many years to come."

    Funding has been provided by the Canadian Foundation for Innovation's
National Platforms Fund, in partnership with the Province of Ontario and
the University of Toronto.

    Construction of this extremely energy efficient datacenter will begin
immediately at a facility just north of Toronto. Installation of the
system will begin in the fall with several milestones throughout the
winter. It is anticipated that both of the main computing systems will be
fully operational by summer 2009.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Barclays Plc (BARC.L) may need to write down 1.5 billion pounds more over the next 18 months, analysts at Goldman Sachs said adding the British bank has little room to absorb further material losses without the dividend potentially being cut or paid in shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another brokerage, Cazenove, downgraded Barclays to "in-line" from "outperform," citing share price outperformance, and said though the bank had performed well given the disruption in financial markets, it still faces a weak economic outlook and lower balance-sheet gearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs also said it remained concerned about the bank's capital position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays' interim results were disappointing as the weak underlying performance, excluding Barclays Capital revenue, were only saved by a strong performance on costs, Goldman Sachs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Barclays reported a 33 percent drop in first-half profits after taking a 2 billion pound writedown on the value of risky assets, and said challenging market conditions are likely to last through 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Barclays' credit market exposures, there is the potential for up to 4.6 billion pounds of further write-downs, Goldman added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It raised its price target on the stock to 340 pence from 320, and reiterated its "sell" rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cazenove, however, said the British bank's first-half results were less pronounced than at many competitors, and write-downs taken by Barclays were broadly consistent with the range of figures disclosed by rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays was the best performing major European bank in the third quarter, with a share-price rise of 21 percent, Cazenove said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It (the shares) now trades at a premium to peers and, with no specific catalyst in view, we expect a period of share price consolidation," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Barclays were trading down 2 percent at 345 pence by 1033 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Neha Singh in Bangalore; Editing by Vinu Pilakkott)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) are close to settling with government regulators to buy back auction-rate debt from clients, Bloomberg News said on Thursday, citing people briefed on the negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wachovia Corp WB.N is also nearing a deal, Bloomberg said, citing Laura Egerdal, a spokeswoman for Missouri Secretary of State Robin Carnahan, who is in the negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency quoted Egerdal as saying that negotiations between a multistate task force and Wachovia "made great progress" over the weekend, but that there were a few more things to be worked out, which were still being discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Texas Securities Commissioner Denise Voigt Crawford said U.S. and state regulators were close to settling with several banks accused of mishandling sales of auction-rate debt to individuals and institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, one of the most aggressive regulators pursuing the issue, on Monday told JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wachovia that it wants to begin settlement talks immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was the third-largest auction-rate municipal bond underwriter since 2000 after Citigroup Inc (C.N) and UBS AG (UBSN.VX), according to ThomsonReuters data, while Morgan Stanley was the fourth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other states announced settlements last week with Citigroup and UBS.

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese advertising and media firm Universe Media Holdings will receive $58 million of investment from a Goldman Sachs (GS.N) venture capital fund and another local fund ahead of a planned Nasdaq listing, a senior company executive said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company, which places advertising on trains and railway stations expects the funds by September, the executive said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most of the funds will be used to invest in our expansion of LCD screens and relevant technical infrastructures on trains and train stations," he told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are now entering a fast phase of expansion," said the executive who did not want to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal will be the last round of private fund-raising before the Beijing-based company lists on the Nasdaq, as early as this year, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He declined to give an estimate for the size of the IPO because the listing plan had not been finalized, but added Goldman Sachs would probably sponsor the share sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legend Capital, part of Legend Group that owns computer maker Lenovo Group Ltd (0992.HK), was the second investor, along with the Goldman Sachs fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokesman in Hong Kong and a partner of Legend Capital could not be immediately reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last November, AirMedia Group Inc (AMCN.O), China's top provider of advertising in airports and on planes, raised $225 million from a Nasdaq listing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Universe Media was formed in May by the merger of two Chinese firms, Epin Media and Guangyuan Media, and operates more than 75,000 LCD screens on about 500 domestic trains that show programs with advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the merger, Legend Capital held a stake in Guangyuan and Goldman invested several tens of millions of dollar in Epin, which had nearly 50,000 LCD screens on about 300 domestic trains by the end of 2007, according to Chinese media reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the merger, an investment arm of China's Ministry of Railways became a strategic investor of Universe Media, helping the firm maintain its leading position in the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's Ministry of Railways had a 15-year contract with Universe Media allowing the firm to produce and broadcast video on trains and in stations, Chinese media reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional media industries such as televisions and newspapers are highly regulated by China's Communist government, but so-called new media firms such as Universe Media and AirMedia have been growing fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have been popular with foreign funds partly because of their focus on profits not politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government also plans to create public and venture capital funds to invest in new media and publishing companies, state media reported on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=6.860 Yuan)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Dominic Whiting and Anshuman Daga)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - A consortium led by Goldman Sachs (GS.N)
has purchased a portfolio of private equity holdings formerly
owned by Dutch bank ABN AMRO at a discount, a source familiar
with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The portfolio of 21 UK, Dutch and Nordic companies, owned
by AAC Capital Partners -- formerly ABN AMRO Capital -- was
valued at 700 million euros ($1.05 billion), but bought at a 10
to 20 percent discount to its face value, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal indicates the growing appetite of investors for
distressed or discounted assets as the credit crunch is
starting to hurt the wider economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's consortium included Alpinvest and the Canada
Pension Plan, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The consortium also injected another 450 million euros
($673.9 million) in AAC Capital Partners for a new northern
Europe buy-out fund, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ABN AMRO was sold to a consortium of three banks last year
and its new owners -- Banco Santander (SAN.MC), Royal Bank of
Scotland (RBS.L) and Fortis FOR.BR -- have injected 500

billion euros, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street Journal said on Wednesday a consortium led
by Goldman Sachs had agreed to pay about $1.5 billion for a
number of ABN AMRO's private equity assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, Belgian-Dutch financial services group Fortis
said that together with Britain's Royal Bank of Scotland Group
and Santander, it had sold a number of ABN AMRO private equity
assets to a Goldman Sachs-led consortium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the time, a Fortis spokeswoman said the assets sold were
in companies located in Scandinavia, Britain and the
Netherlands, but declined to give any further details on the

&lt;p&gt;TORONTO (Reuters) - The University of Toronto and IBM Corp (IBM.N) are building Canada's most powerful supercomputer, a mammoth machine that will need its own building for storage and will be capable of performing 360 trillion calculations per second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's expected the system will be among the top 20 fastest supercomputers in the world and the largest outside the United States. It will be able to store data equivalent to that held by one million regular DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entire budget of the project, which includes construction and operating costs, is just under C$50 million ($47 million) over five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its power is roughly equivalent to "30,000 to 40,000 home computers linked together," said Chris Pratt, strategic initiatives executive at IBM Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The kind of interconnect between parts of the system will allow the equivalent of two full-length feature DVD movies to be moved around in the space of a second," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be a big boost to scientists at the University of Toronto and its associated research hospitals, as it will help tackle projects in an array of areas from aerospace and astrophysics to climate change prediction and medical imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the research, the system will be used to explore the modern scientific mystery of why matter has mass and what constitutes the mass of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding is being provided by the Canadian Foundation for Innovation, in partnership with the province of Ontario and the university.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building the supercomputer will involve the largest implementation of IBM's iDataPlex system, which holds twice as many processors per unit as standard systems and is entirely water-cooled. More than 4,000 servers will be linked together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every aspect of the system has been put together to be the most powerful and yet the most energy-efficient," Pratt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A data center will be built just north of Toronto. Installation will begin in the autumn and it's expected the supercomputer will be fully operational by next summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Wojtek Dabrowski; editing by Peter Galloway)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has taken various rating actions on the Alt-A RMBS
transaction listed below:

   --CWALT 2007-1T1

   This transaction had previous rating actions published August 1,
2008.

   The rating actions reflect the upgrade of 1 super-senior class
which, upon a subsequent review of all super-seniors, were determined
to be particularly sensitive to Fitch's cashflow assumption that the
servicer will not advance on defaulted loans in the month of
liquidation. While Fitch uses a five-year mortgage default curve to
assess the risk of a bond default for Alt-A super-seniors, shortfalls
from liquidations without servicer advancing were projected to result
in unrecovered principal under an 'AAA' stress at deal maturity for
some super-senior classes despite having maintained credit protection
at the end of the stressed five-year mortgage default period. Today's
rating revision considers the class's sensitivity to that particular
cashflow assumption. The super-senior class upgraded reverted to the
initial 'AAA' rating. Additionally, one non-super senior class was
downgraded to a level consistent with all other non-super senior
classes with similar credit enhancement.

   A spreadsheet detailing Fitch's rating actions on the transactions
in question is available on the Fitch Ratings web site at
www.fitchratings.com under the following headers:

   Structured Finance then RMBS then Research Highlights then

   The rating actions taken today reflect Fitch's analysis of
expected default and loss from delinquent loans, in addition to
projected losses from the currently performing pool. Fitch generates
its expectations using its ResiLogic default and loss model. These
expectations are adjusted based on actual performance to-date versus
model projected performance. The model incorporates the impact of
historical home price movements on mortgage performance, in addition
to projecting further stress for many regions of the U.S. The model
also reflects the demonstrated high default rates for loans that
exhibit risk-layering.

   Fitch is nearing completion of its review of the 2005-2007 Alt-A
transactions. This review was completed in two separate phases. The
first phase reviewed all mezzanine and subordinated bonds. The second
phase, which is nearly completed, reviewed the senior bonds that, in
many instances, required additional cash flow analysis to evaluate the
risk of the various individual classes within the senior tranche. Most
notably, the use of super-senior structures was considered in
evaluating senior bonds.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds detail on litigation expenses, effort to reach

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Aug 15 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) on Friday
said it was open to an amicable solution to resolve a lawsuit
by 30,000 Amazon jungle dwellers suing the U.S. oil major in
Ecuador for up to $16 billion in environmental damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron desires to have a fair and complete resolution to
the Lago Agrio case," the company said in a statement, adding
that any talks will need to "include discussion of
Petroecuador's unfulfilled contractual obligations and a
commitment from the Ecuadorean state to stop interfering in the
ongoing trial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Petroecuador's contractual obligations include sharing
litigation expenses, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Representatives for the plaintiffs could not immediately be
reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ecuador Inspector General Diego Garcia told Reuters on
Wednesday that his government is willing to mediate a
settlement between Chevron and the peasants and Indians who are
suing the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Amazon residents charge Chevron's Texaco unit polluted
the jungles and damaged their health by dumping billions of
gallons of oil-laden water from 1972 to 1992. Chevron has
called the case a "judicial farce" plagued by government
interference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Experts have said a deal is unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Texaco, bought by Chevron in 2001, denies its operations
affected the health of Amazon communities. The company has
argued it was released from liability after paying $40 million
for an environmental cleanup in the 1990s and blames state oil
company Petroecuador for much of the pollution.

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Statement Responding to the Government of Ecuador's Offer to Mediate in Ongoing Trial

SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
On August 9th, Ecuador's President Rafael Correa offered to
facilitate settlement discussions between Chevron and the Amazon
Defense Coalition in order to resolve the ongoing civil lawsuit
underway in Ecuador. The mediation offer was repeated by Ecuador's
Attorney General Diego Garcia in an interview with Reuters on
Wednesday. In response, Chevron issued the following statement:

   "Chevron desires to have a fair and complete resolution to the
Lago Agrio case. In 2004, we requested that Petroecuador engage in
arbitration. The Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador have sued
Chevron to prevent such a conversation. Chevron remains open to an
amicable solution, but such a dialogue would need to include
discussion of Petroecuador's unfulfilled contractual obligations and a
commitment from the Ecuadorian state to stop interfering in the
ongoing trial."

   Note to Editors:

   For more information on the arbitration, please see

px (Due to its length, this URL may need to be copied/pasted into your
Internet browser's address field. Remove the extra space if one
exists.)

   Chevron is requesting that Petroecuador fulfill contractual
obligations to the company. They are:

   1. Assume its contractually-mandated share of litigation expenses

   2. Provide adequate assurances that it will indemnify Chevron for
any potential adverse judgment

   3. Provide adequate assurances that it will undertake and fund any
additional remediation activities that the court or any other
competent body requires be undertaken

   Interference on the part of the Ecuadorian state has been
undeniable. In Ecuador, where the International Bar Association(1) has
concluded that "there is a serious politicization of the judiciary"
and "that in many cases no effective independence exists," such
pronouncements have a profound effect on a trial.

   Arturo Torres, editor of the judicial section of El Comercio, an
independent Ecuadorian newspaper, told Dow Jones Newswires that,
"Judges fear ruling in any way that could be seen as going against
Correa." He also said, "They know they can lose their position and
that they can be called traitor to the country."

   Examples of the Republic of Ecuador exerting its influence
include:

   March 20, 2007 - Dow Jones Newswire: "The support from the
government will translate into help in gathering proof and support for
the population directly affected by the contamination Texaco
produced," Correa said in a press release.

   March 26, 2007 - CRE Radio, program Noticias: "We met with our
friends that have fought for many years in the Amazon against Chevron
Texaco. Our friends can be certain that they have the entire support
of the country in which is considered one of the largest disasters in
history: the spills, the waste, the pits that were left by
ChevronTexaco during its disastrous operation in the country." -
President Rafael Correa

   April 26, 2007 - AP Newswire: "No remediation was done here, they
just covered all the waste," expressed Correa in support of the
plaintiffs' judgment. It is the first demonstration of support of an
Ecuadorian president in this cause.

   April 28, 2007 - Radio Caravana (Presidential Radio Network):
"Here we have Chevron-Texaco's attorneys, these lawyer turncoats, who
for a fistful of dollars are capable of selling their souls, their
country. We also have people from Petroecuador who in 1998 signed an
agreement declaring everything had been remediated, when many of these
pits had not been even covered.

   "I hereby call the Attorney General to present a report to the
General Comptroller's Office establishing criminal responsibilities
against Petroecuador's officials who signed this nonsense. They said
everything was remediated when nothing had been done. I ask that this
cause is processed and criminal indictment against these corrupt
turncoats is started, because despite contamination could be seen,
they said everything was remediated.

   "I want to take this opportunity to show my solidarity to our
fellow countrymen in the Amazonia, especially Luis Yanza and those who
have fought for justice. Our dear friends Luis and Pablo, you have set
an example for everyone." - President Rafael Correa

   January 19, 2008 - President Correa's weekly radio program: "We
continued with our regular office activities and then received
representatives of the Amazon Defense Front who have been fighting for
decades against ChevronTexaco; they have all the support of the
National Government."

   August 7, 2008 - Dow Jones Newswires: The Correa administration's
position on the case is clear: "The pollution is result of Chevron's
actions and not of Petroecuador." - Ecuador's Attorney General Diego
Garcia

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats to widen distribution)
 (Adds JP Morgan comment, paragraph 11; closing stock prices,
paragraph 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Jessica Hall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHILADELPHIA Aug 14 (Reuters) - Biotechnology company
ImClone Systems Inc, which rebuffed a $60-per-share takeover
offer from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N), said on Thursday it
hired JP Morgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) as its financial adviser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan will help ImClone IMCL.O study Bristol's offer
in more detail, and weigh a possible plan to split ImClone into
two businesses, sources familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Formal talks between ImClone and Bristol have not yet
begun, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this month, ImClone rejected as too low Bristol's
offer to acquire the shares of ImClone it did not already own
in a deal that valued the company at $5.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ImClone, meanwhile, said its board had been discussing the
possibility of separating its Erbitux cancer treatment business
and its drug-development pipeline operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Erbitux is approved for colorectal and head and neck cancer
in the United States and Canada, while a recent approval for
the drug in Japan and new lung cancer data are expected to
drive sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ImClone said it believed the pipeline business "may be
extremely valuable and significantly increase stockholder value
as a separate business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Activist investor Carl Icahn, chairman of ImClone and a
large shareholder of the company, had said he opposed
Bristol-Myers' offer because he believes it "greatly
undervalues the company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also up for debate is an ImClone antibody, IMC-11F8, that
is under development. If approved for sale, ImClone has said
the antibody "might have a significant competitive effect on
Erbitux," and Bristol-Myers may have no rights to market that
product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bristol previously termed its offer for ImClone "full and
fair" and said it believed it has rights to the follow-on drug
to Erbitux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan confirmed that it had been hired as ImClone's
financial adviser. Bristol, which had hired Citigroup Inc
(C.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) as its
advisers, declined to comment on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ImClone shares fell 20 cents to close at $63.75 on Nasdaq,
while Bristol shed 10 cents to close at $21.88 on the New York
Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Aug 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that Vantage Deluxe World Travel, the
leader in travel to active, mature American travelers, has increased
sales and improved business operations since turning to IBM to run its
Web site and online booking system. Since switching to IBM WebSphere
Commerce software, Vantage Travel has reduced order-taking time by 80
percent and increased revenue for the company. The new Web site also has
special features to make it easier for consumers to navigate and make
reservations.

    Based in Boston, Mass., Vantage Travel offers all inclusive escorted
package tours for active mature travelers. Booking such a tour is a
complicated process since planes, ships, buses, hotels, restaurants and
professional tour guides need to be booked individually by the company but
need to be coordinated with the departure dates of the tours sold to
customers. Until recently, customers had to book their tours by calling
Vantage's call center staffed with reservation specialists. The online
reservation system greatly increases customer convenience, however, since
wait times could often be long and booking tours were a lengthy process
depending on the time of day.

    "Our market changes every single day," says Peter Groustra, director of
information technology for Vantage Travel. "We knew we could vastly
improve the customer experience by deploying an online booking
application to enhance our existing Web site. IBM came in and really
pulled the project together in an amazingly short period of time -- five
months, compressing a development cycle that was slated to take 12
months."

    The online reservation process designed by Vantage Travel now presents
customers with a grid of simple choices on the very first screen,
including tour information such as ships, dates, availability and prices.
The application flows intuitively, helping customers make decisions in a
fast, easy to follow process that typically takes under three minutes.

    If a date is sold out, customers can choose from all the available
alternative dates on a single screen. Cross-sells and up-sells are
smoothly incorporated into the application, offering tour "extensions"
such as offering pre- and post-tour extensions on its river cruise
programs, travel protection, and business class air upgrades.

    "When customers book a tour, the application is simultaneously booking
reservations for hotels, buses and so on," says Groustra. "We needed our
online system to extend the complexities built into our core business
systems out to the Web without making the process too complicated for our
customers. The WebSphere Commerce solution did this without having to
completely rewrite our back-end systems."

    After the new online booking application had been live for one month,
Vantage conducted a customer survey to see how customers had fared with
the new booking process. The result was that 87 percent of customers
ranked the experience as very good to excellent.

    WebSphere Commerce is part of Vantage Travel's service oriented
architecture (SOA) strategy, which allows its Web site to integrate with
online and offline data sources including databases and partner Web sites.
By taking advantage of SOA, IBM's software also integrates with Vantage's
existing IT system including a third-party database, which manages
information about the tours.

    "This project is a great example of how IBM is helping clients adapt to
constantly changing conditions such as rising fuel costs and new terms of
engagement between airlines and travel agencies," said Marty Salfen,
general manager, IBM Travel and Transportation. "Using IBM software and
SOA, companies like Vantage can make it easier and less expensive for
consumers to book vacations, while reducing the time and money it takes to
manage a complex business and Web site like this."

    In the near future, Vantage expects to conduct 20 percent of its business
online, which will take a burden off its call center, reduce wait times
and improve the customer experience.

    At the current level of online business, Vantage Travel expects to pay
back the investment in six months. Since using the new IBM software, the
company can now offer its customers the convenience of booking online
with the best online reservation system in the industry.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Aug 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that it has been positioned by Gartner,
Inc. in the Leaders Quadrant in its new Magic Quadrant for E-Commerce(1)
report.

    The Gartner Magic Quadrant for E-Commerce defines Leaders as "technology
providers that demonstrate the greatest degree of support for B2B and B2C
Internet sales." According to the report, "These providers lead the market
in e-commerce by consistently demonstrating customer satisfaction, strong
support and professional services, leading to the implementation of a
successful e-commerce site." In addition, these leaders should also have
"demonstrated longevity in the e-commerce market, as well as a commitment
to new product innovations for Internet sales. In addition, leaders
represent technology providers with the strongest capability to meet
Internet selling requirements."

    More than 1,000 companies worldwide, including Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Harry
and David, Staples and Home Depot, are using WebSphere Commerce as a
powerful platform for cross-channel, online and mobile commerce --
supporting all of a company's business models while providing a rich,
differentiated customer experience. For example, the IBM WebSphere
Commerce solution is a critical component in Harry and David's initiative
to grow Internet sales.

    "The world of e-commerce has gone through several major transformations
over the past decade and we've always tried to keep our clients ahead of
the competition," said Tom Rosamilia, general manager, IBM WebSphere.
"WebSphere Commerce provides retailers with a wide range of features and
capabilities to help sell goods and services through various channels to
an increasingly global and mobile marketplace."

    WebSphere Commerce is designed to enable deployment and management of
multiple e-commerce sites through a single, unified platform, thereby
maximizing performance, scalability and adaptability. Last year, IBM
enhanced Web 2.0 functionality in WebSphere Commerce, and also added the
capabilities to track and analyze cross-channel behavior to gain insight
for sales and interactive marketing to increase conversion rates, basket
size and return visits. The latest enhancements also extend search
functionality, protect online shoppers' credit card information and ensure
compliance to the latest Payment Card Industry (PCI) security standards.

&lt;p&gt; (Repeating with no change to headline or text)
 (Adds Cuomo and SEC comments, Wachovia details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 14 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and
JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) agreed to buy back billions of
dollars of illiquid auction-rate securities and pay fines to
settle charges that they misled investors about the debt's
risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The banks are the third and fourth to reach auction-rate
settlements with New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo,
joining Citigroup Inc (C.N) and UBS AG (UBSN.VX), which settled
last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley agreed to buy back $4.5 billion of debt and
pay a $35 million fine, while JPMorgan agreed to buy back $3
billion of debt and pay a $25 million fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regulators say brokerages misled investors into believing
that auction-rate debt, which has rates that reset in periodic
auctions, was safe and the equivalent of cash. Much of the $330
billion market has been frozen since February, when brokerages
abandoned their traditional role as buyers of last resort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You have hundreds of thousands of people being caught in a
financial nightmare," Cuomo said at a news conference
announcing the settlements. "I believe we have crossed the
Rubicon and established the premise that the investors will be
helped. The nightmare will end."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup and UBS agreed to buy back a combined $26 billion
of the debt and pay $250 million in fines. Other banks are also
being examined in what Cuomo called an "industrywide" probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, UBS was the target Thursday of a lawsuit by New
Hampshire securities regulators, who said the Swiss bank misled
the state's student loan agency about auction-rate debt,
resulting in less money available to help college students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BAD PUBLICITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley will buy back its auction-rate debt from
retail customers, charities and small to mid-sized businesses
by Dec. 11, while JPMorgan will do so by Nov. 12. Both will
reimburse customers who sold debt at a loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said its buyback may result in a $400 million
pretax charge. Its settlement also covers debt sold by the
former Bear Stearns Cos, which JPMorgan acquired in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thursday's settlements may add to pressure on Merrill Lynch
 Co MER.N, Wachovia Corp WB.N, and other companies that
sold auction-rate securities, to settle with regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The publicity is already bad enough for these banks," said
Joseph Gordon, president of Gordon Asset Management LLC in
Durham, North Carolina. "There is no incentive to drag it out
and run up legal bills."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was not part of
the Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan settlements, unlike the
Citigroup and UBS settlements, but said its investigation into
the auction-rate debt market was continuing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Under the SEC's longstanding policy, it's better for
everyone when harmed investors get their money back before
investigations are completed," SEC spokesman John Nester said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was not immediately clear how investors who bought
now-illiquid auction-rate debt from discount brokerages or
mutual fund companies would be treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WACHOVIA, MERRILL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wachovia may be close to an accord with regulators relating
to $9.5 billion of auction-rate debt, according to Ryan Hobart,
a spokesman for Missouri Secretary of State Robin Carnahan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, Wachovia set aside $500 million of reserves for
a possible auction-rate settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill, meanwhile, has offered to buy back as much as $12
billion of the debt but has not settled with regulators. Cuomo
called the offer "a good thing" but said it wasn't enough. He
said he has had talks with Merrill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wachovia spokeswoman Christy Phillips-Brown and Merrill
spokesman Mark Herr declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) declined to address a report
in the Wall Street Journal that it is refusing to buy back
auction-rate debt from its wealthy clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spokeswoman Andrea Raphael said Goldman "has been working
with clients to address their liquidity needs" and is
cooperating with regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Thursday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares
of Morgan Stanley closed up 49 cents at $40.64, while JPMorgan
rose 90 cents to $37.81.

&lt;p&gt;(Recasts, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aug 15 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities lowered its
earnings estimates on Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) to reflect
a seasonally slow quarter and continued weakness in the credit
environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe the weakness in the third quarter of 2008 is
due to the slowdown in execution and origination, not due to a
major write-down in credit," analyst Kenneth Worthington said
in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worthington, who maintained his "overweight" rating on the
stock, cut his third-quarter earnings outlook to $2.40 from
$4.00 a share, and fourth-quarter outlook to $4.47 from $5 a
share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also lowered his 2009 estimate by a dollar to $18.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Equity capital market revenue in the third quarter of the
year has been a disappointment for Goldman, and the debt
capital market was weak as well, Worthington said. He expects
$500 million in losses in private equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst sees Goldman experiencing somewhat higher
write-downs this quarter at about $1.5 to $2 billion (gross)
given the deterioration in residential and commercial related
indices, but expects the write-down to be manageable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A dominant position in high-margin, high-barrier
businesses and a more manageable presence in credit should
continue to enable Goldman to out-earn and outperform peers,"
Worthington added.

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats due to historical database problem)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 14 (Reuters) - Stabilizing U.S. economic
growth, falling oil prices and a deteriorating outlook outside
the United States have led Goldman Sachs to abandon its
ten-year bearish stance on the U.S. dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a research note on Thursday, the largest U.S. investment
bank said the dollar's long-term downtrend has ended and its
undervaluation could lead to a substantial improvement in the
U.S. balance of payments position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is time to say goodbye to our long-held dollar bearish
stance. For about 10 years we have been negative on the dollar,
occasionally wrong but mostly right," Goldman Sachs wrote in a
research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But now the valuation and growth-driven improvements that
we have been observing for a while have reached the point where
they notably improve the medium to long-term outlook for the
dollar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It added, however, the dollar could still face some
challenges in the near term such as market positioning,
volatility in oil prices and weaker U.S. consumer spending. But
the "powerful improvements in the real trade balance suggest
the dollar has bottomed." The bank expects capital inflows to
start improving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman revised its forecasts for several U.S. dollar
pairings. It now sees the euro EUR= falling to $1.45 in three
months, compared with estimates of $1.56. The euro should drop
further to $1.40 over the next 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Thursday, the euro traded a near-six-month low at
$1.4779, according to Reuters data. The dollar has gained more
than 5 percent against the euro so far this month, reaching its
highest since February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On dollar/yen JPY=, the bank said it forecasts the pair
hitting 110 yen in three months from its original estimate of
106. Over the course of one year, Goldman said the dollar
should rise to 114 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A big part of Goldman's change in stance on the dollar was
the more widespread weakness in economies outside the United
States, which has led to sizable interest rate differentials in
the greenback's favor. Interest rate markets have priced in
rate cuts for major central banks, including the European
Central Bank and the Bank of England, which should diminish
their currencies' appeal to global investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aside from rate differentials, Goldman said the U.S.
economy is finally adjusting favorably to an undervalued
dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The impact of valuation has become much clearer and more
powerful -- increasing our confidence that strong, underlying
forces will lead to continued improvement in dollar
fundamentals in the next couple of years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It added that a strong U.S. export performance and signs of
growing inflows from mergers and acquisitions should clearly
boost the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About other currencies, Goldman said it has become more
upbeat on the outlook for the Brazilian real BRL= and Mexican
peso MXN=.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Certainly the growth story in Brazil and firm balance of
payments surplus should allow the currency to shrug off the
broader U.S. dollar strength," said Goldman.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and JPMorgan
Chase  Co (JPM.N) agreed to buy back billions of dollars of
illiquid auction-rate securities and pay fines to settle
charges that they misled investors about the debt's risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The banks are the third and fourth to reach auction-rate
settlements with New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo,
joining Citigroup Inc (C.N) and UBS AG (UBSN.VX), which settled
last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley agreed to buy back $4.5 billion of debt and
pay a $35 million fine, while JPMorgan agreed to buy back $3
billion of debt and pay a $25 million fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regulators say brokerages misled investors into believing
that auction-rate debt, which has rates that reset in periodic
auctions, was safe and the equivalent of cash. Much of the $330
billion market has been frozen since February, when brokerages
abandoned their traditional role as buyers of last resort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You have hundreds of thousands of people being caught in a
financial nightmare," Cuomo said at a news conference
announcing the settlements. "I believe we have crossed the
Rubicon and established the premise that the investors will be
helped. The nightmare will end."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup and UBS agreed to buy back a combined $26 billion
of the debt and pay $250 million in fines. Other banks are also
being examined in what Cuomo called an "industrywide" probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, UBS was the target Thursday of a lawsuit by New
Hampshire securities regulators, who said the Swiss bank misled
the state's student loan agency about auction-rate debt,
resulting in less money available to help college students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BAD PUBLICITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley will buy back its auction-rate debt from
retail customers, charities and small to mid-sized businesses
by Dec. 11, while JPMorgan will do so by Nov. 12. Both will
reimburse customers who sold debt at a loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said its buyback may result in a $400 million
pretax charge. Its settlement also covers debt sold by the
former Bear Stearns Cos, which JPMorgan acquired in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thursday's settlements may add to pressure on Merrill Lynch
 Co MER.N, Wachovia Corp WB.N, and other companies that
sold auction-rate securities, to settle with regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The publicity is already bad enough for these banks," said
Joseph Gordon, president of Gordon Asset Management LLC in
Durham, North Carolina. "There is no incentive to drag it out
and run up legal bills."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was not part of
the Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan settlements, unlike the
Citigroup and UBS settlements, but said its investigation into
the auction-rate debt market was continuing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Under the SEC's longstanding policy, it's better for
everyone when harmed investors get their money back before
investigations are completed," SEC spokesman John Nester said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was not immediately clear how investors who bought
now-illiquid auction-rate debt from discount brokerages or
mutual fund companies would be treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WACHOVIA, MERRILL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wachovia may be close to an accord with regulators relating
to $9.5 billion of auction-rate debt, according to Ryan Hobart,
a spokesman for Missouri Secretary of State Robin Carnahan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, Wachovia set aside $500 million of reserves for
a possible auction-rate settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill, meanwhile, has offered to buy back as much as $12
billion of the debt but has not settled with regulators. Cuomo
called the offer "a good thing" but said it wasn't enough. He
said he has had talks with Merrill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wachovia spokeswoman Christy Phillips-Brown and Merrill
spokesman Mark Herr declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) declined to address a report
in the Wall Street Journal that it is refusing to buy back
auction-rate debt from its wealthy clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spokeswoman Andrea Raphael said Goldman "has been working
with clients to address their liquidity needs" and is
cooperating with regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Thursday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares
of Morgan Stanley closed up 49 cents at $40.64, while JPMorgan
rose 90 cents to $37.81.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Joan Gralla, Martha Graybow, Grant

&lt;p&gt;  (Repeats story filed on Aug 14))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Elena Moya and Tessa Walsh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON Aug 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) has cut the
price of its covenant lite loan to German yacht maker Bavaria
Yachtbau GmbH in the secondary loan market in a renewed effort
to sell the paper as banks around the world come under pressure
to clean their books, banking sources said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Loan traders told Reuters LPC on Thursday that Goldman
Sachs, which is reporting on Aug. 19, had offered the senior
debt at 30 percent of face value last week, but found few
takers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's deeply subordinated payment-in-kind (PIK) loan
was said to have been offered at 5 percent of face value,
traders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs and Dresdner Kleinwort underwrote a 875
million euro financing package backing the 1.3 billion euro
purchase of the company by private equity firm Bain Capital in
June 2007 before the credit crunch, RLPC data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The aggressive loan had high leverage of nearly ten times
total debt to EBITDA and was structured with senior debt, second
lien, PIK and mezzanine loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal was part of the 75-80 billion euro pipeline of
aggressively priced and structured leveraged loans that were
unable to be sold and left on banks balance sheets as the credit
crisis intensified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks have been forced to discount the paper to sell it and
Bavaria was one of Europe's first discounted loan sales in
March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, which owns most of the junior debt, tried to sell
the senior debt at 65 percent of face value and sold around 100
million euros of its position at that time, banking sources
said. The loan was quoted recently at 50 percent of face value,
according to RLPC data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dresdner, which owns half of the senior and second lien
debt, opted not to sell and has not been a recent seller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Now, they're (Goldman) are desperately trying to sell it,"
one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bavaria has struggled as consumers have cut down on luxury
purchases such as yachts. The highly leveraged company has
underperformed its business plan but traders said that the
secondary loan price also reflects Goldman's desire to sell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is recovery value in there - 30 is pretty harsh, Bain
is a reasonable sponsor. They overpaid and overlevered the
business and the equity is underwater but Bain is an experienced
sponsor," a secondary loan trader said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bavaria's overall debt facility initially included 650
million euros of senior debt, 157 million of mezzanine and 85
million of PIK notes, one of the sources said.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comment, share price)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN Aug 15 (Reuters) - Irish business services group DCC
Plc DCC.Isaid on Friday it would buy Chevron's (CVX.N) UK oil
distribution business for 27.52 million euros ($41 million), in
a move analysts saw as an attractive way of boosting earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DCC said the Chevron distributor, which trades under the
Texaco brand, sells about 1 billion litres of oil per year in
England and Wales. DCC's British unit GB Oils has sales of 3.2
billion litres, giving it a market share of 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The acquisition of the Texaco distribution business will
bring significant further scale to DCC's oil distribution
business in Britain and is consistent with our strategy of
growing our presence in this market," DCC Chief Executive Tommy
Breen said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said the deal would continue DCC's track record of
acquisitions with solid returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Davy analyst David Jennings said the deal would give DCC 26
new trading locations, mainly in southern England and Wales,
where its presence had been limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It brings further scale to DCC's oil distribution
business," he said, estimating the deal should add about 2
percent to group earnings in the 2010 fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in DCC, whose interests range from oil, computer
games and muesli to recycling and cosmetics, traded 0.64 percent
higher by 0742 GMT at 15.562 euros, underperforming a 1.1
percent higher wider Irish market .ISEQ.

&lt;p&gt;RIYADH Aug 16 (Reuters) - Saudi-based Jubail Chevron
Phillips Co. petrochemical company said on Saturday it plans to
export its first shipment next month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The firm, based in the eastern Saudi city of Jubail, will
produce an annual 750,000 tonnes of styrene and 150,000 tonnes
of polypropylene, Saudi Industrial Investment Group (SIIG)
2250.SE said in a statement posted on the bourse's website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SIIG holds a 50 percent in Jubail Chevron Phillips Co..
Chevron Phillips Chemical Company holds an unspecified stake in
Jubail Chevron Phillips Co. which was built at a total cost of
4.5 billion riyals ($1.2 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The start of commercial operations has been delayed by at
least six months on initial launch plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jubail Chevron Phillips Co. is the second joint-venture
between SIIG and Chevron Phillips Chemical Co..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saudi Arabia is among the world's top suppliers of
petrochemical products, Manufacturers there benefit from access
to cheap feedstock and proximity to major markets in India and
China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Styrene, also known as vinyl benzene, is used to produce
products such as synthetic rubber, fibreglass, insulation
material and food containers. Polypropylene can be used in
packaging, textiles, stationery and automotive components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SIIG doubled its capital this year to set up with Chevron
Phillips another petrochemicals firm it called Petchem under a
18 billion riyals joint venture, half the capital of which will
be offered in an initial public offering this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron Phillips will hold 35 percent of Petchem, SIIG has
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SIIG posted an 18 percent increase in net profit in the
seven months to July, 2008 despite the start-up costs of the
Jubail Chevron Phillips Co., SIIG said in a separate statement
on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in SIIG closed up 3.25 percent at 31.75 riyals on
Saturday, but they are 18.6 percent below their level since the
start of the year, which is better than the overall bourse
performance but below the petrochemicals industry index.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - First Marblehead Corp (FMD.N) shares soared by more than half on Monday as a Goldman Sachs (GS.N) fund completed an equity investment in the student finance company, which has been hit hard by student loan losses and a frozen asset-backed securities market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First Marblehead also said Daniel Meyers, who co-founded the company in 1991, would return next month as president and chief executive. It said Jack Kopnisky, who succeeded Meyers as CEO in 2005, resigned and will depart at the end of August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, GS Capital Partners agreed to buy a stake in First Marblehead in two parts, starting with the purchase of $59.8 million of convertible preferred shares, to be followed by the purchase of $200.7 million of common stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which for years made its living by packaging loans originated by other banks into securities, saw its shares reach a high of $42 last October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the breakdown of securitized-loan markets, plus the demise of TERI, a non-profit group that guaranteed First Marblehead's offerings, sent the company's shares tumbling more than 90 percent over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the decline in First Marblehead's value, the Goldman fund cut its second purchase to $132.7 million. That investment, completed on Monday, sent First Marblehead shares soaring $1.54 to $4.54, their highest price since April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's private equity arm now owns a little over 13.1 percent of First Marblehead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investment "provides First Marblehead with liquidity and financial flexibility in an environment where other institutions are stepping away from their willingness to help students," Meyers said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the absence of securitization deals -- First Marblehead has not completed one since last year -- the company wants to expand its direct student lending, loan processing and other services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it expects to report a net loss of $57 million, or 57 cents a share, for its fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30. Actual results, including a net loss of $235 million for fiscal 2008, will be announced on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First Marblehead said the losses were driven largely by the continued dislocation in the market for bonds backed by private student loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by John Wallace and Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

IBM "Green Sigma(TM)" Consulting Offering to Help Clients Reduce Energy and Water</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;  SOMERS, NY, Aug 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
A new IBM (NYSE: IBM) consulting offering can help clients lower their
environmental impact, increase efficiency and reduce costs by applying
Lean Six Sigma principles to energy and water usage throughout their
operations.

    "There's a fundamental truth to understanding and improving any aspect of
a company's performance -- if you can't measure it, you can't manage it."
said Dave Lubowe, global leader of IBM's operations strategy consulting
practice. "This applies as much to a company's energy and water
consumption as it does to anything else, and our new offering can help
clients apply this principle to make their businesses greener."

    IBM's Green Sigma(TM) consulting offering is based on Lean Six Sigma, a
business strategy for carefully analyzing operations to improve overall
efficiency, lower costs, increase quality, and add, change or eliminate
activities and processes to improve overall performance.

    This new offering applies these principles wherever energy and water are
used throughout a client's operations -- transportation systems,
datacenters and IT systems, manufacturing and distribution centers, office
facilities, retail space, research and development sites, etc.

    The constraints and costs of energy and water usage are rising at an
accelerating rate, with a significant impact on business operations and
financial performance. In addition, companies are coming under increasing
pressure from governments, advocacy groups, investors, prospective
employees, and consumers to make their operations, products and services
more socially responsible, particularly regarding the environment.

    IBM's own conservation efforts have saved 4.6 billion kWh of electricity
and $310 million in costs, and avoided over three million metric tons of
CO2 emissions since 1990. The company's work-at-home program for employees
saves roughly eight million gallons of gasoline annually.

    Combining IBM's experience with energy efficiency and carbon reduction,
measurement and management dashboards, Lean Six Sigma processes and
corporate social responsibility consulting, Green Sigma(TM) allows
clients to apply this strategy to their operations and environmental
practices to:

    Manage and reduce carbon output and water inefficiencies;  Reduce energy
and water usage, and associated costs;  Use advanced analytical
techniques to establish ongoing carbon footprint and water management 
practices;  Increase profit through activities such as carbon trading. 

    Business leaders acknowledge the advantages that come from proactively
addressing corporate social responsibility issues like green. An IBM
global CSR survey of more than 250 c-suite executives showed that 68
percent of them already are focusing on CSR activities to create new
revenue streams and 54 percent believe CSR gives them a competitive
advantage. Additionally IBM's biennial global survey of more than 1,100
CEOs showed that the majority of them plan to increase their investments
in CSR by 25 percent over the next three years.

    Companies can ensure they are investing in the right CSR activities and
processes by using IBM's consulting offerings like Green Sigma(TM), which
consists of a five-phase approach to a client's operations and
environmental practices:

    Establish key performance indicators defined and tailored to the client's
operational environment, industry and business. Activities include
building key process indicator sets for carbon and water, including
regulatory and stakeholder requirements; 

    Identify areas where activities and practices should be measured. This
can include developing a facilities management plan and determining where
to use sensors to collect information for analysis; 

    Use a Carbon and Water Management Dashboard system to monitor key
performance indicators and analyze performance data. This can be linked to
other systems to help initiate processes such as carbon trading; 

    Apply Green Sigma(TM) statistical tools and techniques to analyze and
improve processes to reduce energy usage, carbon emissions and water
inefficiencies; 

    Create ongoing optimization of processes and key performance indicators
through the Carbon and Water Management Dashboard, and identifying new
areas where improvements can be made.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Aug 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced today that Shared Health(R), one of the
nation's largest public/private Health Information Exchanges (HIE) in the
U.S., is using IBM InfoSphere software and services to power its
newly-launched Clinical Xchange(TM) data exchange platform.

    Shared Health(R) Clinical Xchange(TM), built on IBM's information
integration software, improves healthcare clinicians' access to clinical
information, helping them operate more efficiently and deliver better
patient care. The IBM software enables a Web-based system that supports
millions of patients by merging key clinical data with administrative data
from numerous sources and formats.

    Information from Clinical Xchange can be accessed on demand in a secure
manner by patients and healthcare providers. Whether a patient visits a
primary care provider, specialist, or an emergency department, Shared
Health makes this important patient information available to accelerate
assessment, diagnosis and treatment.

    "We're in the business of integrating healthcare data and translating that
data into actionable information," said Kevin Janes, Shared Health's
Senior Solution Architect. "We chose IBM's InfoSphere software because it
provides the scalable, robust integration that we need to achieve our
goals and deliver immediate value to our customers."

    Underpinning Clinical Xchange is the Shared Health Clinical Health
Record(R), which maintains a comprehensive view of a patient's medical
history, supported by Shared Health's data warehouse. These information
resources are populated using the IBM InfoSphere Information Server
software platform, creating a common metadata repository that helps Shared
Health reuse information, ensure data governance and develop new services
more efficiently.

    Information Server helps staff understand the structure, content and
quality of data sources to uncover missing, inaccurate and inconsistent
data at the start of each data integration project. Shared Health then
collects, integrates and transforms data from its partners and makes it
available to providers. The IBM software also helps Shared Health
standardize the format of data such as names, addresses and phone numbers
while matching together data from across sources, to display a single
complete record in a unified format regardless of the sources.
Additionally, the software's common metadata foundation allows Shared
Health to share information collaboratively between business analysts and
code developers to reduce project cycles and improve business results.

    Information Server's ability to execute multiple processes in parallel has
also enabled Shared Health's IT staff to perform data analysis on an
entire database table consisting of millions of rows and hundreds of
columns in less than two hours. Previously, this would have taken more
than 24 hours to accomplish.

    Shared Health's system is hosted at an IBM data center operated by IBM
Global Technology Services.

    "In the wake of HIPAA, it's critical to our business to know that data is
secure and always available," Janes said. "The IBM data center provides
the stringent security and disaster recovery features we need to protect
patient data and make it available to providers when they need it."

    The combination of IBM software and services supports Shared Health's use
of information to improve patient care by combining and reconciling
information from various applications and sources. This use of information
is a focus of IBM's cross-company Information on Demand business strategy
that enables organizations like Shared Health to use its information
assets more effectively. Increased information flow helps to better
incorporate disparate internal and external information sources,
providing a seamless flow of information regardless of format, platform
or location. IBM InfoSphere software furthers this approach by delivering
trusted business information quickly and in a context appropriate to the
people, applications and business processes that rely on it.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN DIEGO, CA, Aug 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Today at the  TDWI World Conference, IBM (NYSE: IBM) introduced new
versions of two software products, part of its growing InfoSphere
portfolio, that deliver information on demand to the people, processes
and applications that rely on it. The new products help customers create
and manage trusted information from across their enterprises to improve
business performance.


 IBM is introducing a new version of its IBM
master data management software. The company is also releasing a new
version of IBM InfoSphere Information Server, which allows customers to
standardize and resolve multicultural name data. In addition, IBM is
offering enhanced globalization, extended mainframe support, and improved
ease-of-use with new automation features to simplify and speed
large-scale information integration projects across the globe.

    Getting a Grip on Product Information

    Master data management is a top priority for many companies as they try to
get control over their data -- their most valued and often most underused
asset. While master data -- which includes high-value information on
customers, products, suppliers, partners, materials, and employees -- is
critical for running a business, it is typically scattered across multiple
front and back-office systems and cannot be easily shared across an
enterprise.

    IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management Server for Product Information
Management (MDM Server for PIM) helps companies turn product information
into a strategic business asset. The new version of the software,
previously known as IBM WebSphere Product Center, allows customers to
maintain a single view of product information for use throughout an
organization as part of a comprehensive master data management strategy.
The software is capable of managing millions of products, including
product data that differs by geographic location.

    The new release of MDM Server for PIM provides several significant
enhancements that make it simpler to deploy and use. An improved user
interface makes it easier for users to interact with product information.
The software is also now integrated with InfoSphere Information Server so
that customers can take advantage of that product's data cleansing
capabilities to improve the quality of information managed by InfoSphere
MDM Server for PIM. In addition, improvements to the underlying technology
-- including use of the JAVA application protocol interface and easy
integration with enterprise solutions based on a service-oriented
architecture -- make MDM Server for PIM faster to roll out.

    Expanded Global Data and Project Support for InfoSphere Information Server

    To help businesses make more insightful decisions and serve customers more
effectively, IBM is adding its proven multicultural name resolution
technology, now called InfoSphere Global Name Recognition as a module of
the InfoSphere Information Server platform. This combination will help
businesses use Information Server to derive more information from
multicultural names and improve name matching using SOA enabled interfaces
to connect to name data across an enterprise. InfoSphere Global Name
Recognition uses sophisticated linguistics analysis gleaned from more than
a billion names from around the world, to help organizations better
identify and understand multicultural names. This added module, as well as
InfoSphere Information Server's expanded global address verification
support for more than 244 countries, provides organizations with
market-leading capabilities for dealing with multicultural names and
addresses.

    For example, Information Server can be used by banks, manufacturers or
retailers to support "Know Your Customer" efforts using global name
recognition, allowing them to counter fraudulent activities, offer better
customer service, and better understand their customer base from around
the world.

    Information Server now features extended global support for eight
languages, including French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian,
simplified and traditional Chinese, Japanese and Korean, allowing
developers to work with tools, documentation, online help, and error
messages in their native languages.

    In addition, enhanced support for grid deployment is included, allowing
organizations to more easily manage and ensure service level agreements
within Information Server when deployed across large server farms.

    Expanded SOA and Grid Support for InfoSphere Information Server

    To help clients share information across SOA projects, the new version of
InfoSphere Information Server allows reusable services to be easily
published for data access and data processing functions. It also includes
advanced security features supporting Web services standards, support for
Web 2.0 services using REST and RSS standards, as well as support for
direct service publishing from Oracle databases, InfoSphere Master Data
Management Server and mainframe data sources. It also automates
integration tasks, helping business and IT teams collaborate more
effectively and speeding project development.

    Support for grid environments has been enhanced, providing new automated
tools for managing and optimizing Information Server when it is deployed
across large-scale server farms.

    InfoSphere Information Integration Software for the Mainframe

    Enhancements to IBM InfoSphere Classic Replication Sever include stand
alone replication capabilities for a subset of mainframe data sources to
ensure high availability of critical information and to offload query
processing to a secondary environment for better system performance.

    Also announced today, IBM InfoSphere Classic Data Event Publisher provides
a new, file-based interface to InfoSphere Information Server in addition
to the existing IBM WebSphere MQ interface for changed-data delivery.
Enhancements enable lower latency capture of source data and ensure
replication accuracy.

    InfoSphere Classic Replication Server, InfoSphere Classic Data Event
Publisher and IBM InfoSphere Classic Federation Server each provide a new,
direct graphical user interface to easily view and alter mainframe
configuration settings. They include tooling extensions to help automate
creation of metadata and extend visual metadata to more complex scenarios.

    IBM InfoSphere software is available worldwide through IBM and IBM
Business Partners.

&lt;p&gt;"Early Warning" Service Gives Cardholders Extra Confidence and
Security
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa (NYSE:V), the global leader in payments, and eight leading
North American financial institutions - PNC Bank, SunTrust Bank, U.S.
Bank, Wachovia, and Wells Fargo in the United States, and Royal Bank
of Canada, TD Bank Financial Group, and Vancity in Canada - have
agreed to initiate a pilot program with up to a total of 2,000
participants to test the delivery of real-time notification alerts on
Visa accounts.

   The program, which is being conducted in cooperation with some of
the largest North American issuers, is designed to enhance the
consumer payment experience by alerting cardholders in real-time or
near real-time of transaction activity on their Visa account -
typically within seconds rather than hours or days. Participants will
receive notification alerts from Visa through email or Short Message
Service (SMS) delivered directly to their mobile devices.

   Based on Visa's state-of-the-art transaction authorization system,
and its ability to analyze and conduct risk score transactions
"in-flight," the service allows Visa cardholders to set thresholds
that will trigger a transaction alert. Alert types that Visa
cardholders may choose in the pilot include:

   --  cash withdrawal from an ATM machine;

   --  a transaction initiated cross border;

   --  an Internet or telephone transaction and

   --  a transaction that exceeds an amount that has been chosen by
        the cardholder.

   Through the alert received via email or SMS text, cardholders can
verify the transaction details, and if the transaction appears to be
irregular, can immediately contact their bank to help stop further
transactions on the card. The service is designed to help cardholders
keep closer track of their transactions and spending levels as they go
about their daily routine. According to a recent Javelin Strategy &amp;
Research report, consumers view timely alerts as a valuable resource
to help detect fraud.

   "Information is power, especially when delivered in a timely
manner," said Elizabeth Buse, Global Head of Product at Visa Inc.
"Visa already delivers real-time transaction risk scores to financial
institutions, and we are now empowering cardholders in this pilot with
real-time transaction alerts. Participating Visa cardholders can
typically receive alerts before they walk out of the store, rather
than hours or even days later."

   Visa's Mobile Platform

   Visa began testing mobile notifications in 2007, beginning with an
internal employee pilot. Mobile alerts are part of a suite of mobile
services that are supported by the Visa Mobile Platform, which was
created to help financial institutions tap into mobile technology to
deliver enhanced products and services. This effort comes as consumers
globally are relying on their mobile phones to do far more than just
handle calls. A recent Pew Research Centre report found that more than
80 percent of consumers between the ages of 18 and 49 use their mobile
devices to engage in activities such as sending text messages, taking
pictures and accessing the Internet.

   Worldwide, Visa's Mobile Platform is supporting mobile trials of:

   --  mobile payments made both at the point of sale (using Visa
        payWave technology) and away from it by permitting remote
        payments via text message or the Internet;

   --  value-added services, which in addition to account
        notification can include the delivery of offers, coupons and
        rewards directly to a consumer's mobile device;

   --  mobile acceptance, enabling mobile devices to accept Visa
        payments, thus extending the flexibility of merchants and

   --  money transfer, which allows cardholders to use their mobile
        device to electronically transfer money to family and friends
        around the world directly from their Visa accounts.

   Visa has announced mobile trials and commercial rollouts in
Brazil, Canada, Germany, India, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, the
United Kingdom and the United States.

   About Visa Inc.: Visa Inc. operates the world's largest retail
electronic payments network providing processing services and payment

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Paying Heavy Price For Texaco's Mistakes in Ecuador, Says Amazon Defense Coalition

    Talk of Settlement Reflects Dwindling Legal Options After Court
                   Expert Finds Damages in Billions
QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
Chevron's surprise announcement on Friday that it would be open to
talks to resolve a possible $16.3 billion liability for environmental
damage in Ecuador reflects the company's dwindling legal options in a
long-running lawsuit over who pays for the clean-up of what even
Chevron now acknowledges is a huge disaster, the Amazon Defense
Coalition said today.

   It also reflects how boxed in Chevron has become by a series of
questionable legal and operational decisions made years ago by Texaco,
a company Chevron bought in 2001 eight years after the Ecuador case
had been filed in U.S. federal court. Even though it had never
operated in Ecuador, Chevron has assumed defense of the case and will
bear any liability.

   Chevron voluntarily subjected itself to jurisdiction in Ecuador in
2002 as a condition of the case being transferred out of the U.S.
court and is likely bound by any ruling there. Chevron's statement on
Friday - that it would be open to "a fair and complete resolution" to
the Ecuador lawsuit if Ecuador's government also meets certain
conditions - was a marked departure from previous statements made by
company management that rejected all possibility of an out-of-court
settlement. It came after Ecuador's President, Rafael Correa, said in
a speech that the government would be willing to mediate talks between
the Amazon plaintiffs and Chevron.

   Correa said Chevron had approached his government about trying to
resolve the case, which went to trial in 2003 in the town of Lago
Agrio in Ecuador's Amazon region.

   Pablo Fajardo, the Ecuadorian lawyer for the plaintiffs, said he
and other representatives of the 30,000 Amazon plaintiffs welcomed
Chevron's statement but said they were fully focused on the actual
trial, which is expected to result in a judgment in 2009. A
court-appointed Special Master recently fixed damages at between $7.2
billion and $16.3 billion.

   Although Chevron claims it is the victim of an unfair judicial
process - a charge disputed by the plaintiffs, who blame the company
for years of delays and political interference in the trial -- there
is much more to Chevron's problems in the Ecuador case than the
company has let on publicly. For example:

   --  The evidence in the trial increasingly points to Chevron's
        guilt. The court's special master reviewed more than 70,000
        chemical sampling results and concluded that three different
        entities -- Chevron, the plaintiffs, and his own
        court-appointed technical team - had separately verified
        extensive levels of toxic contamination in soils and waters at
        100% of Texaco's former well sites in Ecuador inspected by the
        court. Some of the sites operated exclusively by Texaco
        contained toxins thousands of times higher than the maximum
        amounts permitted by law. Chevron, in other words, has helped
        to prove the case against itself.

   --  Texaco's original decision in the 1960s to dump highly toxic
        "produced water" into Amazon waterways instead of re-injecting
        it into underground wells is now haunting Chevron. All told,
        Texaco dumped 18.5 billion gallons in just over two decades -
        in the process, killing off much aquatic life and poisoning
        groundwater that the population relies on for drinking. The
        practice was not considered customary in the industry at the
        time and it had never been done in the Amazon rainforest,
        considered a highly delicate ecosystem.

   --  Texaco's decision in 1995 to try to end-run the pending
        lawsuit brought by Amazon communities in U.S. courts and pay
        $40 million to Ecuador's government for a so-called clean-up
        and release has backfired almost completely. Not only did the
        clean-up fail to address most contaminated sites, but trial
        results demonstrate clearly the sites that were "remediated"
        still have extensive levels of contamination. Texaco was given
        a "release" before any work was done. Two of Chevron's
        representatives are being investigated for fraud and
        corruption relating to the clean-up.

   --  The release Texaco received for the so-called clean-up - and
        on which Chevron hinges its defense -- has caused various
        problems for Chevron in various courts. The release
        specifically carved out the claims of private citizens who
        were not a party to the agreement. Chevron's claim to the
        contrary has never been accepted by any court, and its legal
        prospects on this important point seem dim.

   About the Amazon Defense Coalition

   The Amazon Defense Coalition represents dozens of rainforest
communities and five indigenous groups that inhabit Ecuador's Northern
Amazon region. The mission of the Coalition is to protect the
environment and secure social justice through grass roots organizing,
political advocacy, and litigation.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY and ANCHORAGE, AK, Aug 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
LitSite Alaska (www.litsite.org) -- an interactive Web site with a wealth
of information, insights and stories about the history, diversity,
culture and traditions of Alaskans -- is bringing native language and
stories to life using IBM (NYSE: IBM) cutting-edge speech technology.
Over 1,000 pages of text have been enhanced with audio files, using IBM
WebSphere Voice Server text-to-speech software. These audio files even
include uncommon pronunciations of Alaskan native names and words such as
KwaashKiKwaan, Tlingit, and Inupiaq.

    LitSite Alaska (http://www.litsite.org/), a project of the University of
Alaska Anchorage and the Alaska Literary Consortium, funded in part by
grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Rasmuson
Foundation, is working to "teach" the software proper pronunciation. One
of the challenges of using text-to-speech software is the uncommon
pronunciations of Alaska Native names and words. The oral tradition, an
integral part of the lives of Alaska Natives, is essential to learning and
to passing on cultural knowledge and life skills. Taking advantage of IBM
WebSphere Voice Server's flexibility and easy to use tools to create
custom pronunciations is helping to preserve Alaska Native words and
making them available to the world on the Web.

    "LitSite Alaska uses narrative to inspire learning and community
building," said Ronald Spatz, professor and Dean of the University Honors
College at the University of Alaska Anchorage. "We bring people together
through storytelling and are using IBM's technology to give voice to
hundreds of stories about Alaska and the lives of Alaskans contained
within our vast and growing archive."

    "If we had to record all of the stories ourselves, the process would be
too costly and time consuming," said Spatz. "But with WebSphere Voice
Server, we can convert a page of text quickly and efficiently. For a
not-for-profit site, the savings in time and resources are enormous.
LitSite Alaska is leveraging IBM's technology to produce more audio
content than its small staff of freelancers and contract workers could do
on its own."

    "Alaskan storytelling is an art form and LitSite is playing a critical
role in continuing the tradition of preserving Alaskan culture," said
Kareem Yusuf, IBM Director of Product Management, WebSphere Software. "As
a leader in speech technology, IBM is pleased to be playing a role in
bringing Alaskan tradition to life on the Web through vocalizing
traditional stories and native language."

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY and ANCHORAGE, AK, Aug 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
LitSite Alaska (www.litsite.org) -- an interactive Web site with a wealth
of information, insights and stories about the history, diversity,
culture and traditions of Alaskans -- is bringing native language and
stories to life using IBM (NYSE: IBM) cutting-edge speech technology.
Over 1,000 pages of text have been enhanced with audio files, using IBM
WebSphere Voice Server text-to-speech software. These audio files even
include uncommon pronunciations of Alaskan native names and words such as
KwaashKiKwaan, Tlingit, and Inupiaq.

    LitSite Alaska (http://www.litsite.org/), a project of the University of
Alaska Anchorage and the Alaska Literary Consortium, funded in part by
grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Rasmuson
Foundation, is working to "teach" the software proper pronunciation. One
of the challenges of using text-to-speech software is the uncommon
pronunciations of Alaska Native names and words. The oral tradition, an
integral part of the lives of Alaska Natives, is essential to learning and
to passing on cultural knowledge and life skills. Taking advantage of IBM
WebSphere Voice Server's flexibility and easy to use tools to create
custom pronunciations is helping to preserve Alaska Native words and
making them available to the world on the Web.

    "LitSite Alaska uses narrative to inspire learning and community
building," said Ronald Spatz, professor and Dean of the University Honors
College at the University of Alaska Anchorage. "We bring people together
through storytelling and are using IBM's technology to give voice to
hundreds of stories about Alaska and the lives of Alaskans contained
within our vast and growing archive."

    "If we had to record all of the stories ourselves, the process would be
too costly and time consuming," said Spatz. "But with WebSphere Voice
Server, we can convert a page of text quickly and efficiently. For a
not-for-profit site, the savings in time and resources are enormous.
LitSite Alaska is leveraging IBM's technology to produce more audio
content than its small staff of freelancers and contract workers could do
on its own."

    "Alaskan storytelling is an art form and LitSite is playing a critical
role in continuing the tradition of preserving Alaskan culture," said
Kareem Yusuf, IBM Director of Product Management, WebSphere Software. "As
a leader in speech technology, IBM is pleased to be playing a role in
bringing Alaskan tradition to life on the Web through vocalizing
traditional stories and native language."

&lt;p&gt;  YORKTOWN HEIGHTS, NY, Aug 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced the availability of state-of-the-art
speech recognition software to clients and partners exploring the
development of real-world consumer and business solutions.

    As part of an effort to bring IBM Research's vaunted intellectual capital
directly into the marketplace, the opening of IBM Research's speech assets
will make it easier for IBM customers and partners to gain a competitive
advantage in new markets by integrating the industry's most advanced
speech recognition software.

    "One of the unique ways IBM Research stays ahead of the competition is by
looking at innovations that will have a real-world impact," said David
Nahamoo, IBM Fellow and CTO Speech Technology, IBM Research. "Now, through
our collaborative model, we are helping the IT market explore new growth
opportunities enabled by our state-of-the-art speech technologies and
solutions."

    More than 15 years after the introduction of IBM's first dictation
products a lot has changed. Now, IBM speech software allows consumers to
interact with car navigation and entertainment systems; transforms the
way patients receive healthcare; helps children learn to read; enables
companies to gain new business insights and improve customer service
through interactions with their clients and allows people to communicate
with others who speak different languages.

    Today, IBM's speech technology is being utilized in the emerging areas of
voice search and interaction, transcription for voicemail and accessible
education, language conversion and business intelligence.

    "Speech is becoming increasingly equivalent to text due to decades of
research investment such as that of IBM Research. Improved performance and
tools for interpreting the resulting text are driving rapid growth, for
example, of speech as an interface to mobile phones," said Dr. Bill
Meisel, President TMA Associates. "One particularly effective approach is
the Voice Search model -- just say what you want and get it -- to shorten
transactions. Transcription of voicemail and call-center conversations to
text makes it possible to quickly search and analyze the result, creating
new growth and flexibility in unified communications and customer-service
analytics."

    IBM's worldwide network of research and development laboratories continues
to be focused on solutions that address customers' and consumers'
communication challenges. These labs are responsible for some of the
world's most promising emerging technologies -- technologies that have the
potential to transform the way we all live and work.

&lt;p&gt;DAKAR (Reuters) - Cocaine smuggling is fanning political turbulence and undermining investment confidence in West Africa, where drugs experts say Latin American gangs threaten to transform small nations into "narco-states".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unexpected seizures from Guinea-Bissau and Mauritania to Sierra Leone and Senegal illustrate a haphazard response to drugs syndicates that run rings around law enforcement agencies despite help from the United States and European countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The danger comes at a critical time for West Africa, where several states are rebuilding after civil wars and the region is of growing interest to the most adventurous frontier investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a huge threat," said Emmanuelle Bernard, West Africa analyst at the International Crisis Group think-tank. "The money from the drug trade is competing with the institution-building, which is what these countries need to be doing now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When there are those in power who are involved in the drug trade, its hard to do this," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowhere better shows up the dangerous combination of drug money and a weak state than Guinea Bissau. Death threats against a minister fighting the drug trade were followed by a coup attempt and the arrest of the head of the navy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cops and training are fine but we also need people to come up with things like guns, armoured cars and money for informants," said Antonio Mazzitelli, the West Africa representative of the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guinea-Bissau's justice minister says she will fight on. She survived a government reshuffle triggered by a constitutional crisis that forced President Joao Bernardo Vieira to dissolve parliament and appoint a new cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But her judicial police, with few weapons or vehicles and little ammunition or fuel, are no match for international criminal networks. Despite the support of U.S. FBI and DEA agents, they were blocked by the armed forces from searching a suspect jet that landed in Bissau last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they were eventually given a green light, sniffer dogs confirmed cocaine had been on board, but the jet was empty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mazzitelli says this shows how busts must be the end, not the beginning of investigations. It also added weight to widespread reports that state officials are involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Loyalties in the armed forces can be strengthened by the drug money," said Bernard. "Some might fear that they will lose out while others might see it as an opportunity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tiny West African nation, where there is no electricity but Porsche and Mercedes four wheel drive vehicles ferry some state officials down the potholed streets, may be the extreme but it is a microcosm of the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WEAK AUTHORITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traffickers take advantage of poorly protected borders and weak authority to ferry hundreds of millions of dollars worth of cocaine from Latin America to Europe, a short hop to the north.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although they represent a fraction of the actual amount of cocaine passing through, the region has seen seizures jump from just 273kg in 2001 to 14.6 tonnes in 2006, according to the U.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West African seizures are increasing when the global trend is downwards. But more of a concern, say analysts, is the relative impact the drug money can have on these weak countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One haul last year of 600kg of cocaine found in the boot of a car in Guinea-Bissau had a street value equivalent to about 10 percent of the country's GDP of $340 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weakness of states recovering from wars is a particular advantage for the drug traffickers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is in the interests of the criminal networks to maintain a limbo where things don't really work but there is not complete chaos," said Bernard of the International Crisis Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sierra Leone has been commended for its post-war recovery but its transport minister is being investigated by police after his brother was arrested following the seizure last month of 700 kg of cocaine at the country's main airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, a ship flying the flag of Liberia, another nation recovering from years of war, was seized off the coast with 2.5 tonnes of cocaine onboard, adding weight to U.N. concerns that it was also being targeted by traffickers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is not only the recovering states that are caught up in the drug trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghana is seen as one of Africa's most stable democracies and a darling of investors scrambling for assets on the continent, but has also become a big staging point for drugs -- as the arrest of two British teenage girls for smuggling last year made clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disappearance in 2006 of two tonnes of cocaine being held by police after a seizure aboard a ship led to an official investigation, accusations and recriminations that still reverberate among Ghana's officials and security chiefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High commodity prices are attracting billions of dollars in investment to West Africa from companies seeking mines rich in everything from gold and bauxite to iron ore and diamonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mazzitelli, from the U.N. drugs office, said the drugs trade was a significant threat to any sort of investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Other than predatory investment, who will invest in a country where the rule of law does not exist?" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For full Reuters Africa coverage and to have your say on the top issues, visit: africa.reuters.com)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Matthew Tostevin)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aug 18 (Reuters) - Cocaine smuggling is fanning instability in West Africa. Here are some of the key facts about the trade and details of the region's biggest seizures: * United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime (UNODC) figures show cocaine seizures in the region have risen from 273kg in 2001 to 14.6 tonnes in 2006. This goes against a global decline in seizures in the last three years. * Cocaine has long been trafficked from West Africa but the trade has moved from the ferrying of small quantities, usually by couriers known as mules, to transporting industrial scale shipments weighing hundreds of kg and worth millions of dollars. * The shift in routes used by the Latin American traffickers is due partly to improved law enforcement in the Caribbean and on U.S. routes and increased demand in Europe. * The price of cocaine per kilogramme ranges between $12,000 and $17,000 across West Africa but increases to $65,000 in Madrid and can fetch $110,000 once it reaches Stockholm, according to UNODC data. * The traffickers have identified West Africa as a prime transit point as it hosts a collection of weak states with poorly controlled borders and corruptible public officials. * Guinea Bissau emerged as one of the weakest countries on the frontline of the drugs trade with two seizures in September 2006 and April 2007, both of which involved in excess of 600 kg of cocaine. Several Latin American smugglers and their local accomplices who were arrested in the seizures escaped or were freed, to the outrage of international crime experts. * Mauritania, with its long coastline heading north towards Europe, has also been used by traffickers. A haul of 629 kg was seized in May 2007, followed by another of 864 kg on Aug. 14 the same year. * Senegal also made two significant seizures with 1.2 tonnes found on an empty sailing boat in the seaside resort of Nianing on June 29, 2007 followed by another, just two days later, of 1.25 tonnes. * On the same day as the second Senegalese seizure, two British teenage girls were arrested in Ghana for trying to board a plane to Britain with 6 kg of cocaine hidden in laptop bags. They were later convicted and spent a year in detention. * As well as the marine and coastal routes, traffickers use ancient trading routes north across the Sahara, where smugglers, rebels and terrorists have rendered state authority almost non-existent. Malian authorities seized 750 kg in the remote north of the country after a gunbattle on Jan 3, 2008. * On Jan 31, 2008, a French navy warship intercepted Liberian-flagged ship carrying 2.5 tonnes of cocaine off its coastal capital, Monrovia. * The most recent big seizure took place last month when about 700 kg of cocaine were seized on July 13 at Lungi international airport in Sierra Leone. The country's transport minister has been suspended after his brother was arrested in connection with the drugs.  (Reporting by David Lewis; editing by Alistair Thomson)

&lt;p&gt;  YORKTOWN HEIGHTS, NY, Aug 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and its joint development partners -- AMD, Freescale,
STMicroelectronics, Toshiba and the College of Nanoscale Science and
Engineering (CNSE) -- today announced the first working static random
access memory (SRAM) for the 22 nanometer (nm) technology node, the
world's first reported working cell built at its 300mm research facility
in Albany, NY.

    SRAM chips are precursors to more complex devices such as microprocessors.

    The SRAM cell utilizes a conventional six-transistor design and has an
area of 0.1um2, breaking the previous SRAM scaling barriers.

    Researchers achieved this breakthrough at CNSE of the University at
Albany, State University of New York. CNSE's Albany NanoTech is the
world's most advanced university based nanoelectronics research complex.
IBM and its partners do much of their leading-edge semiconductor research
at CNSE.

    A nanometer is one one-billionth of a meter or about 80,000 times smaller
than the width of a human hair.

    "We are working at the ultimate edge of what is possible -- progressing
toward advanced, next-generation semiconductor technologies," said Dr.
T.C. Chen, vice president of Science and Technology, IBM Research. "This
new development is a critical achievement in the pursuit to continually
drive miniaturization in microelectronics."

    22 nm is two generations away in chip manufacturing. The next generation
is 32 nm -- where IBM and its partners are in development with their
leading 32 nm high-K metal gate technology that no other company or
consortium can match.

    Traditionally, an SRAM chip is made more dense by shrinking its basic
building block, often referred to as a cell. IBM-alliance researchers
optimized the SRAM cell design and circuit layout to improve stability and
developed several novel fabrication processes in order to make the new
SRAM cell possible. The researchers utilized high-NA immersion
lithography to print the aggressive pattern dimensions and densities and
fabricated the parts in its a state-of-the-art 300mm semiconductor
research environment.

    SRAM cell size is a key technology metric in the semiconductor industry,
and this work demonstrates IBM and its partners' continued leadership in
cutting-edge process technology.

    Key enablers of the SRAM cell include band edge high-K metal gate stacks,
transistors with less than 25 nm gate lengths, thin spacers, novel
co-implants, advanced activation techniques, extremely thin silicide, and
damascene copper contacts.

    Additional details of this achievement will be presented at the IEEE
International Electron Devices (IEDM) annual technical meeting to be held
in San Francisco, CA, December 15-17, 2008.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Goldman Sachs)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aug 18 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Goldman Sachs
(GS.N) are responding to the credit crisis with a system that
uses the market's view of their own creditworthiness as a basis
for lending decisions, the Financial Times reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street's second-largest investment bank Morgan Stanley
is essentially tying its promise to provide financing to hedge
fund clients to the price of credit insurance on its own debt,
it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the cost of the protection rises to a certain level, that
would trigger a reduction in Morgan Stanley's commitments to
hedge funds, the quoted people familiar with the situation as
saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The message is that "if our firm is in trouble, we would
rather fund ourselves than fund you (hedge funds)," the paper
quoted a brokerage executive with knowledge of the arrangements
as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs, which has largely avoided the credit losses
hobbling its rivals, is understood to have a similar arrangement
that uses its bond prices as a reference point for credit
commitments to hedge fund clients, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs did not immediately return
calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)

securities and pay fines to settle charges that they misled
investors about the debt's risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley had agreed to buy back $4.5 billion of debt
and pay a $35 million fine to settle the charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In June, it reported a 57 percent drop in quarterly earnings
on weak trading, investment losses and a slowdown in investment
banking, even after it realised $1.43 billion in one-time gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said last week that it had racked up $1.5 billion
of losses so far in the third quarter mortgage-linked assets,
reflecting deepening turmoil in credit markets.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) plans to spend $300 million this year to build 13 "cloud computing" data centers where businesses can store information for quick retrieval in case their computer systems are destroyed in a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing refers to services accessed via the Web that seem to exist in a cloud over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The computing giant, which will unveil the plan on Wednesday, is building the sites in 10 countries, including China, Japan, Turkey, Poland, France and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has so far rolled out the cloud-computing data recovery technology to fewer than five of its 154 existing data centers, the oldest of which was built more than 40 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology encrypts data on computers, automatically sending it to IBM's cloud computing center over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a customer's computer breaks down or a data center is destroyed, lost data can be restored via the Web in two to six hours, IBM Vice President Mike Riegel said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older technology known as "data mirroring" is far more expensive than cloud-computing technology and relies on two sets of data in two locations. But it also allows for systems to be restored in less than an hour, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's rivals in this area include Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and privately held SunGard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds outlook, details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MELBOURNE Aug 20 (Reuters) - Australian soft drinks group
Coca-Cola Amatil reported a 7 percent rise in first-half profit
on Wednesday, in line with market forecasts, as it sold more
drinks in Australia, New Zealand and Indonesia, and reaffirmed
its full year guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The group, which also sells alcoholic drinks, bottled
water, canned fruits and jams, said it still expected high
single-digit growth in earnings before interest and tax in the
second half before one-offs, with a target of around 7 percent
EBIT growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net profit before one-offs rose to A$171.9 million ($149
million) for the six months to June from A$160.9 million a year
earlier. Four analysts on average had expected a net profit of
A$169.4 million, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amatil said it expected its cost of goods sold per case to
rise by just over 3 percent for the full year, and would
continue to try to recover those increases from its customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It plans to invest between A$20 million and A$25 million in
the Bluetongue brewery, and a further A$30 million to A$35
million next year, through its Pacific Beverages joint venture
with SABMiller Plc (SAB.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Australia in the first half, operating earnings grew 10
percent, with a recovery in the second quarter after a hit from
heavy discounting by its main competitor in supermarket sales
in the first quarter. Volumes grew 2 percent in the first half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While analysts had been concerned about the slowing New
Zealand economy, the company said it sold 3 percent more drinks
there in the first half, increased pricing and extracted cost
savings to boost operating earnings by 18 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Indonesia, earnings tripled to $10.4 million, on volume
growth of nearly 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola Amatil Chief Executive Terry Davis has said the
group is interested in buying Cadbury Plc's CBRY.L Australian
Cadbury Schweppes drinks business. Cadbury put the business,
which has around 300 million pounds ($558 million) in annual
sales, up for review in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Coca-Cola Amatil, 30 percent owned by the
Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), have fallen 16 percent so far this year,
outperforming a 21 percent slide in the broader market

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, quotes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Jeffrey Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, Alberta Aug 19 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N)
will sign a deal with Newfoundland on Wednesday to develop the
long-delayed Hebron oil field in the North Atlantic, the
Canadian province's fourth offshore producing project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The local oil service industry, which has been anxiously
awaiting Hebron's start since the project was rekindled more
than a year ago, is watching closely for any changes to
development plans that might result from the inflation that has
plagued the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Previous plans have called for production of about 170,000
barrels a day from the field, located in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin
in the Atlantic Ocean, about 350 km (220 miles) southeast of
St. John's, Newfoundland. Costs have been estimated as high as
C$6 billion ($5.7 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Officials with the Newfoundland  Labrador Oil  Gas
Industries Association said the kickoff of Hebron has created
"a lot of fuss and bother" in industry circles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a major project, by not only Newfoundland
standards but by international standards," NOIA Chief Executive
Bob Cadigan said by telephone from St. John's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a C$4 billion to C$6 billion development, a project
spend of C$7 billion to C$11 billion over the life of the
project, so it's going to create a significant amount of
activity for our members."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Premier Danny Williams will join Natural Resources Minister
Kathy Dunderdale and the heads of Chevron Canada and its
partners in a ceremony in St. John's, the government said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for Chevron's Canadian unit declined to give
any details about what may have changed in the project's scope,
but Cadigan said he does not foresee major changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The formal deal comes a year after the outspoken Williams
and the companies agreed to a memorandum of understanding to
give Newfoundland a 4.9 percent stake in the field for C$110
million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Chevron and its partners had balked at the government
taking a share in the 731 million barrel field, but eventually
agreed before the province enacted legislation demanding a 10
percent stake in all new oil and gas projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Williams has crusaded for a bigger share of oil wealth for
several years, saying oil companies and Ottawa were raking in
huge profits while Newfoundlanders got short-changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hebron, which Chevron discovered in 1981, would follow the
Hibernia, Terra Nova and White Rose projects, which can
collectively produce up to nearly 500,000 barrels a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plans have called for a concrete gravity base structure to
be built at Newfoundland's Bull Arm construction site, where
Hibernia's massive GBS was built in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hebron is co-owned by Petro-Canada PCA.TO, Exxon Mobil
Corp (XOM.N) and StatoilHydro (STL.OL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cadigan said a new rush of activity has started in the East
Coast oil industry as Hebron gets under way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other projects include Husky Energy Inc's (HSE.TO) C$1.3
billion North Amethyst extension at White Rose, the planned
Hibernia South project, which still requires government
approval, and a proposed C$2 billion expansion of Harvest
Energy Trust's HTE_u.TO Come-by-Chance refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think the spigot is definitely open," Cadigan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=$1.06 Canadian)

Yosufzai, president of Chevron Global Marketing. "It has served our
Texaco and Havoline brands well. We value the partnership and
professionalism of our NASCAR teams and the support that our loyal
NASCAR fans have provided over the years.

   "NASCAR has been a first class experience for us, due in large
part to Chip Ganassi Racing with Felix Sabates (CGRFS). We wish them
the best in their pursuit of the Cup."

   "We are pleased to have represented Texaco and Havoline over the
past five years," said Chip Ganassi, owner, CGRFS. "Despite the
success of our partnership, we understand that priorities change and
wish Chevron the best in implementing its new marketing initiatives."

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Shares of casino operators fell sharply on Tuesday amid concerns that the Chinese government may act to curtail visits by mainlanders to Macau, the only place in China where gambling is legal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Las Vegas Sands Corp (LVS.N) were down more than 11 percent, MGM Mirage (MGM.N) fell by about the same amount and Wynn Resorts (WYNN.O) fell 6.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portuguese news agency Lusa, quoting unnamed sources, reported on Tuesday that the Chinese government may tighten individual visas to Macau to one visit every six months from the current limit of one every two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From the tone of the article and talking with our sources on the ground, we do not think the government has made a final decision yet," Morgan Stanley analyst Celeste Mellet Brown said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said the government has made it clear that it is determined to slow the strong gaming revenue growth seen in Macau and Morgan Stanley is forecasting year-over-year growth to drop from 50 percent in the first half of this year to around 25 percent in the second half and to 16 percent in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, China limited Macau visas under its individual visit scheme to once every two months. In addition, starting in September, mainland residents will no longer be able to enter Macau on a Hong Kong visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The potential for China to continue to slow visitation (and hence gaming revenues) in Macau underscores a major risk of operating in this region," Lehman Brothers analyst Felicia Hendrix said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jefferies  Co analyst Larry Klatzkin cautioned that the potential limits have not been officially announced and he is hearing that the proposed restrictions would only be for Guangdong province.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are forecasting Macau gaming revenue growth of only 9.1 percent for the second half of 2008 and a decline of 8.3 percent in the first half of 2009," he said in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Wynn fell $6.94, or 6.91 percent, to $93.45 on Nasdaq. MGM lost $3.50, or 11.18 percent, to trade at $27.80 and Sands dropped $5.93, or 11.64 percent, to $45.00, both on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The central tenet of our 'Don't buy AIG' argument is simple: the intricacies of AIG's business are so complex that management may not even know the extent of the company's ultimate exposures, let alone losses," analyst Thomas Cholnoky said in a note dated August 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholnoky, who cut his price target on the stock to $23 from $30, cautioned investors that many uncertainties remain, though AIG shares may appear intriguing at current levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said his view is based on the downward spiral which is likely to ensue as more actual cash losses emanate from the financial products segment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyst said he foresees $9 billion to $20 billion in economic losses from the credit default swaps, which could result in even larger cash outlays, resulting in a significant shift in the risk quality of AIG's assets, forcing rating downgrades, and then large-scale capital raises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"....the cash outlays will be large and the rating agencies will ultimately dictate the level of capital the company may need to cover such losses," Cholnoky said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholnoky rated the stock "neutral" and said with the inevitable large-scale cash call which would accompany losses from financial products, the rating agencies are likely putting off the inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue of losses in AIG's investment portfolio is as potentially troublesome as the losses in financial products, Cholnoky said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOTHING TO FEAR BUT MORTGAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, AIG reported its third consecutive quarterly loss of more than $5 billion, stemming from further declines in the value of assets linked to subprime mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We note that each quarter's disclosures continue to provide incrementally concerning information regarding dangerous exposures," Cholnoky said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIG has recorded nearly $25 billion in unrealized market losses from credit default swaps that guaranteed risky mortgage-backed debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm has already raised in excess of $20 billion in capital, but ended the second quarter with less capital than at the end of the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Goldman analyst said downgrades to AIG's credit or financial strength ratings would trigger collateral calls and accelerated payments, damage to insurance operations, and increased costs for raising capital that would be necessary to bolster the firm's balance sheet strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is very little to suggest that the mortgage market will stabilize in the next six weeks, which indicates that third-quarter earnings could once again be volatile, Cholnoky added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of AIG were trading down $1.50 at $20.10 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Before Tuesday's change, they have fallen about 62 percent since the start of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Eric Yep in Bangalore; Editing by Jarshad Kakkrakandy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary: Sunwest Trust, Inc. is known for its services in the
Escrow and the Self Directed IRA market. Under the supervision of
Chief Executive Officer, Terry White, Sunwest Trust has hit the market
with a new record, breaking its own previous record, which was set
previously in better economical conditions.
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.--(Business Wire)--
Sunwest Trust, Inc. (the "Company"), the only New Mexico company
acting as an escrow agent and IRA custodian, has achieved a new record
by opening up new accounts. July is the eventful month that ended with
the hiring of new people to serve better.

   Sunwest Trust offers a wide range of retirement and self directed
plans such as Roth IRAs, Spousal and Traditional IRAs, SEPs, and
SIMPLEs. It offers direct investment within the retirement accounts
and allows their clients to invest in a number of things, including,
but not limited to sales and purchase of real estate, mortgages,
publicly traded stocks, bonds, private limited liability companies,
mutual funds, secured and unsecured notes and more. Credited to this
diverse range of plans and options, the Company witnessed an
unprecedented rise in demand to open up new accounts, leading the
Company to set a new record in July for newly opened accounts.

   Following this record breaking performance, the Company announces
the induction of three new employees. Casey Love, Natalie Rodriguez
and Sandra McBride are going to contribute in different departments.
Casey Love, a bachelor's degree holder in Secondary Education with a
minor in English from the University of New Mexico will work in the
IRA Department. Natalie Rodriguez, a California native, brings nine
years experience in the escrow and title businesses. Sandra McBride is
the third addition who will be handling the Customer Service
Department. In addition to her job as Customer Service Representative,
she is attending school part time to obtain a bachelor's degree in
Business.

   With the recent upsurge, Sunwest Trust now services over $900
million in assets and provides services to over 14,000 individuals and
companies. The company management has expressed the hope that the
trend will continue in coming months as well.

   "We are happy with our progress and we are excited about the
growth during a cooler economy and during an election year. I expect
to continue to see increased growth over the coming months and years
as more boomers and investors get closer to retirement, look to truly
diversify, and shift a portion of their funds out of the market and
into the local real estate market," Terry White, CEO Sunwest Trust,
says with confidence.

   The statement of Terry White attests the fact that the Company is
relying upon boomers which actually are more than 75 million in U.S.
As boomers get closer to retirement, they look for alternatives to
invest their money in order to have a secure future. By counting on
this fact, management is pretty hopeful that the trend of increased
demand, with boomers investing more, will continue in coming months
and years.

&lt;p&gt;
SAN JOSE, Calif., Aug. 19, 2008 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Magma(r) Design Automation
Inc. (Nasdaq:LAVA), a provider of chip design software, today announced it has
extended the reach of its QuickCap(r) NX parasitic capacitance extraction
software. IBM(r) (NYSE:IBM) is now utilizing the software for its 45-nanometer
(nm) and 65-nm process technologies. IBM is also using QuickCap NX for
extraction qualification to deliver silicon-accurate parasitic data to designers
who manufacture their integrated circuits in Common Platform foundries.

In addition to correlating full-chip parasitics, QuickCap NX is now also used to
correlate device-level and top-level interconnect extraction data to 3-D
extraction data across all IBM technologies, including CMOS, silicon-germanium
(SiGe) and silicon on insulator (SOI), and spanning all design types, including
digital, analog and mixed signal. QuickCap NX validates not only simple metal
configurations, but also more complex transistor-level structures, which are
traditionally difficult to verify with sufficient accuracy.

"The QuickCap NX 3D extraction reference provides the fast, device-level and
top-level interconnect parasitic extraction that we require," said Matt Graf,
IBM manager of PDK Development. "We are expanding use of the software to the
45-nm and 65-nm process technologies to achieve dial-in accuracy and
error-bounds reporting, giving us highly accurate results."

"IBM's decision to utilize QuickCap NX for not only parasitic extraction but
also device-level and top-level extraction for its leading-edge processes
reinforces QuickCap NX's position as the industry standard," said Premal Buch,
general manager of Product Development of Magma's Design Implementation Business
Unit. "Working with leading semiconductor providers like IBM enables Magma to
improve QuickCap NX to meet the requirements of new silicon technologies."

QuickCap NX: Gold Standard of Extraction

QuickCap NX is used by major semiconductor companies as the reference standard
for parasitic, device-level and top-level interconnect extraction. It is a
highly accurate 3D extractor that precisely models advanced process effects such
as optical proximity correction (OPC), chemical-metal polishing (CMP) and
trapezoidal wires. QuickCap NX is proven to closely correlate to exact
analytical solutions and silicon measurements, delivering capacitance values
that are within one percent of silicon measurements.

It is the only extractor that provides dial-in accuracy and error-bounds
reporting on each net, giving the user complete control and trust in the
accuracy of results. Leading foundries have validated QuickCap NX's ability to
more closely match silicon measurements. By taking process effects into account,
the average difference between QuickCap NX capacitance values and actual silicon
measurements has been reduced from 9.79 percent to just 0.11 percent.

QuickCap NX in the Magma Flow

QuickCap NX can be used for post-layout analysis in the Magma flow. QuickCap
technology is also incorporated into the Talus(r) Vortex physical design
software systems to support highly accurate timing and noise analysis during
chip implementation. It is used to compute the highly accurate capacitance rules
used within Talus and the Quartz(tm) RC sign-off extraction tool.

About Magma

&lt;p&gt;  LOS ALTOS, CA, Aug 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Internet Research Group (IRG) today announced the release of its latest
report on technology infrastructure, "Why Microsoft Virtualization is
Different (and possibly better)."

    With this summer's launch of Hyper-V, Microsoft began shipping its long
awaited entry into the server virtualization market in competition with
VMware's ESX, the market leader. This new research report compares
Microsoft's quite distinct virtualization strategy to that of VMware as
the two companies battle to win enterprise customers.

    "As the old saying goes, if all you have is a hammer then everything is a
nail," noted Peter Christy, co-founder of IRG. "VMware has built a very
successful business around the hypervisor and virtual machine, and not
surprisingly expresses its strategy that way. Microsoft has a much broader
set of products, and sees virtualization just as one element in their
effort to improve IT effectiveness. Is this all just marketing spin or is
there real substance here?"

    This report compares the business value focus of Microsoft and VMware as
they continue to develop market opportunities for their virtualization
products.

    Vendors directly impacted by Microsoft's virtualization market entry
include: Citrix, HP, IBM, EMC, Parallels, Virtual Iron and VMware. One
step removed most IT participants are impacted by virtualization and this
business competition.

    The study is available now. A table of contents for this study can be
found at www.irg-intl.com.

&lt;p&gt; (Corrects DSG International RIC in last line)

 (Recasts; adds details)

 Aug 19 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded several Europe
retail stocks, including Carrefour (CARR.PA) and Metro AG
(MEOG.DE), as it revised its stock selection/valuation
methodology to partly reflect opportunities for mergers and
acquisitions in the sector.

 Market consensus is predominantly bearish, with many stocks
in the sector trading well below historical lows, the brokerage
said.

"We see potential for mean reversion to historical average
multiples (average of P/E and EV/EBITDA for the past five
years) in those cases where we see good earnings
visibility...," the brokerage wrote in a note.

 On MA opportunities, Goldman said, "We start from the
assumption that assets have reached attractive levels of
valuation and that the current operating environment could
drive consolidation among the challenged players."

 The brokerage said it prefers companies with global
presence and superior pricing power within the general retail
and luxury goods sector. In the food retail sector, Goldman
Sachs said it would stick by names that can outgrow cost
pressures and improve margins.

 It added Belgian supermarket group Delhaize and British
clothing retailer Next to its conviction buy list.

 However, it added Stockmann (STCBV.HE) to its conviction
sell list, citing the Finnish department store group's heavy
investment plan, lower potential MA support and increased
economic uncertainty in the Nordic and Baltic regions.

 The various rating changes by Goldman are listed below:
 Stock                      New            Old
 Delhaize (DELB.BR)         Buy            Neutral
 Next Plc (NXT.L)           Buy            Neutral
 Carrefour (CARR.PA)        Buy            Neutral Kesa
Electricals KESA.L  Buy            Sell Metro AG (MEOG.DE)

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - First Marblehead Corp (FMD.N) shares
soared by more than half on Monday as a Goldman Sachs (GS.N)
fund completed an equity investment in the student finance
company, which has been hit hard by student loan losses and a
frozen asset-backed securities market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; First Marblehead also said Daniel Meyers, who co-founded
the company in 1991, would return next month as president and
chief executive. It said Jack Kopnisky, who succeeded Meyers as
CEO in 2005, resigned and will depart at the end of August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In December, GS Capital Partners agreed to buy a stake in
First Marblehead in two parts, starting with the purchase of
$59.8 million of convertible preferred shares, to be followed
by the purchase of $200.7 million of common stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company, which for years made its living by packaging
loans originated by other banks into securities, saw its shares
reach a high of $42 last October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the breakdown of securitized-loan markets, plus the
demise of TERI, a non-profit group that guaranteed First
Marblehead's offerings, sent the company's shares tumbling more
than 90 percent over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Because of the decline in First Marblehead's value, the
Goldman fund cut its second purchase to $132.7 million. That
investment, completed on Monday, sent First Marblehead shares
soaring $1.54 to $4.54, their highest price since April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's private equity arm now owns a little over 13.1
percent of First Marblehead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The investment "provides First Marblehead with liquidity
and financial flexibility in an environment where other
institutions are stepping away from their willingness to help
students," Meyers said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the absence of securitization deals -- First Marblehead
has not completed one since last year -- the company wants to
expand its direct student lending, loan processing and other
services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it expects to report a net loss of $57
million, or 57 cents a share, for its fiscal fourth quarter
ended June 30. Actual results, including a net loss of $235
million for fiscal 2008, will be announced on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First Marblehead said the losses were driven largely by the
continued dislocation in the market for bonds backed by private
student loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by John Wallace and Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA, Aug 20 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
New England Credit Union(2) (NECU), Australia's largest inland regional
community credit union with more than 51,000 members, has chosen a
unified communications solution from Nortel(1)(TSX: NT)(NYSE: NT) and
Microsoft(2) to reduce business costs and improve customer service.

    The new technology solution which will go live in early September is
expected to save the company a minimum of A$100,000 a year through a
combination of increased productivity, reduced travel time and
time-saving functionality. Nortel's open architecture supports
integration of business voice services with NECU's Tandberg video
conferencing system to deliver video-to-the-desktop functionality and
Microsoft's desktop software enabling click-to-call video conferencing
from any location.

    "One of our main challenges is locating the right person in our
organisation to answer a customer query in a timely manner and then being
able to contact them directly," says David Cook, chief information
officer, NECU. "This was underlined by a recent report that showed 20
percent of our contact centre agents' time was spent looking for the
right person in our organization to handle specific customer queries.
What we needed was a technology solution that would leverage our prior
investment in a company-wide videoconferencing system with new capability
to unify voice, video and customer information, and provide personalised
customer contact with improved customer service."

    "Nortel impressed us with the direct software integration between its
communication network and Microsoft's Office Communications Server
software, providing specific information about each of our expert
resources available in real-time to all of our branches," says Cook.
"This gives us an incredibly powerful platform for connecting our people
with our customers in a variety of different ways - through audio, video,
text and IM - and ensures that regardless of where our customers are
located, we have the resources available to serve them."

    "We're already looking past the initial implementation to the next phase
of the project, which will extend the reach of our video-enabled unified
communications services to our customers through the web," says Cook.
"This will give customers direct access to our consultants through the
video conferencing system, presenting them with a new way of
communicating directly with our staff without having to leave their
homes."

    Nortel's solution demonstrated other competitive advantages that made it
appealing to NECU.

    "Nortel and Microsoft's alliance gives them a clear time-to-market
advantage that's well ahead of what any of their competitors could
muster," says Cook. "It was also obvious that we were speaking the same
language when it comes to reducing our carbon footprint through
energy-efficient technology and cutting back on unnecessary travel. And
it was also an easy sell to my CFO. The operational savings we've
calculated as a result of implementing this technology are substantial.
Delivering significant customer service enhancement more efficiently will
have lasting benefits on both our top and bottom line."

    "Nortel's solution is helping NECU overcome the challenges of one-to-one
communication in an organisation that is spread across multiple branches,
some in remote rural areas," says Mark Stevens, president, Australia and
New Zealand, Nortel. "This unified communications approach will help NECU
stand out from the crowd as people look for different ways of
collaborating with each other and their service organisations, using
multiple web-enabled devices in today's era of Hyperconnectivity - when
anything that can be connected to the network is being connected."

    Nortel's solution for NECU centres on its flagship Communications Server
(CS) 1000, a full-featured unified communications IP PBX that integrates
with Microsoft's Office Communications Server(2) to enable multiple call
features such as unified messaging, presence, IM and voice and video
calls from the desktop. The CS1000 is accessible to all of NECU's
branches over the company's wide area network, supported by Nortel's
Ethernet Routing Switch (ERS) 5520s at NECU's head office and business
continuity locations.

    The solution also incorporates Nortel's 1140E IP handsets at select
locations, although the majority of calls will take place using Microsoft
Office Communicator softphones. NECU's incumbent contact centre
technology will be replaced by Nortel's Contact Centre 6.0 platform to
provide complete integration with the new unified communications
functionality.

    Nortel and Microsoft continue to chalk up new customer wins in Australia
and across Asia as part of their Innovative Communications Alliance.
Earlier this year the companies added insurance company MDA National to
its growing customer list, which includes construction giant Mirvac,
financial services firm Austock, and Victoria water utility company
Wannon Water. Nortel and Microsoft will be hosting a customer event in
late August to highlight the progress of the Alliance and detail new
products in the unified communications portfolio.

&lt;p&gt;Noven Signs License and Supply Agreements with Procter &amp; Gamble Pharmaceuticals for Patches to Treat HSDD

MIAMI--(Business Wire)--
Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:NOVN) today announced that it
has entered into global license and supply agreements with Procter &amp;
Gamble Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("P"), a subsidiary of The Procter &amp;
Gamble Company, relating to the development and commercialization of
prescription transdermal patches for the treatment of Hypoactive
Sexual Desire Disorder ("HSDD") in women.

   Under the agreements, Noven granted P an exclusive worldwide
license to a testosterone patch for the treatment of HSDD in women, as
well as potential next-generation patches in the same therapeutic
category. The agreements provide for payment to Noven of royalties and
manufacturing fees, as well as development and sales milestones,
relating to the licensed products. P will fund any clinical
development costs and will be responsible for any regulatory filings
and marketing applications associated with the licensed products, as
applicable.

   Noven successfully formulated the licensed testosterone patch
utilizing its patented DOT Matrix(R) transdermal delivery technology
pursuant to a development agreement between Noven and P established
in 2003. Peter Brandt, Noven's President &amp; Chief Executive Officer,
said: "We are excited to be advancing our collaboration with one of
the world's best-regarded companies to bring advanced DOT Matrix(R)
patches to women suffering from HSDD."

   About HSDD

   HSDD is the medical term for low sexual desire that results in
personal distress for the patient, and it is believed to be the most
common form of female sexual dysfunction. Currently, there are no
products approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat HSDD in
the U.S. In certain countries outside the U.S., P markets and sells
a testosterone patch called Intrinsa(R) for the treatment of HSDD in
certain patient populations.

   About DOT Matrix(R)

   Noven's patented DOT Matrix(R) transdermal drug delivery platform
is a highly-efficient class of diffusion-based drug-in-adhesive patch
technology that can often deliver more drug through a smaller patch
area than competitive patches, without using irritating skin
permeation enhancers, and without compromising adhesion. Several
commercialized products utilize Noven's DOT Matrix(R) technology,
including Vivelle-Dot(R), CombiPatch(R) and Daytrana(R).

   About Noven

   Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company
engaged in the research, development, manufacture, marketing and sale
of prescription pharmaceutical products. Noven's business and
operations are focused in three principal areas - transdermal drug
delivery, the Novogyne joint venture, and Noven Therapeutics, Noven's
specialty pharmaceutical unit.

within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that involve
substantial risks and uncertainties. Statements that are not
historical facts, including statements that are preceded by, followed
by, or that include, the words "believes," "anticipates," "plans,"

performance or other non-historical facts are forward-looking and

change based on factors that are, in many instances, beyond Noven's

   While not necessarily listed in order of priority or probability,
these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the
possibility that the products may not be successfully developed;
uncertainties related to any clinical trials, the possibility that
even if successfully developed, regulatory authorities, including the
FDA, may not approve any of the products on a timely basis or at all;
the possibility that P may elect not to commercialize any of the
products, even if such products are successfully developed and
approved; the possibility that Noven may experience difficulties in
manufacturing or supplying any of the products to specification on a
commercial scale; the possibility that patent or other strategies
could delay or prevent any launch of the products; the possibility
that Noven will not achieve the development and sales milestones under
the Agreements; the impact of competitive responses to any sales,
marketing and strategic efforts relating to the products; and the risk
that P may have priorities that are different from or conflict with
Noven's, which may adversely impact P's ability or willingness to
advance any development or commercialization activities related to the
products.

   For additional information regarding these and other risks
associated with Noven's business, readers should refer to Noven's
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, as
well as other reports filed from time to time with the Securities and

information directly from Microsoft further extends value to our
mutual customers across the globe," said Azhar Hameed, CEO of Etilize.

   As new products are introduced to the market, Microsoft is working
with Etilize to identify "Office Ready" hardware. The "Microsoft

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aug 20 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded department
stores Kohl's Corp (KSS.N) and Macy's Inc (M.N) on valuation,
and said it expects softer sales for the retailers as the boost
from stimulus checks wanes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage cut shares of Macy's and Kohl's from
"neutral" to "buy," but maintained its earnings estimates and
outlook for the companies. It has a price target of $48 on
Kohl's and $21 on Macy's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Adrianne Shapira said while the stocks have rallied
due to lower oil prices and better-than-expected second-quarter
earnings, the key to a longer-term inflection point in
fundamentals -- a turn in same-store sales -- remains far off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Lower oil prices should help in the near-term, but could
easily reverse over the longer-term and housing/credit markets
remain a drag," Shapira said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst said top-line fundamentals are likely to remain
challenged as tighter inventory control leads to lower
clearance activity, unit sales and revenue gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We await a return of rising unit sales alongside higher
full price selling to become more bullish," Shapira said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales gains could become increasingly difficult as the
boost from the stimulus checks begins to ease, the analyst
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Kohl's were down 15 cents at $48.67 while Macy's
shares were down about 12 cents at $20.20 in morning trade on
the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Announces Agreements to Develop the Hebron Heavy Oil Project Offshore Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada

SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today announced that its wholly
owned subsidiary, Chevron Canada Limited, and its co-venturers have
finalized legal agreements with the government of Newfoundland and
Labrador to develop the Hebron heavy oil project offshore the east
coast of Canada.

   The Hebron Field is located 210 miles (340 km) offshore the
province of Newfoundland and Labrador in 300 feet (92 m) of water.
Discovered in 1981, the field is expected to be developed using a
gravity-based structure with integrated drilling and production
topsides. Hebron contains an estimated 400 million to 700 million
barrels of recoverable oil.

   "Completion of formal binding agreements with the government of
Newfoundland and Labrador represents a major milestone toward the
successful development of the Hebron Project," said George Kirkland,
executive vice president of Global Upstream and Gas for Chevron.

   "The Hebron Project is expected to offer significant benefits to
the people of Newfoundland and Labrador, generate a competitive rate
of return for Chevron and our partner companies, and provide
additional energy supplies for the North American marketplace," said
Kirkland.

   Chevron Canada Limited has a 26.63 percent working interest and is
operator of the Hebron Project. The other partners are ExxonMobil
Canada Properties (36.04 percent), Petro-Canada (22.73 percent),
StatoilHydro Canada Oil &amp; Gas Inc. (9.7 percent) and Oil and Gas
Corporation of Newfoundland and Labrador (4.9 percent).

   "The Hebron Project is key to our Canada growth strategy and is
one of many projects in our North American portfolio that will allow
us to grow our reserves and production," said Gary Luquette, president
of Chevron North America Exploration and Production.

   "Chevron Canada is contributing to that anticipated growth in
Atlantic Canada through our participation in the Hebron Project,
through our ongoing financial interest in the Hibernia and Terra Nova
offshore oil projects, and through our exploration in the Orphan
Basin. Moreover, Chevron Canada is pursuing long-term growth through
the development of legacy assets in the Alberta oil sands and Northern
Canada."

   Chevron Corporation is one of the world's leading integrated
energy companies, with subsidiaries that conduct business across the
globe. The company's success is driven by the ingenuity and commitment
of approximately 59,000 employees who operate across the energy
spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and transports crude oil and
natural gas; refines, markets and distributes transportation fuels and
other energy products; manufactures and sells petrochemical products;
generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides energy
efficiency solutions; and develops and commercializes the energy
resources of the future, including biofuels and other renewables.
Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif. More information about Chevron
is available at www.chevron.com.

from geopolitical turmoil, pointing to the still tense

ongoing nuclear dispute with the West, a Taliban resurgence in
Afghanistan and bombings in Algeria, an OPEC member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Russian military trucks crossed from Georgia back into

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs  Co slashed its earnings outlooks for five major rivals on Tuesday, citing mounting write-downs on mortgages, a slowdown in overall activity, and legal expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts led by William Tanona reduced third-quarter and full-year forecasts for Citigroup Inc (C.N), JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N, Merrill Lynch  Co MER.N and Morgan Stanley (MS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman could lose $9.65 per share for the year, versus a prior forecast for a loss of $2.10 per share, the Goldman analysts said. Lehman may reduce its mortgage exposure in the third quarter by 20 percent, or $15 billion, which could lead to a $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion write-down, the analysts said. Its share-price target was cut to $22 from $40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We assume no or negative earnings for the majority of firms in our universe this quarter, and for some of our firms, the third quarter marks the fourth consecutive quarter of reported losses, clearly an unprecedented streak," Tanona wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Firms are clearly being more aggressive with asset sales and reducing their balance sheet exposure to troubled assets," the analyst added. "However, we believe a major recovery is still a few quarters away."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanona said results will also be affected as Citigroup, JPMorgan, Merrill and Morgan Stanley buy back billions of dollars of illiquid auction-rate securities from clients. Citigroup, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley have also agreed to regulatory fines over the debt, while Merrill has not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite his outlook, Tanona still recommends a trade in which investors buy Morgan Stanley shares and sell Citigroup shares short. He said Morgan Stanley is one of the brokers best positioned for a market turnaround, while Citigroup will remain heavily exposed to mortgages and consumer credit issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanona lowered his third-quarter earnings-per-share forecasts as follows: Citigroup, to nil from 17 cents; JPMorgan, to 40 cents from 64 cents; Lehman, to a loss of $2.75 from a profit of 68 cents; Merrill, to a loss of $4.75 from a loss of $4.40; and Morgan Stanley, to 85 cents from $1.10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He lowered his 2008 earnings-per-share forecasts as follows: Citigroup, to a loss of $1.30 from a loss of $1.10; JPMorgan, to $2.30 from $2.60; Lehman, to a loss of $9.65 from a loss of $2.10; Merrill, to a loss of $10.25 from a loss of $10.10; and Morgan Stanley, to $4.45 from $4.80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanona also lowered his 2009 earnings-per-share forecasts for JPMorgan, Lehman, Merrill and Morgan Stanley. He left his forecast for Citigroup unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Tuesday trading, Citigroup shares closed down 43 cents, or 2.4 percent, at $17.19; JPMorgan fell $1.16, or 3.2 percent, to $35.58; Lehman slid $1.96, or 13 percent, to $13.07; Merrill fell 92 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $23.82, and Morgan Stanley fell $1.51, or 3.8 percent, to $38.08.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

necessary tool for monitoring the Olympics streaming video, but will
continue to empower companies with the necessary tools to ensure an
exceptional end-user experience."

streaming video is a critical capability particularly as broadband
video consumption grows exponentially," said Rajeev Kutty, product
manager for Streaming Perspective. "We have received very positive
feedback on our solution from both Microsoft and CCTV, two companies
dedicated to assuring the highest performance levels possible during
the Olympics."

   Keynote Streaming Perspective is the market-leading service for
measuring the quality and reliability of video streams from multiple
geographic locations around the world. Using Keynote's globally

&lt;p&gt;(Recasts; adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aug 20 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Securities cut auto parts
retailer Advance Auto Parts Inc (AAP.N) to "neutral" from
"overweight," while upgrading peer O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY.O)
to "overweight" from "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Christopher Horvers said Advance Auto Parts was
entering into an accelerated investment phase in a tough
environment with its high spending on structural changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The culture at AAP is becoming more aggressive as
indicated by the recent spending acceleration," Horvers said,
adding that while this can be a long-term virtue, it could
create higher risk to results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Horvers also said he expects the cost reductions over the
year, which had added substantially to Advance Auto Parts'
earnings, to have subsided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Advance Auto parts closed at $42.96 Tuesday on
the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan upgraded O'Reilly saying it sees potential upside
to earnings per share in the coming year, given rising demand
in the company's do-it-for-me (DIFM) side of business and its
CSK Auto Corp CAO.N synergies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Reilly announced a deal to acquire CSK Auto in April that
would solidify its position as the third-largest U.S. auto
parts retail chain behind No. 1 chain AutoZone Inc (AZO.N) and
Advance Auto Parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said the CSK synergies could add 18 cents to
its 2010 earnings per share forecast of $2.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company closed at $28.08 Tuesday on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds detail)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Aug 20 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) reiterated
on Wednesday its year-end price forecast of $149 a barrel for
U.S. crude oil, and said strong fundamentals were a more
important factor than a strengthening dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The restatement came in a research note dated Aug. 19 but
sent out on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. investment bank is one of the most influential
financial players in commodities markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs equity analyst Arjun Murti
predicted oil prices would spike to between $150-$200 before the
end of 2009 due to his view of rising global demand and
faltering supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Although the recent correlation in dollar and oil prices is
clear, it is important to emphasise that each of these assets
are driven by multiple, varying factors ... Put differently,
there is more to oil than the U.S. dollar and vice versa," the
Goldman Sachs energy team said in the note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. crude prices hit an all-time high of $147.27 a barrel
on July 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since then, prices have declined by more than 22 percent to
around $115 a barrel on concerns over the strength of demand as
OECD economies slow and on a rebound in the U.S. dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Weakness in the dollar during the first seven months of the
year was seen as one of the key reasons for crude's rally, with
investors buying dollar-priced commodities as a hedge against
the greenback's decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S crude's record high came four days before the U.S.
dollar slipped to an all-time low against the euro of $1.6038.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crude prices sold off-sharply in the wake of the dollar's
fall to its record low, with many analysts saying the U.S.
currency had found a base, encouraging investors to unwind
commodity hedges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs said that despite the recent negative
correlation between the U.S. dollar and oil prices, there was
"very little correlation between oil prices and the U.S. dollar
over the longer term".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The investment bank sees the oil market being supported in
the short-term by limited OECD oil stocks, a possible recovery
in U.S. oil demand, near 10 percent growth in Chinese oil demand
year-on-year in July and a drop in non-OPEC production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by David Sheppard; editing by Christopher

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Aug 20 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced it is investing US$300 million to
construct 13 Business Resilience service delivery centers in 10 countries
in 2008, increasing its ability to address surging demand from businesses
and governments from around the world seeking to keep their operations
safe from disruption. The massive infrastructure expansion is the largest
of its kind and will permit IBM clients to access services that support
business continuity for the first time from a cloud computing environment.

    Business continuity and resiliency services help ensure uninterrupted
operations across all layers of the business, as well as helping
businesses avoid, prepare and recover from a disruption. IBM is the
world's leader in providing services that help avoid disruption and
enable business continuity.

    Future Business Resilience service delivery centers will be located in
every geographic region of the globe, with sites including Hong Kong;
Tokyo, Japan; Paris, France; London, UK; Beijing and Shanghai, China;
Izmir, Turkey; Warsaw, Poland; Milan, Italy; Metro Park, New Jersey;
Cologne, Germany; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Mumbai, India; South Africa; and
Brussels, Belgium. The centers are specifically designed to help clients
maintain business operations under virtually any condition, comply with
industry and government regulations and recover rapidly from disasters.

    "Enterprise Rent-A-Car is in the business of providing exceptional
customer service and that is how we differentiate ourselves," said
Richard Bozada, Department Manager of Business Continuity, Enterprise
Rent-A-Car. "To that extent, IBM helps us achieve our business goals by
creating a highly resilient environment that is anchored by a world class
IBM service delivery team. Through IBM's Business Resilience Centers we
are able to address and minimize multiple points of business and
event-driven risk. Today's commitment further validates the strategic
approach we've taken to key aspects of our IT operations."

    IBM is also today accelerating the build-out of its Information Protection
Services business to deliver cloud-based computing services to support
business continuity. Services from IBM Information Protection Services
combine IBM hardware with storage management software in a fully
configured, rack-mounted storage appliance, known as a data protection
"vault" that is capable of storing multi-terabytes of information and
applications data. The vaults are integrated with technology gained via
IBM's acquisition of Arsenal Digital Solutions in 2008. The patent-pending
on-demand service delivery platform enables global scalability of
information protection services and rapid time-to-protection of customer
data.

    Using the service delivery platform, clients will be able to take
advantage of cloud computing capabilities by storing their business data
in IBM's data protection vaults that will be based in IBM's global
business resiliency centers. Once the information is protected, customers
will be able to immediately recover that information by restoring and
retrieving it from a center directly to the client's business or to an
alternative worksite recovery area in the event of a disaster.

    The acquisition of Arsenal and the accelerated deployment of its data
protection vaults globally will help IBM offer clients sophisticated
remote data management and business continuity capabilities, like storing,
replicating and recovering key data and business applications through an
IBM business resiliency center.

    "Today, IBM, the global leader of business continuity and resiliency,
makes a historic investment and commitment to clients for whom continuous
and resilient business operations are an imperative," said Philippe Jarre,
general manager of IBM Global Business Continuity and Resiliency Services.
"Whether it be via acquisitions, expansion of our consulting services, or
the opening of new service delivery centers, IBM is committed to helping
clients achieve the levels of business continuity necessary to meet the
triple threat of data protection, security and compliance head-on."

    With 40 years of global experience in the business continuity arena and
more than 150 business resilience delivery centers worldwide, IBM has deep
industry-specific knowledge and a portfolio of unmatched services that
help companies avoid disruption and keep their operations online.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) plans to pay software maker Novell Inc NOVL.O up to $100 million in additional subscription fees due to strong demand for Novell's open-source Linux software that partners with Microsoft's proprietary Windows software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The payment to be made by November 1, announced by the companies on Tuesday, is in addition to a $240 million payment to Novell from Microsoft in 2006 as part of a broad set of business and technological agreements to make their products work together for corporate customers using both Linux and Windows servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, buys certificates from Novell and then sells subscriptions to Windows clients who want support in making their computer systems work well alongside Linux machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement between the companies expires January 1, 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux is the most popular variant of open-source software. Unlike proprietary software, open-source software lets developers share code and add functions, and users only pay for custom features, maintenance and technical support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novell said it will also spend an undisclosed sum of money to provide new tools, support, training and resources for subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novell said it has already invoiced $156 million in revenue from the Microsoft certificates in the first 18 months since the November 2006 start of the five-year agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pact between Microsoft and Novell stirred up quite a controversy in the open-source community because it included among other things a clause saying that neither company would sue customers of the other for patent violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This clause was seen as an endorsement of Microsoft's claim that it holds patents to intellectual property behind some open-source software, a contention rebutted by Novell and others in the open-source community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics said the deal undermined the patent position of Linux software and gave Microsoft an edge in persuading businesses to use Microsoft products over Linux and other types of open-source software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A software group that own rights to much of the code behind Linux software threatened to punish Novell over the deal before opting not to take punitive action against the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Settles with State Regulators and Offers to Repurchase Auction Rate Securities Sold to Its Private Clients

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) today announced that
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. has entered into a settlement in principle with
the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York and the
Illinois Securities Department (on behalf of the North American
Securities Administrators Association) regarding auction rate
securities (ARS). Under the settlement, Goldman Sachs will offer to
immediately repurchase at par the outstanding auction rate securities
that are held by its Private Wealth Management clients and were
purchased through the firm prior to February 11, 2008. Goldman Sachs
has informed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the
agreement and intends to fully cooperate with the SEC's ongoing
investigation. The terms of the settlement include:

   --  Goldman Sachs will pay a $22.5 million penalty.

   --  Goldman Sachs neither admits nor denies allegations of
        wrongdoing.

   --  Effective immediately, Goldman Sachs will offer to repurchase
        at par approximately $1 billion of ARS still held by private
        clients that were purchased through the firm prior to February
        11, 2008, with the exception of those ARS where auctions are
        clearing. Clients who are eligible for this offer include
        individuals, all charities and non-profits, and those
        businesses with accounts of $10 million or less. The firm will
        complete all buybacks no later than November 12, 2008.

   --  Goldman Sachs will compensate private clients who purchased
        ARS through the firm before February 11, 2008, and sold such
        securities at a loss between that date and the date of this
        announcement.

   --  To the extent that a private client has incurred consequential
        damages beyond the loss of liquidity in the private client's
        holdings of ARS, Goldman Sachs will participate in a special
        arbitration process in which Goldman Sachs will be precluded
        from contesting liability from the sale of the ARS.

   --  Goldman Sachs will endeavor to continue to work with issuers
        and other interested parties, including regulatory and
        government entities, to expeditiously provide liquidity
        solutions for institutional investors.

   --  Goldman Sachs will refund financing fees that it received from
        all municipal ARS issuers that issued ARS in the primary
        market through Goldman Sachs between August 1, 2007 and
        February 11, 2008, and refinanced those securities after
        February 11, 2008.

   Goldman Sachs is a leading global investment banking, securities
and investment management firm that provides a wide range of services
worldwide to a substantial and diversified client base that includes

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) After mulling its options for decades, Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) says it is poised to launch full-bore into a $1.3 billion plan to develop the long-languishing Point Thomson field on Alaska's North Slope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company plans to build nearly 50 miles of ice road and an ice air strip and start drilling exploration wells this winter, the first wells to be drilled since 1982. Some contractors have been hired and, ultimately, 200 people will be employed on the work, which will prepare for oil production that is scheduled to start in 2014, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is one big problem with those plans: The state says Exxon and its partners no longer own the Point Thomson leases. The Alaska Department of Natural Resources formally revoked the leases, some of which date back to the 1960s, for what it claims is nonperformance by operator Exxon and the partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has obtained a couple of permits from the state for surface work: one for water use and one that allows staging of equipment, fuel and a work camp, Exxon will not be allowed to drill any wells or do any subsurface work on what is now referred to as the "former Point Thomson unit," state officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They won't be issued any permits that are contingent on having leasehold rights," said Nan Thompson, petroleum manager for the department's Division of Oil and Gas. "So anything they do is at their own risk as to whether they will regain those rights."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon, which has been the operator on behalf of itself and partners BP (BP.L), Chevron (CVX.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N), maintains that it still owns the leases and can still do development work there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have the right to conduct drilling activities under the terms of the leases, which we do not believe have expired," company spokeswoman Margaret Ross said in an email sent earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon is already preparing a rig, has ordered materials and has awarded contracts to Alaska companies doing preparatory work "for the multi-well drilling program," Ross said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Point Thomson field, on state land just west of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, holds an estimated 8 trillion to 9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and hundreds of millions of barrels of liquids, according to the Alaska Department of Natural Resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While commercialization of the natural gas must wait until there is a pipeline to ship the product from the North Slope, the state has long maintained that Exxon and its partners are obligated by to produce Point Thomson's liquids or relinquish the leases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study commissioned earlier this year by the state Division of Oil and Gas estimated that Point Thomson holds 580 million to 950 million barrels of oil and 490 million to 600 million barrels of natural gas liquids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state's efforts to revoke Point Thomson leases started in 2005 when the Division of Oil and Gas rejected Exxon's 22nd plan of development for the field. In that plan, Exxon and its partners declared that development would have to wait for a natural gas pipeline, a project estimated at the time to cost over $20 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state subsequently rejected Exxon's 23rd plan of development for Point Thomson, which calls for production of at least 10,000 barrels of liquids a day by 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon and its partners have challenged the state's actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dispute over Point Thomson leases is now pending in Alaska Superior Court. State officials have predicted the issue will be resolved in the courts in about two years, and that there will be ready buyers once the leases are put back up for auction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Christian Wiessner)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Updates with confirmation; background, adds byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Steve Gorman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Aug 21 (Reuters) - Comedian Jerry Seinfeld
will star in a $300 million marketing campaign for Microsoft
Corp aimed at burnishing the image of its computer operating
system, a person familiar with the effort said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The centerpiece of that campaign, to debut next month, is a
series of television advertisements in which Seinfeld, 54, best
known for his eponymous NBC sitcom, will appear with Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates, the person told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street Journal, which first reported details of
the marketing effort, said Seinfeld will receive about $10
million for his work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seinfeld's representatives were not immediately available
for comment and Redmond, Washington-based computer software
giant Microsoft (MSFT.O) declined to discuss the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the source who knew of the ad campaign said an
immediate goal of the commercials is to counter public
perceptions that Windows Vista, Microsoft's latest PC operating
system, is clunky and hard to use compared with rival products
from Apple Inc (AAPL.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The overall objective of the campaign is to rejuvenate the
brand image of Windows generally, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Devised by the Miami-based ad agency Crispin Porter +
Bogusky, the spots will employ some variation of the slogan
"Windows, Not Walls" and the theme of removing barriers that
prevent people and ideas from connecting, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ads will begin appearing Sept. 4. The Wall Street
Journal said the $300 million marketing campaign is one of the
largest in the company's history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For now, Seinfeld is the only celebrity, other than Gates,
taking part in the campaign, although others were considered,
including comic actor Will Ferrell, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The attempted image overhaul comes in the wake of Apple's
"Mac vs. PC" ads featuring a geeky PC guy who vaguely resembles
Gates being unable to keep up with a better-looking, hip Mac
counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those ads, painting Windows as stodgy and unreliable, have
reinforced criticism about Vista's performance, stringent
hardware requirements and lack of support for other software
and devices such as printers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite selling more than 180 million licenses since its
launch in 2007, Vista continues to suffer from the perception
the release was a dud, although Microsoft has said early
problems with the operating system have been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Windows operating system is the crown jewel of
Microsoft's $60 billion software empire. It sits on more than
90 percent of the world's computers and profits generated from
Windows bankroll the company's ventures into new businesses
such as Xbox video game machines and Zune music players.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) reiterated on Wednesday its year-end price forecast of $149 a barrel for U.S. crude oil, and said strong fundamentals were a more important factor than a strengthening dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The restatement came in a research note dated August 19 but sent out on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. investment bank is one of the most influential financial players in commodities markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs equity analyst Arjun Murti predicted oil prices would spike to between $150-$200 before the end of 2009 due to his view of rising global demand and faltering supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although the recent correlation in dollar and oil prices is clear, it is important to emphasize that each of these assets are driven by multiple, varying factors ... Put differently, there is more to oil than the U.S. dollar and vice versa," the Goldman Sachs energy team said in the note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. crude prices hit an all-time high of $147.27 a barrel on July 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, prices have declined by more than 22 percent to around $115 a barrel on concerns over the strength of demand as OECD economies slow and on a rebound in the U.S. dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weakness in the dollar during the first seven months of the year was seen as one of the key reasons for crude's rally, with investors buying dollar-priced commodities as a hedge against the greenback's decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S crude's record high came four days before the U.S. dollar slipped to an all-time low against the euro of $1.6038.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crude prices sold off-sharply in the wake of the dollar's fall to its record low, with many analysts saying the U.S. currency had found a base, encouraging investors to unwind commodity hedges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said that despite the recent negative correlation between the U.S. dollar and oil prices, there was "very little correlation between oil prices and the U.S. dollar over the longer term".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investment bank sees the oil market being supported in the short-term by limited OECD oil stocks, a possible recovery in U.S. oil demand, near 10 percent growth in Chinese oil demand year-on-year in July and a drop in non-OPEC production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by David Sheppard; editing by Christopher Johnson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Announces Plans to Construct Base Oil Manufacturing Facility in Pascagoula, Miss.

  Facility to Manufacture 25,000 Barrels of Premium Base Oil Per Day
PASCAGOULA, Miss.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today announced that it has
submitted an environmental permit application to the Mississippi
Department of Environmental Quality for the construction of a premium
base oil facility at the company's Pascagoula refinery. The facility
is expected to produce approximately 25,000 barrels per day of premium
base oil for use in manufacturing high-performance lubricants, such as
motor oils for consumer and commercial uses. Construction is
anticipated to begin in early 2009 and conclude in 2011.

   "Subject to obtaining the required permits and making a final
investment decision, it is our intention to build this state-of-the
art facility at Pascagoula," said Dale Walsh, president, Chevron
Global Lubricants. "Demand for premium base oils is increasing in the
U.S. and around the world. These oils are the primary ingredients in
the production of top-tier motor oils needed to improve fuel economy,
lower tail-pipe emissions and extend the period between oil changes."

   Added Walsh, "Chevron was the first company to produce and market
premium base oil. With additional manufacturing from the Pascagoula
facility, Chevron would become the world's largest producer of this
product."

   "This project represents another significant Chevron investment in
Mississippi," said Roland Kell, general manager, Pascagoula refinery.
"We have the expertise and resources necessary to plan, build and
safely operate projects of this magnitude."

   The base oil facility would utilize Chevron's revolutionary
ISODEWAXING(R) technology. Commercialized in 1993, ISODEWAXING(R)
results in higher yields and enables a broader range of crude oil
feedstocks to be used in the manufacturing of base oils. More than two
thirds of the world's premium base oil is manufactured with this
technology.

   As Chevron's largest wholly-owned refinery, the Pascagoula
facility has a work force of 1,540 and processes up to 330,000 barrels
per day of crude oil to produce gasoline, jet fuel, diesel and other
products. The refinery commenced operation in 1963.

   Chevron Corporation is one of the world's leading integrated
energy companies, with subsidiaries that conduct business across the
globe. The company's success is driven by the ingenuity and commitment
of approximately 59,000 employees who operate across the energy
spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and transports crude oil and
natural gas; refines, markets and distributes transportation fuels and
other energy products; manufactures and sells petrochemical products;
generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides energy
efficiency solutions; and develops and commercializes the energy
resources of the future, including biofuels and other renewables.
Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif. More information about Chevron
is available at www.chevron.com.

&lt;p&gt;  MOSCOW, Aug 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Russian retail chain, LENTA, have signed a three-year
information technology (IT) services contract estimated at approximately
US$1 million. The contract signed in May 2008, will provide IBM support
and recovery services for LENTA's entire IT infrastructure.

    The LENTA chain is actively expanding its operations with 31 hypermarkets

rapid business growth meant the company needed to establish a professional
system for IT infrastructure support in order to help ensure business
continuity across the company's widespread operations.

    "The services contract, performed by IBM engineers on site, will help with
hardware recovery times and thus facilitate LENTA's objective to reduce

infrastructure more stable," said Grigoriy Davydov, Infrastructure Service
Sales Expert, IBM Russia. "IBM's retail industry and IT services
experience will ultimately help LENTA provide better services to its

    "We selected IBM because it has a service center and a stock of spare
parts and components in St. Petersburg. Another key factor that
influenced our choice was IBM Russia and CIS Service Department's
invariable focus on customer needs. The fact that IBM engineers are
highly qualified and have the knowledge required to provide the services,
recover hardware within agreed to time frames and use original spare
parts also had a critical role to play," explained Sergey Cherniy, CIO,

&lt;p&gt;Cardholders in Phoenix Area to Benefit from Merchant Offers
                        Delivered via SMS Text
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa (NYSE:V) together with Chase (NYSE:JPM) today announces a
consumer pilot that delivers merchant offers directly to the mobile
devices of Chase credit and debit cardholders in the Phoenix
metropolitan area.

   The offers - from merchant discounts to specials - are tailored to
match the personal interests selected by Chase cardholders and will be
redeemable at the point of sale or the web site of more than 50
participating merchants.

   Partnering with Chase in this trial, Visa is delivering merchant
offers to mobile devices via short message service (SMS), the same
technology that handles text messaging between individuals. The trial
takes advantage of the widespread adoption of "texting" as an everyday
activity by younger consumers aged 18 to 34, who are the primary group
selected for the program.

   One of the key aspects of the pilot is its personalization. When
Chase cardholders sign up for the service, they will have the option
to set preferences on the program's Web site, choosing offers and
merchants that are most relevant and compelling for them. This
approach allows consumers the ability to see offers they are likely to
want and enables merchants to send offers only to those consumers most
likely to be interested.

   "Chase is always looking for new, innovative ways to reward
cardholders and enhance the consumer payment experience," said Eileen
Serra, Chase Card Services executive. "The intersection of mobile
technology and consumer financial services is an area of focus for
Chase. We're using leading technology to deliver compelling offers
from top merchants directly to consumers' mobile devices, and at the
same time, helping to increase spending and create greater loyalty for
merchants participating in the trial."

   Among the merchants in the pilot are Chico's FAS, Inc (brands Soma
Intimates and White House/Black Market), Circle K, Macy's, Marriott,
Old Navy, Papa John's Pizza and Robeks Juice. Thanks to the Chase
sponsorship of the Arizona Diamondbacks, baseball fans will receive
special game-day offers when attending Major League Baseball games at
Chase Field in Phoenix.

   In this trial, select Chase Visa cardholders will be invited to
participate in the program by mail, email, Chase ATM and the Chase.com
website. Customers who aren't directly invited may still participate
in the program by responding to marketing at Chase Field. In keeping
with the mobile focus of the pilot, participants may enroll in the
program online or through the SMS technology itself.

   Chase and Visa will review the program in the fourth quarter to
evaluate the impact of mobile offers on stakeholder interest,
cardholder engagement, and card usage.

   Visa Mobile Platform

   At the heart of the pilot is Visa's Mobile Platform, a suite of
technologies that enables Visa, its clients, and mobile operators to
engage in trial activities and develop commercially scalable mobile
services. Built on years of experience in mobile payments, Visa's
platform complements the infrastructure of financial institutions, and
is supported by contributions from chip suppliers, mobile applications
developers, over-the-air (OTA) service providers and mobile messaging
providers.

   "Visa innovations enable more people in more places to enjoy the
advantages of electronic payments," said Pam Zuercher, Head of Global
Product Innovation at Visa Inc. "The Visa Mobile Platform helps us
deliver on that promise and enables our clients to expand their
products to new channels."

&lt;p&gt;WARSAW Aug 21 (Reuters) - The Polish consumer watchdog has
forwarded to the European Commission an investigation into
Microsoft (MSFT.O) after concluding the software giant may be
harming competition by colluding with laptop makers, it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The consumer and competition watchdog said it was concerned
that Microsoft may be cooperating with computer makers to hamper
the installation of operating systems such as Linux that compete
with its dominant Windows software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The character of the investigation -- especially the
territory of the activities -- indicates that the effects of
this agreement may cover the entire European Union," the
watchdog said in a statement on its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Because of this, the head of the agency has forwarded the
collected materials to the European Commission, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The EU's executive body has already levied 1.68 billion
euros ($2.5 billion) in fines on Microsoft for abusing its 95
percent dominance of the PC operating system to block its
competitors.

&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, Alberta Aug 22 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N)
will give up its status as operator of the planned Hebron oil
project off the coast of Newfoundland to partner Exxon Mobil
Corp (XOM.N), a Chevron spokesman said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron will hand over control of the C$5 billion to C$7
billion ($4.8 billion to $6.7 billion) oil project after
Hebron's management committee votes to approve the deal,
according to spokesman Leif Sollid. No date has been set for
the vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It will be in as timely a manner as possible," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon, the biggest U.S. oil company, is the largest
shareholder in the project, with a 36.04 percent interest.
Chevron has a 26.63 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The switch comes just days after the Hebron partners
reached a deal with the Newfoundland government on fiscal terms
for the development, which could produce oil in eight or 10
years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hebron, discovered in 1981, contains between 400 million
and 700 million barrels of oil and will be the fourth major oil
development off Newfoundland, joining the Hibernia, Terra Nova
and White Rose projects. All are in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin, in
the Atlantic Ocean, about 350 km (220 miles) southeast of the
Newfoundland capital of St. John's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The other Hebron partners are Petro-Canada PCA.TO, with a
22.73 percent interest, and StatoilHydro (STL.OL) with 9.7
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Newfoundland government will hold a 4.9 percent share.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Aug 22 (Reuters) - Worldwide sales of computer
servers rose 5.7 percent to $13.8 billion in the second quarter
and IBM (IBM.N) extended its market share lead to 31.2 percent
in terms of revenues, research firm Gartner said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Shipments rose 12.2 percent to 2.3 million units, with
Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N) maintaining its lead in terms of units,
although second-placed Dell DELL.O narrowed the gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In spite of economic constraints in some markets like the
United States, on a worldwide basis, servers continued to grow,"
Gartner research vice president Jeffrey Hewitt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The most significant driver in the quarter continued to be
an upswing in x86 server replacements that started in the first
quarter. This, coupled with Web data centre build-outs and
growth in emerging markets, produced solid Q2 results."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dell was among those who benefited from the x86 trend,
reporting the fastest growth of any top supplier in terms of
both revenues and shipments. It sold 24.7 percent more servers
and increased its revenues by 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HP, ranked second in terms of revenues, lost market share in
terms of both sales and shipments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dell had 13 percent of the market in terms of revenues,
behind IBM and HP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM came third in terms of shipments, after HP and Dell, as
it sold fewer but more expensive servers.

&lt;p&gt; (Changes source, adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aug 22 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded Chico's FAS Inc
(CHS.N) to "neutral" from "sell," saying shares of the women's
apparel retailer have undergone a sharp correction after its
second-quarter earnings warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's shares, which had shed 24 percent over the
past month, rose 7 percent to $4.79 in morning trade on the New
York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While we expect continued disappointments on earnings, we
no longer see enough downside to shares to offset upside
risks," analyst Michelle Tan wrote in a research note dated
Aug. 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this month, the company, which operates the White
House/Black Market and SOMA Intimates stores in addition to its
namesake chain, said it expects second-quarter earnings to fall
short of market estimates due to lower sales and higher
markdowns in the Chico's brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect ongoing sales pressure on mature women's
retailers from the challenging environment, changing customer
tastes, and retail overcapacity," the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tan currently sees "sell"-rated Coldwater Creek Inc
CWTR.O as the better way to take advantage of ongoing sales
weakness in the mature women's segment.

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats to additional subscribers)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Kirby Chien&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BEIJING Aug 22 (Reuters) - Credit card company Visa Inc
(V.N) said on Friday it was interested in remaining a sponsor
of the Olympics beyond 2012, but had not begun talks on a new
deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Absolutely, we are looking to continue beyond London,"
Antonio Lucio, Visa's chief marketing officer, told Reuters in
an interview in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But we have not started our conversations with the IOC
(International Olympic Committee). Maybe we will begin talks
next year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Beijing Games end on Sunday and London will host the
next summer Olympics in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Beijing Olympics will become the most viewed Games in
history, boosted by a massive online audience. The IOC had
faced criticism for awarding the Games to China despite
concerns over its human rights record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa, the world's largest credit card network, said it had
been pleased with the impact of its sponsorship. It is one of
the 12 main Olympic sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With all its issues, it is still a very strong property to
have," Lucio said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa has been a Games sponsor for more than two decades.
Under its current contract, the company signed up for two
summer and two winter Games. The next winter Games are in
Vancouver in 2010, followed by London in the summer of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lucio was certain that rivals MasterCard Inc (MA.N) and
American Express (AXP.N) would also be interested in the Games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As soon as we begin to talk about our negotiations with
any of these properties, our other two competitors are going to
want to bid too," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since sponsoring the Olympics, Visa said it had seen an
increase in volume transactions, higher acquisition and
retention from customer banks and rising brand awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa also sponsors 90 athletes -- including U.S. gold medal
winners swimmer Michael Phelps and gymnast Nastia Liukin -- 68
of whom are at the Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The number of merchant outlets in Beijing accepting Visa
cards has jumped from 20,000 -- or about 10 percent of all
outlets -- five years ago to around 34,000 now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hosting the Olympics has accelerated the spread of
electronic payment infrastructure in Beijing, but the ratio is
still far lower than the 80-90 percent seen in recent Olympic
host cities such as Athens or Sydney.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN, Ireland--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/0c55f5/the_top_10_worlds)
has announced the addition of the "The Top 10 World's Leading
Pharmaceutical Companies: Pfizer" report to their offering.

   In a highly dynamic and fragmented pharmaceutical market, besieged
by intense competition, rapid pace of technological innovations and
the uncertainty regarding future government regulations, the ability
to anticipate new competitive product introductions and marketing
strategies is particularly important... and spells the difference
between success and failure. The TOP 10, a unique series of market
intelligence studies first introduced in 1987, is designed to provide
the pharmaceutical industry executives, as well as companies planning
to diversify into the pharmaceutical field, with strategically
significant competitor information, analysis and insight, critical to
the development and implementation of effective marketing and R
programs. The study's major objectives include: to establish a
comprehensive, factual, annually-updated and cost-effective;
information base on performance, capabilities, goals and strategies of
the world's leading pharmaceutical companies; to help current
suppliers realistically assess their financial, marketing and
technological capabilities vis-a-vis leading competitors; to assist
potential market entrants in evaluating prospective acquisitions and
joint venture candidates; and to complement organizations' internal
competitor information gathering efforts by providing strategic
analysis, data interpretation and insight.

   The study provides an approximately 50-page worldwide strategic
overview of the pharmaceutical market, including sales forecast for
major product segments (ethical, OTC, generics); key geographic
regions (North America, Western Europe, Japan, Eastern Europe, and
Latin America); major drug categories, including cardiovascular,
gastrointestinal, antibiotics, CNS, respiratory, musculoskeletal,
hormonal/genitourinary, dermatological, oncological, and others. In
addition, the report reviews major U.S. and international regulatory,
technological, economic, demographic, and social trends with
potentially significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry during
the next five years, including discussion of such key issues as
pricing, industry consolidation, market globalization, growing R
cost, generics, as well as advances in genomics, proteomics, drug
screening, tissue engineering, bioinformatics, and other technologies.

   The report provides: Executive Summary; Business Organization;
Senior Management; Facilities and Employees; Technological Know-How;
Product Portfolio Analysis; Marketing Tactics; Financial Analysis; R
Expenditures and Major Programs; Collaborative Arrangements; and
Strategic Direction.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Banc of America Securities analyst Michael Hecht cut his earnings outlook on U.S. investment banks Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) to reflect a tough fixed-income sales and trading environment, and a downward trend in equity markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"...We still believe Goldman and Morgan Stanley stand to benefit from stronger customer flow activity as other firms face more substantial de-leveraging pressures, but still not enough to offset recent cyclical and seasonal pressures across most capital markets businesses the last three months," the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cut his third-quarter earnings estimate on Goldman to $2.50 a share from $3.98, and on Morgan Stanley to 85 cents a  share from $1.02.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hecht, however, said he expects Morgan Stanley to deliver the best earnings-per-share growth and return-on-equity traction in the group, given continued momentum in its core institutional securities franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cut his price target on the shares of Morgan Stanley to $52 from $55 and maintained his "buy" rating on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hecht cut Goldman's price target to $186 from $192, maintaining his "neutral" rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the start of this month, analysts at Merrill Lynch, Fox-Pitt, Bernstein, Citigroup and Lehman have cut their estimates for Goldman and Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman closed at $156.42 Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, while those of Morgan Stanley closed at
$37.06.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Neha Singh in Bangalore; Editing by Vinu Pilakkott)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sales of Coca-Cola Products in Mongolia increase 16 times in 6
                                 years
ULAANBAATAR, Mongolia--(Business Wire)--
A US$22 million green field Coca-Cola bottling plant was
officially opened in Ulaanbaatar today by Muhtar Kent, President and
CEO of The Coca-Cola Company and Odjargal Jambaljamts, Chairman &amp; CEO,
MCS Group. This new plant will be the second and largest Coca-Cola
plant in Mongolia. The first Coca-Cola plant was built in 2001 by MCS
Coca-Cola, the exclusive bottler of Coca-Cola products in the market.

   "I'm delighted to see MCS Coca-Cola continue to exceed all
projections in sales volume and profit," said Mr. Kent. "By posting an
average annual volume growth of nearly 50% year on year, the Mongolian
business has established itself as one of the strongest performing
operations globally. I am also delighted to see that the leadership of
MCS Coca-Cola has continuously demonstrated its commitment to invest
in the development of its people and manufacturing facilities,
critical to ensure continued future growth of the Coca-Cola business
in Mongolia."

   The new bottling plant in Ulaanbaatar has a site area of 6
hectares. Two state-of-the-art bottling lines are installed - one for
sparkling PET-bottle "Cold"/ ambient filling, and another line for
still "hot" filling to cover the production of juice, tea and water
products. A returnable glass bottling line will also be relocated from
the existing plant. The new plant will implement cutting edge water
treatment processes in line with the stringent quality assurance
system of The Coca-Cola Company. Good manufacturing practice and sound
environmental and regional safety requirements will also be enforced.

   The Coca-Cola Company sees incredible value in developing its
business in the Mongolian market and is confident that the new
expansion will help the local business generate further growth.

   The Coca-Cola system in Mongolia is also strongly committed to
being a respected corporate citizen; an effort that is reflected by
MCS Coca-Cola's commitment to contributing to the Ulaanbaatar economy
and population. With over 3,500 employees, the bottling company is a
leading employer and top taxpaying private company in the city. The
MNTT25.35 billion (US$22 million) that the company invested into the
new site also created an influx of funds to bolster the local economy.
International research indicates that for each job created directly by
the Coca-Cola system additional 10 local jobs are created with
suppliers and business partners.

   "With the burgeoning beverage market in Mongolia we have recorded
remarkable growth rates. In 2002 we sold 4 Coca-Cola products to every
average Mongolian consumer. In 2008 we are selling an average of 67
beverages to every Mongolian consumer. This has caused our first plant
to run out of manufacturing capacity 7 years ahead of schedule" said
Mr. Jambaljamts. "We are greatly encouraged by the outstanding
performance of our bottling operation as both the bottling company and
The Coca-Cola Company have exceeded all projections of profitability
and sales. Our investment in the new plant is just our first step to
bring world class manufacturing to Mongolia."

   The Coca-Cola Company

   The Coca-Cola Company is the world's largest beverage company,
refreshing consumers with more than 450 sparkling and still brands.
Along with Coca-Cola, recognized as the world's most valuable brand,

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) said the market value of its investments in Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N preferred stock has dropped by half to $600 million this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a filing with regulators on Monday, the bank said the decline could affect its earnings. The precise amount of losses for the third quarter is difficult to determine, given the oscillations in the preferred shares' values, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors have grown concerned over the fate of holders of Fannie and Freddie preferred stock because a possible bailout of the government-sponsored enterprises (GSE) could partly or wholly wipe out the value of these investments if bondholders are put first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have already seen their share values plummet amid the credit market crisis, which has triggered questions about whether they have enough capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fannie shares have dropped nearly 90 percent this year, but closed up 3.8 percent at $5.19 on Monday. Freddie shares have fallen more than 90 percent this year but gained 17.1 percent to end at $3.29 a share, also on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other financial institutions, particularly smaller regional banks, could also be hit by losses on their holdings of GSE preferred stock, according to a report issued by Keefe, Bruyette and Woods on Monday, pinpointing Sovereign Bancorp SOV.N and Westamerica Bancorp (WABC.O), among others, as having "significant exposure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KBW analyst Samuel Caldwell, in the report, said Gateway Financial Holdings Inc GBTS.O, Farmers Capital Bank (FFKT.O) and Midwest Banc Holdings Inc MBHI.O were also seen as having significant exposure to potential losses from holdings of Fannie and Freddie preferred stock, relative to tangible equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While JPMorgan's write-downs have been modest compared with other banks', the company said earlier this month it had lost $1.5 billion in July and the first third of August, after wider credit spreads and deteriorating liquidity hit the value of its mortgage-backed securities and loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay and Dinesh Nair in Bangalore; additional reporting by Lilla Zuill; editing by John Wallace, Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encrypting Your Hard Disk is Not Safe Anymore: New Vulnerability Affects Microsoft, Intel, HP and Others

   Microsoft, Intel, HP, Lenovo and Leading Vendors Are Affected by a
New Vulnerability That Allows Attackers to Bypass Hard-Disk Encryption
Software, System Boot Passwords and Steal Confidential Data
LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--
iViZ, an On-Demand Penetration Testing company, announced its
discovery of a new class of vulnerability at Defcon 16, the world's
leading security conference. This vulnerability allows attackers to
steal computer boot passwords and bypass the security of pre-boot
authentication software like hard disk encryption tools. It affects
general computer users, enterprises, governments and can result in
unauthorized access or theft of confidential data. Incidentally, in
2007 the global loss due to data theft is estimated to be USD 40
Billion.

   "Surprisingly, this vulnerability has been existing for 25 years,"
says Jonathan Brossard, iViZ lead security researcher and discoverer
of this vulnerability. "Programmers unaware of this security hole have
coded boot password feature in such a way that user entered text do
not get flushed from memory properly leading to inadvertent leakage
and theft. Even hard-drive encryption does not help in this case,"
adds Mr. Brossard. This vulnerability affects Microsoft Bitlocker on
the latest TPM (but not Vista SP1), Truecrypt, Intel/HP BIOS and
several others.

   As a part of responsible disclosure practice, iViZ has already
briefed all the affected vendors. "We appreciate vendors like
Microsoft, Intel, HP taking a proactive approach in providing fixes to
users. iViZ is committed to initiatives making the web safe and would
continue to conduct research that helps to secure organizations
worldwide," said Bikash Barai, CEO of iViZ.

   About iViZ:

   iViZ is an Information Security company that offers the world's
only end-to-end, automated Penetration Testing on-demand. It's

&lt;p&gt;  NEW DELHI, INDIA, Aug 25 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Bharti Retail Limited and IBM India (NYSE: IBM) today announced a
wide-ranging ten year strategic partnership under which IBM will provide
technology and services that will enable the consolidation,
transformation and management of a comprehensive IT infrastructure for
Bharti Retail by IBM India. This collaboration is a progression of an
existing four-year relationship between the Bharti Group and IBM. Further
strengthening this relationship, Bharti Group's retail company, Bharti
Retail will leverage IBM's worldwide expertise in the retail sector and
introduce best practices and innovations to support Bharti Retail's
business goals and enhance Bharti Retail's competitive advantage in a
dynamic and competitive retail market.

    Vinod Sawhny, President and Chief Operating Officer, Bharti Retail Ltd.,
said, "In a dynamic and fast evolving retail sector, Bharti Retail's
association with IBM will provide a distinct competitive edge that will
assist the company's vision and growth plans. Our partnership lays the
foundation on which future business functions can be supported in the
course of the next 10 years. This alliance is in line with Bharti Retail's
efforts to be a customer-centric and trusted retailer."

    "We are delighted to further strengthen our relationship with IBM. The
creation of the IT Community of Practice with IBM in 2004 has led to one
of the fastest integrations of IT anywhere in the globe," said Dr Jai
Menon, Director Bharti Airtel &amp; Group CIO, Bharti Enterprises. "We look
forward to replicating the unprecedented success we have had with them in
the telecom sector by consolidating, managing and delivering business
process transformation that will drive innovation and enhance value for
all Bharti Retail customers."

    The current scope of the deal includes Project Management, Infrastructure
for Data centers, Applications, Security and Network, and Support for
End-user Services. The scope of work will keep evolving as Bharti Retail's
business continues to grow. This partnership will provide Bharti Retail
with a differentiation in the market place including faster product to
market and cost efficiencies. Bharti Retail will also draw upon IBM's
global expertise and innovations in programming like the automated
attendance terminals to help maintain a very low PC footprint
(approximately 1 PC per 30 employees). These efforts will link into the
core platform set up with technical support that Wal-Mart Inc. is
providing to Bharti Retail under the franchise agreement between the two
entities.

    "This is a strategic win for IBM which is a testament to the trust Bharti
places in IBM's cross-industry capabilities. Our collaboration with Bharti
goes back over four years and our joint commitment to innovation
throughout our business relationship continues to pay off. Our goal is to
ensure that Bharti Retail has the support it needs to be a
customer-focused retail enterprise committed to delivering high value to
their customers," said Ashish Kumar, Vice President, Client Services, IBM.

    This partnership will also help Bharti benefit from IBM's ability to
leverage a cross industry play across Telecom - Insurance - Retail in
providing ease of accessibility and differentiated service to Bharti
clients.

&lt;p&gt;  UNTERFOHRING, GERMANY, Aug 25 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
ProSiebenSat.1 Produktion, the ProSiebenSat.1 Group's technical service
provider, and IBM (NYSE: IBM) are setting up the media group's central
tapeless archive in terms of an agreement worth four million euro. The
new agreement extends the ten year, 200 million euro IT services
agreement signed with IBM in April 2008.

    The new contract is for IBM to design and implement the new tapeless
archive, the ProSiebenSat.1 "materialpool," to store all of
ProSiebenSat.1 Group's moving image material as digital files.

    The tapeless archive will allow the media group's program content to be
easily and simultaneously available for use on different platforms. In
addition to classic television, new distribution channels such as video on
demand, IPTV or cellphone TV will benefit from the file-based
materialpool. Storage duplication will be avoided as content will no
longer be copied for different distribution channels but retrievable from
the same file. IBM will manage total integration into the Group's
applications landscape. For instance, there will be an automatic data
interchange with the ProSiebenSat.1 transmission planning and rights
management systems. Different image formats and resolutions are supported,
including high definition.

    "We are progressively replacing tapes with files. In the future, employees
at our various subsidiaries and locations will be able to access and
process the same material simultaneously. Technical quality control will
then be largely automated," said Dr. Martin Emele, General Manager,
ProSiebenSat.1 Produktion. "IBM is helping us to make our work process
faster and cheaper."

    "Broadcasters require dramatically more cost-effective and efficient ways
to capture and store digital content, repurpose that content and make it
electronically available for both traditional and new distribution
outlets," said Dr. Niko Waesche, IBM Relationship Manager for
ProSiebenSat.1. "The materialpool that will be set up in Unterfoehring is
one of the most modern tapeless television production systems in Europe
with a very high level of flexibility."

    The tapeless archive is to be built from spring next year. It will be
expandable and take into account ProSiebenSat.1 Group cross-location and
international cooperation requirements. Adaptable interfaces to other
systems will ensure flexibility and future safety. Along with a
multi-channel playout, the materialpool will be the second pillar of the
new tapeless playout center that ProSiebenSat.1 Produktion will open in
early 2009 at the company's Unterfoehring, Munich, headquarters.

    IBM is working with its broadcast technology partner VizRT to connect the
VizRT Ardome media asset management system with other ProSiebenSat.1
Group systems. This will enable new and effective production processes to
be put into effect in playout and content management. Using the IBM Media
Hub architecture and IBM ADMIRA essence management, processes can be
managed flexibly by means of modern workflow management.

    About ProSiebenSat.1 Produktion

    ProSiebenSat.1 Produktion, a wholly owned ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG
subsidiary, is with around 1,000 employees the ProSiebenSat.1 Group's
largest business unit. The company makes an important contribution to the
Group's success in the core areas Production, Creative Solutions,
Broadcasting Services, and Technology. Its portfolio of services ranges
from outdoor, studio and post-production via on air design and promotion
to integrated asset management and transmission handling services for more
than ten TV stations.

&lt;p&gt;Morph Labs hosts the first DB2 Express-C database "in the cloud" as part of IBM's "Search for the XML Superstar" contest

PORTLAND, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
Morph Labs, a leading provider of Platform as a Service (PaaS) for
web applications, has been selected to support the global "Search for
the XML Superstar" contest sponsored by IBM and the International DB2
User Group (IDUG). Morph Labs will provide an online version of the
IBM DB2 Express-C database server and an associated web application
interface to allow contestants from around the world to take part in
the competition easily.

   "Search for the XML Superstar" is part of the International DB2
User Group (IDUG)'s efforts to highlight the benefits of DB2 and
related technologies and is expected to attract hundreds of thousands
of contestants from countries around the world. More details can be
found at http://channeldb2.com/superstar

   Morph Labs and the IBM DB2 team have worked together to create an
online application that will allow contestants to access a fully
configured and populated DB2 Express-C database in the Morph Labs
cloud environment.

   Running inside a Morph AppSpace, the application and associated
cloud-resident DB2 Express-C database will provide the participating
XML developers with an environment in which they can use their XML
skills without having to download, install and configure the database
first.

   "We are delighted to be working with Morph Labs to
simplify participation in the Search for the XML Superstar contest,"
said Leon Katsnelson, program director for IBM Data Management. "By
connecting to DB2 Express-C hosted on reliable Morph Labs cloud
computing infrastructure, XML contest participants can explore the
power of DB2 pureXML and XQuery from their web browser without a need
to install and manage their own DB2 server."

   "The project to set up and run DB2 Express-C within a Morph
AppSpace has resulted in a good working relationship with the IBM DB2
team, which we hope to develop further," said David Abramowski, CEO of
Morph Labs. "As cloud computing becomes more mainstream we are looking
to add features to our Morph AppSpace service for enterprise customers
- including the DB2 database."

   Morph AppSpace is a comprehensive service that combines
technology, people and automation to deploy, deliver and manage
web-based applications in a hosted environment. Currently supporting
Ruby on Rails, Java and Grails applications, Morph AppSpace is the
broadest and most open Platform as a Service in the marketplace today.

&lt;p&gt;Covergence Integrates Multi-vendor PBX Environments into Microsoft Office Communicator Client without Requiring Rip and Replace of Existing Telephony Infrastructure

   Company's Latest Subscription Service Provides PBX Line Presence
   and Click-to-Call Functionality to Microsoft Office Communicator
                                Client
MAYNARD, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Covergence(R), Inc., the leading provider of solutions that enable
organizations to deploy, control, manage and utilize voice in the same
manner they do today with their existing enterprise applications,
today unveiled Covergence Call Control (CCC) which extends enterprise
PBX investments by incorporating them into Unified Communications (UC)
platforms such as Microsoft's Office Communications Server (OCS).

   Many forward-looking organizations have begun adopting UC
platforms, but their initiatives to improve communications, increase
collaboration and improve productivity have been postponed due to the
fact that most PBX vendors don't support third-party integration. CCC
enables that integration and brings UC functionality to OCS. With CCC,
users manage their telephone communications directly from their MS
Office Communicator (MOC) and can initiate calls from any location
using the phone of their choice - PBX, cellular or home. The service
also adds PBX line presence so users can see the availability status
of their internal and external contacts and use the click-to-call
function to speak with them directly. Click-to-call dialing simplifies
telephony and eliminates the use of paper or online telephone
directories.

   "We provided this capability for our service provider customers
using Broadsoft and now we are bringing it to our enterprise
customers," said Covergence President and CEO Jim Moran. "Large
enterprises have hundreds or even thousands of PBXs and this new
solution allows organizations to interconnect all their PBXs with
their MOC clients without costly upgrades."

   A lack of interoperability between communications platforms is a
critical factor preventing UC from reaching critical mass within
enterprises. CCC breaks down some of these barriers by translating
telephony information between uaCSTA and PBX-supported protocols such
as JTAPI (Java Telephony API) and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
and by effectively acting as a gateway between the OCS server and the
enterprise PBX. This allows companies to easily integrate their PBX
into their UC deployment strategies and provides them with a variety
of new features including PBX line presence and call control.

   "While companies are taking measured steps towards achieving their
UC goals, they are also looking for cost-effective solutions that
leverage their existing infrastructure as much as possible during
migration," said IDC Senior Research Analyst Nora Freedman. "Solutions
like Covergence's latest offering helps to address this need by
integrating legacy systems with proprietary communications standards
associated with the latest UC platforms."

   CCC marks the second installment of Covergence's latest
interoperability subscription services. Earlier this month, the
company announced the availability of the Covergence Collaboration
Gateway. The Covergence Collaboration Gateway delivers controlled,
secure connectivity between disparate UC platforms including Microsoft
(OCS) and IBM Lotus Sametime, allowing users from different
organizations - even different companies - to work together as if they
were served by the same UC platform, enjoying shared presence
information, instant messaging and other features.

   Covergence Call Control is available immediately. To learn more,

&lt;p&gt;Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Chevron Corp., Linktone Ltd., DRDGOLD Ltd., Salesforce.com, Inc. and UTStarcom, Inc.

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst
Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest
news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks
recently featured in the blog include: Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX),
Linktone Ltd. (Nasdaq: LTON), DRDGOLD Ltd. (Nasdaq: DROOY),
Salesforce.com, Inc. (NYSE: CRM) and UTStarcom, Inc. (Nasdaq: UTSI).

   Get the most recent insight from Zacks Equity Research with the
free Profit from the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=4579

   Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:

   Chevron at a Great Value

   We are upgrading Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) shares to Buy from Hold
following the stock's recent commodity-price related weakness. We
think that the risk-reward trade-off is very favorable at current
levels.

   While a weak oil price environment may weigh on the stock over the
coming weeks, we believe that Chevron's strong pipeline -- which is
projected to add more than 1 MMBOE/d by 2011 -- and impressive recent
exploration successes have significantly improved its long-term
upstream growth prospects.

   Linktone Unprofitable Thru '09

   Linktone Ltd. (Nasdaq: LTON) is a provider of wireless interactive
entertainment services for mobile telephone users and advertising
services to enterprises in China.

   The Chinese wireless value-added services market has seen
increasingly intense competition and the policy/regulatory changes
have a material impact on Linktone's business. However, the company's
revenue has increased sequentially for three consecutive quarters,
which may indicate that the worst time for Linktone has passed.
Advertising service business may become another revenue source for the
company.

   DRDGOLD with Certain Challenges

   In the fourth quarter, unhedged gold-producing company DRDGOLD
Ltd.'s (Nasdaq: DROOY) headline earnings from continuing operations
were $2.52 per share, compared to a loss from continuing operations of
$0.25 per share in the year ago quarter when measured in constant
currencies. Total revenue was $65 million, up 30% from $50 million
recorded in the previous year's corresponding quarter when measured in
constant currencies. Gold production from continuing operations for
the quarter was 1% higher at 71,211 oz.

   With minimal debt on its balance sheet, DRDGOLD is well positioned
to undertake expansion activities. However, there are some challenges
facing the company with respect to its aging assets, environmental
laws, currency risks and power shortages. Thus, we rate the stock a
Hold with a six-month target price of $6.

   Salesforce.com Trending Strong

   Salesforce.com, Inc. (NYSE: CRM) is the market leader in the
on-demand Customer Relationship Management (CRM) space and continues
to see substantial subscriber and customer growth.

   While the company reported strong second half results and raised
full-year revenue guidance, dilution from the InStranet acquisition
will result in lower than expected second half EPS. Although this will
penalize the stock, we believe InStranet makes strategic sense, and
over the long-term EPS growth will accelerate. We therefore reiterate
our Buy rating on Salesforce.com's shares.

   UTStarcom Keeping Grounded

   UTStarcom, Inc. (Nasdaq: UTSI), a provider of IP-based telecom
equipments, announced encouraging second quarter 2008 financial
results, above our estimates.

   This was primarily due to growing acceptance for the company's
IPTV solutions and personal communications devices (PCD). We believe
market demand for the company's IPTV and optical transport solutions
remains firm as opportunities appear respectable at several carriers
in Asia and Latin America. Recent divestiture of the PCD and mobile
solutions businesses will foster adequate focus on the company's core
IP-based business, while simultaneously improving overall margins.

&lt;p&gt;PARIS (Reuters) - French biotechnology firm Nicox (NCOX.PA) said on Monday U.S. partner Pfizer (PFE.N) had decided not to launch Phase III studies in Asia of an experimental treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Nicox and Pfizer are currently in discussions regarding the rights to PF-03187207 (the tested nitric oxide-donating treatment), to allow its potential continued development and commercialization," Nicox said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, Pfizer decided not to take Nicox's experimental glaucoma drug PF-03187207 into final Phase III tests outside of Asia after a mid-stage study failed to meet its primary endpoint, causing Nicox shares to tumble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news was a serious blow to Nicox as it had been working on developing eye treatments with Pfizer for over four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on Monday, Nicox said joint research with Pfizer would now focus on diabetic retinopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are also pleased by the progress that has been made in the research program focused on diabetic retinopathy, where we hope a lead compound will be selected in the first half of next year," Nicox Chairman and Chief Executive Michele Garufi said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Astrid Wendlandt)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Pfizer Inc said on Tuesday their apixaban blood clot preventer failed its primary goal in a late-stage trial, and that they no longer plan to seek marketing approval next year for the pill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the drugmakers and industry analysts said some data in the trial were encouraging and that the medicine could still prove effective in preventing dangerous blood clots in other large trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not good news, but not a death knell either," said Michael Castor, a portfolio manager with health-care fund Sio Capital Management. He noted that the drug remains in development, including for other uses, and did show effectiveness despite missing the trial's main goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stocks of both drugmakers were little changed in after-hours trading. Bristol-Myers closed unchanged at $21.98, while Pfizer fell 23 cents to $19.28, both on the New York Stock Exchange in regular trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Phase III trial was designed to show whether twice-daily apixaban was at least as effective as twice-daily injections of Sanofi-Aventis' Lovenox in preventing dangerous blood clots among patients undergoing knee-replacement surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The failure represents another setback for two companies that had hoped apixaban would become a big seller and bolster their earnings in the face of looming generic competition within three years for their best-selling drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not to say that apixaban is buried, but this initial poor result is another in a string of poor partnering decisions that Pfizer has recently made," said Damien Conover, an analyst with Morningstar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drugmakers said 9 percent of knee-surgery patients receiving apixaban developed dangerous clots, versus 8.9 percent of those receiving Lovenox. The new drug, therefore, was not deemed statistically as effective as Lovenox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bristol-Myers said this was surprising because about 16 percent of patients taking Lovenox had developed dangerous clots in earlier studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients had statistically similar incidents of major bleeding, although the combined incidence of major and non-major bleeding was significantly less in patients given apixaban, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apixaban has generated excitement because it works through a new mechanism of action, by blocking a protein called Factor Xa that is instrumental in the clotting process. A similar drug, called rivaroxaban, is being co-developed by Bayer AG and Johnson  Johnson and considered slightly farther along in testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This would seem to benefit Johnson  Johnson and Bayer," said Mike Krensavage, a principal of Krensavage Asset Management. "It's another setback for Pfizer as well," he said, referring to its string of drug failures in recent years that has driven the company's stock to 10-year lows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just weeks ago, Bristol-Myers described apixaban as the most promising of its medicines in late-stage studies. Analysts have said it could become a blockbuster drug, especially if it proves effective in preventing strokes among patients with atrial fibrillation, a form of irregular heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the setback, the drugmakers said they remain confident in apixaban and will continue other large studies of the medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first of eight Phase III trials for a broad range of indications, including atrial fibrillation, and we view all of them as very significant opportunities," said Jack Lawrence, a Bristol-Myers research official who heads the apixaban program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf and Bill Berkrot; editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--  Apixaban Phase II Acute Coronary Syndrome Data to be Presented
        at European Society of Cardiology Meeting on Sept. 2

   --  U.S. Regulatory Filing for the Prevention of Venous
        Thromboembolism will not be submitted in 2009, as previously
        indicated

   --  Other Clinical Programs Continue as Planned
PRINCETON, N.J. &amp; NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) and Pfizer Inc (NYSE:
PFE) provided an update on the apixaban clinical development program
today. The companies announced that new Phase II data in acute
coronary syndrome patients (ACS) will be presented at the upcoming
meeting of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). In addition,
Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer reported that an early evaluation of
results from a Phase III study of apixaban for the prevention of
venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients undergoing total knee
replacement indicates that the primary endpoint of this study was not
met.

   The Phase III VTE prevention study known as ADVANCE-1 compared
apixaban, a novel, oral Factor Xa inhibitor given at a dose of 2.5 mg,
twice daily, to the FDA-approved dose of enoxaparin, 30 mg given twice
daily. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of symptomatic or
asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and death by
any cause. The rate of the primary efficacy endpoint on apixaban was
numerically similar to that observed with enoxaparin (9.0% vs. 8.9%,
p=.064), but did not meet the pre-specified statistical criteria for
non-inferiority compared to enoxaparin. The actual enoxaparin VTE rate
of 8.9 percent was lower than the expected VTE rate of 16 percent seen
in previous similar clinical trials, resulting in an inability to
demonstrate non-inferiority.

   In ADVANCE-1, there were no unexpected findings in adverse events
for apixaban compared to enoxaparin. The major bleeding event rate for
apixaban was numerically lower, but was not significantly lower, than
enoxaparin (0.7% vs. 1.4%, p=.053). The composite rate of clinically
relevant non-major bleeding and major bleeding was significantly less
in patients who received apixaban than those who received enoxaparin
(2.9% vs. 4.3%, p =.034).

   Full results of the ADVANCE-1 trial have been submitted to the
American Society of Hematology Meeting (ASH) for presentation in
December.

   ADVANCE-1 results confirm the characteristics of apixaban as
reported previously in phase II studies. The companies are considering
further studies with different protocols in preventing VTE in knee
surgery and will not submit the U.S. filing for VTE prevention in the
2nd half of 2009, as previously communicated. The results of ADVANCE
-1 do not necessitate any changes in protocols of any other ongoing
apixaban studies. Programs directed towards prevention of VTE
including EMEA registrational studies, treatment of VTE, and in the
prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation continue as planned.

   "Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer remain enthusiastic and committed
to the clinical development program for apixaban," said Jack Lawrence,
vice president, Research and Development, Bristol-Myers Squibb.
"Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer anticipate that the results of
APPRAISE-1 being presented at ESC will provide important insight into
the potential use of apixaban for the secondary prevention of
cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome, which
affects an estimated 2.7 million people around the world every year."

   About the Apixaban Clinical Program

   Apixaban, an oral, factor Xa inhibitor in a new class of agents
that have shown therapeutic potential to prevent and treat blood
clots, is currently being explored in the EXPANSE clinical trial
program which includes eight Phase III clinical studies involving
approximately 45,000 patients worldwide. The ADVANCE-2 and 3 trials
are investigating the safety and efficacy of apixaban 2.5 mg twice
daily compared to enoxaparin 40 mg once daily in patients undergoing
major orthopedic surgery. The ADOPT study is investigating apixaban
for one month compared to standard of care (enoxaparin 40 mg once
daily for at least 6 days followed by placebo) for the prevention of
VTE in hospitalized patients who are medically ill and at risk of VTE.

   Apixaban is also in Phase III trials studying the prevention of
stroke and other thromboembolic events in patients with atrial
fibrillation (AF). The AF program consists of two trials. The
ARISTOTLE trial is investigating apixaban compared to warfarin in
approximately 15,000 patients with atrial fibrillation. The AVERROES
trial is investigating apixaban compared to aspirin in approximately
5,600 patients with atrial fibrillation who are ineligible for vitamin
K antagonists (VKA) treatment or haven't tolerated previous VKA
treatment.

   The VTE treatment program consists of two trials. The AMPLIFY
trial is a 6-month trial investigating apixaban compared to enoxaparin
plus warfarin in approximately 4,800 patients with acute DVT or PE.
The AMPLIFY-EXT trial is a 12-month trial investigating apixaban
compared to placebo for extended treatment to prevent recurrent VTE in
approximately 2,400 patients who have completed 6 to 12 months of
treatment for DVT or PE.

&lt;p&gt;Mintz Levin Achieves Significant Victory Against Microsoft Corporation in Patent Infringement Case

    New Trial is Ordered for Client, Uniloc, Inc., in Case Against
                            Software Giant
BOSTON--(Business Wire)--
Uniloc, Inc., a security technology provider represented by Mintz,
Levin Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C., achieved a major victory
in its patent infringement case against Microsoft Corporation when the
Federal Circuit reversed a summary judgment and ordered the matter
back to trial.

   The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
reversed the Summary Judgment of the U.S. District Court for the
District of Rhode Island (Uniloc USA, Inc. and Uniloc Singapore
Private, Ltd. v. Microsoft Corp., U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit, No. 08-1121, 8/7/08) of non-infringement and remanded
the matter back to the District Court for trial. Uniloc alleged that
the anti-piracy software registration system of Microsoft's Product
Activation system infringed on U.S. Patent No. 5,490,216.

   The Federal Circuit concluded that the District Court erred in
granting Summary Judgment by failing to credit this admission of
Microsoft's affiants confirming that the same algorithms at issue were
used in Microsoft's system. The Federal Circuit also flatly rejected
all of Microsoft's alternative claim construction arguments.

Intellectual Property practice, represented Uniloc, Inc.

&lt;p&gt;  RALEIGH, NC and LONDON, Aug 26 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Patersons HR and Payroll Solutions, a leading global HR and payroll
software and services business delivering expert solutions to clients in
more than 160 countries, today announced its expanded relationship with
IBM Cognos. Under the terms of the redefined alliance, Patersons HR and
Payroll Solutions is delivering IBM Cognos 8 seamlessly to its clients.
The integration with Patersons HR and Payroll Solutions brings HR and
Payroll data to the desktop, enabling HR professionals to conduct "what
if" scenarios and make fact-based decisions using both HR and payroll
data.

    IBM Cognos 8 Business Intelligence delivers the complete range of business
intelligence capabilities on a single, service-oriented architecture
(SOA). Users can author, share, and use reports that draw on data across
all enterprise sources for better business decisions. The IBM Cognos 8
platform delivers consistent information in terms that business users
understand through a common business model, multidimensional PowerCube
creation, the ability to publish sections of a user's model to different
user communities and improved data security.

    Patersons HR and Payroll Solutions and Cognos have worked together since
2001. The latest version of IBM Cognos, known as IBM Cognos 8, is now
accessible to Patersons' clients through the Patersons' secure on-demand
solution known as Logon2. By combining the power of IBM Cognos 8 with the
global breadth of Patersons' Logon2, the basis of an unparalleled
HR/Payroll business reporting capability is formed. Reports can be created
ad hoc or users can select from a wide range of pre-defined reports.

    Additionally, there are standard Patersons' "data cubes" within IBM Cognos
8 that are built from the existing fields in the Patersons Logon2
database. These data cubes can be deployed very quickly and enable
analysis across multiple parameters with the ability to "drill into"
reports for more details. It is now genuinely possible for the HR
function to deliver metrics and scorecards that demonstrate the
contribution that people make to the organization. Furthermore, because
the reporting automatically accesses both HR and Payroll data, all HR
metrics can be put in the context of their full cost to the business.
This gives HR the ability to confidently move into the commercial and
strategic arena, and is a tangible step towards the transformation of HR
away from its old-fashioned "administrative" roots.

    The advanced features within both Patersons' Logon2 and IBM's Cognos 8
enable report users to easily and flexibly transform their HR and Payroll
data into meaningful business information without the time and cost of
developing additional bespoke reports. Patersons HR and Payroll Solutions'
portal and IBM Cognos 8 are also tightly integrated in Microsoft Office,
which means users can accomplish their complex reporting requirements
without having to learn new products.

    Martin Stockton, Group Vice President - Business Development, commented,
"Many of our clients are continually looking for better ways of accessing
and analyzing their HR and Payroll data in order to support their business
decisions. Now, because the full details of payroll are available through
the same reporting channel as HR, HR data can be made more commercially
focused than ever before. By using IBM Cognos 8 to drill into the vast
store of global HR and Payroll data available from Patersons' Logon2
solution, HR can gain access to valuable information, such as forecasting
the cost impact of moving operations from one country to another by
analyzing the full cost of employment, absence rates and labor turnover."

    He continued, "As a leading Business Analytics tool, Cognos 8 provides
Patersons customers with an integrated reporting application that will
draw upon the power of our Logon2 HR and Payroll data to produce true
business metrics reporting. The data cubes provided by Patersons can be
deployed with a suite of ready built reports covering all aspects of HR
and Payroll data, together with customer specific requirements. As a
hosted software on demand solution, both Logon2 and Cognos 8 can be
deployed quickly, cost effectively and backed by Patersons' Global
support infrastructure."

    Since IBM Cognos 8 is integrated with Patersons HR and Payroll Solutions'
Logon2 product, it is delivered via Patersons' software-as-a-service
delivery model. Using SaaS means Patersons' customers do not have to
invest in dedicated hardware and can access the applications as needed
under a subscription model. Additionally, working with Patersons HR and
Payroll Solutions delivers a safe, secure computing environment with full
failover protection.

    Karen Paterson, CEO of Patersons HR and Payroll Solutions, commented,
"Payroll and HR decisions need to be based on quality data and examined in
a meaningful context. IBM Cognos is one of the leaders in business
intelligence and we've chosen to align ourselves with them to ensure that
our clients are receiving the industry's most robust and proven reporting
tools. Unlike typical off the shelf applications, the Patersons solution
is uniquely positioned to deliver the elusive strategic reporting that HR
and Payroll departments have been searching for."

ORCL.O are holding up strongly this year after the companies
gained share from IBM (IBM.N) in 2007, according to market
research firm Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft and Oracle continue to make advancements in
certain faster-growing areas," Gartner analyst Colleen Graham
said in an interview. "IBM continues to struggle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales of Microsoft's database software climbed 16.5 percent
to $3.1 billion last year, buoyed by growth in Asia and Eastern
Europe. The No. 3 player in the market also expanded sales to
mid-sized businesses in North America, Graham said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's market share widened to 18.1 percent from 17.6
percent, according to data that Gartner released to Reuters on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Graham said that Microsoft's software is gaining popularity
because it generally includes more bells and whistles in basic
versions that rival software from Oracle and IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The product is cheaper," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Sales at Oracle, by far the market leader, rose 14.9
percent in 2007 to $8.3 billion. Its market share grew to 48.6
percent from 47.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oracle's strategy for boosting sales is to introduce new
features that it can sell to its broad, existing customer base,
an approach that Graham said has paid off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Oracle is like a really tricked-out car. You can get all
this really great stuff, but you have to pay extra for all the
options," Graham said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While sales at No. 2 player International Business Corp
rose 10 percent to $3.5 billion, its market share contracted to
20.7 percent last year from 21.3 percent, according to
Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One factor hampering IBM's growth rate is that customers
who buy its database software tend to use the programs on IBM
hardware, whose sales are not growing as quickly as the systems
that are most often used with databases from Microsoft and
Oracle, Graham said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's database, by contrast, is generally used with
the software maker's own Windows Server operating system.
Oracle's database is typically run on the widely used Linux
operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Database sales at the three companies accounted for about
87 percent of the $17.1 billion global market for database
software last year, according to Gartner.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has downgraded two classes of JP Morgan Commercial
Mortgage Securities Corp. pass-through certificates, series 2003-PM1
as follows:

   --$4.3 million class N from 'B' to 'B-';

   --$2.9 million class P from 'CCC' to 'CCC/DR1'.

   In addition, Fitch has affirmed the following classes:

   --$312.4 million class A1A at 'AAA';

   --$40.1 million class A-2 at 'AAA';

   --$82.6 million class A-3 at 'AAA';

   --$282 million class A-4 at 'AAA';

   --Interest-only class X-1 at 'AAA';

   --Interest-only class X-2 at 'AAA';

   --$33.2 million class B at 'AAA';

   --$13 million class C at 'AAA';

   --$27.5 million class D at 'AAA';

   --$13 million class E at 'AA+';

   --$15.9 million class F at 'AA-';

   --$13 million class G at 'A';

   --$18.8 million class H at 'BBB+';

   --$15.9 million class J at 'BBB-';

   --$7.2 million class K at 'BB+';

   --$8.7 million class L at 'BB';

   --$7.2 million class M at 'B+'.

   Class A-1 has paid in full. Fitch does not rate the $14.7 million
class NR certificates.

   The downgrades are the result of expected losses on the four loans
(2%) currently in special servicing as well as higher than expected
losses on a loan disposed from the trust.

   Two loans (1.6%) are secured by multifamily properties located in
Fort Worth, TX and are controlled by MBS Cos., a property owner and
operator that defaulted on a portfolio of multifamily properties in
late 2007. Recent property valuations indicate that significant losses
are possible upon liquidation. Fitch's analysis reflects the risk
associated with these loans.

   The third specially serviced loan (0.46%) is collateralized by an
industrial warehouse located in Tustin, CA. The loan is 90+ days
delinquent on debt service payments. The servicer is currently trying
to establish contact with the operator. Losses are possible.

   The final specially serviced loan (0.18%) is secured by a
multifamily property in Springfield, IL. The loan has a history of
delinquencies and the borrower is currently working with the special
servicer to cure all defaults. Losses are possible.

   The affirmations reflect scheduled amortization and defeasance
since Fitch's last rating action. As of the August 2008 distribution
date, the pool's aggregate certificate balance has decreased 21% to
$913 million from $1.16 billion at issuance. Thirteen loans (21%),
including the largest two loans in the transaction (11.6%), are fully
defeased.

   The majority of the non-defeased pool (55.6%) matures in 2013. The
weighted average interest rate for these loans is 5.58%. The largest
non-defeased loan in the pool (5.6%) is secured by a retail property
in West Palm Beach, FL, has an interest rate of 6.20% and matures in
October 2012. The servicer reported December 2007 Debt Service
Coverage Ratio was 1.40 times.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department could take several steps to buttress Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac before taking direct take control of the mortgage finance companies, according to a report released by Goldman Sachs on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, the Treasury agreed to lend the companies money or give them a capital injection if either were to face collapse, and Wall Street has lately shunned the companies for fear that such a bailout would damage existing shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a research note that outlined several scenarios for government aid, Goldman Sachs stated that an aggressive government intervention was a last option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If either company's capital were to dip below its required level, the report states that it "would put more pressure on the Treasury to explicitly back the liabilities of the GSEs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the report states, "the Treasury would opt for one of the earlier options to avoid such an outcome."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common shares of the government-sponsored enterprises have sunk in recent days and even their relatively safe preferred shares have lost value as investors have turned their backs on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Goldman report states that the Treasury might stand aside and hope that companies find their own footing. If the Treasury does intervene, it might first choose to ease capital demands on the two companies since many investors fret that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are bound to dip below the capital levels set by regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Treasury deems that the situation is worsening, it might either buy mortgage securities from the GSEs or directly inject capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While any government intervention would likely cost the taxpayer money, the Goldman report states that any scenario for intervention "would be an entirely management event in the context of the federal budget."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Patrick Rucker, Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)&lt;/p&gt;

Securities Trust 2006-LDP9 commercial mortgage pass-through
certificates as follows:

   -- $44 million class A-1 at 'AAA';

   -- $6.1 million class N at 'B';

   -- $12.1 million class P at 'B-/DR1'.

   Fitch does not rate the $54.6 million class NR.

   The rating affirmations reflect minimal paydown since issuance and
stable performance of the pool. As of the August 2008 distribution
date, the transaction has paid down by 0.04% to $4.835 billion from
$4.854 at issuance. In total, 18 loans are considered Fitch loans of
concern (4.4%), including six specially serviced assets (1.8%). The
largest specially serviced loan (0.5%) is secured by a multifamily
property in Bradenton, FL. The loan is current, but it was transferred
to special servicing in June 2008 due to the borrower's failure to set
up a lockbox. The special servicer is currently working with the
master servicer and borrower to establish the lockbox.

   Two (0.4%) of the five specially serviced assets are multifamily
properties located in Houston, TX. The borrowing entities, controlled
by MBS Cos., declared bankruptcy immediately prior to the special
servicer filing for foreclosure. Vacant units were stripped of
appliances and are in poor condition. The special servicer is
determining the cost to bring all units to leasable condition. Losses
are expected.

   Fitch considers the following loans to have investment grade
shadow ratings: The Belnord, Merchandise Mart, Centro Heritage
Portfolio III, Raytheon LAX, and Tysons Galleria. The Belnord (7.8%)
is a mixed-use property consisting of 215 residential units and 60,514
square feet (sf) of retail space located on the Upper West Side
neighborhood of Manhattan, NY. The borrower is currently renovating
the property and is in the process of converting the rent
controlled/stabilized residential units and below-market leases on the
retail space to market rents. At issuance, there were 141 rent
controlled/stabilized units. As of June 30, 2008, there were 130 rent
controlled/stabilized units. The current rate of conversion is
consistent with Fitch's expectation at issuance. The debt service
reserve is approximately $36.8 million.

   Merchandise Mart (3.6%) is a 3.4 million sf trade mart and office
property located in downtown Chicago, IL. Major tenants include MTS-MM
LLC, Banker's Life and Casualty Company (rated 'BBB', with a Negative
Outlook by Fitch) and CCC Information Services. The property benefits
from the sponsorship of Vornado Realty Trust (rated 'BBB', Outlook
Stable), a real estate investment trust (REIT). Occupancy as of
February 2008 has increased to 98.7% from 95% at issuance. Centro
Heritage Portfolio III (3.0%), the eighth largest loan in the pool, is
collateralized by a portfolio consisting of 2.6 million sf in 14
retail properties located throughout IL, WI, IA, IN and MO. The
sponsor is Centro Watt America REIT IGA, a partnership between
Australian-based Centro Properties Group (rated 'CCC', and on Rating
Watch Negative) and Watt Commercial Properties of Los Angeles.
Occupancy as of year-end 2007 is 90% compared to 93.6% at issuance.

&lt;p&gt;New ExxonMobil Brochure Educates Fleet Managers and Owner-Operators about the Benefits of Mobil Delvac Synthetic Heavy-Duty Diesel Engine Oils

   Tests Show Mobil Delvac Synthetic Lubricants Deliver Outstanding
      Equipment Protection, While Helping to Enhance Fuel Economy
FAIRFAX, Va.--(Business Wire)--
To help educate trucking fleet managers and owner-operators about
how synthetic lubricants can enhance the performance and reliability
of their vehicles, as well as potentially deliver fuel economy
benefits, ExxonMobil today introduced a new six-page color brochure
for its flagship Mobil Delvac synthetic commercial vehicle lubricants.

   The Mobil Delvac lineup of the fully synthetic heavy-duty
lubricants includes Mobil Delvac Synthetic Transmission Fluid, Mobil
Delvac Synthetic Gear Oil, Mobil Delvac Synthetic ATF, and Mobil
Delvac 1 ESP 5W-40 which, in June 2007, became the world's first API
CJ-4 licensed all synthetic 5W-40 lubricant.

   Available in print or online at
(www.mobildelvac.com/USA-English/Lubes/files/Mobil_Delvac_
Fleet_Edge.pdf), the brochure details how using high quality synthetic
lubricants, such as Mobil Delvac 1 ESP 5W-40, can help fleet managers
and owner-operators extend drain intervals, enhance soot handling, and
minimize wear, leading to lower maintenance costs and downtime. (Due
to its length, the above URL may need to be copied/pasted into your
Internet browser's address field.  Remove the extra space if one
exists.)

   In addition, the brochure provides key data, with accompanying
graphics and detailed charts, that shows how Mobil Delvac's full range
of synthetic oils have performed in the most challenging OEM and
industry standard benchmark tests, such as Sequence IIIG Oxidation
Test, CEC L60-1 Thermal Oxidation Test, and Cummins ISB Wear Test.

   Test results show that Mobil Delvac 1 ESP, Mobil Delvac Synthetic
Gear Oils and Mobil Delvac Synthetic Transmission Fluids, when used in
combination, can help trucking fleets and/or owner-operators generate
up to three-percent fuel savings, compared to conventional, mineral
lubricants.

   "As the trucking industry continues to become more competitive,
and the technology used in today's vehicles continues to become more
advanced, fleet managers and owner-operators are increasingly looking
at ways to lower their costs, by maximizing the performance of their
vehicles and enhancing fuel economy," said Yeong Kwon, Commercial
Vehicle Lubricants' product offer adviser, ExxonMobil Lubricants &amp;
Petroleum Specialties Company.

   "With our full lineup of Mobil Delvac-branded, high performance,
synthetic lubricants, we continue to extend our legacy of being at the
forefront of lubricant technology, providing the marketplace with a
range of products that deliver outstanding oxidation resistance, wear
protection and viscosity stability, as well as improved fuel economy."

lubricants, or other Mobil Delvac products and services, please call

&lt;p&gt; (Changes source; adds details, stock movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aug 26 (Reuters) - William Blair  Co initiated coverage of
Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) with an "outperform"
rating, saying there is potential for growth in payment card
volume as the shift towards card-based payments continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The payment-card volume should grow substantially helped by
new plastic-money technology, modernization of payment
infrastructure in developing nations and the increase in
cross-border travel, the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; William Blair said it views Visa and MasterCard as
investment opportunities as they are less exposed to the
weakening U.S. economy and have significant operating leverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage forecast revenue growth of 14 percent yearly
for Visa and earnings growth of 23 percent a year, over the
next five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For MasterCard, the brokerage expects revenue growth of 13
percent yearly and profit growth 22 percent a year, over a
five-year period, helped by opportunities in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Visa were trading down 10 cents at $73.22, while
those of MasterCard were trading down $1.00 at $233.20 Tuesday
morning on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;William Blair &amp; Company Initiates Coverage of Visa Inc. and MasterCard Incorporated With Outperform Ratings

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
William Blair &amp; Company initiated research coverage of Visa Inc.
(NYSE:V) ($73.32) and MasterCard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) ($234.20) with
Outperform ratings and Core Growth company profiles. Visa, based in
San Francisco, operates the largest global payment card network, while
MasterCard Incorporated, based in Purchase, New York, runs the
second-largest global payment card network.

   Analyst David Long estimated that Visa would earn $2.24 per share
in fiscal 2008, $2.75 per share in fiscal 2009, and $3.40 per share in
fiscal 2010. Long expects MasterCard to achieve earnings per share of
$8.85 in 2008, $11.20 in 2009, and $13.75 in 2010.

   "We believe payment card volume is poised for attractive growth as
a result of the continued move toward card-based payments, the
development of new payment solutions and categories, the modernization
of payment infrastructures in developing nations, and the increase in
cross-border travel," Long said. "In our opinion, Visa and MasterCard
are positioned to capitalize on these positive trends to produce
robust growth and strong financial results."

   "We expect Visa to produce attractive top- and bottom-line growth
relative to other large-cap companies and believe the company will
benefit from positive industry trends and expense rationalization
opportunities as it integrates its global franchise. We forecast
revenue growth of 14% per year and EPS growth of 23% per year over the
next five years," Long said. "We expect MasterCard to uniquely benefit
from opportunities in Europe (particularly as a result of SEPA), and
forecast revenue growth of 13% per year and EPS growth of 22% per year
over the next five years."

   Long concluded, "We view Visa and MasterCard as compelling
investment opportunities in the financial services sector. They have
unique growth opportunities; are less exposed to the weak U.S.
economy, which has been negatively affected by deteriorating housing
market conditions; and have significant operating leverage."

   William Blair &amp; Company, L.L.C. intends to seek or expects to
receive compensation for investment banking services from Visa Inc.
and MasterCard Incorporated in the next 3 months.

&lt;p&gt;Research and Markets: An Essential Report on JPMorgan Chase Showing Its IT Sales Opportunities for 2008

DUBLIN, Ireland--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/191ceb/jpmorgan_chase_i)
has announced the addition of the "JPMorgan Chase - IT Sales
Opportunities - 2008" report to their offering.

   JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPMorgan Chase), incorporated in 1968, is a
financial holding company. The company's principal bank subsidiaries
are JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A.), a national banking association with branches in 17 states, and
Chase Bank USA, National Association (Chase Bank USA, N.A.), a
national bank that is the Companys credit card issuing bank. The
group's principal non-banking subsidiary is J.P. Morgan Securities
Inc., its United States investment banking firm.

   Industry trends and drivers have a direct or indirect affect on IT
spending of all companies operating within an industry. For example -
increased threat perception and incidence of fraud would result in
increase in demand for security software and hardware. Thus, we can
conclude that industry spending on any particular IT product or
service is an important indicator of the criticality of that product
or service for the industry. Based on the IT spend information
available in 'TechNavio,' we have computed a 'criticality score' for
various IT products and services, for JPMorgan Chase.

   Various company level developments and events are important
indicators of selling opportunities and drive the sales of IT products
and services. For example - an acquisition by JPMorgan Chase might
result in opportunities for IT migration and integration services. By
tracking these sales drivers (using 'TechNavio'), we have arrived at a
demand score for each product and service.

   Through an in-depth analysis of industry trends and drivers and
company level developments and events, we have made the 'IT Selling
Opportunities Map' for hardware, software and IT services for JPMorgan
Chase. These maps have been divided into four zones representing Level
I, Level II and Level III opportunity areas. Level I opportunity areas
have the highest scores and hence, there is a high probability that
JPMorgan Chase will buy these products and services. Level II
opportunity areas have lower scores and hence, lower probability to
sell to JPMorgan Chase. Level III opportunities have the lowest scores
and hence, unlikely to sell to JPMorgan Chase.

   The report is meant for IT vendors and intends to help them
identify selling opportunities within the company. Furthermore, the
identified sales drivers can be used to penetrate these accounts or
increase current share of the customers wallet. Also, the report lists
key IT spending decision makers, which enables the salesperson to
directly contact the key executives within the company.

   TechNavio Insights is a set of reports based on TechNavio - a
market intelligence platform for the IT industry. It builds on the
intelligence available within TechNavio, and leverages on the custom
research experience of the Technology Navigators. TechNavio is built
on years of experience of the authors in deep dive custom research and
consulting for over 30 Fortune 500 companies and numerous large and
mid-sized companies.

&lt;p&gt;Decade Milestone Marked with Special Edition Release of
       Best-Selling Baby Mozart(TM) and Baby Beethoven(TM) DVDs
GLENDALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Since its debut 10 years ago, The Baby Einstein Company has been
making millions of moms and babies around the world smile with its
award-winning DVD - Baby Mozart. This best-selling title was developed
by a mom and former teacher, Julie Clark, with the goal of creating a
product that would encourage discovery and interactive experiences for
parents and their babies. Baby Mozart's popularity grew through the
power of mom-to-mom word-of-mouth and today is a must-have tool for
parents. To celebrate the milestone, for the first time ever, special
10th anniversary editions of Baby Mozart as well as the popular title
Baby Beethoven will be released on September 9, 2008 with expanded
content and new bonus features. Together, Baby Beethoven and Baby
Mozart create a unique opportunity for parents to expose their babies
to amazing music and eye-catching real-life images- all from a baby's
point of view.

   Both Baby Mozart and Baby Beethoven have been digitally and audio
re-mastered, and will feature a "Together Time Tips" bonus feature
narrated by Julie Clark, where parents will have the opportunity to
view useful tips and tools on how to make DVD viewing an interactive
and engaging experience for their children. From singing songs to
crawling, wiggling and jumping around, "Together Time Tips" encourages
parents and little ones to participate in the fun together. Moms and
babies can also experience the Discovery Cards bonus feature, which
now includes corresponding sounds to the real world image presented on
screen. Finally, an in-depth retrospective bonus feature with Julie
Clark and her two daughters will highlight key milestones over the
last decade from Clark's perspective including insights into the
conception of Baby Einstein, Clark's initial vision for the brand and
the overwhelming success of the company.

   "Ten years ago, I couldn't have imagined how widely used and loved
Baby Einstein would become - especially since I created the first
title simply to enjoy with my own baby," explains Julie Clark, founder
of Baby Einstein. "This anniversary marks a significant personal and
professional milestone for me and I continue to be thrilled,
overwhelmed and humbled by how many parents and children around the
world have enjoyed Baby Einstein. I'm very excited about the special
edition release of these DVDs, as I feel like the new features get to
the heart of what this brand is all about: interacting with young
children while exposing them to beautiful music and imagery."

   Baby Mozart and Baby Beethoven special edition titles will feature
packaging with a new look and a commemorative silver anniversary seal
on the exterior packaging. The Baby Einstein Company is the
award-winning creator of the infant media category and best-selling
brand of DVDs for infants, from birth. As with every Baby Einstein
DVD, the special edition Baby Mozart and Baby Beethoven DVD titles
feature multi-language viewing options including English, Spanish and
French. Available at major retailers and online, the suggested retail
price is $19.99 for DVD. Baby Mozart and Baby Beethoven are
recommended for children aged three months and up.

&lt;p&gt;Expand Five Year Strategic Agreement With New Focus on Healthcare,
                Communications and Insurance Industries
CUPERTINO, Calif. &amp; ARMONK, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
Chordiant Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHRD), the leading provider of
Customer Experience (Cx(TM)) software and services, and IBM (NYSE:IBM)
today announced an extended partnership to deliver Service Oriented
Architecture (SOA)-based solutions to help global brands with
high-volumes of customer interactions better meet consumer needs and
improve customer relationships.

   Chordiant and IBM have expanded their alliance for an additional
five years with particular focus on global healthcare, communications,
and insurance markets. To date, Chordiant and IBM have completed
significant implementations with leading global brands across North
America and Europe including:

   --  DAK - German health insurance provider DAK recently launched
        its ProDAK initiative to realign the organization around a
        stronger customer focus. ProDAK has optimized customer service
        and saved costs while improving the customer experience for
        its members.

   --  ING Bank Slaski (Poland) - The global financial institution

        customer needs in real-time. IBM Global Business Services
        helped deploy the solution.

ISV alliances, IBM. "IBM's strength in hardware, software, and
services combines perfectly with Chordiant's expertise in
decision-based front-office solutions for our chosen verticals."

advanced decision management solutions and multi-channel SOA platform,
IBM WebSphere, DB2, Rational, and Lotus software, IBM hardware
including System x(TM) and Power(TM) Systems servers, and systems
integration expertise from IBM Global Business Services. These
software offerings provide clients with:

   --  A single, comprehensive view of their customer interactions
        across any number of call center agents or channels;

   --  Enterprise-scale case management that provides a consistent
        customer response and tracking across all channels in an
        organization;

   --  Improved control over customer retention;

   --  An improved ability to maximize sales opportunities with
        seamless cross-selling;

   --  Reduced customer interface costs through real-time predictive
        and adaptive decisioning, providing consistent customer
        treatments in line with profitable, pre-defined business
        strategies.

   Under the agreement, Chordiant will also tap the worldwide network
of nearly 40 IBM Innovation Centers in new and emerging markets such
as Asia and Eastern Europe to work side by side with IBM sales,
marketing, technical experts and engineers to fine-tune skills and
solutions.

   "Our partnership with IBM gives us the global reach and deployment
resources we need to complete large-scale projects, such as ING
Poland, successfully," said Steven R. Springsteel, chairman, president
and CEO of Chordiant Software. "It's a partnership that complements
our strengths perfectly. As global brands continue to seek out ways to
upgrade the management of their complex, multi-channel customer
interactions, we look forward to continuing to partner with IBM to
solve these real-world problems together."

&lt;p&gt;VISANOW Poses Key Questions For Presidential Candidates On Broken U.S. Immigration System

   With outdated immigration system no longer reflecting U.S. needs,
               candidates must address crucial questions
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Consistently throughout U.S. history, immigration has been a
divisive topic. Cultural biases, misconceptions, racism and fear
continue to influence both opponents and proponents of various
immigration policies. The solution requires productive dialogue to
identify and address multiple economic, social and political
interests. As the presidential election and debates approach, now is
the perfect time to consider what questions about the immigration
system should be asked of the candidates.

   "U.S. presidential candidates must address the most important
issue - that the outdated immigration system no longer reflects the
changing needs of the United States," says Bob Meltzer, CEO of
industry-leading immigration solutions provider VISANOW. "This
situation should prompt many crucial questions for the candidates, as
their proposed solutions will have a direct impact on the day-to-day
U.S. businesses, families and the economy for years to come."

   Meltzer also provides specific insight on the tough questions
surrounding immigration that must be asked of the candidates:

   --  What will you do about the outdated immigration system that no
        longer reflects national needs?

   --  Will you seek to increase the H-1B cap so that employers can
        hire tech workers who are in low supply and high demand in the
        U.S.?

   --  How will today's existing legal system handle the potential
        influx of immigration applications for the processing of the
        roughly 12 million foreign nationals working illegally in the
        U.S.?

   --  What can employers expect in regards to post-legislation
        enforcement to avoid a possible workforce disruption or
        penalties for non-compliance?

   "The current system is based on premises that made sense in the
1950s and even the 1970s but no longer apply in today's highly
competitive global economy," Meltzer adds.

   As an example, according to the National Foundation for American
Policy, "The reality of the global economy is that employers and their
capital will follow the talent - wherever that talent is permitted to
work and flourish." The report notes that as a result, restricting the
hiring of highly-skilled foreign nationals actually limits job
creation and innovation in the U.S.

   Moreover, American companies increasingly find they must go beyond
U.S. borders to recruit the talent they need. In a recent survey by
the Society for Human Resource Management and the Canadian Council of
Human Resources Associations, human resource professionals in the U.S.
reported that shortages of citizens and legal alien-worker candidates
with highly scientific and/or technical skills posed their most
significant challenge. The largest percentage of respondents from the
U.S. - 25% - identified the inability to successfully recruit citizen
and legal-resident alien workers with the necessary skills as their
primary reason for recruiting and or/hiring foreign national workers.

   Comments Meltzer: "The U.S. immigration system is so outmoded that
it is virtually beyond repair, requiring not just mere updating, but
complete rebuilding. To deal with this situation, such difficult
questions must be addressed. This is especially true of the
immigration system's inability to meet the needs of U.S. businesses."

   No matter what solutions are ultimately devised, the price of
doing nothing is becoming too costly in economic, social, and
humanitarian terms. Focused dialogue with the presidential candidates
on the most important and overlooked issue - the fact that the U.S.
immigration system is outdated and often irrelevant - is the most
effective and direct route to productive results.

&lt;p&gt;CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australia is re-thinking a decision to give gangsta rapper Snoop Dogg a visa after public complaints that he should not tour in October in a double act with Ice Cube, an immigration official said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snoop Dogg, whose real name is Cordozar Calvin Broadus Jr., was refused permission to even apply for a visa to enter Australia in 2007 because of his criminal record, sinking plans for him to co-host the MTV Australia Video Music Awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But immigration officials this week cleared the way for an October tour visit, until a spate of public complaints from Australian victims of crime groups on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a result of public concern and interest, the department has decided that in fact we will be undertaking a more thorough assessment of Mr Broadus' character," a senior immigration official told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision does not mean Snoop Dogg will again be barred from Australia, but he could be counseled before arrival and given strict behavior rules to abide by while in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snoop Dogg was first barred by Australia's former conservative government, which lost power last year to the centre-left Labor government of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. Labor has steadily softened tough immigration laws while in power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics say Snoop Dogg's lyrics are racist and sexist. The rapper has sold over 17 million records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His criminal record counts several drugs and firearms charges since 1990, including a 1993 acquittal for murder. He has also been denied entry to Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After learning of a change of heart by officials on barring the controversial rapper, Australian victims of crime groups complained to the government to have the decision overturned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Snoop Dogg trades in toxic messages of menace, violence, misogyny and lawlessness," Angela Conway, of the Australian Family Association, told the Herald Sun newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immigration official said a fresh assessment of an approval for Snoop Dogg to apply for a visa -- clearing the way for a 17-day visit from October 21 -- had already begun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've advised his tour promoter and he and Mr Broadus will have an opportunity to respond. We clearly will look at his criminal history," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Paul Tait)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall Builder 3.4 Release Further Extends Product's Centralized
Confidentiality Management Capabilities, Enabling Law Firms to Manage
Access Controls for SharePoint Client and Matter Sites
PALO ALTO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
IntApp, Inc., the leading provider of risk management, time
capture and integration software for the legal industry, today
announced that it has extended Wall Builder, its information access
control product, to secure and manage user access to SharePoint client
and matter sites.

   Wall Builder is a web-based confidentiality management application
that enables organizations to centrally control, monitor and report on
user access permissions across multiple applications including
document management, accounting, CRM and records management systems.

   Law firms must closely manage and track internal access to client
information for many reasons. These include waiver-driven ethical
screens, client outside counsel guidelines, and compliance with
regulations such as SEC, SOX, HIPAA, ITAR and European Union Market
Abuse and Privacy Directives.

   Wall Builder from IntApp replaces distributed, ad hoc approaches
to information security with a centralized solution that provides
organizations with unprecedented capability and control over user
access to specific applications, documents and other information. It's
the only product for law firms that delivers real-time enforcement
while updating access rights in response to attorney behavior to
ensure that policies are kept up to date automatically.

   By using Wall Builder in conjunction with Microsoft Office
SharePoint Server 2007, law firms will be able to deliver timely,
accurate and relevant information to attorneys and staff, while
minimizing the risk of individuals inadvertently accessing restricted
materials or falling out of compliance with internal policies.

   "As SharePoint becomes increasingly strategic to law firms, so too
does the need to ensure that the right people have access to the right
information," said John Guyer, IT Director, Hinckley, Allen &amp; Snyder
LLP. "Adding SharePoint security management capabilities to Wall
Builder is a welcome enhancement to an excellent product. Not only
does this reduce our firm's risk profile, but it also provides a huge
competitive advantage for us, as it allows our firm to quickly and
efficiently deploy secure extranet sites for client collaboration."

   "Law firms are increasingly using Microsoft SharePoint as a way to
increase attorney productivity by providing them with a centralized
view of client information," said Thad Jampol, CTO, IntApp. "By
extending Wall Builder confidentiality controls to SharePoint, we're
helping law firms ensure that attorneys and staff can't accidentally
access client or internal firm information they shouldn't."

   About IntApp

   IntApp provides software solutions that enable law firms to
increase attorney billability, ensure client confidentiality and
maximize staff productivity. With over 100 customers, including 35% of
the 200 largest US firms as ranked by The American Lawyer, and a
vibrant partner community, IntApp has been embraced and endorsed as an
industry standard. For more information, visit: www.intapp.com.

services and pragmatic business advice to clients throughout the

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI Aug 26 (Reuters) - China's economic growth could
slip below 9 percent, after years of double-digit rises, if the
government does not make drastic policy changes, JPMorgan Chase's
chief China economist Frank Gong said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He added that his note to clients last week on a possible
economic stimulus package of at least 200 billion to 400 billion
yuan ($29-58 billion), which spurred a nearly 8 percent rise in
the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC last Wednesday,
was based on his own research rather than official sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the 200 billion to 400 billion yuan estimate, equivalent
to 1.0 to 1.5 percent of GDP, was "very conservative", he said,
noting the impact of slowing exports and a sluggish housing
market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If the government sits there doing nothing, the economy will
slow down significantly," he told a lunch meeting with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During the Asian financial crisis at the end of the last
decade, he noted, the Chinese government increased its fiscal
deficit to 3 percent of GDP from 1 percent, helping to avert a
slowdown and laying the groundwork for future growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The need for stimulus spending also matches the country's
urgent requirement to build up infrastructure such as rail
transport to ease bottlenecks, he said, while taxes could easily
be cut by 100 billion yuan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With appropriate fiscal stimulus, the economy could maintain
10 percent growth, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also expected the central bank to cut the bank reserve
ratio by 50 basis points in the second half of the year, as a
slowing influx of speculative funds into China and decelerating
exports will ease the problem of excess liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government should form a $100 billion stock stabilisation
fund from its hefty foreign exchange reserves, he said, to help
the market cope with large volumes of shares that are becoming
tradeable after the expiry of lock-up periods under reforms of
state shareholdings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If you have this fund, it can bring confidence back," he
said, adding that the fundamentals of domestically listed A
shares remained strong and valuations were low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also expected the yuan to continue appreciating against
the dollar, but at a much slower pace.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) said the
market value of its investments in Fannie Mae FNM.N and
Freddie Mac FRE.N preferred stock has dropped by half to $600
million this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In a filing with regulators on Monday, the bank said the
decline could affect its earnings. The precise amount of losses
for the third quarter is difficult to determine, given the
oscillations in the preferred shares' values, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors have grown concerned over the fate of holders of
Fannie and Freddie preferred stock because a possible bailout
of the government-sponsored enterprises (GSE) could partly or
wholly wipe out the value of these investments if bondholders
are put first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have already seen their share
values plummet amid the credit market crisis, which has
triggered questions about whether they have enough capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fannie shares have dropped nearly 90 percent this year, but
closed up 3.8 percent at $5.19 on Monday. Freddie shares have
fallen more than 90 percent this year but gained 17.1 percent
to end at $3.29 a share, also on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other financial institutions, particularly smaller regional
banks, could also be hit by losses on their holdings of GSE
preferred stock, according to a report issued by Keefe,
Bruyette and Woods on Monday, pinpointing Sovereign Bancorp
SOV.N and Westamerica Bancorp (WABC.O), among others, as
having "significant exposure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KBW analyst Samuel Caldwell, in the report, said Gateway
Financial Holdings Inc GBTS.O, Farmers Capital Bank (FFKT.O)
and Midwest Banc Holdings Inc MBHI.O were also seen as having
significant exposure to potential losses from holdings of
Fannie and Freddie preferred stock, relative to tangible
equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While JPMorgan's write-downs have been modest compared with
other banks', the company said earlier this month it had lost
$1.5 billion in July and the first third of August, after wider
credit spreads and deteriorating liquidity hit the value of its
mortgage-backed securities and loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Elinor Comlay and Dinesh Nair in Bangalore;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Aug 26 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' senior China

&lt;p&gt;HARTFORD, Conn.--(Business Wire)--
Phoenix Investment Partners, a diversified asset management firm
with $33.4 billion under management, and a subsidiary of The Phoenix
Companies, Inc. (NYSE: PNX), today announced that Francis G. Waltman
has re-joined the company as senior vice president, product management
and development. He reports to George R. Aylward, president of Phoenix
Investment Partners, which will soon be renamed Virtus Investment
Partners.

   Waltman previously worked at Phoenix and was instrumental in
improving the company's PhoenixFunds mutual fund platform and
enhancing the company's multi-manager, multi-style approach to
investment management.

   "Frank's knowledge of the investment industry and his leadership
of our product initiatives will be invaluable as we enter a new and
very important phase of the company's development," Aylward said. "We
are particularly looking for opportunities to leverage the
capabilities of our affiliated investment managers and sub-advisers to
further develop new products that meet the evolving needs of our
distribution partners and our clients."

   Phoenix has announced its intention to spin off Phoenix Investment
Partners to Phoenix's shareholders later this year. The company will
operate as Virtus Investment Partners following the spin-off.

   Waltman was honored for his leadership with Phoenix in product
development as co-recipient of the 2007 "Fund Marketer of the Year"
award from Fund Action. The award was given for Phoenix's ability to
grow its mutual fund business by hiring sub-advisers, adopting small
institutional funds and revamping existing funds, in addition to
increasing distribution relationships.

   "Frank has been actively involved in the development of products
and the partnerships we have today with our affiliated managers and
sub-advisers. He is rejoining us at the right time to help us extend
these relationships and build new partnerships," Aylward said.

   Waltman rejoins Phoenix from Prudential Retirement, where he was
head of the organization's investment products team. He had previously
been with Phoenix for 15 years, most recently as senior vice
president, product development and management. Prior to joining
Phoenix, he held positions at Shearson Lehman Brothers and National
Securities &amp; Research Corporation.

   Waltman holds a bachelor's degree in finance from Hofstra
University and an M.B.A. in finance from Fordham University.

   Phoenix Investment Partners provides investment management
products and services to individuals and institutions. It operates a
multi-manager asset management business, comprising a number of
individual affiliated managers, each with a distinct investment style,
autonomous investment process and individual brand. Investors have an
array of needs and Phoenix Investment Partners offers a variety of
investment styles and multiple disciplines to meet those needs. It had
$33.4 billion in assets under management as of June 30, 2008.

   With roots dating to 1851, The Phoenix Companies, Inc. (NYSE:PNX)
helps individuals and institutions solve their often highly complex
personal financial and business planning needs through its broad array
of life insurance, annuities and investments. The company's products

&lt;p&gt;SANTIAGO, Chile--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has upgraded the international foreign and local
currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of Coca-Cola Embonor S.A.
(Embonor) to 'BBB' from 'BBB-' and simultaneously withdraws them.

   The upgrades reflect the continuous improvement of Embonor's main
credit metrics during the last five years, as well as its strong
Business position in Chile and Bolivia. Additional factors supporting
the ratings include Coca-Cola's 45.5% ownership stake in the company.
Fitch believes Coca-Cola (KO, long-term IDR rated 'A+') would
financially support the company, if needed, to preserve its reputation
for supporting bottlers in which it has a significant economic stake.

   Embonor's net debt to EBITDA ratio has improved to 1.7x in June
2008 from 4.8x in December 2003. The improvement is a result of
increasing EBITDA levels due to higher sales volume, cost reductions
and debt repayments. For the 12 months ended June 30, 2008, Embonor
generated Ch$52.403 million of EBITDA, an increase from Ch$48.917
million in 2006 and Ch$42.342 million in 2005. The company's funds
from operations (FFO) has also grown significantly during this time
period. For the 12 months ended June 30, 2008, Embonor generated
Ch$42.154 million of FFO. This figure compares with Ch$38.418 million
in 2006 and Ch$27.076 million in 2005.

   During the six months ended June 30, 2008, Chilean volumes grew by
5% and Bolivian volumes grew by 17%, resulting in 9% growth in the
company's sales volumes compared to the same period in 2007. As of
June 30, 2008, Embonor had Ch$23.421 million of cash and marketable
securities and Ch$110.789 million of total financial debt. The
company's net financial debt has improved to Ch$87.368 million as of
June 30, 2008 from Ch$89.568 million as of December 31, 2007.
Liquidity is not a concern as the company has sufficient cash to cover
Ch$11.865 million of short-term debt.

   Embonor margins have decreased slightly due to cost increases
driven by higher concentrate costs and energy costs. Rating concerns
also include political and social risks in Bolivia. Embonor has been a
Coca-Cola bottler in Chile since 1962. During 1995 and 1996, the
company acquired Coca-Cola bottling operations in Bolivia. Embonor
accounts for about 36% of the sales of Coca-Cola products in Chile and
almost 100% of the sales of Coca-Cola products in Bolivia.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo's office is probing the relationship between Fidelity Investments and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) in connection with the broker's sales of auction-rate securities, people familiar with the investigation said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State investigators previously disclosed their interest in looking into how Fidelity and other brokerages sold auction rate debt -- investments long marketed as cash alternatives that have been nearly impossible to sell for most of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, Cuomo's staff began taking a close look at whether Fidelity marketed Goldman-underwritten ARS because it received other services from the world's largest investment bank and therefore had an incentive to sell auction-rates to clients, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state began focusing on the relationship after finding that most of the ARS sold by Fidelity were underwritten by Goldman, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman was the No. 5 underwriter of auction-rate municipal bonds since 2000, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and Cuomo's office declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fidelity spokeswoman Anne Crowley said Fidelity received no special financial incentive to sell auction rate securities. Roughly 600 Fidelity customers who bought ARS before February 2008, when the markets collapsed, still hold them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bulk of Fidelity's discount brokerage clients are self- directed, although it has a small wealth management business for richer households.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closely held Fidelity has said it does not issue or market auction-rates. Like other "downstream" brokerages, it argues the banks that issued these securities should repurchase them from investors no matter where they have their accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOT CONVINCED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cuomo's office last week expressed skepticism that downstream brokers were unaware of the weakness of auction rate markets and the possibility they could collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our investigation will closely examine whether Fidelity or any other downstream brokerages consciously avoided knowledge of the ARS market deterioration," Benjamin Lawsky, special assistant to Cuomo, wrote in a letter to regional bond dealers last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also noted "some evidence indicates that Fidelity was actively marketing auction rate securities to its high net worth clients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York, together with the Securities and Exchange Commission and Massachusetts and other state securities regulators have announced settlements in recent weeks with eight of the largest banks and brokerages. The firms will buy back about $50 billion of these illiquid securities from their own retail clients and pay more than $500 million in fines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State and U.S. regulators currently are focused on smaller brokerages, including Fidelity, as they work down the list of some 30 to 40 firms that participated in these markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auction rates are long-dated municipal, student-loan or mutual fund debt that paid interest rates that reset periodically in auctions. These auctions also provided investors with the opportunity to cash out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the auctions, which struggled last year amid the credit crunch, failed by January as banks stopped taking up the remaining supply. More than a hundred thousand investors were stuck holding the debt and they complained their brokers misled them about how risky these securities were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss in Boston and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty in Bangalore; Editing by Erica Billingham)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp released on Wednesday a second test version of Internet Explorer 8, delivering a feature-complete upgrade to the world's most widely used Web browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker said the latest version -- beta 2 -- of Internet Explorer, which has a market share of about 75 percent, comes with new features to enhance privacy, ease-of-use, and security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft first released a test -- or beta 1 -- version of IE 8 in March, but that was aimed at letting Web developers take a first look at the new browser. This latest version is aimed at a broader consumer audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company would not disclose when it planned to officially launch IE 8 nor how many people are expected to download the test version of the new browser. It released Internet Explorer 7 in October 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has pledged to deliver more regular updates of Internet Explorer, whose lead has been chipped away by Mozilla's Firefox browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest version of Internet Explorer replicates features found in Firefox 3, the latest version of that Web browser, including a "smart" address bar that remembers and redirects user to website addresses they have visited before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer 8 also offers a mode called "InPrivate Browsing," which ensures that history, temporary Internet files and cookies are not recorded on a user's PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a security feature that allows a user to block content coming from third-parties trying to track and aggregate the user's online behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also updated already announced features such as "Activities," which allows a user to use information found on one page, such as an address, in conjunction with an online service such as mapping without leaving the original site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest test release of Internet Explorer 8 is available for download at www.microsoft.com/ie8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

the Olympics. While we do not yet have an exact count of U.S. travelers
who attended the Olympics, over 25,000 elected to obtain their visa
through CIBT. One travel agency client commented that CIBT deserves a
'Gold Medal' for procuring so many visas in a relatively short time and
with very few delays or problems."

    CIBT President Jeff Fine noted that his company expedited travel documents
for most of the 2008 Olympic sponsors, including GE/NBC, Johnson &amp; Johnson
and Coca Cola. "It was a real challenge to move large groups of people as
Chinese visa requirements became more and more restrictive leading up to
the opening ceremonies. We are extremely appreciative of the close
cooperation that occurred between our clients, the Chinese Government and
our regional offices," said Mr. Fine.

    CIBT created customized plans, including visa application kits, for
companies sending 50 or more people to China for the games. The company
assisted athletes and coaches, corporate travelers, tour operators, VIPs,
and some very large incentive groups, accommodating the unique needs of
each CIBT client.

    "It was a unique experience for CIBT's visa professionals," added Mr.
Diehl. "China's visa policy underwent significant changes and became more
restrictive leading up to the Olympics. CIBT personnel worked closely with
the Chinese Embassy and its Consulates across the United States to ensure
the smoothest possible process for all involved."

    Until recently, a Chinese visa was valid for one year and permitted
multiple entries. Before the Olympics, only a single entry visa was
issued. Now, travelers may need official invitations, flight and hotel
confirmation, and in some cases bank statements and other documents to
apply for a visa. Complete details are available at CIBT's website
(www.cibt.com).

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Chemical Completes Manufacturing Facility to Produce New Specialty Compounds for Energy Efficient Tires

HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Chemical today announced the start-up of a
manufacturing facility at its existing site in Pensacola, Fla., that
provides new capacity for the production of a revolutionary new tire
material technology that can improve vehicle fuel efficiency.

   "Tire inner liners made with the new material, Exxcore(TM)
dynamically vulcanized alloy (DVA), achieve leading-edge air retention
with less material. This reduces air loss between fillings and helps
conserve energy and resources for future generations," said Art
Sullivan, vice president, ExxonMobil Chemical Butyl Polymers Business.

   Specifically, Exxcore(TM) DVA enables better fuel economy from
significantly improved tire inflation pressure retention (IPR). IPR is
a measure of tire air pressure loss over time. Improved air retention
means reduced rolling resistance, resulting in improved fuel economy.

   If all vehicle tires on the road in the U.S. had an IPR of 1.5
percent, it would represent a significant potential annual fuel
savings of over 700 million gallons and a reduction in greenhouse
gases of over 6 million tons per year, equivalent to taking over a
million cars off the road. Exxcore(TM) DVA can help achieve these
savings.

   Exxcore(TM) DVA combines the flexibility and elasticity of rubber
with the low air permeability of plastic, achieving 7 to 10 times
better permeability than existing halobutyl inner liner materials.

   In addition, tire durability testing shows an improvement greater
than 50 percent over standard halobutyl inner liners. This allows for
an improved speed rating and potentially extends the tire's life.

   The new material's performance benefits have already been
recognized by key tire manufacturers. ExxonMobil Chemical's
development partner, The Yokohama Rubber Co., Ltd., plans to begin
manufacturing tires with Exxcore(TM) DVA inner liners later this year.
In addition, Cheng Shin Rubber Company, the manufacturer of the
popular "MAXXIS" brand, plans to debut a higher-performance, lower-IPR
tire with the new inner liner material in 2009.

   Exxcore(TM) DVA represents ExxonMobil Chemical's latest
advancement in tire inner liner material science. The additional
capacity will help meet growing worldwide demand for fuel efficient
tire inner liners.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Financial distress has slashed the value of many natural resource stocks, but a lot of the underlying assets remain solid and the outlook for commodities is positive, a fund manager said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ian Henderson, who manages around $5 billion at JPMorgan's (JPM.N) Global Natural Resources Fund, said he favours long-term commodity investments but investors have to be selective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I strongly believe this is a multi-year cycle ... but you have to be a lot more selective and distinguish between commodities," Henderson told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the credit crunch in July last year, equities have been battered with mining stocks .SXPP losing more than 15 percent of value, making it difficult for miners to raise cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, some commodities such as nickel, zinc and platinum have halved in value since their peaks with speculation exacerbating price volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some people have been hit very badly financially ... so there has been forced liquidation," Henderson said, adding that this could continue to have an "adverse impact on London Metal Exchange traded metals".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund, with half of its investments in smaller firms with a market capitalization of below $2 billion, has lost nearly 30 percent in value since its peak in February this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"BOMBED-OUT"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If people were to go and buy a basket of these completely bombed-out companies, although they might not have picked the bottom, the upside potential is tremendous," Henderson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But value depends on the underlying commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even if prices stabilize at current levels earnings are going to be negligible for people producing zinc and there will be huge downgrades for nickel producers too," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, low stock levels would persistently support copper producers with the metal MCU3 up 13 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The energy market is still very tight, including coal, and uranium will become tight as time goes by," Henderson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iron ore, oil and gas, platinum and gold would also see prices rising on strong demand from emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are long-term believers in China's infrastructure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February this year, European investors turned particularly risk averse liquidating their holdings, but this had not changed the structure of the portfolio, Henderson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We haven't really seen huge outflows and in fact, over the past week our flows have been pretty positive," he said, referring to some investors starting to take on risk again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People will always try to pick the bottom of the market ... but it (the selling) will probably go on for a bit longer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund held 25.2 percent in base metals and diversified mining companies, 29 percent was allocated to precious metals firms and energy attracted 33.5 percent at the end of July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think it is a turnaround in sentiment ... but if you look at the extent of the falls ... they far outweigh any fundamental analysis or rational behavior," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anna Stablum; editing by Christopher Johnson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil agreed to pay out 75 percent of a $507.5 million damages ruling to settle the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska, the Anchorage Daily News reported on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citing both Exxon and the plaintiff's lawyer, the Anchorage Daily News said the oil giant will release about $383 million for distribution to the nearly 33,000 commercial fishermen and others who sued Exxon after the worst tanker crash in U.S. history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobile took a $290 million charge in the second quarter to account for a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June that threw out an earlier $2.5 billion damages award against the company and lowered the award to $507.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal will allow fishermen and other plaintiffs to be paid a chunk of the damages as soon as October with a final payout schedule expected to be hammered out this week, the newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Exxon Valdez spilled some 34,000 tons of crude oil in the costliest accident of its kind. The clean up alone cost around $2.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two sides still disagree about whether Exxon owes interest on the $507 million award, which would bring the final figure to $1 billion, according to plaintiff's lawyers. There is also debate over another $70 million, according to the Anchorage Daily News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Oesting of Anchorage, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs, and Exxon were not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the subject, the justices sent the case back to the lower court to handle the final settlement of the $507.5 million award, which the Court said was the maximum damages available to the plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Aug 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM), the official technology partner of the US Open, and the
United States Tennis Association have teamed to offer exciting ways to
help more fans than ever experience the action of the 2008 US Open. With
a new array of personalized features including customized content and
mobile alerts, the USOpen.org site will help fans get closer to the
action of the US Open in ways not before possible. In addition, this year
IBM is helping the USTA run a more environmentally-friendly US Open by
helping reduce the energy consumption required to power the tournament's
web site and scoring operations. The IT solution continues to allow the
USTA to concentrate on its goals of building value for the US Open brand
around the world, meeting revenue objectives and promoting tennis in the
United States.

    Delivering Robust Infrastructure That Conserves Energy

    IBM provides the USTA with a robust infrastructure to handle the
unpredictable nature of running a sporting event. Even as visits to the
USOpen.org site have grown steadily over the past two years, power
consumption continues to decrease due to new innovative technologies from
IBM. New solutions for the 2008 US Open that IBM is putting into place
include implementing the newest p6 550 servers with new POWER6 technology.
IBM is taking further advantage of Virtualization and Systems Management
Technologies to ensure an Optimized Infrastructure with integrated
solutions for both monitoring and managing the infrastructure as well as a
fully virtualized environment. New solutions for the 2008 US Open that IBM
is putting into place include implementing Power 550 servers running Linux
with new POWER6, the world's fastest microprocessor technology. IBM is
taking further advantage of Virtualization and Systems Management
Technologies to ensure an Optimized Infrastructure with integrated
solutions for both monitoring and managing the infrastructure as well as a
fully virtualized environment. These include a variety of IBM Tivoli
systems management and security products, applications support from
Rational, database management from DB2, and Web management from Lotus and
WebSphere.

    The results of these solutions are significant:

    Consolidating from nine servers to six servers (since 2006 consolidation
has gone from 60 servers to 6 servers) Since 2006, reduction of energy
consumption by 23% and cooling demand reduced by 25% With the p6
implementation it is expected that energy consumption will be reduced by
40% and cooling demand reduced by 48% Since 2006, visits to events
infrastructure have grown by 26% while the cost per visit has been
reduced by 38% during the same period Users have increased by over 20%
while the cost/user has been reduced by over 27% during the same period

    "The USTA requires a solution that helps extend the global reach of the
tournament, but is also energy and cost-efficient," said Rick Singer,
Director Worldwide Sponsorship Marketing, IBM. "This is an example of how
IBM takes a more holistic approach to helping our clients solve the
problems that matter most to them. USOpen.org must be scalable, highly
available, highly secure as well as interactive, entertaining and
user-friendly to ensure that fans have the best fan experience, no matter
where they're sitting. That's what IBM delivers."

    Bringing Live Scores, Serve Speed and Statistics to Tournament Officials,
Journalists and Fans; More Personalization

    IBM's real-time scoring system collects courtside data from each umpire's
chair and then stores and distributes the statistics to broadcast TV,
USOpen.org, the intranet used by more than 1,500 international journalists
at the event, closed circuit TV, electronic displays, and automated voice
applications for players. On the broadcast courts, IBM statisticians enter
winners, unforced errors, and net approaches.

    The scoring system ensures spectators both at the stadium and online, can
view details on the current schedule, matches in progress, and results for
every match by court. IBM WebSphere software, leveraging a flexible
Service Oriented Architecture, streamlines the timely and accurate
distribution of more than 200 million score updates to fans around the
world.

    In 2008, IBM and the USTA are expanding their initiative to create an even
more engaging, more immersive and more personalized user experience,
including the following online features:

    My USOpen -- Personalized section of the home page to track your favorite
players; users can track up to five (5) of their favorite players and
customize their experience by following the players' statistics, related
news and interviews, match results and scores. Users can also customize
three homepage sections from a list of 11 content options with their
preferred choice. SlamTracker application -- Interactive Draw feature that
allows your to track you favorite player through the Draw as well as
switch to follow a specific match in real-time, with exclusive
point-by-point scoring. There is also an Interactive Venue Map -- with a
simple roll of the mouse over locations on the map, fans can see who is
playing on a given court and the online scoreboard changes to reflect the
chosen match. USOpen FANBOOK -- fans from around the world can share their
thoughts, comments and perspective on the tournament in real-time. Widget
-- Scoring, Schedule, News and other tournament content. Widget is
shareable via Facebook, iGoogle and downloadable via Yahoo! Widgets.
Mobile.usopen.org -- US Open "on the go" at http://usopen.org/Mobile --
action all in one; receive real-time scores, stats, schedule for the day,
news, photos and more. Text Alerts -- fans can stay close to the action
with text alerts for breaking news, match updates and more. There are
more than 47 different alerts a user can select from including TV tune-in
updates, breaking news and match updated (by player).

    "Our 17-year partnership with IBM has allowed the USTA to continually
deliver a unique and cutting-edge experience to all tennis fans," said
Phil Green, Director, Advanced Media, USTA. "This year we're taking steps
to make this Open not only more fan-friendly, but
environmentally-friendly as well. Reducing energy consumption while being
able to increase services, is an important statement for our growing fan
base. USOpen.org has evolved into the premiere destination for innovative
and interactive web experiences, including significant multi-media
content, personalized features and real-time solutions."

    IBM to provide Match Analysis DVD to Players

    IBM will provide men's and women's players on Arthur Ashe, Louis
Armstrong, Grandstand, courts 10 &amp; 13 (the five broadcast courts) with a
DVD following their match. The DVD enables these players and their

&lt;p&gt;Keynote Streaming Perspective Selected by Microsoft and CCTV to Monitor Performance of 2008 Beijing Olympics Streaming Video


   --  Keynote's Global Test and Measurement Network Monitored the
        Performance of More Than Two Thousand Hours of Olympics
        Coverage on MSNOlympics.com on MSN

   --  CCTV Selects Keynote Streaming Perspective to Monitor Olympics
        Video Quality in China
SAN MATEO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Keynote(R) Systems (Nasdaq:KEYN), the global leader in on-demand
mobile and Internet test &amp; measurement solutions for continuously
improving the online experience, today announced both Microsoft and
CCTV selected Keynote Streaming Perspective(R) for robust performance
monitoring of streaming video of the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.

   Keynote was selected by Microsoft to monitor the performance of
2,200 hours of streaming video of the Olympic Games on NBCOlympics.com
on MSN in the U.S. as a result of Keynote's ability to expand the
Streaming Perspective product to include Microsoft Silverlight 2.
Additionally, CCTV, the company that originates much of the Olympics
coverage from China, also selected Keynote Streaming Perspective to
ensure the protection of the copyrighted online streaming video of the
Olympic Games.

   The Beijing Olympics generated more streaming video, both live and
on-demand, than any other event in history with a wider variety of
sports delivered to more audiences than in any previous Olympics.

   Silverlight, Microsoft's cross-browser, multiplatform plug-in for
delivering the next generation of media experiences and rich
interactive applications via the Web, enabled Olympics fans to not
only watch and pause thousands of hours of live Olympics coverage
online, but also offered rewinding and replaying capabilities for
viewers to re-live historic Olympics moments or catch the technicality
they may have missed.

   "We are pleased to have worked with Keynote to test and monitor
the performance of the Olympics video coverage streamed via
Silverlight 2 on NBCOlympics.com on MSN," said Brian Goldfarb, Group
Product Manager, Developer Platforms team, Microsoft Corp. "Keynote's
deep understanding of our technology requirements and our companies'
commitment to customers helps ensure we are delivering an exceptional
experience to our online viewers."

   Keynote Streaming Perspective measures the quality and reliability
of streaming media the way end users experience it. With operational
monitoring, performance trending and competitive benchmarking,
Streaming Perspective gives users the reliable performance data needed
to deliver an excellent user experience every time. From connect time
to rebuffer events, Streaming Perspective provides the true picture of
the audio and video stream delivery. It gives users the insight needed
for infrastructure planning and provides the most effective early
warning system to help resolve performance and availability issues in
real time.

   "We're pleased to have worked with both Microsoft and CCTV on such
a historic event," said Umang Gupta, CEO of Keynote Systems. "This
year marks the most ambitious effort to enhance and expand the
experience of the Olympics by bringing thousands of hours of live
streaming video online. Both Microsoft and CCTV demonstrated their
commitment to the end-user experience by working with Keynote's global
test and measurement network to ensure viewers are able to enjoy their
favorite Olympics moments."

   "Streaming video for the Olympics was no easy task," said Jian
Bai, manager of IPR Technic at CCTV.com. "Keynote Streaming
Perspective allowed us to effectively manage the copyrighted Olympic
streams and ensure our online viewers were able to experience the
excitement of being the hosts of today's greatest athletes from around
the world."

&lt;p&gt;Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day Highlights: IBM Corporation, United Therapeutics, Greatbatch, Genuine Parts and School Specialty

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights IBM Corporation (NYSE: IBM) as
the Bull of the Day and United Therapeutics (Nasdaq: UTHR) as the Bear
of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on
Greatbatch, Inc. (NYSE: GB), Genuine Parts Co. (NYSE: GPC) and School
Specialty (Nasdaq: SCHS).

   Full analysis of all these stocks is available at
http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676.

   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:

   Bull of the Day: IBM Corporation (NYSE: IBM)

   With over half of its revenue (58%) coming from outside the United
States, IBM Corporation has been insulated from recent weakness in the
U.S. economy than many of its peers. Although this trend may be ending
as the U.S. economy picks up strength relative to Europe, IBM should
continue to benefit from its focus on faster-growing markets through a
series of acquisitions and divestiture of mature businesses.

   Moreover, its position in emerging markets should continue to help
drive growth. We maintain our Buy rating on IBM shares and a target
price of $140.00.

   Bear of the Day: United Therapeutics (Nasdaq: UTHR)

   United Therapeutics Corporation, a biotechnology company, engages
in the development and commercialization of therapeutic products for
patients with chronic and life-threatening diseases. It offers
products primarily in three therapeutic areas, including
cardiovascular, cancer, and infectious diseases.

   Although we believe current business fundamentals are solid, we
are seeing several potential hiccups coming in the next year. And,
with the stock up 65% over the past twelve months and currently
trading at 50x our 2008 EPS estimate, we believe investors are pricing
the stock for near flawless execution. Expectations are high, and any
slip-up, even minor, may cause a sell-off in the shares. As a result,
we are initiating with a Sell rating and an $82 price target.

   Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog:

   Greatbatch, Inc. (NYSE: GB)

   Greatbatch is a leading producer and supplier of batteries,
capacitors, and components used in implantable medical devices through
its Implantable Medical Components (IMC) business.

   The company reported second quarter top-line above expectations
primarily due to acquisitions and strong end-market growth. However,
EPS exceeded our expectations by a penny on lower R spending. The
management provides adjusted 2008 EPS guidance of $1.20-$1.50. Our
2008 EPS estimates increase on positive news surrounding new products
and promising innovations, and diversification beyond the CRM original
equipment manufacturers, now less than 50% of Q208 sales.

   Genuine Parts Co. (NYSE: GPC)

   Genuine Parts has undertaken various initiatives such as product
line expansion, penetration into new markets and acquisitions to boost
sales and earnings. Genuine Parts has been diversifying its revenue
base to reduce excessive dependence on the automotive replacement
market.

   The company's electronic and industrial parts businesses are
showing impressive performance and it has a strong balance sheet.
However, our optimism is dampened by the sluggish automotive and
office products industries in the U.S. Considering these factors, we
maintain our Hold recommendation with a target price of $43.

   School Specialty (Nasdaq: SCHS)

   In the first quarter, School Specialty, Inc.'s earnings per share
were $0.16 below the consensus estimate and $0.15 below our estimate.
In addition, the management updated its guidance for fiscal 2009. The
company continues to expect revenue of $1.08-$1.11 billion, but it
lowered its EPS guidance from $2.27-$2.43 to $2.23-$2.39 to account
for a $0.04/share cost to closing a distribution center in the second
quarter.

   We are slightly reducing our 2009 EPS from $2.30 to $2.28 but
leaving our fiscal 2010 EPS estimate at $2.45. School Specialty's
industry-leading market position and cost-cutting efforts are offset
by growing competitive pressures and limited organic growth prospects.
We maintain our Hold rating on the stock.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - The New York attorney general's office is probing the relationship between Fidelity Investments and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in connection with the sale of auction-rate securities, the Wall Street Journal said, citing a person familiar with the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investigators are looking at whether Fidelity's relationship with Goldman may have given the mutual fund giant an incentive to sell the instruments, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attorney general started focusing on the relationship after it learned that most of the auction-rate securities sold by Fidelity were underwritten by Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These securities offered interest rates that reset periodically in auctions, but when those auctions failed this year, investors were stuck holding longer-term debt of uncertain value. Dealers have been accused of understating the debt's risk to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Merrill Lynch  Co Inc, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs settled with U.S. securities regulators, agreeing to buy back billions of dollars of auction-rate securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attorney general's office is probing whether Fidelity may have marketed Goldman-underwritten ARS's because it was getting other services from the investment bank, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was not immediately available for comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was no incentive for Fidelity to promote auction-rate securities," the paper quoted Fidelity spokesperson Anne Crowley as saying. She said 600 Fidelity accounts held the auction-rate securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs agreed to buy back about $1.5 billion in auction-rate notes by November 12, and pay a $22.5 million fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's agreement does not cover customers who bought auction-rate securities from Fidelity. Massachusetts's top regulator, William Galvin, has called on Fidelity to buy back all the securities it sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fidelity, which is privately held, has long said it neither issues nor aggressively markets these securities and that it expects underwriters who issued the securities to stand behind them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty in Bangalore)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--  Apixaban Phase II Acute Coronary Syndrome Data to be Presented at
        European Society of Cardiology Meeting on Sept. 2

    --  U.S. Regulatory Filing for the Prevention of Venous Thromboembolism will
        not be submitted in 2009, as previously indicated

    --  Other Clinical Programs Continue as Planned
PRINCETON, N.J. &amp; NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) and Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) provided an
update on the apixaban clinical development program today. The companies
announced that new Phase II data in acute coronary syndrome patients (ACS) will
be presented at the upcoming meeting of the European Society of Cardiology
(ESC). In addition, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer reported that an early
evaluation of results from a Phase III study of apixaban for the prevention of
venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients undergoing total knee replacement
indicates that the primary endpoint of this study was not met.

The Phase III VTE prevention study known as ADVANCE-1 compared apixaban, a
novel, oral Factor Xa inhibitor given at a dose of 2.5 mg, twice daily, to the
FDA-approved dose of enoxaparin, 30 mg given twice daily. The primary efficacy
outcome was a composite of symptomatic or asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, and death by any cause. The rate of the primary efficacy
endpoint on apixaban was numerically similar to that observed with enoxaparin
(9.0% vs. 8.9%, p=.064), but did not meet the pre-specified statistical criteria
for non-inferiority compared to enoxaparin. The actual enoxaparin VTE rate of
8.9 percent was lower than the expected VTE rate of 16 percent seen in previous
similar clinical trials, resulting in an inability to demonstrate
non-inferiority.

In ADVANCE-1, there were no unexpected findings in adverse events for apixaban
compared to enoxaparin. The major bleeding event rate for apixaban was
numerically lower, but was not significantly lower, than enoxaparin (0.7% vs.
1.4%, p=.053). The composite rate of clinically relevant non-major bleeding and
major bleeding was significantly less in patients who received apixaban than
those who received enoxaparin (2.9% vs. 4.3%, p =.034).

Full results of the ADVANCE-1 trial have been submitted to the American Society
of Hematology Meeting (ASH) for presentation in December.

ADVANCE-1 results confirm the characteristics of apixaban as reported previously
in phase II studies. The companies are considering further studies with
different protocols in preventing VTE in knee surgery and will not submit the
U.S. filing for VTE prevention in the 2nd half of 2009, as previously
communicated. The results of ADVANCE -1 do not necessitate any changes in
protocols of any other ongoing apixaban studies. Programs directed towards
prevention of VTE including EMEA registrational studies, treatment of VTE, and
in the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation continue as planned.

"Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer remain enthusiastic and committed to the
clinical development program for apixaban," said Jack Lawrence, vice president,
Research and Development, Bristol-Myers Squibb. "Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer
anticipate that the results of APPRAISE-1 being presented at ESC will provide
important insight into the potential use of apixaban for the secondary
prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome,
which affects an estimated 2.7 million people around the world every year."

About the Apixaban Clinical Program

Apixaban, an oral, factor Xa inhibitor in a new class of agents that have shown
therapeutic potential to prevent and treat blood clots, is currently being
explored in the EXPANSE clinical trial program which includes eight Phase III
clinical studies involving approximately 45,000 patients worldwide. The
ADVANCE-2 and 3 trials are investigating the safety and efficacy of apixaban 2.5
mg twice daily compared to enoxaparin 40 mg once daily in patients undergoing
major orthopedic surgery. The ADOPT study is investigating apixaban for one
month compared to standard of care (enoxaparin 40 mg once daily for at least 6
days followed by placebo) for the prevention of VTE in hospitalized patients who
are medically ill and at risk of VTE.

Apixaban is also in Phase III trials studying the prevention of stroke and other
thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The AF program
consists of two trials. The ARISTOTLE trial is investigating apixaban compared
to warfarin in approximately 15,000 patients with atrial fibrillation. The
AVERROES trial is investigating apixaban compared to aspirin in approximately
5,600 patients with atrial fibrillation who are ineligible for vitamin K
antagonists (VKA) treatment or haven't tolerated previous VKA treatment.

The VTE treatment program consists of two trials. The AMPLIFY trial is a 6-month
trial investigating apixaban compared to enoxaparin plus warfarin in
approximately 4,800 patients with acute DVT or PE. The AMPLIFY-EXT trial is a
12-month trial investigating apixaban compared to placebo for extended treatment
to prevent recurrent VTE in approximately 2,400 patients who have completed 6 to
12 months of treatment for DVT or PE.

&lt;p&gt;  HURSLEY, ENGLAND and SAN JOSE, CA, Aug 28 (MARKET
WIRE) -- 
Engineers and researchers at the IBM (NYSE: IBM) Hursley development lab
in England and the Almaden Research Center in California have
demonstrated groundbreaking performance results that outperform the
world's fastest disk storage solution by over 250(1) percent. IBM has
demonstrated, for the first time, the game-changing impact solid-state
technologies can have on how businesses and individuals manage and access
information.

    The results were achieved using Flash solid-state technology coupled with
IBM's industry leading, highly scalable storage virtualization technology.
Under the codename "Project Quicksilver," IBM achieved groundbreaking
results in transferring data at a sustained rate of over one million
Input/Output (I/O) per second -- with a response time of under one
millisecond (ms). Compared to the fastest industry benchmarked disk
system(1) Quicksilver improved performance by 250 percent at less than
1/20th the response time, took up 1/5th the floor space and required only
55 percent of the power and cooling.

    Performance improvements of this magnitude can have profound implications
for business, allowing 2-3 times the work to complete in a given timeframe
for classic workloads, enabling tremendous efficiency for time sensitive
applications like reservations systems, and financial program trading
systems, and creating opportunity for entirely new insights in information
warehouses and analytic solutions.

    IBM is driving a comprehensive approach to leverage solid state storage,
which is an emerging enterprise technology that has no moving parts, thus
eliminating many of the access delays associated with electro-mechanical
disks. Technology leadership for IBM is rooted in 15 consecutive years of
U.S. patent leadership, unmatched by any competitor in the world today.
IBM continues to develop, integrate and optimize solid state storage into
the broad range of applications, middleware, operating systems and
hardware in their storage and server offerings, well beyond a simple
replacement of disk.

    As an example, IBM's first to-market implementation of solid-state drives
for select IBM BladeCenter servers has been available since June of 2007,
enabling customers to experience enhanced reliability. The ongoing
cross-IBM initiative promises significant energy savings and dramatic I/O
performance improvements. Additionally, by deploying automated management
capabilities, IBM is creating fully integrated information infrastructures
that can deliver significant customer benefit.

    "The ultimate benefits of solid state will require software, management
and systems capabilities -- with IBM being uniquely positioned, with its
deep research and development capabilities and broad product and services
experience, to unlock that potential," said Andy Monshaw, General Manager,
IBM System Storage. "IBM is integrating this technology with systems and
applications so that companies can achieve real business value from
solid-state disk. Quicksilver is a significant step forward in this
comprehensive systems strategy. This is not about replacing today's hard
disk drive with a new form factor, this is about having a complete,
end-to-end systems approach -- and that's not something EMC, HP or Sun can
match."

    Research Innovation with Solid-State Technology

    IBM has a decades-long proven track record in system innovation including
the memory chip, the hard disk drive and the relational database. As the
leader in solutions which blend tiers of storage, and 15 consecutive years
of U.S. patent leadership and innovation, IBM Research has developed
breakthrough data center provisioning technology that automatically
understands and balances the utilization of diverse storage components in
the information infrastructure, including solid-state storage.
Additionally, to get the most value from high performance system resources
in storage, IBM Research patented key technologies that help maintain
required quality-of-service for higher priority applications.

    Quicksilver is part of IBM's focus on leveraging new and emerging systems
technologies to deliver advanced data center capabilities and business
value to customers. IBM is committed to develop solid state storage to
create real-world uses across a broad range of applications, middleware,
and systems offerings.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, dateline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PHILADELPHIA Aug 28 (Reuters) - Funeral services company
Stewart Enterprises Inc STEI.O, which received an unsolicited
$1.0 billion takeover offer from larger rival Service Corp
International (SCI.N), said on Thursday it hired Goldman Sachs
 Co to help it weigh strategic alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stewart, the No. 2 provider of death-care services, last
month rejected Service Corp's initial takeover offer of $9.50
per share, but now must weigh a sweetened offer of $11 per
share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stewart's committee of independent board members will work
with Goldman to review alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The higher offer had been expected. Service Corp had said
in its initial offer letter that it could sweeten its bid to a
range of $10.25 to $11.25 a share if it was granted access to
information about Stewart's overhead and trust management
structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Service Corp said it raised its offer "to eliminate any
ambiguity" about its proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stewart said Chairman Frank Stewart, Jr., who controls 34
percent of the funeral company's voting power, had indicated he
is supportive of the process, but has not made any decision
about his plans or views on the takeover offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stewart's articles of incorporation and Louisiana state law
require that major transactions should have two-thirds of
shareholder approval to proceed, analysts have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Service Corp could not be immediately reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stewart shares closed at $9.28, up 14 cents, on Nasdaq.
Service Corp's stock gained 28 cents to close at $10.41 on the
New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Production Company today announced that it has
completed initial barging of equipment and supplies to the Point
Thomson drill site. This work supports the drilling program outlined
in the Point Thomson development plan submitted to the Department of
Natural Resources earlier this year. ExxonMobil is operator of the
Point Thomson unit.

   The barges and tugs, operated by Crowley Maritime Corporation,
transported ice road and drill site construction equipment and
supplies to the Point Thomson site located on Alaska's North Slope.
ExxonMobil has conducted field operations at Point Thomson for several
weeks following issuance of permits and is awaiting additional permits
from State regulatory agencies necessary to allow drilling activities
to continue.

   Craig Haymes, Alaska production manager for ExxonMobil, said,
"Point Thomson will be the highest pressure gas cycling project in the
world, employing world-class drill wells. Currently over 150 people
from more than 30 companies in Alaska are working to progress drilling
and development activities for the Point Thomson field. The future
availability of Point Thomson gas is essential to the success of an
Alaska gas pipeline project."

   The Point Thomson reservoir, located 60 miles east of Prudhoe Bay,
is over 12,000 feet deep. The reservoir pressure of 10,200 pounds per
square inch is abnormally high for the depth, requiring specialized
drilling and well-completion operations to maintain well control. The
project also will require high pressure injection and fluid-handling
facilities.

   As part of the drilling program, a $20 million project is under
way to upgrade the Nabors Rig 27E with new drilling mud and electrical
systems to safely access the very high pressure Point Thomson
reservoir. Casing pipe and wellhead equipment containing high-strength
steel and special corrosion-resistant alloys is under manufacture,
with delivery scheduled before year-end. The drilling and production
facilities will be designed and installed to minimize the impact on
the environment. Ice roads and existing gravel pads will be used as
much as practicable, with no off-lease gravel roads planned. Road
construction is planned for late 2008.

   The project will cost approximately $1.3 billion, which includes a
five-well delineation drilling program and a multi-year development to
construct production facilities, pipelines, and support
infrastructure. The upgraded Nabors rig will drill the first well
during the 2008-09 winter season.

   Under the initial phase, approximately 200 million cubic feet per
day of Point Thomson gas is expected to be produced. Approximately
10,000 barrels per day of liquid condensate that is separated from the
gas is planned to be delivered for sale through new and existing oil
pipelines. The remaining gas will be injected back into the Thomson
Sand reservoir to maintain pressure for continued hydrocarbon recovery
and for subsequent gas sales.

   ExxonMobil and the other Point Thomson working interest owners are
proceeding with the project while they seek to resolve the dispute
with the State over the Point Thomson Unit and leases. Other owners
include BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc., Chevron U.S.A. Inc.,
ConocoPhillips Alaska Inc, as well as 23 additional companies.

   CAUTIONARY STATEMENT: Estimates, expectations, and business plans
in this release are forward-looking statements. Actual future results,
including resource recoveries, production rates, and project plans,
schedules, and costs could differ materially due to changes in market
conditions affecting the oil and gas industry or long-term oil and gas
price levels; political or regulatory developments; reservoir
performance; timely completion of development projects; technical or
operating factors; and other factors discussed under the heading
"Factors Affecting Future Results" in the Investor Information section
of our website (www.exxonmobil.com) and in Item 1A of our most recent
Form 10-K. References to hydrocarbon resources, gas, barrels of liquid
condensate, and similar terms include quantities of oil and gas that
are not yet classified as proved reserves but that we believe will be
produced in the future.

&lt;p&gt;Michael Phelps Returns to United States and Partners with Visa to Help Introduce NYC Kids to Swimming

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Michael Phelps - a 14-time Olympic gold medalist - today teamed
with Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), a Worldwide Olympic Partner for more than
two decades, to present a Play Every Day jump-start grant to the YMCA
of Greater New York. The funds will help the YMCA expand participation
in its 2nd Grade Swim program, purchase new swimming equipment, and
also support aquatic facility expansions in Brooklyn and Queens.

   Today's announcement is a continuation of Visa and its family of
Olympic athletes ongoing commitment to the Partnership for Play Every
Day - an effort to raise national awareness and support for increasing
and improving the spaces where America's youth can play.

   "For America's kids, the time to play and swim is today," said
Phelps. "We need everyone's help in providing all kids with safe and
well-equipped spaces where they can exercise, have fun and maybe even
begin to pursue their own Olympic dreams."

   The Partnership for Play Every Day brings together organizations
including nonprofits, businesses and government agencies to ensure
that all children get at least 60 minutes of physical activity each
day. Federal funding for local parks, playgrounds, trails and open
spaces has decreased in recent years, and one of the partnership's
objectives is to increase the number of settings where kids can engage
in physical activity.

   "As a longtime Olympic sponsor, we're committed to empowering
current and future Olympic team hopefuls to reach for and achieve
their dreams," said Hans Morris, president, Visa Inc. "We believe in
the Play Every Day call to action and saw an opportunity to involve
Michael in an initiative that addresses a growing issue and will
introduce more kids to Olympic sports."

   Visa has had a long standing relationship with Michael Phelps
through its Team Visa program, featuring him in Olympic marketing
materials around the world including four national television
commercials, and partnering with him to grow the sport of swimming
around the world through domestic and international goodwill tours.

   This marks the fourth jump-start grant presented to the
partnership since Visa began supporting and promoting the Partnership
for Play Every Day initiative at the one-year countdown to the Beijing
Olympic Games in August 2007. Previous grants were made in New York,
Washington D.C. and San Francisco.

   "We are delighted that Visa, Michael Phelps, and the YMCA
understand the importance of teaching children how to swim and to have
a respect for water at an early age," said Dennis M. Walcott, Deputy
Mayor for Education and Community Development. "Swimming can teach
discipline, develop focus and enhance self confidence among children
at an early age. By expanding Second Grade Swim, more students can
develop these skills earlier which can go a long way in helping them
to become strong students as well as strong swimmers."

   "We're thrilled to have Visa and Michael Phelps on the Partnership
for Play Every Day team," said Jack Lund, president &amp; CEO of the YMCA
of Greater New York. "To reach our ultimate goal of getting America's
youth moving, we need influential voices like these to rally all
Americans around increasing the spaces and places where our kids can
play. Through this support we're able to expand participation in our
youth swimming program and continue to ensure that no child will be
turned away due to capacity or financial limitations."

USA, and the National Association for Sport and Physical Education are
working together as conveners of The Partnership for Play Every Day to
increase the spaces and quality of play for our country's children and
youth. These organizations have a proud legacy of providing physical
education, physical activity, childcare, after school programs and
youth sports to millions of children throughout the country. The
challenge today is to reach all our kids, especially those who aren't
afforded these same opportunities. Through this dynamic collaboration
with more than 30 of the nation's leading non-profits, government
agencies, academic organizations and corporations, we can create and
sustain the momentum for a national movement to ensure that all kids
get 60 minutes of physical activity every day. www.playeveryday.org

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Lehman Brothers LEH.N and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) may report a small sequential drop in third-quarter write-downs, helped by hedging gains, according to an analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyst David Trone wrote in a note to clients that he expects the three firms to together write-down $6.1 billion on their "problem assets" across leveraged loans, and commercial and residential mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They reported $6.9 billion in write-downs in the second quarter, due in part to losses from ineffective hedges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Trone forecast third-quarter composite revenue of $13.0 billion for the banks, down 15 percent from second quarter and down 47 percent from the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding write-downs in the second and third quarters, he said revenue forecast still reflects a 14 percent fall from second quarter, reflecting slower activities across business lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They faced new challenges with the sharp decline in global equity markets, seasonal weakness in customer flows in July and August, and ARS-related settlements with government bodies, Trone said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley agreed to pay a $35 million fine and buy back $4.5 billion of auction-rate debt by December 11, while Goldman Sachs said it will pay a $22.5 million fine and buy back about $1.5 billion of such notes by November 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cyclical weakness and uncertainty over composite members' balance sheets are not going away anytime soon," Trone said. "On the other hand, the valuation risk/reward in the group is quite compelling for longer-term investment horizons."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a practical matter, we see short-duration mini-rallies coming and going, but we doubt that a definitive, sustained upside breakout is looming," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Lehman and Morgan Stanley were trading almost flat at $14.72 and $39.29, respectively, while Goldman shares were trading up almost 2 percent at $158.22 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ratul Ray Chaudhuri in Bangalore; Editing by Anil D'Silva)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  BRUSSELS, BELGIUM, Aug 28 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Cefic, representing the European Chemical Industry, and IBM (NYSE: IBM)
developed a state-of-the-art solution which will facilitate and ease the
exchange of information between companies with the goal of submitting
registration dossiers required by the REACH Regulation. The solution,
SIEFreach, is a reliable and performing collaboration tool incorporating
IBM software, hardware and services. The system went live on August 21,
2008.

    Under REACH, around 30,000 substances have to be registered by 2018 to
ECHA, the European Chemicals Agency. All companies importing or
manufacturing chemical substances with quantities above one ton have to
submit registration dossiers.

    Cefic offers via the SIEFreach platform the possibility for companies to
exchange information in a user-friendly manner. Through the Substance
Information Exchange Forum (SIEF) companies will be able to exchange tests
and other data on identical chemical substances, which means that these
companies will gain time and cut costs by enhancing their communication
through a structured channel. Another important outcome will be that
animal testing can be minimized.

    In the context of the REACH project, Cefic created a new company called
ReachLink, who is the owner of the platform, together with the German,
French, Italian, UK and Spanish national chemical federations. In
cooperation with IBM, ReachLink will put a European SIEF management IT
system at the disposal of all European chemical and related companies
impacted by REACH, as from August 21, 2008. SIEFreach, as the system is
called, is an industry-wide shared IT platform.

    The SIEFreach solution, consisting of the SIEFreach application and
portal, is designed, developed and maintained by a global IBM team. The
IT platform is based on IBM WebSphere and Lotus collaboration software
and is hosted by IBM. In addition to hosting, IBM will also provide the
application helpdesk for the end user.

    Alain Perroy, Director-General of Cefic, explains why they chose to
partner with IBM, "IBM provided us with a one-stop-shop for services,
software and hardware. Their state-of-the-art technology and proven track
record led to a highly flexible and scalable collaboration solution fit
to the specific needs of the chemical industry."

    Isabelle Verleye, IBM Global Business Services, Business Development
Executive, confirms the IBM commitment to ReachLink, "Our global team is
dedicated to make this solution a success for ReachLink and the chemical
industry now and in the coming years. We have used our extensive resources
to enable efficient collaboration and successful registration for the
chemical industry."

    The agreement was signed on February 25, 2008.

to manage the risks that chemicals may pose to the health and the
environment.

&lt;p&gt;  KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA, Aug 28 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
RHB Banking Group today announced its new department, Central Technology
Unit, will enhance its product development and delivery to customers with
IBM (NYSE: IBM) System z10 mainframe as the foundation of its new
enterprise data center. The investment will also support the critical
processing capacity for the banking group's clients throughout Malaysia,
Singapore, Brunei and Thailand.

    RHB Banking Group's goal with the z10 project is to become a one-stop
banking institution, covering different services from Islamic banking to
insurance banking, in the advent of the business and Information
Technology (IT) transformation exercise.

    The banking group recently underwent a strategic transformation exercise
which brought about its IT operations under a single umbrella of Central
Technology Unit, which is responsible to deliver enhanced shared IT
services to the Group.

    RHB Banking Group's IT operations is poised to offer shared services such
as IT solutions and services delivery so that RHB will be able to leverage
its skilled workforce to achieve the Group's vision to be among the top
three financial institutions in ASEAN by the year 2020. The integration
also reflects the Group's commitment to taking new business approaches and
using the latest technology to sustain growth in the long term.

    Michael J. Barrett, Group Managing Director, RHB Banking Group said that
the banking group is confident that IBM System z10 will help serve its
customers better especially now that banking group offers more holistic
financial services such as retail banking and wealth management, corporate
and investment banking, Islamic banking and insurance.

    "We are proud to be the forerunner in having this system that, amongst
other things, is highly scalable to cater for business growth, mergers and
acquisitions. The RHB Banking Group, in line with its aspiration to be a
convenient one-stop financial institution, has continually explored all
possibilities in integrating all its available products and services,"
said Barrett.

    "This investment and collaboration with IBM is the platform that will help
us realize the objective of providing continuous banking services to our
customers. In making this choice, we have also taken into account how this
mainframe system will enable us to consolidate and streamline our core
banking systems and day-to-day operation of other businesses within the
RHB Banking Group," he added.

    IBM's strong performance in the second quarter this year was partly
attributed to the growth of IBM System z10 mainframe, which delivered a 32
percent increase in revenue. IBM has driven mainframe revenue growth in
seven of the last nine quarters, and MIPS growth 10 of the last 12
quarters. IBM has doubled its market share in high end server space since
2000. More than 600 new applications were introduced last year, bringing
the total to more than 4,000 applications available on the System z
platform.

    IBM Malaysia's managing director Ou Shian Waei said, "RHB has proven its
innovation stance as it leads the way in adopting the world most powerful
computer, the IBM System z10 Enterprise Class, to meet the escalating
needs of its clients locally and regionally."

    IBM System z10 which made its debut early this year also offers security
controls which are synonymous with the system as the only server on the
planet that has achieved this level of certification for security and
partitions from the United States government's highest level of security,
Evaluation Assurance Level 5 (EAL5), via z/VM.

    "Our relationship with RHB is one which we have built for more than a
decade and we have seen the banking group grow and prosper and we are
confident that they will reach their goals while keeping clients' needs at
heart," added Ou.

    About IBM System z10

    The security of the mainframe allows protection of sensitive data such as
credit card information and client's personal information from hackers
which is vital in banking operations such as RHB Banking Group.

    IBM System z10 is designed from the ground up to help clients dramatically
increase data centre efficiency by significantly improving performance and
reducing power, cooling costs, and floor space requirements, creating a
new enterprise data centre model for the organization.

    Clients today are looking to reduce the inefficiency and complexity of
today's data centers, as well as share IT resources more efficiently and
better align them to specific business objectives and ever-changing
business conditions. Clients are looking to manage IT as a service --
using a policy-driven system -- such as the IBM System z10 that doles out,
manages, and tracks appropriate IT resources where and when needed -- to
create the new enterprise data center.

&lt;p&gt;RICHARDSON, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Tango Networks(TM), one of the leaders in seamless enterprise
fixed-mobile convergence for unified communications, today announced
that its award-winning Abrazo(TM) solution has achieved
interoperability qualification with Microsoft Office Communications
Server 2007 by tekVizion Labs. This also coincides with Tango
Networks' acceptance into the Microsoft Unified Communications Open
Interoperability Program.

   With Tango Networks' Abrazo, corporations are able to interoperate
any mobile phone with Office Communications Server 2007. Users of
Office Communications Server 2007 are able to make and receive calls

   Tango Networks' Abrazo is based on a unique hybrid architecture
containing a component in the enterprise network and a component in
the mobile operator network. This fundamental design enables the
solution to passively monitor mobile device status in the mobile

area, etc.) and provide controlled, secure updates to Office
Communications Server 2007. Because of this architecture, any mobile
phone - with or without data connectivity - can extend the unified
communications experience to include mobile presence and location
information.

   "With Office Communications Server 2007, Microsoft has
successfully extended the power of unified communications to embrace
desktop voice communications as part of the enterprise's overall
unified communications strategy," stated Alastair Westgarth, president
and chief executive officer of Tango Networks. "Tango is taking it one
step further by enabling enterprises to extend Office Communications
Server 2007 to all mobile devices while providing a complete view of
end-user availability and location."

&lt;p&gt;BSD Medical to Collaborate With General Electric On New MRI-Monitored Cancer
Treatment System

SALT LAKE CITY, Aug. 28, 2008 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BSD Medical Corporation
(Nasdaq:BSDM) today announced that the company has agreed to collaborate with GE
Medical Systems in the integration of BSD Medical's premier cancer treatment
system with a GE magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system. The new system to be
installed at Duke University will provide MRI monitoring of cancer treatments in
progress as delivered by a BSD Medical system. This will be the first
collaborative engineering effort between GE and BSD Medical. BSD Medical has
also worked with Siemens Medical Systems in prior integrations for MRI
monitoring of cancer treatments with BSD Medical's systems.

The BSD-2000/3D/MR is a hybrid integration of a BSD-2000/3D cancer treatment
system with a magnetic resonance imaging system (MRI) used to visually monitor
deep thermal therapy cancer treatments in progress with thermal imaging through
MR-tomography. The images are in color, and temperature within the images is
differentiated visually by use of color coding. MR-tomography is therefore a
classic application for monitoring cancer treatments with BSD Medical's systems,
as these treatments involve delivery of precision-focused heat through
RF/microwave energy.

About BSD Medical Corporation

BSD Medical Corp. is the leading developer of systems used to deliver
precision-focused microwave/RF energy to diseased sites in the body, including
cancer. Its treatments are used to kill cancer directly and increase the
effectiveness of companion radiation treatments for certain tumors. The
BSD-2000/3D/MR is part of the family of BSD-2000 systems that are a recipient of
the Frost and Sullivan Innovation of the Year Award for cancer therapy devices.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comments, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aug 28 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse downgraded Coca-Cola Co
(KO.N) to "neutral" from "outperform," saying the company was
under increased urgency to restructure its North American
business, and added this would be harder for Coke than for
rival soft drink giant PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With dollar poised to strengthen, and with growing
competitive pressure from PepsiCo and its North American
bottlers, the urgency for dealing with Coke's "broken North
American model has now moved to the front burner," analysts
Carlos Laboy and Anthony Bucalo wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In July, Coca-Cola reported a lower quarterly profit, hurt
by an impairment charge at its largest bottler Coca-Cola
Enterprises Inc (CCE.N), which initiated a 120-day review of
its North American operations in order to find actions that
would improve results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With Pepsi indicating that a reshaping to be unveiled in
November will not provoke a change to its growth algorithm, and
with Coca-Cola Enterprises in crisis, the pressure is rising
for Coke to fix this market," the analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit Suisse analysts also said its economists were
expecting a bottoming out and recovery of the dollar for 2009
and beyond, adding that this may have a "dampening effect on
potential earnings growth and accelerate the need for
concentrate price increases to the bottling network."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The weakness of the U.S. dollar against many other
currencies increases the value of overseas sales when they are
converted to dollars for inclusion in companies' income
statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Laboy and Bucalo cut their price target on the stock to $57
from $60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company closed at $53.79 Wednesday on the New
York Stock Exchange.

with Coca-Cola Enterprises in crisis, the pressure is rising
for Coke to fix this market," the analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit Suisse analysts also said its economists were
expecting a bottoming out and recovery of the dollar for 2009
and beyond, adding that this may have a "dampening effect on
potential earnings growth and accelerate the need for
concentrate price increases to the bottling network."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The weakness of the U.S. dollar against many other
currencies increases the value of overseas sales when they are
converted to dollars for inclusion in companies' income
statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Laboy and Bucalo cut their price target on the stock to $57
from $60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company closed at $53.79 Wednesday on the New
York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Insurance Industry Plunges Deep into Outsourcing - IBM Global is Client-Favored Supplier, Reports 2008 Black Book

    Brown-Wilson Group Announced the 2008 Black Book Top Insurance
  Industry Outsourcing Vendors Results Based on the Client Experience
and Satisfaction Outcomes from over 3,300 Insurance Companies Globally
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The insurance industry, which has lagged behind others in
outsourcing business and technology processes abroad, is now the
fastest growing offshore service sector with a CAGR of 33%.

   Overall, global insurance outsourcing is growing at a CAGR of 8%,
expected to become a $24 billion industry next year. Onshore sourcing
relationships are the favored destination of 91% of insurance firms,
while 9% elect to have suppliers from abroad. However, that mix is
shifting offshore at a breaking pace.

   Black Book findings for the Insurance Industry include:

   --  Nearly three-quarters of global insurers currently use at
        least one information technology outsourcer and one business
        process outsourcer.

   --  U.S. outsourcing vendors are preferred by 9 of 10 U.S.
        insurance users/clients. Offshore data security, the
        complexities of managing risks, cultural barriers, compliance
        requirements and reliability are still viewed as offshoring
        drawbacks by 95% of insurance users. 96.6% of onshore clients
        state they would consider offshore vendors if these issues
        manifested improvements.

   --  System modernization, process transformation and innovation
        dominate sourcing agendas as the key drivers for vendor
        selections - more than the cost based benefits of recent
        years, as risks from service interruption, customer data,
        information security and privacy exposures far outweigh any
        benefits from cost reduction to insurers.

   IBM Global has made a clean sweep in all Insurance Industry
outsourcing domains of Information Technology Outsourcing, Business
Process Outsourcing, Call Center Outsourcing and Knowledge Process
Outsourcing.

   The achievement of cross-domain top honors in all the major
categories in a single industry or vertical by IBM Global's collective
outsourcing divisions is the first time any single vendor has
accomplished full industry dominance in a Black Book client
satisfaction survey since its inception in 2004.

   About one out of five IBM Global employees are now located in
India including over 20,000 in its Indian BPO division, IBM Daksh
serving both core insurance systems and front office processes.

   Scott Wilson, Partner of Brown-Wilson Group, which authors The
Black Book of Outsourcing, stated, "The Black Book award, completely
based on client experience and satisfaction, is an acknowledgment of
the culture of excellence IBM has created within the Insurance
Industry and their sustained efforts in offering their insurance
industry customers the best sourcing experience through a combination
of people, process and innovation excellence."

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp released on Wednesday a second test version of Internet Explorer 8, delivering a feature-complete upgrade to the world's most widely used Web browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker said the latest version -- beta 2 -- of Internet Explorer, which has a market share of about 75 percent, comes with new features to enhance privacy, ease-of-use, and security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft first released a test -- or beta 1 -- version of IE 8 in March, but that was aimed at letting Web developers take a first look at the new browser. This latest version is aimed at a broader consumer audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company would not disclose when it planned to officially launch IE 8 nor how many people are expected to download the test version of the new browser. It released Internet Explorer 7 in October 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has pledged to deliver more regular updates of Internet Explorer, whose lead has been chipped away by Mozilla's Firefox browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest version of Internet Explorer replicates features found in Firefox 3, the latest version of that Web browser, including a "smart" address bar that remembers and redirects user to website addresses they have visited before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer 8 also offers a mode called "InPrivate Browsing," which ensures that history, temporary Internet files and cookies are not recorded on a user's PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a security feature that allows a user to block content coming from third-parties trying to track and aggregate the user's online behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also updated already announced features such as "Activities," which allows a user to use information found on one page, such as an address, in conjunction with an online service such as mapping without leaving the original site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest test release of Internet Explorer 8 is available for download at www.microsoft.com/ie8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Microsoft has agreed to buy Greenfield Online, owner of popular European price comparison website ciao.com, for about $486 million to boost its Internet search and e-commerce business in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, whose $47.5 billion bid to buy Yahoo earlier this year failed after a long battle, said on Friday the acquisition -- the latest in a series -- should help it build a more consumer-friendly, results-oriented search engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We call it 'instant answers'," said John Mangelaars, head of Microsoft's consumer and online business in Europe. "I hope it's getting very clear that we've very serious about EMEA," he added, speaking to Reuters by telephone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internet search is dominated by Google, which has 62 percent of the global search market and 79 percent in Europe, according to Web usage tracker ComScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has a 2 percent market share in Europe and 9 percent worldwide, behind both Google and Yahoo. In Europe, Microsoft is also outranked by online auction site eBay and Russia's Yandex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Mangelaars said buying ciao.com was an important step in Microsoft's attempt to distinguish itself by providing search results more useful to consumers, particularly shoppers, than those thrown up by a Google search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, results of a Microsoft search for a particular camera model could include which prices were available from which retailers, and maps of where those retailers were, rather than just links to the manufacturer's and retailers' websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acquisition follows those of Norwegian enterprise search company Fast for about $1.2 billion early this year and shopping-and-auction site jellyfish.com for an undisclosed sum last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CASH BACK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caio.com is active in seven European countries and attracts 19.6 million unique visitors per month in Europe, more than twice as many as rival kelkoo.com, according to ComScore, thanks to its large network of members who contribute product reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To attract more users, Microsoft also plans to reward consumers who buy products through its shopping sites by giving them cash back, extending a trial started in the United States a few months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google's trying to do all your search needs. What Microsoft is doing with this kind of acquisition is saying: 'We're going to be very good at the commercial side of search, the shopping'," said Forrester principal analyst Rebecca Jennings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herve le Jouan, ComScore's managing director, Europe, agreed. "Doing this shopping thing, I think, is a good move," he said, but cautioned that acquisitions alone would never bring Microsoft close to Google's market share in search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nobody is able to compete right now with Google so there is nobody to buy to compete with Google," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Mangelaars acknowledged the distance Microsoft had to cover, especially given the commercial edifice rapidly being built by online advertisers whose models depend on Google's particular view of the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a race," he said, "but we also believe it's very early days in search technology."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's offer of $17.50 per share betters an earlier proposal by media-focused U.S. buyout firm Quadrangle Group to acquire the company for $15.50 a share, and represents a slight premium to Greenfield's closing price of $17.25 on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On August 26, Greenfield had said it had received a $17.50 per share offer but did not reveal from whom. The latest offer represents a premium of about 10 percent over Greenfield's closing share price on August 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it had agreed to sell Greenfield's main business, which surveys consumer opinion online and sells the results to market researchers, to an unnamed financial buyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies expect both deals to close during the fourth quarter of 2008. Completion of the Greenfield sale to Microsoft does not depend on Microsoft's disposal of the online survey business, the two companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty in Bangalore; Editing by Quentin Bryar and Sue Thomas)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - Puerto Rico's largest bank Popular Inc (BPOP.O) said it will sell the loan and servicing assets of its U.S. mortgage unit worth $1.17 billion to Goldman Sachs (GS.N) to improve liquidity and reduce risky assets, sending its shares up as much as 27 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transaction, expected to close in the fourth quarter, will provide more than $700 million in additional liquidity and significantly reduce its U.S. sub-prime assets, Popular, the parent of Banco Popular, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Popular expects a loss of about $450 million related to the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This sale probably gets rid of most of the remaining sub-prime assets form the mainland and from their subsidiary (Popular Financial Holdings)," Joseph Gladue, analyst with B.

&lt;p&gt; (Figures in U.S. dollars unless noted)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WINNIPEG, Manitoba Aug 29 (Reuters) - Potash Corp of
Saskatchewan (POT.TO) risks running short of supplies to fill
contracts because of a strike at three of its mines, an analyst
with JP Morgan said in an alert to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Silver said the strike, which began three weeks ago,
limits supplies at a time when world markets were "already
exceptionally tight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Absent a settlement, we believe Potash Corp may soon be
forced to declare force majeure due to an inability to meet
current contractual commitments," Silver wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has said the strike has affected industrial
customers, accounting for about 5 percent of sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has also said it's too early to say whether the strike
will affect its ability to meet sales commitments in its
mainstay fertilizer business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are no talks scheduled between Potash Corp and the
United Steelworkers union, which represents about 500 striking
workers at the mines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The mines account for about 6 percent of world capacity for
potash, a fertilizer farmers need to boost yields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Potash Corp shares were up C$1.09 at C$187.50 on the
Toronto Stock Exchange on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Managers restarted production at the largest of the three
mines, but will probably restore only about half of production,
which was 1.744 million tonnes in 2007, Silver said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A strike lasting eight weeks would reduce the company's
potash output by 240,000 to 270,00 tonnes, Silver said, costing
it 15 to 20 cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he did not change his third-quarter earnings estimates
of $3.80 per share nor 2008 estimates of $13.25 per share,
noting ammonia fertilizer prices have strengthened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=$1.05 Canadian)

&lt;p&gt;  LAKE BUENA VISTA, FL, Aug 29 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Direct from the Beijing Games where he won a record eight Gold Medals,
world champion swimmer Michael Phelps celebrated his unprecedented
achievement with an all-American homecoming parade in his honor at Walt
Disney World Resort.

    In a star-spangled salute amidst confetti and thousands of flag-waving
fans in the Magic Kingdom, Phelps was honored for his record-setting wins
and for the spirit in which he captivated the world in his quest for Gold.

    The 23-year-old from Baltimore beamed as he rode through the park
alongside Mickey Mouse, waving to fans who chanted his name. Magic
Kingdom guests joined in "America's Homecoming Parade" for the swimmer
who broke records in each event he entered in Beijing.

    For Phelps, who also was honored in Disney parades at both Walt Disney
World in Florida and Disneyland Park in California following the 2004
Summer Games, it was a sweet homecoming to the United States and to see
fans who supported him in his quest for Gold in Beijing.

    "I am so happy to celebrate here and see some of the fans who supported
me," said Phelps. "It's great to feel so much excitement around the sport
of swimming in the U.S. and around the world. To top it all off with a
parade at Disney World is just incredible."

    During his celebration in the Magic Kingdom, Phelps also took time to meet
a group of local swimmers from the central Florida area. The aspiring
young swimmers had the chance to talk with Phelps, ask about his
record-breaking experiences and see the Gold Medals he won in Beijing.

    Phelps' celebration at Walt Disney World is planned to be the next feature
on his wildly popular Facebook.com page. Phelps, one of the most popular
public figures on the social networking site, has nearly 1.5 million
Facebook "fans" who have subscribed to receive his latest news and
updates. Phelps said he plans to offer photographs and video of his Walt
Disney World visit on his Facebook.com site.

    Phelps, who has announced he will train for the 2012 Games, now owns the
record for most Gold Medals in a single event (8) and for a career (14).

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - Procter  Gamble Co (PG.N), the maker of Gillette razors and Pampers diapers, said on Friday that Chairman and Chief Executive A.G. Lafley's total compensation in the latest fiscal year declined 15 percent due largely to lower option awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total compensation fell to $23.5 million from $27.7 million in the previous year, according to a proxy filing with U.S. regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lafley's salary of $1.7 million was the same for the fifth consecutive year, while his bonus, based on company performance, was $4 million, up $500,000. The board approved a $100,000 raise for the current year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other compensation, Lafley received $9.1 million in stock, down slightly from last year, and $7.8 million in options. The previous year, he received $10.3 million in options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said Lafley's compensation was 89 percent based on performance goals that were met or exceeded in the latest fiscal year ended in June, with the majority paid in stock, restricted stock units or options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PG's sales rose 9 percent to $83.5 billion for the year. Sales in ongoing businesses, also known as organic sales, were up 5 percent, in line with company goals on which Lafley's compensation is based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings per share for the year jumped 20 percent to $3.64. Excluding the Gillette acquisition, they rose between 11 percent and 12 percent, compared with a company goal of 10 percent or better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ben Klayman; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many global brands fail to achieve brand awareness whilst local
Chinese retailer captures interest despite holding no official Olympic
               sponsorship, with successful brand ambush
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Research from Mediaedge:cia (www.mecglobal.com), a leading media
agency , today reveals the level of success achieved by the brand
sponsors of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games.

   Between them, the top 12 official brand sponsors invested $866m in
sponsorship, advertising and sponsorship activation. Yet research from
Mediaedge:cia (MEC) reveals wide variations in the success of brands
in generating a strong association with the Beijing 2008 Games. MEC's
research amongst 1,000 Chinese consumers into which brands they
associated with the Games found that only Coca-Cola and Lenovo
succeeded in generating brand awareness in more than 40% of consumers
(see diagram 1). Despite the investment made by other top brand
sponsors (including McDonald's) many failed to generate significant
brand awareness. During Wave 2 only 17% of Chinese consumers
associated McDonald's with Beijing 2008.

   Coca-Cola is estimated to have spent between $75m and $90m dollars
on its Chinese Olympic sponsorship. However, MEC's research found that
sponsorship on its own does not equal success for brands in Beijing
2008. Coca-Cola was the brand sponsor, achieving the highest awareness
amongst consumers and successfully boosting its awareness from 28% in
April to 2008 to more than 50% of Chinese consumers during the Games.
MEC propose that this was due, in part, to strong above-the-line
advertising support (see diagram 2). Coca-Cola trebled its monthly
spend in the six weeks leading up to the opening ceremony. The brand's
sponsorship clearly helped to differentiate it from rivals with Pepsi,
not an official sponsor of the Games, only achieving 8% brand
awareness.

   Adidas is estimated to have spent close to $250m on its complete
Olympics sponsorship and advertising package. Yet in April 2008,
Adidas and Nike (which is not an official sponsor of the games)
achieved similar levels of brand awareness, with 16% and 11%
respectively, despite Nike not being an official sponsor. However, by
August, Adidas had built 38% awareness of its brand, whereas Nike only
raised its awareness to 18%. Adidas's success was a result of
on-screen presence through branded clothing and consistent
Olympics-related advertising in the six months prior to the Games.

   The brand that achieved the greatest uplift in consumer awareness
was local sportswear retailer Li Ning. MEC research revealed that
consumers' brand awareness soared from just 8% in April 2008 to 20%
during the Games. While home-grown brand Li Ning had no official Games
sponsor status, the company sponsored the Chinese gymnastics team and
the founder (an ex Olympian himself) was chosen to light the torch at
the opening ceremony. This jump in brand awareness saw Li Ning's share
price rise 6% overnight.

   These successes are in stark contrast to other official brand
sponsors such as Lenovo, which is both a top sponsor and torch
partner. In April 2008, MEC research found it was the brand Chinese
consumers most associated with the Beijing Olympics. The brand failed
to leverage its sponsorship by increasing advertising spend, arguably
resulting in brand awareness levels remaining static until the first
week of the Games.

   Commenting on the research, Jon Wright, director of MEC MediaLab
APAC, said: "Beijing 2008 was the biggest and most significant
opportunity to date for brands to capture the interest of Chinese
consumers. Our research clearly shows that it's not just about how
much money you have. If brands want to maximize the return of their
sponsorship they need consistent, integrated advertising strategies.
But it's not just what you do with an event that is as vast as the
Olympics; it is also how you do it. There are six months from the
torch relay to the end of the Games, and our research has shown that
the brands that succeed are the ones that continually keep their
advertising and sponsorship fresh and engaging for consumers."

   Notes to editors:

   Interviews were conducted online between 11-17 April and 11-13
August, through the online fieldwork company GMI, with 1,000
respondents. Respondents were from Beijing, Shanghai or Guangzhou and
data from the 2nd wave were weighted to match the profile from the
first wave.

   A final wave of the research will be conducted in the second week
of September.

&lt;p&gt;Court in Denmark Upholds Two Lipitor Patents, Prevents Launch of Ranbaxy Generic Product before November 2011

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc said today that the Eastern Division of the High Court in Copenhagen,
Denmark has ruled in the company's favor in challenges to two of its patents
covering atorvastatin, the active ingredient in Lipitor. The basic (DK 171,588)
and enantiomer (EP 409,281) patents were challenged by generics manufacturer
Ranbaxy.

The court ruled that the basic patent, which expires in November 2011, would be
infringed by Ranbaxy's generic atorvastatin product. The court also ruled that
the atovastatin enantiomer patent is valid. That patent expires in July 2010.
The decision, which is subject to possible appeal, prevents Ranbaxy from
launching its generic product before November 2011.

"Today's decision is an important outcome for Pfizer and other medical
innovators who invest in high-risk research to develop life-saving medicines for
millions of patients," said Pfizer Denmark Country Manager Karin Verland.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Aug 29 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that Procter and Gamble (NYSE: PG) has
selected products and services from IBM's Internet Security Systems (ISS)
division to expand its global cyber-security initiative. The agreement
will strengthen Procter and Gamble's (P) threat protection arsenal by
streamlining the management of its layered security tools and ultimately
can help deliver substantial savings in administrative costs.

    This simplified security approach will streamline the management and help
increase the efficiency of P's cyber-security project. First developed
in 2005, P pioneered a layered, preventative network protection and
vulnerability assessment project to mitigate and eliminate major costly
internal vulnerabilities. Because the threat landscape has drastically
evolved since the project was developed to become more sophisticated and
profit-driven, P will look to IBM to enhance its security tools and
provide on-going management of its security infrastructure with IBM ISS
managed security services. P will benefit from IBM ISS's industry
leading security products and managed security services that are based on
IBM ISS's experience and its leading X-Force research team while also
helping P save on administrative and IT resources costs associated with
managing its security operations.

    As part of the agreement, IBM will help manage the efficiency of P's
network security through its leading Virtual Security Operations Center
(SOC). The Virtual SOC can help enhance the overall security posture of
the company by integrating data from disparate, heterogeneous security
products into a single point of control. This feature allows IBM ISS to
view, manage and monitor P's global security infrastructure through a
powerful Web-based portal that provides integrated vulnerability
assessment, data correlation and analysis. IBM ISS can quickly visualize
and prioritize security areas that need remediation. Through the Virtual
SOC, IBM ISS streamlines the monitoring and maintenance of four IBM ISS
Proventia SiteProtector management consoles deployed throughout North
America, Europe and Asia, alleviating the need for P to conduct manual
updates.

    "By teaming with IBM ISS our objective is to both strengthen our security
systems and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our security
operations," said Willie Alvarado, P's Enterprise Infrastructure
Services Director. "Working with IBM we believe we can deliver
substantial cost savings and offer the business a security solution that
is both strong and sustainable."

    "P is truly ahead of the curve with a radical approach to pre-emptive
security," said Val Rahmani, general manager of IBM ISS. "Working together
we've enhanced the security infrastructure and resiliency around the
globe, and we're helping to reduce the cost of that security. With a
layered, streamlined and managed security strategy in place, P can
focus on its core business, and ultimately better serve its customers."

    IBM will deploy for P a comprehensive set of integrated security
technologies which proactively identify and address vulnerabilities at the
desktop, server and network tiers.

    About Procter and Gamble

    Three billion times a day, P brands touch the lives of people around the
world. The company has one of the strongest portfolios of trusted,
quality, leadership brands, including Pampers(R), Tide(R), Ariel(R),

&lt;p&gt;(Recasts; adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aug 29 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded Cabot
Corp (CBT.N), a maker of specialty chemicals, to "overweight"
from "neutral," saying the company is now poised to grow
earnings per share strongly over a multi-year period from a
cyclical bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Jeffrey Zekauskas said 2009 should prove to be a
materially better year for the company with reductions in cost
of carbon black raw materials and rise in carbon black
contractual prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cabot's major products are carbon black, fumed silica,
inkjet colorants, capacitor materials and cesium formate
drilling fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zekauskas said free cash flow for Cabot seemed "healthy" at
4.9 percent for 2009, but warned it was likely to be
constrained due to a large capital program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the Boston, Massachusetts-based company closed at
$27.54 Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds quote, details, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Orhan Coskun and Thomas Grove&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISTANBUL Aug 29 (Reuters) - Turkey is holding talks with
Germany's RWE AG (RWEG.DE) and U.S. Chevron (CVX.N) on
conducting oil exploration in the Black Sea, a senior Turkish
energy ministry source told Reuters on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Major oil importer Turkey is looking to develop its oil
exploration activities as part of efforts to reduce its large
fuel bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source said Turkish oil company TPAO planned to open six
wells in the Black Sea, of which two will be opened with
Brazil's Petrobras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Talks with U.S. Chevron are continuing. These talks have
reached an important stage. A partnership may also be
established with RWE for some licenses belonging to TPAO," the
source said on the sidelines of an energy conference in
Istanbul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are indications that the Black Sea could be an oil
production region like the Caspian. We are expecting good news
from the exploration there in 2009," Energy Minister Hilmi Guler
said at the same conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mehmet Uysal, general director of TPAO, said earlier this
year the company would start oil exploration in the Black Sea
with Brazil's Petrobras next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The seismic surveys near the Black Sea town of Sinop with
Petrobras, which is expected to invest $400 million in Black Sea
oil exploration in the next four years, were completed last year
and the first well is expected to be opened in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TPAO is hoping to find rich gas reserves in the western
Black Sea and rich oil reserves in the eastern part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Officials estimate the volume of reserves in the Black Sea
to amount to 10 billion barrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, Uysal told the same conference on Friday that
French companies were interested in conducting oil exploration
in the eastern Mediterranean region near Mersin.

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Announces Opening of Vocational Training Center in Tsunami-Affected Indonesian Province

BANDA ACEH, Indonesia &amp; SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), the government of Indonesia, the
local government of Aceh province, the National Education Department,
the Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Agency for Aceh and Nias, and
the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) today
announced the completion of a $16 million partnership to construct a
polytechnic institute in Aceh province, Indonesia.

   Chevron committed $6 million to the polytechnic, which supports
the government of Indonesia's plan to assist in restoring people's
livelihoods following the tsunami of December 26, 2004. The company
has committed a total of $14.7 million through the Chevron Aceh
Recovery Initiative to support reconstruction initiatives. More than
100,000 people in Aceh have been helped by the company's efforts.

   "The polytechnic opens a new chapter in rebuilding Aceh society,"
said Rhonda Zygocki, Chevron vice president for Policy, Government and
Public Affairs. "It will build the capacity of dozens of community
leaders, teach thousands of students critical technology skills and
help restore countless livelihoods."

   The Aceh Polytechnic will provide vocational training in applied
technology fields such as information technology, mechatronics
engineering (a combination of electronic and mechanical engineering),
electronics telecommunication and business accounting. These fields
correspond with local industry needs and are critical to continued
reconstruction and development in the province.

   "Through this partnership, we are helping Aceh achieve and sustain
greater economic growth, educational opportunities and human and
institutional capacity than it had before," said Steve Green, managing
director of Chevron's IndoAsia Business Unit. "Partnerships are part
of our values and central to the way we conduct community engagement
programs," he added.

   Chevron Corporation has had a presence in Indonesia since 1924,
when it began exploration activities through its predecessor, Standard
Oil Co. of California. The corporation has contributed to developing
human capacity through education, training and local business
development in Indonesia.

   Chevron Corporation is one of the world's leading integrated
energy companies, with subsidiaries that conduct business across the
globe. The company's success is driven by the ingenuity and commitment
of approximately 59,000 employees who operate across the energy
spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and transports crude oil and
natural gas; refines, markets and distributes transportation fuels and

&lt;p&gt;Greenfield Online Announces Agreement to Be Acquired by Microsoft; Terminates Agreement with Affiliates of Quadrangle

WILTON, Conn.--(Business Wire)--
Greenfield Online, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRVY) ("Greenfield Online")
announced that earlier today it entered into a merger agreement to be
acquired by Microsoft Corporation (Nasdaq: MSFT) ("Microsoft"), via a
cash tender offer for $17.50 per share in a transaction valued at
approximately $486 million. In addition, Greenfield Online announced
that immediately prior to entry into the merger agreement with
Microsoft it had terminated its previously announced merger agreement
with affiliates of Quadrangle Group LLC (together with its affiliates,
"Quadrangle") following the expiration of the matching rights granted
to Quadrangle under the Quadrangle merger agreement. In connection
with the termination of the Quadrangle merger agreement, Greenfield
Online is required to pay Quadrangle a $5 million fee.

   Microsoft has advised Greenfield Online that it has entered into
an agreement to sell the assets of Greenfield Online's Internet survey
solutions (ISS) business to an unnamed financial buyer. The merger of
Greenfield Online and Microsoft and Microsoft's sale of the ISS
business are expected to close simultaneously in the fourth quarter of
2008. The consummation of the Microsoft transaction is not contingent
on the sale of the ISS business.

   Albert Angrisani, Greenfield Online's President and Chief
Executive Officer said: "We are pleased to deliver additional value to
our stockholders through this superior offer from Microsoft. We are
excited about working with one of the world's leading corporations to
effectuate a smooth transition in both our comparison shopping and
global ISS businesses." Angrisani added, "We believe that the
transition will have a positive outcome for our customers and
employees."

   "Acquiring one of Europe's leading price comparison, shopping and
consumer reviews sites will further extend Microsoft's search and
ecommerce services in Europe," stated Tami Reller, Corporate Vice
President &amp; CFO for Windows and Online Services, Microsoft
Corporation. "The team at Ciao has built a passionate consumer
community based on intuitive technology and extensive merchant
relationships that we believe will deliver incremental benefit to the
Microsoft Live Search platform. Greenfield Online's ISS business has
been a cornerstone of the company's growth and market value - we are
pleased we could find the right strategic partner for ISS to continue
its growth."

   The closing of the tender offer by Microsoft is subject to
customary conditions, including that shares representing at least a
majority of Greenfield Online's common stock on a fully diluted basis
are validly tendered into the offer and the obtaining of customary
antitrust approvals. The subsequent closing of the merger may be
subject to obtaining stockholder approval of the merger agreement if
Microsoft does not acquire a sufficient number of shares to effect a
short-form merger. If such approval is needed, Greenfield Online will
call a special meeting of its stockholders.

   Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., served as Greenfield Online's
financial advisors in connection with the transaction. Paul, Weiss,
Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison LLP served as Greenfield Online's legal
counsel.

   Greenfield Online will file a Form 8-K with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") with further details concerning
this transaction.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Microsoft has agreed to buy Greenfield Online, owner of popular European price comparison website ciao.com, for about $486 million to boost its Internet search and e-commerce business in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, whose $47.5 billion bid to buy Yahoo earlier this year failed after a long battle, said on Friday the acquisition -- the latest in a series -- should help it build a more consumer-friendly, results-oriented search engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We call it 'instant answers'," said John Mangelaars, head of Microsoft's consumer and online business in Europe. "I hope it's getting very clear that we've very serious about EMEA," he added, speaking to Reuters by telephone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internet search is dominated by Google, which has 62 percent of the global search market and 79 percent in Europe, according to Web usage tracker ComScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has a 2 percent market share in Europe and 9 percent worldwide, behind both Google and Yahoo. In Europe, Microsoft is also outranked by online auction site eBay and Russia's Yandex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Mangelaars said buying ciao.com was an important step in Microsoft's attempt to distinguish itself by providing search results more useful to consumers, particularly shoppers, than those thrown up by a Google search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, results of a Microsoft search for a particular camera model could include which prices were available from which retailers, and maps of where those retailers were, rather than just links to the manufacturer's and retailers' websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acquisition follows those of Norwegian enterprise search company Fast for about $1.2 billion early this year and shopping-and-auction site jellyfish.com for an undisclosed sum last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CASH BACK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caio.com is active in seven European countries and attracts 19.6 million unique visitors per month in Europe, more than twice as many as rival kelkoo.com, according to ComScore, thanks to its large network of members who contribute product reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To attract more users, Microsoft also plans to reward consumers who buy products through its shopping sites by giving them cash back, extending a trial started in the United States a few months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google's trying to do all your search needs. What Microsoft is doing with this kind of acquisition is saying: 'We're going to be very good at the commercial side of search, the shopping'," said Forrester principal analyst Rebecca Jennings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herve le Jouan, ComScore's managing director, Europe, agreed. "Doing this shopping thing, I think, is a good move," he said, but cautioned that acquisitions alone would never bring Microsoft close to Google's market share in search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nobody is able to compete right now with Google so there is nobody to buy to compete with Google," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Mangelaars acknowledged the distance Microsoft had to cover, especially given the commercial edifice rapidly being built by online advertisers whose models depend on Google's particular view of the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a race," he said, "but we also believe it's very early days in search technology."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's offer of $17.50 per share betters an earlier proposal by media-focused U.S. buyout firm Quadrangle Group to acquire the company for $15.50 a share, and represents a slight premium to Greenfield's closing price of $17.25 on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On August 26, Greenfield had said it had received a $17.50 per share offer but did not reveal from whom. The latest offer represents a premium of about 10 percent over Greenfield's closing share price on August 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it had agreed to sell Greenfield's main business, which surveys consumer opinion online and sells the results to market researchers, to an unnamed financial buyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies expect both deals to close during the fourth quarter of 2008. Completion of the Greenfield sale to Microsoft does not depend on Microsoft's disposal of the online survey business, the two companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty in Bangalore; Editing by Quentin Bryar and Sue Thomas)&lt;/p&gt;
