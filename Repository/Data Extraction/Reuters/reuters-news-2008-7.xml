&lt;p&gt;MADRID (Reuters) - The U.S. public mood is moving toward allowing drilling in areas which are currently off limits to the oil majors due to environmental concerns, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rex Tillerson said outdated environmental attitudes were the reason for opposition to drilling in areas such as the eastern Gulf of Mexico and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're stuck in this emotional, environmental past ... Public sentiment in the United States seems to be shifting," Tillerson told Reuters in an interview. "The American people are kind of sick and tired of these prices."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some politicians have questioned the impact on prices of opening U.S. offshore waters that are now closed to energy exploration. Last week Guy Caruso, who heads the federal Energy Information Administration, said consumers would see little savings at the pump from the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillerson dismissed this view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When people make statements like that it suggests to me that they don't understand how the 85 million barrels (of total world oil production) today is delivered," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every barrel counted he said, adding that even if only 100,000 barrels per day of production per day were added, "it's going to make a big difference".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillerson said Exxon would look at any opportunities that arise. "We'd be very active in anything that's opened up in the future," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has faced criticism in Alaska after the U.S. Supreme Court last week overturned a $2.5 billion punitive damages award against the world's largest non-government controlled oil company by market capitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CEO added he hoped the decision would not mar the company's relationship with the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I hope we can work co-operatively with the state and that this doesn't become a distraction," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state of Alaska vowed to tighten oversight on Exxon after the ruling but Tillerson said he was not worried about this. "I don't know how their oversight can get much tighter," he said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by David Holmes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Tuesday it had agreed to buy Powerset, a start-up that is working on a new class of Web search that relies on insights from linguistics rather than simple keyword strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satya Nadella, senior vice president of Microsoft's Search, Portal, and Advertising business, confirmed the purchase in a statement, following months of rumors that they were in merger talks. Financial terms were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powerset's technology breaks down the meaning of words into related concepts, freeing users from having to type the exact words they want to find. This emerging approach to Web search, known as semantic search, has fascinated researchers for decades but proved frustratingly difficult to commercialize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Powerset has always been a small company with big dreams, with the ultimate goal of changing the way humans interact with computers through language," Powerset product manager Mark Johnson wrote in a company blog post announcing the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The start-up, with several-dozen staff including academic experts in the field of natural language processing, is one of a handful of Web search acquisitions by Microsoft, even as it has been frustrated in its pursuit of Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software giant said in January it was buying Norway's Fast Search and Transfer ASA, a top provider of Web search services used inside businesses, for about $1.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Yahoo, the No. 2 provider of consumer Web search behind Google Inc (GOOG.O), rebuffed a $47.5 billion bid and a partial deal to buy Yahoo's search business for more than $9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHADDYA MEAN BY THAT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powerset technology looks beyond words to try to understand conceptual relationships to get closer to what a user is looking for, analyzing sentences and whole documents to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco-based company is one of a number of start-ups seeking to use semantic language software to improve on the current generation of search dominated by Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, and Baidu.com (BIDU.O) to a lesser degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powerset has mounted public demonstration projects to showcase the power of its approach to search. In May, it began offering a way of searching millions of entries in Wikipedia's online encyclopedia, helping users find detailed answers to questions rather than isolated links requiring more research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making it possible to search the wider Web using conversational language is expensive, Johnson said, adding: "Microsoft accelerates our ability to move Powerset to the entire web faster than anyone could have imagined."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said Powerset's software, together with similar semantic Web tools developed by Microsoft Research, can help it develop products that understand the intent of a user's word choices in each Web search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know today that roughly a third of searches don't get answered on the first search and first click," Nadella said. "Usually searchers find the information they want eventually, but that often requires multiple searches or clicks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powerset, a 2-1/2-year-old start-up, has licensed natural language processing technology and related machine processing methods developed over three decades at the Xerox PARC research center in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Visa comment, firms involved, details on dispute)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, July 1 (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) dropped a
requirement that consumers punch in personal identification
numbers when using Visa-branded debit cards to make small
purchases, prompting the U.S. Justice Department to close an
antitrust probe, it said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Justice Department had been looking into whether there
was an antitrust concern with Visa's decision to require the
PINs for Visa debit cards at the same time that it dropped a
requirement for a signature for purchases under $25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa processes the cards verified by signature while the
cards with PINs are processed by Visa competitors like STAR,
owned by First Data Corp FDC.BA, and Pulse, which is owned by
Discover Financial Services (DFS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa said it dropped the PIN requirement in response to
inquiries by the Justice Department and the attorneys general
of Washington, D.C., Ohio and New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The department's Antitrust Division will close its
investigation now that Visa has rescinded its operating
regulation and adopted new regulations that should eliminate
any potential for competitive harm," the government said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About 70 percent of the signature debit cards in the United
States are Visa cards, and nearly all can be used with PINs.
Visa is the world's largest credit card network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Following this rule change, the decision on whether to
enable these transactions will be made by financial
institutions that issue Visa debit cards. Today, these issuers
have chosen to process approximately 80 percent of their debit
transactions over the Visa network," Visa said in its
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Diane Bartz; editing by John Wallace, Richard

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Animation giant Pixar scored its 
ninth consecutive No. 1 on Sunday with its robot love story 
"WALL-E," while Angelina Jolie achieved a personal best with 
her violent assassination thriller "Wanted."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "WALL-E," bolstered by near-unanimous critical praise, sold 
an estimated $62.5 million of tickets in its first three days, 
said Pixar's Walt Disney Co parent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It tied with 2001's "Monsters, Inc." to become Pixar's 
third-best opener. Pixar has gone to No. 1 with all nine of its 
movies, an unprecedented run that begin in 1995 with "Toy 
Story."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company record of $70.5 million was set in 2004 by "The 
Incredibles." Industry pundits had forecast an opening for 
"WALL-E" in the $50 million to $60 million range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Anything north of 60 (million dollars), we were going to 
be ecstatic," said Mark Zoradi, president of Walt Disney 
Studios Motion Picture Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile Jolie, whose career has been overshadowed in 
recent years by breathless tabloid coverage of her personal 
life, kicked off at No. 2 with "Wanted." The Universal Pictures 
release earned about $51.1 million, easily beating forecasts of 
an opening in the mid- to high-$30 million range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her previous record for a live-action movie was 2005's "Mr. 
 Mrs. Smith," which opened to $50 million. The General 
Electric Co-owned studio said "Wanted" ranks as the 
third-highest opening for an R-rated action film, behind "The 
Matrix Reloaded ($91.7 million) and "300" ($70.9 million).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SALES SOAR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "WALL-E" and "Wanted," clearly aimed at disparate 
audiences, helped pushed overall sales to their highest level 
of the year, said tracking firm Media By Numbers. The top 12 
films grossed $179 million, up 29 percent from last weekend, 
and up 20 percent from the year-ago period, when Pixar's 
"Ratatouille" opened at No. 1 with $47 million on its way to 
$206 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last weekend's champion, the Warner Bros spy comedy "Get 
Smart," slipped to No. 3 with $20 million, taking its 10-day 
haul to $77.3 million. The film, which stars Steve Carell as 
the inept hero Maxwell Smart, should finish up with about $130 
million, said the Time Warner Inc-owned studio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rounding out the top five, Pixar rival DreamWorks Animation 
SKG Inc's "Kung Fu Panda" slipped one to No. 4 with $11.7 
million, taking its total to $179.3 million. The film opened 
four weeks ago to $60.2 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marvel Entertainment Inc's "The Incredible Hulk" fell three 
to No. 5 with $9.2 million. The superhero adaptation has earned 
$115.5 million after three weeks, roughly on par with its 
unloved 2003 predecessor "The Hulk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "WALL-E," a space adventure mixing an unusual love story 
with somber messages about the future of Earth and humankind, 
was directed by Andrew Stanton, who won an Academy Award for 
Pixar's 2003 hit "Finding Nemo."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The title character, or Waste Allocation Load Lifter 
Earth-Class, is the last of a cadre of robots tasked with 
cleaning up piles of trash discarded by humans who abandoned 
the planet centuries before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The human race set off on a luxury space cruise during a 
planned five-year clean-up that lasts much longer and results 
in unfortunate changes in the human physique and psyche.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The arrival of a sleek girl robot named Eve, sent to Earth 
by the orbiting humans to look for plant life, sends Wall-E on 
an adventure that changes his own and humanity's destinies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Critics heaped praise on the film. According to Rotten 
Tomatoes, a Web site that collects reviews, an astonishing 96 
percent of critics liked the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune said on TV's "Ebert 
 Roeper" that it was perhaps "the best American studio picture 
of the year," but the Hollywood Reporter said "it might be too 
clever to connect with mainstream audiences."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's Zoradi said "WALL-E" was not a conventional 
cartoon, but the studio was "confident from the get-go" that it 
would work. He declined to reveal the film's budget, in line 
with Disney's policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "WALL-E" also opened at No. 1 in six small foreign markets, 
led by Brazil with $1.6 million, Zoradi said. It will reach 
Russia and Mexico next weekend, followed by the U.K. in 
mid-July, timed with the school holidays in each market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Wanted," a $74 million comic book adaptation directed by 
Kazakhstan-born filmmaker Timur Bekmambetov, stars Scottish 
actor James McAvoy ("The Last King of Scotland") as an office 
drone recruited to an elite order of assassins by Jolie and 
Morgan Freeman. Critics were also enthused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Dean Goodman and Gina Keating; Editing by

&lt;p&gt;MADRID (Reuters) - Oil producing countries need to remove barriers to investment to ensure global oil markets are well supplied, but they are unlikely to do so as long as prices remain high, Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) CEO said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rex Tillerson told Reuters the world's ability to meet oil demand hinged on political, rather than geological, uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If governments are unhappy with the current supply-demand balance, they can change it," he said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPEC President Chakib Khelil had earlier told the World Petroleum Congress, which is being attended by about 3,000 industry executives, that producers shared consumers' dissatisfaction with high oil prices, which hit a record above $143 per barrel on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPEC blames speculators, rather than a shortage of supply capacity for high oil prices, but on Monday the CEOs of Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L), Britain's BP Plc (BP.L) and Spain's Repsol YPF (REP.MC) blamed instead a dearth of new supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillerson said there was one way for states endowed with oil to ensure future supplies meet demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Allow your resources to be developed to meet the world's energy needs," the CEO of the world's largest publicly traded oil company by market capitalization urged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninety percent of global oil reserves are in countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, that restrict investment by international oil companies, Repsol CEO Antonio Brufau said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil companies have long sought more access to the rich fields of OPEC members without much success. A recent oil price surge has only increased pressure on OPEC to boost supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want them to allow our efficient oil companies to have a role to play in the oil production of the oil producing countries," British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said at an emergency oil summit between producers and consuming nations in Jeddah in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPENING UNLIKELY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillerson said producing countries that limit investment had little incentive to lift barriers when oil prices were high, even though the price rise was a clear market signal that such measures to boost supply were needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When the prices are high, the national governments ... don't see a need for an IOC (international oil company). They don't recognize the value an IOC brings," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillerson said while Saudi Arabia was working hard to boost spare capacity, more could be done in OPEC to boost output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted the oil cartel plans to invest $210 billion in oil production and refining in the coming five years while Exxon plans to invest $125 billion over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell is expected by analysts to invest even more than Exxon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillerson said every country had a reason for putting bars on investment by oil companies and that even the United States was guilty of unnecessary restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. barriers were largely environmental, he said, but he added public mood was moving toward allowing drilling in areas now off limits to oil majors due to environmental concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said outdated environmental attitudes were the reason for opposition to drilling in areas such as the eastern Gulf of Mexico and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're stuck in this emotional, environmental past ... Public sentiment in the United States seems to be shifting," he told Reuters. "The American people are kind of sick and tired of these prices."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillerson earlier told a news conference that Kazakhstan was holding up development of the giant Kashagan oil field through disputes with companies working on the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EXXON VALDEZ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillerson said he understood Alaskans were disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court overturning a $2.5 billion punitive award for the Exxon Valdez oil spill, but hoped the ruling would not mar the company's relationship with the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He does not expect another round of oil mega-mergers even though size is becoming increasingly important as oil majors focus on complex projects costing tens of billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a true benefit to scale in this environment we're in," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deals like Exxon's tie-up with Mobil and BP's takeover of Amoco in the late 1990s were now unlikely because European and U.S. regulatory rules would block them. "I'm not sure there's a lot of appetite to provide for consolidation," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillerson refused to predict where oil prices were heading but dismissed talk that oil prices would stay high, adding his experience of previous slumps influenced how he runs Exxon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I also remember the crash in oil prices in 1982/83 when we lost 400,000 people out of the industry in the United States. It was painful," he said solemnly. "I had to let a lot of those people go. And those things, you don't lose sight of them easily."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Rory Channing and Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has downgraded and withdrawn its ratings on three
classes of notes issued by Visage CDO I, Ltd. (Visage I). All the
classes on Rating Watch Negative are removed. The following rating
actions are effective immediately:

   -- $56,000,000 Class A to 'C/DR6' from 'CCC;

   -- $40,000,000 Class B to 'C/DR6' from 'CC;

   -- $20,000,000 Class C to 'C/DR6' from 'CC'.

   Visage I is a managed hybrid collateralized debt obligation (CDO)
that closed on July 28, 2006 and references a portfolio of mezzanine
and high-grade asset-backed securities (ABS) CDO tranches and
commercial real estate CDO tranches, with both funded and unfunded
liabilities. The portfolio is managed by TCW Investment Management
Company. Visage I and has entered into a total return swap (TRS) with
Credit Suisse International (CSI), the TRS counterparty, wherein CSI
makes total return payments to Visage I in exchange for credit
protection on the reference portfolio.

   These rating actions reflect an Event of Default (EOD) under
Condition 11 of the Notes on March 3, 2008 and proposed collateral
enforcement in accordance with Condition 12 of the Notes, as requested
by the TRS Counterparty in its capacity as the Controlling Class on
March 6, 2008. The EOD was declared because the Class A Par Value
Ratio was less than 100%. As of the May 8th post-enforcement
distribution, all proceeds have been realized and distributed. No
principal or interest due and payable on the rated notes were paid as
of the final distribution.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 1 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) may take $16
billion of provisions for credit losses in 2008, said Fox-Pitt
Kelton analyst David Trone, who also believes that any
additional acquisitions by the bank would be too risky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We see the ABS-CDO/subprime debacle yielding to a more
general weak credit cycle, and impending problems in consumer
and corporate are likely to hurt JP Morgan as much, if not
more, than peers," said Trone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He downgraded the stock of the third-largest U.S. bank to
"in line" from "outperform" and cut the earnings estimates by
65 cents to $2.25 a share for 2008 and by another 71 cents to
$3.29 a share for 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trone, who took over coverage of the bank from analyst
Andrew Marquardt, said he expects the bank's Tier 1 ratio -- a
measure of financial strength based on capital available
against perceived risk -- to fall to 7.2 percent by the
fourth-quarter of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In March, the U.S. Federal Reserve urged a well-capitalized
JPMorgan to acquire Bear Stearns Cos, at a fire sale price, to
keep the fifth-largest investment bank from going bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, analyst Trone believes that it was unlikely that
JP Morgan would get help from the government for further
acquisitions similar to its deal for Bear Stearns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe JP Morgan should hunker down and reserve its
relatively strong balance sheet to weather its own forthcoming
increase in credit costs," the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the bank represented an attractive collection of
strong franchises for the longer-term, provided it can escape
the pending credit downturn without too much damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trone cut the price target by $5 to $45 on the bank's
stock, which was trading down more than 3 percent at $32.74 in
afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;  REDMOND, WA, Jul 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
CoroWare Technologies, a wholly owned subsidiary of CoroWare, Inc.
(OTCBB: CROE), announced pricing and availability of CoroWare ClassPack
for Microsoft Robotics Studio (CoroWare ClassPack), a simulation software
package that complements its CoroBot mobile robot product line.

    Combined with CoroWare's CoroBot, ClassPack is an affordable and effective
robotics solution for teaching and research. By using the CoroWare
ClassPack services, students can write robotics applications that will run
both in simulation and on a real CoroBot. ClassPack features a classroom
environment which allows the robot to encounter common objects found in an
office or classroom. An easy-to-use control panel interface allows for
remote control of the CoroBot.

    "Simulation is the perfect tool for educators and researchers since they
can realistically model any environment without the pains and costs
involved with creating that environment," said Sara Morgan, CoroWare
Robotic Software Engineer, and author of "Programming Microsoft Robotics
Studio." "Students and researchers can experiment with a lower-cost
version of CoroBot in the simulation environment, and then run their
application on a real CoroBot in the classroom or lab."

    CoroWare plans to make CoroWare ClassPack generally available at the end

&lt;p&gt;Consumers and Merchants Tell Congress to Support the Credit Card
                             Fair Fee Act
IRVINE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Consumers and merchants alike will rally in Irvine on July 3rd,
Thursday morning at 7:30 - 9:00 am at the Chevron station at Jamboree
and Barranca Parkway to call for independence from Visa and
MasterCard's hidden credit card fees that add another 8-10 cents a
gallon on top of already skyrocketing gasoline prices.

   Consumers and merchants will also be rallying in favor of the
Credit Card Fair Fee Act which would end price-fixing by the credit
card industry and help cut interchange fees. This bill would allow
retailers to have a seat at the table to negotiate with the credit
card industry for the terms and rates of the fees.

   "Service station owners and consumers are paying record credit
card fees as Visa, MasterCard, and their member banks reap the
windfall from the 100% increase in the price of gasoline since 2007,"
said Mitch Goldstone, event organizer and editor of WayTooHigh.com -
The Credit Card Interchange Report. Goldstone is also president and
CEO of 30 Minute Photos Etc. and ScanMyPhotos.com.

   With $4-plus gasoline, gas customers typically shell out $2 or
more to the credit card industry every time they fill up. Goldstone
said, "Except for OPEC, nobody makes more money from skyrocketing
gasoline prices on American consumers than Visa and MasterCard member
banks - over $10 billion this year alone if gas prices stay above $4."

   "About two dollars of every $100 consumers spend in stores or
buying gasoline goes directly to the credit card industry in the form
of the interchange fee, the biggest credit card fee you've never heard
of. Interchange has skyrocketed in recent years. Interchange is a
hidden fee; the rates are set in secret by the credit card industry,"
said Goldstone.

   American businesses and consumers paid $42 billion in total
interchange fees just in 2007 on all goods and services, far more than
they paid in late fees, over-the-limit fees, annual fees, universal
default, double cycle billing, exchange fees, and inactivity fees
combined. Consumers not only pay more than they should through unfair
fees but also through inflated retail prices, especially on gasoline.

   The credit card industry has come under increased scrutiny from
the public, consumer groups, the Federal Reserve, and Congress in the
past three years for their unfair credit card practices, policies and
fees. Interchange fees have been the subject of hearings three times
in recent years under both the Republican and Democratic Congresses.
Large number of Democrats and Republicans favor the Credit Card Fair
Fee Act; it has bi-partisan support in both chambers of Congress.

&lt;p&gt;New LNG Supplies and Greater Energy Efficiency to Play Critical
               Roles in Meeting Global Energy Challenge
MADRID, Spain--(Business Wire)--
Joint ventures in Qatar in which Exxon Mobil Corporation
 (NYSE:XOM) participates will start up projects over the next two
years that will bring more liquefied natural gas to market than any
other international oil company, Rex Tillerson, chairman and chief
executive officer, said today.

   Speaking at the 19th World Petroleum Congress in Madrid, Mr.
Tillerson outlined the challenge of supplying growing energy needs
while minimizing the impact on the environment.

   "New energy technologies for energy supply, such as those enabling
an increase in world LNG supplies, together with technologies to
improve energy efficiency, will be critical in meeting the world's
energy challenge," Mr. Tillerson said.

   "On the supply side, technological breakthroughs in the production
and transportation of LNG -- such as ExxonMobil and Qatar Petroleum's
Q-Max technology enabling an 80 percent increase in LNG ship cargo
capacity -- are facilitating the development of a global market for
cleaner-burning natural gas.

   "Not only will a global LNG market help supply increasing energy
demand, it will also strengthen global energy security by helping to
diversify supplies. And because it is cleaner-burning than other
conventional sources, natural gas has important environmental
advantages as well.

   "Partnerships, such as the one between Qatar and ExxonMobil, are
making LNG's potential a reality," said Mr. Tillerson. "Technological
advances, pioneered with Qatar Petroleum and others, have enabled
ExxonMobil to achieve new economies of scale for development of the
North Field, the largest non-associated natural-gas field in the
world."

   Mr. Tillerson outlined a project led by ExxonMobil, Qatar Terminal
Limited and Edison -- the Adriatic LNG terminal -- which is a key
component of plans to bring new LNG supplies to market.

   Adriatic LNG will be the first offshore gravity-based
re-gasification terminal in the world, and will have the capacity to
provide 10 percent of Europe's LNG supply. Construction is nearing
completion and the terminal is scheduled to be moved to location in
the Adriatic Sea offshore Italy in August. In addition to projects in
Qatar and the Adriatic LNG project, ExxonMobil is also participating
in the development of a number of other LNG projects around the world.

   In his speech, Mr. Tillerson also outlined the role consumers of
energy have to play in meeting the energy challenge from the demand
side.

   "Energy efficiency extends the life of the world's resource
endowment, reduces greenhouse-gas emissions, helps drive down energy
prices -- and strengthens energy security," Mr. Tillerson said.

   "ExxonMobil has systematically worked to improve efficiency and
environmental performance throughout our facilities worldwide," he
said. "Since 2004, ExxonMobil has invested more than $1.5 billion in
activities that improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, and we will be spending at least half a billion dollars on
additional initiatives over the next few years."

   In addition, ExxonMobil is partnering with engine and vehicle
manufacturers to develop a number of transportation technologies that
can improve fuel economy and reduce emissions -- from lightweight
plastics, to materials that make tires lighter and keep them properly
inflated, to more efficient synthetic motor oils, to lithium-ion
battery improvements for hybrid and electric vehicles.

   "International partnerships are essential to fostering
technologies that increase supplies, strengthen security and reduce
environmental impacts," said Mr. Tillerson. "We must approach this
challenge by advancing technologies to increase supplies, while using
energy more efficiently. No single source can meet the world's growing
energy needs -- and no single segment of our industry can either.

   "Such partnerships are forged through the free flow of goods,
services, capital and expertise across borders. Free trade and
investment propel the energy-innovation cycle forward, bringing the
best minds and the latest tools to bear on the toughest challenges."

wrong," analyst Kenneth Worthington said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A business that was stabilizing post risk management

lack of investor confidence evidenced by the onerous terms MF

&lt;p&gt;DiCentral's Integrated EDI Solutions Enriched by Addition of DiIntegrator for Microsoft Dynamics(TM) GP

   New product developed for seamless integration into MS Dynamics GP
allows for an end-to-end solution
HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
DiCentral Corporation, the first true SaaS model for EDI and B2B
e-commerce, has again added to its DiIntegrator suite of proprietary
solutions with the development of a built-in API (Application Program
Interface) for seamless integration into MS Dynamics GP. Now large
volumes of Purchase Orders and Invoices can be directly imported into
and exported out of GP in a matter of minutes. In addition to tight
integration, DiIntegrator provides process management capabilities
such as Advance Ship Notice and Transportation Management System
solutions.

   DiIntegrator is a pre-built EDI solution installed locally but
managed by DiCentral's SaaS internet infrastructure. There is no need
for foreign "middleware" to be utilized which simplifies ongoing
management and provides simpler customer service options. DiCentral's
model allows the user to concentrate on their business and still have
precise, fast, and powerful EDI software that leverages their
investment in MS Dynamics GP through its integration of financial

software and additional staff. DiCentral's unique SaaS business model
simplifies implementation, lowers total cost of ownership, and reduces
staffing levels needed in typical integrated EDI installations.

&lt;p&gt;Media Alert: Check Point Provides Protection Against Microsoft Windows Safari Browser Vulnerability

        VPN-1, IPS-1, Connectra, and InterSpect gateways defend
     enterprises against broad remote code execution vulnerability
REDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Check Point(R) Software Technologies Ltd. (Nasdaq:CHKP), the
worldwide leader in securing the Internet, today announced that users
of its VPN-1, IPS-1, Connectra, and InterSpect products are protected
against a potentially dangerous remote code execution vulnerability in
Microsoft Windows.

   Check Point customers who subscribe to Check Point SmartDefense
Services - which provide ongoing and real-time updates and
configuration advisories for defenses and security policies - received
protection for the broader DLL-load Hijacking vulnerability on June
2nd. These customers are protected not only from the Safari instance
of DLL-load Hijacking, but from other exploits that may try to utilize
a similar vulnerability approach.

   "Windows platform vulnerabilities, which often go unpatched for
days, weeks or even months, continue to be one of the top security
challenges facing enterprise network environments today," said Oded
Gonda, vice president of network security products at Check Point.
"Check Point customers, however, through our SmartDefense Services, do
not have to rely on patches to be issued by vendors or deployed to all
machines to have the protection against these vulnerabilities."

   Check Point's SmartDefense Services maintain the most current
preemptive security for the Check Point security infrastructure. To
help defenses stay continuously ahead of today's constantly evolving
threat landscape, SmartDefense Services provide ongoing and real-time
updates and configuration advisories for defenses and security
policies.

   Announced in Microsoft Security Advisory 953818 on May 30, this
vulnerability affects users of Windows XP and Windows Vista when
Apple's Safari for Windows has been installed. The vulnerability is
due to the combination of the default download location of dynamic
link libraries (DLLs) and how the Windows desktop handles these
executables. The result is a blended threat in which files may be
downloaded to a machine without prompting, allowing them to be
executed. Apple issued a patch on June 19th for the Safari-specific
vulnerability.

   More information about this vulnerability can be found at Check
Point Software's SmartDefense Services website at:
www.checkpoint.com/defense/advisories/public/2008/cpai-02-Jun.html

&lt;p&gt;July 1 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs cut NYSE Euronext Inc's
NYX.N price target about 10 percent and removed it from the
brokerage's America's Conviction Buy list, saying investor
sentiment on global exchanges has declined over the past few
months and there is no near-term catalyst for the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, which maintained a "buy" rating on the
stock, cut the price target to $74 from $82.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock, which has lost 27 percent of its market value
since early April, may continue to fall in the next four weeks
on lower U.S. volumes and market share and increasing
competition from Europe, analyst Daniel Harris said in a note
to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ongoing weakness in equity issuance and global equity
markets will also weigh on the stock, Harris said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the analyst said the company is among the best
positioned firms in the market structure group to deliver
growth over the next few years, to some extent regardless of
industry volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of NYSE Euronext fell about 2 percent to $49.50 in
trading before the bell. They closed at $50.66 on Monday on the
New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;DALLAS--(Business Wire)--
SoftLayer extends its solution set to include virtualization with
the release of Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V. Hyper-V is a
next-generation virtualization hypervisor that allows a single
physical server to be separated into multiple virtual machines that
can run independent operating systems - Windows, Linux and others. As
with all SoftLayer services, Hyper-V can be ordered through the
customer portal and provisioned automatically along with a server's
operating system or systems.

   "Deploying Hyper-V is the first step in an extensive
virtualization strategy that we are rolling out over the coming
months," stated George Karidis, Chief Strategy Officer. "The
opportunities and advantages of virtualization are radically impacting
the way we envision SoftLayer's future and our fundamental approach to
server and data center architecture."

   A hypervisor such as Hyper-V creates a level of software in
between the physical "bare-metal" hardware and any operating system.
The hypervisor then assigns and manages the hardware's resources to
create and run distinct virtual machines. Each virtual machine can run
a different operating system, or even its own instance of the same
operating system. This presents incredible advantages, including:

   --  increased server utilization rates and decreased
        infrastructure costs by pooling server resources rather than
        managing individual servers

   --  reduced provisioning times by allowing individual machines to
        be removed for maintenance without interrupting application
        use

   --  decreased environmental impact, by delivering the productivity
        of multiple machines within only a single machine's power,
        cooling and floor space requirements

   --  fewer application and OS incompatibilities, as each virtual
        machine runs independently from others on the same physical
        hardware

   About SoftLayer Technologies

   Headquartered in Plano, Texas, SoftLayer delivers next-generation
web hosting and on-demand data center services on a global basis from
facilities located in Dallas, TX; Seattle, WA; and Washington, DC.
Utilizing proprietary management tools coupled with the industry's
first network-within-a-network topology, the company delivers
unprecedented power and control to securely manage IT environments
while providing unparalleled scalability. For more information please

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - British recruitment company Robert Walters (RWA.L) is looking to increase its employees in Japan by about 70 percent over the next two-and-a-half years as it taps demand for financial specialists and aims to land more local clients in a country where job mobility is on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin Gibson, managing director of Robert Walters' Japan operations, told the Reuters Japan Investment Summit in Tokyo that its number of recruiters and other staff could climb to 250 by the end of 2009 and 300 by 2010 from about 175 now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His bullish stance on hiring comes even as some of its core investment banking clients continue shedding staff in the wake of the subprime crisis and with the world's second-largest economy susceptible to a slowdown in global growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Walters, whose rivals include Michael Page International Plc (MPI.L) and Hays Plc (HAYS.L), places a lot of back-office positions at western investment banks -- jobs that are comparatively immune to swings in the financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also plans to grow by serving more Japanese clients and sees opportunities in demographic trends. Retired baby boomers, for example, could be brought back to the workplace in increasing number to help fill a shortage in the talent pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a huge market and there are a number of areas which we haven't fully exploited yet," Gibson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that while the tradition of the "salaryman" with a job for life does not apply to younger workers in Japan, lingering resistance to job-hopping means each move requires more work and -- higher fees -- than Robert Walters sees elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The end of the salaryman era is a very old story but we actually see that day in and day out. And we see the propensity to move from job to job within the younger generation just as high as Singapore and Hong Kong now," Gibson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Walters does not provide a breakdown for earnings in Japan, but Asia Pacific is now the firm's largest market, generating 40 percent of the group's net fee income of 128.9 million pounds ($257.5 million) in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gibson said positions in demand in Japan include credit risk analysts and specialists able to help companies comply with JSOX, the Japanese version of the Sarbanes-Oxley corporate reform law implemented in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He predicted that investment banks would be cautious about making any mass job cuts in Japan because such a move could tarnish their reputation and make it more difficult to hire good people again when market conditions rebound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People have very long memories in Japan," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it could take until the end of the year until investment banks have enough confidence in market conditions to start recruiting in full force, he added. "There are a lot of people still sort of sitting on their hands waiting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(US$=1.9972 pounds)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) plans to cut the price of its best-selling Xbox 360 Pro model by $50, to $299 in the next few weeks, the Hollywood Reporter reported citing anonymous sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The price cut for the Xbox 360 model with the 20 gigabyte hard drive will come before the video game industry's biggest trade show, E3, taking place in Los Angeles on July 15-17, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rumors of the Xbox price cut swirled on popular gaming blogs Joystiq and Kotaku last week. The two sites received snapshots of Kmart and Radio Shack flyers advertising the $299 price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft spokeswoman declined to comment on the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft last cut the price of the Xbox Pro in August, from $399 to $349, prior to the release of "Halo 3" the following month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cut to $299 would make the Xbox 360 Pro $100 less than one of the console's major rivals, Sony Corp's (6758.T) PlayStation 3 with a 40 gigabyte hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is locked in a three-way competition with Nintendo's 7974.OS Wii and the PlayStation 3, which comes with a high-definition Blu-ray video player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jennifer Martinez; Editing by Daisuke Wakabayashi and Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details from statement, background on complaint)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 2 (Reuters) - International Business
Machines Corp (IBM.N) said on Wednesday it has bought privately
held software maker Platform Solutions Inc and the two
companies have dropped their legal complaints against each
other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No financial terms were disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In December 2006, IBM sued Platform Solutions charging that
the company, which makes software that can run on IBM's
high-end mainframe computers, violated patents IBM holds on
some of its operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In January 2007, Platform Solutions counter-sued, alleging
IBM engaged in unfair competition. Platform Solutions also
denied it had violated IBM's patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Later that year, Platform Solutions also filed a complaint
with the European Commission, alleging that IBM violated an EC
prohibition on abuse of market dominance by refusing to supply
interface information relating to mainframe computers and
refusing to license third parties. IBM responded by saying it
would be bringing Platform Solutions' alleged intellectual
property violations to the EC's attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, IBM said it had acquired the company,
headquartered in Sunnyvale, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As part of this acquisition, both IBM and PSI dropped
their respective claims against each other," IBM said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Platform Solutions will become part of the IBM Systems and
Technology Group, IBM said.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has had no new negotiations on deals involving Yahoo Inc, but preliminary talks with media companies continue, a source familiar with the software giant's thinking said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The media companies have included Time Warner Inc, which owns AOL, and News Corp, parent of MySpace, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Yahoo jumped as much as 9 percent earlier in the day, after the Wall Street Journal reported that Microsoft, positioning for a new run for Yahoo's search business, had in recent days approached media companies to join together on a deal that would effectively lead to Yahoo's breakup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the Reuters source and a CNBC report, citing unnamed sources, later said there were no new talks or negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Journal also reported Microsoft had met with activist investor Carl Icahn in recent days to encourage him to press his proxy battle for control of Yahoo's board, the first sign Microsoft welcomed his month-old campaign. This development also was attributed to unnamed sources familiar with the talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn was not available to comment on the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, Yahoo, Time Warner and News Corp all declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REVIVING HOPE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street analysts said the latest news revived flagging hopes among some investors that Microsoft was still interested in doing a deal with Yahoo. "The hopes that Microsoft would come back were getting crushed over the last 10 trading days," Collins Stewart analyst Sandeep Aggarwal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo stock ended the day up 3.4 percent at $20.88. The stock had traded as low as $19.58 on Tuesday, near its level in late January before Microsoft made its unsolicited takeover bid for Yahoo, sending the stock above $30 in mid-February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares fell 3.7 percent to $25.88 on Wednesday. In the prior day's trading, Microsoft fell to two-year lows of $23.19, intraday, before recovering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyst Youssef Squali of Jefferies  Co said the sharp Yahoo stock reaction was most likely a defensive move by short-sellers seeking to cover bets a Microsoft deal was off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even the rumor that Microsoft is getting interested again is enough to have people to want to cover their bets against Yahoo stock," Squali said, adding that many investors have shorted Yahoo from the high $20s all the way down below $20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Options investors placed fresh bets that Yahoo would be trading up to $27.50 by October, analyst Rebecca Engmann Darst of Interactive Brokers Group said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE WAITING GAME&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several financial analysts said a key detail in the Journal report was that Microsoft and Yahoo executives had sought to revisit the merger on May 17 -- two weeks after Microsoft walked away -- and that two Yahoo board members in the meeting had said they would settle for a merger worth $33-$34 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 3, Yahoo rejected a $33-a-share Microsoft offer worth $47.5 billion, and earlier this week questioned whether the software maker was ever serious about a full-scale merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source familiar with Microsoft's thinking confirmed that Yahoo had belatedly sought a deal in mid-May worth $33 to $34, but that Microsoft was no longer interested at that point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source said Microsoft executives considered the early May deadline as vital to winning regulatory approval before the end of the year -- when a new presidential administration arrives and months more delays would likely occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had also become convinced that Yahoo executives were passively resisting the deal and unwilling to seriously negotiate. Meanwhile, the economy has taken a toll on the online advertising market, and with it the value of buying Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is going to let Icahn do the dirty work and hand Yahoo over to them," Jefferies  Co's Squali said, adding that it was in Microsoft's interest to hang back and let Yahoo shares settle lower as investors quit betting on a takeover premium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the long run, however, Microsoft needs Yahoo more than Yahoo needs Microsoft, he argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft has a gaping hole in its strategy and it's called the Internet and it's only getting worse because Google is encroaching on Microsoft's business," Squali said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, the U.S. Justice Department is pursuing a formal antitrust investigation into a deal reached last month between Yahoo and Microsoft-archrival Google Inc to team up on Web search advertising, delaying implementation of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google, with more than 60 percent of the Web search market, and Yahoo, with 16.6 percent, agreed to a deal for Google to run search ads on Yahoo's site in a partnership that could mean $250 million to $450 million in new cash flow for Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google said it was confident the deal would enhance overall industry competition, but declined to discuss the probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Ajay Kamalakaran in Bangalore, Franklin Paul in New York and Doris Frankel in Chicago; Editing by Derek Caney, Leslie Gevirtz, Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  MONTREAL, QUEBEC, Jul 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Paladin Labs Inc. (TSX: PLB) and Procter &amp; Gamble (P) Pharmaceuticals
Canada, Inc., today announced that the companies have entered into a
Canadian Co-Promotion Agreement for SEASONALE(TM) - the first and only
extended-cycle oral contraceptive available in Canada. With
SEASONALE(TM), Canadian women have an oral contraceptive option that will
allow them to have just four periods per year.

    SEASONALE(TM) (levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol 0.15mg/0.03 mg
tablets) is an effective new contraceptive option for Canadian women,
striking a balance between the benefits of having fewer periods with the
reassurance of still having some periods.

    Under this Co-Promotion Agreement, Paladin will maintain regulatory and
supply responsibilities for SEASONALE(TM) and will continue to support
SEASONALE(TM) using its national specialty sales force. P
Pharmaceuticals Canada will provide marketing, promotion, trade
distribution and will deploy a national sales force in support of
SEASONALE(TM).

    "P is the world's largest consumer product company and offers the
pharmaceutical expertise and proven alliance management capabilities that
made it our preferred partner for helping to grow SEASONALE(TM) in
Canada" said Jonathan Ross Goodman, President and Chief Executive Officer
of Paladin Labs Inc.

    "We are pleased to partner with Paladin and share their passion to make a
positive impact in the lives of patients," said Andy McClenaghan, General
Manager, P Pharmaceuticals Canada. "At P, we have a deep consumer
understanding and a long history of successful women's health products.
We understand that many women want to manage their periods and
SEASONALE(TM) is an exciting new option for Canadian women that will help
meet this need."

    SEASONALE(TM) is suitable for anyone who can safely and effectively take
oral contraceptives, but may appeal most to women with busy, active lives
who would prefer not to deal with the inconvenience of a monthly period.
Women who suffer from period-related symptoms such as cramping, heavy
bleeding and headaches may also find SEASONALE(TM) to be an attractive
contraceptive option.

    Paladin acquired the Canadian license to SEASONALE(TM) from Duramed
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a subsidiary of Barr Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSE:
BRL), in September 2005. At that time, Paladin filed on behalf of Duramed
the New Drug Submission (NDS) for SEASONALE(TM) with the Therapeutic
Products Directorate (TPD) of Health Canada. SEASONALE(TM) received TPD
approval in July 2007 and was subsequently launched by Paladin in January
2008.

    About SEASONALE(TM)

    SEASONALE(TM) is an extended-cycle oral contraceptive designed to reduce
the number of periods from 13 to 4 per year. SEASONALE(TM) is a 91-day
regimen taken daily as 84 active tablets followed by seven inactive
tablets, during which time a woman would have her period. By contrast,
oral contraceptive products currently on the market are based on a 28-day
regimen, with 21 active pills and seven inactive tablets.

    SEASONALE(TM) has been used by over half a million women in the U.S.
since its approval in 2003, and studies have shown no increased health
risks with the medication compared to traditional birth control pills.

    Clinical Data

    The clinical data supporting Health Canada's approval of SEASONALE(TM)
tablets resulted from a randomized, open-label, multi-centre trial that
ended in March 2002. The trial involved 1,400 patients between the ages
of 18 to 40 at 47 sites across the U.S. An extension trial with 300
patients was performed for an additional two years.

    In the trials, SEASONALE(TM) was found to have a comparable safety and
efficacy profile to traditional oral contraceptives. The most common
adverse events were nasopharyngitis, headache and intermenstrual bleeding
or spotting.

    Oral contraceptives are one of the most widely researched drugs
prescribed by physicians and have been studied for over 40 years.
SEASONALE(TM) has been formulated using well-established ingredients,
long recognized as safe and effective and extensively used in 28-day
regimens.

&lt;p&gt;ARYx Therapeutics, Inc. Announces Procter &amp; Gamble Exercises Option to End Collaboration on ATI-7505

                       Company Seeks New Partner
FREMONT, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
ARYx Therapeutics, Inc., (NASDAQ:ARYX), a biopharmaceutical
company, today announced that Procter &amp; Gamble Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(P) has utilized a one-time thirty day cancellation option linked to
the completion of a Thorough QT (TQT) study to end the collaboration
agreement between the companies covering the late-stage development
and commercialization of ATI-7505, a prokinetic agent in Phase 2
clinical trials for chronic constipation and functional dyspepsia. The
results of the TQT study are contained in an accompanying press
release.

   "We are surprised P would cancel our collaboration after
receiving the results of the TQT study given that we achieved a
successful result at the study's primary endpoint, and are
disappointed in their decision to return the rights to ATI-7505 to us.
We have been informed by P their decision is based on their view of
certain commercial and technical criteria, and that the program no
longer fits into their future plans. This decision by P does not in
any way diminish our confidence in ATI-7505, and we believe the
results from the TQT study, along with continued positive clinical and
preclinical data, will allow moving ATI-7505 into late-stage
development once the program is in the hands of a new partner," said
Dr. Paul Goddard, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of ARYx
Therapeutics.

   Under the terms of the collaboration agreement between P and
ARYx Therapeutics, the results from the just-completed TQT study
qualified ARYx for the Tier 1, or highest, milestone payment from P
The collaboration agreement provides P a thirty-day option period
from the lock of the database for the TQT study to cancel the
collaboration or agree to pay ARYx the milestone payment provided for
under our collaboration agreement. P has exercised their option to
cancel the agreement effective immediately. However, P has also been
very supportive in agreeing to a transition plan for handing the
program back to ARYx to allow it to pursue an optimal partnering
package.

   As part of the transition plan, the on-going Phase 2 studies in
chronic constipation and functional dyspepsia will be terminated in an
orderly method. No new patients will be enrolled and those currently
on therapy will be withdrawn from the studies over the coming weeks.
This will allow ARYx to continue to focus its resources on the
on-going trials on ATI-5923 and ATI-2042.

   Conference Call and Webcast Information

   A conference call and simultaneous webcast to discuss these
results and accompanying events will be held today, July 2, 2008, at
2:30pm Pacific Time. The webcast will be available live via the
internet by accessing the ARYx website at www.aryx.com or through
Thomson at www.earnings.com. Alternatively, the call can be accessed
by dialing 866-700-5192. Participants outside of the U.S. should dial
617-213-8833. The passcode for the call is 32052837. Replays of the
call will be available until July 16, 2008 at the Company's website or
by dialing 888-286-8010 or 617-801-6888 (international), passcode
49969932.

   About ARYx Therapeutics, Inc.

   ARYx Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company focused on
developing a portfolio of internally discovered products designed to
eliminate known safety issues associated with well-established,
commercially successful drugs. ARYx uses its RetroMetabolic Drug
Design(TM) technology to design structurally unique molecules that
retain the efficacy of these original drugs but are metabolized
through a potentially safer pathway to avoid specific adverse side
effects associated with these compounds. ARYx currently has four
products in clinical trials: an oral anticoagulant agent for patients
at risk for the formation of dangerous blood clots, ATI-5923; an oral
anti-arrhythmic agent for the treatment of atrial fibrillation,
ATI-2042; a prokinetic agent for the treatment of various
gastrointestinal disorders, ATI-7505; and, an agent for the treatment
of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders, ATI-9242. Please
visit our web site at www.aryx.com for additional information.

   About ATI-7505

   ATI-7505 is our product designed to normalize upper and lower
gastrointestinal motility to treat various GI disorders. A potent
agonist of 5-HT4 receptors which exist throughout the GI tract
regulating gastric emptying and the motility of food through the
intestines, ATI-7505 is engineered to maintain the efficacy of
cisapride, a drug that reached peak sales of $1.0 billion a year prior
to being withdrawn from the market in 2000 due to life-threatening
cardiac toxicities. However, unlike cisapride, ATI-7505 is not
dependent upon a rate-limiting cytochrome P450 enzyme in the liver for
metabolism and therefore avoids the build-up of drug levels associated
with cisapride's toxicities. In addition, ATI-7505 is more selective
than cisapride having minimal activity on the hERG channel in the
heart and virtually no activity at the 5-HT3 or other serotonergic
receptors. To date, over 600 patients have been treated with ATI-7505
and intensely monitored for cardiac effects with no cardiac QT
prolongation seen.

   Forward-looking Statements

   This press release contains forward-looking statements, including,
without limitation, statements related to the timing and availability
of our clinical results, the initiation of new clinical trials, the
completion of preclinical work, the ability of preclinical packages to
lead to further clinical trials, the ability to find partners to help
advance our product candidates through clinical development. Words
such as "expect," "will," "believes" and similar expressions are
intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking
statements are based upon the company's current expectations.
Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. The
company's actual results and the timing of events could differ
materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements
as a result of these risks and uncertainties, which include, without
limitation, the risk that collaborative arrangements will likely place
the development of our product candidates outside of our control, the
risk that we may have to alter our development and commercialization
plans if collaborative relationships are not established for ATI-7505,
ATI-5923 and ATI-2042, the risk that our product candidates may not
demonstrate safety and efficacy or lead to regulatory approval, the
risk that we may be unable to raise additional capital when needed
which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate product development
programs, the risk that any failure or delay in commencing or
completing clinical trials for our product candidates could severely
harm our business, and the risk that third party manufacturers could
delay or prevent the clinical development of our product candidates.
These and other risk factors are discussed under "Risk Factors" and
elsewhere in the company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended March 31, 2008. The company expressly disclaims any
obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions
to any forward-looking statements contained herein.

&lt;p&gt;Zacks #1 Rank Top Performers: FTI Consulting, Alpha Natural Resources, Walter Industries, Fuel Systems Solutions and Petrobras

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the latest list of top performing Zacks #1
Rank ("strong buy") stocks. The stocks on the prestigious list with
the highest returns last week were FTI Consulting, Inc. (NYSE: FCN),
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. (NYSE: ANR), Walter Industries, Inc.
(NYSE: WLT), Fuel Systems Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ: FSYS) and Petrobras
(NYSE: PBR). Each of these stocks easily outperformed the S 500.

   Stocks ranked #1 (Strong Buy) by Zacks have produced an average
annual return of +32% since inception in 1988. During the 2000-2002
bear market, Zacks #1 Rank stocks gained 43.8% while the S 500
tumbled 37.6%. To learn more about the Zacks Rank, go to
http://at.zacks.com/?id=3172.

   Here is a synopsis of the last week's best performing Zacks #1
Rank stocks.

   Shares of FTI Consulting, Inc. (NYSE: FCN) gained 9.3% last week,
which was enough to put the consulting services firm on the Zacks #1
Rank Top Performers List. Earnings estimates for this year are up
approximately 4.9% over the past two months. In addition, next year's
earnings per share are currently expected to be about 23% better than
this year's. Over the past four quarters, FCN has put together an
average surprise of more than 14%.

   Last month, FCN announced its plan to acquire Attenex Corporation
for about $88 million in cash. Attenex, which had revenue of about $25
million last year, is an eDiscovery software provider. According to
FCN, this acquisition extends the range of its proprietary software
technologies, enhances its position in the corporate market for
eDiscovery products and services, and enhances the contribution of its
scalable software licensing and processing revenues.

   Many analysts expect coal prices to continue rising this year and
beyond, which is good news for Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. (NYSE:
ANR) and other coal producers. Shares of this company advanced 8.5%
for the week ended Jun 27. The last two months have seen analysts
boost this year's earnings estimates by as much as 55%. Underscoring
the lofty expectations for coal prices moving forward, analysts
currently anticipate next year's earnings per share to be more than
300% better than this year's.

   In its first quarter, ANR earned 39 cents per share, which beat
the consensus by almost 130% while trouncing the year-ago result. Coal
sales advanced 17% year over year to $445.7 million. The company said
it achieved the highest quarterly price realization in its history,
thanks to rising metallurgical coal exports and price levels.

   Walter Industries, Inc. (NYSE: WLT) is another company getting a
boost from rising coal prices. Over the past 30 days, earnings
estimates for this year have risen by more than 12%. The past two
months have seen a gain of about 19%. Furthermore, analysts expect
next year's earnings per share to be about 138% better than this
year's.

   WLT, which will be added to the Russell 1000, made the Zacks #1
Rank Top Performers List last week with a gain of 8.1%.

   Fuel Systems Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ: FSYS) is enjoying strong
demand for its products that allow internal combustion engines to
operate on natural gas. Shares gained 6.6% during a tough environment
last week. Earnings estimates for this year are up 33% over the past
two months, including a gain of 2.3% in the past seven trading days.
Expectations for next year have also improved in those timeframes.

   In May, the company announced strong first-quarter results,
including earnings per share of 40 cents on revenues of $94.6 million.
The earnings result topped the consensus by as much as 150% while
revenues increased from $54.8 million a year earlier. Due to favorable
market trends, Fuel Systems Solutions raised its full year 2008
revenue guidance to $320 million.

   Petrobras (NYSE: PBR) is an oil company based in Brazil, which are
both attractive factors given high oil prices and that country's
growing economy. The company is getting a lot of attention from the
Street due to its future potential. (In fact, over the weekend
Barron's stated that PBR could become one of the world's top three oil
companies with potential for a 25% gain in price this year.) Analysts
have boosted earnings estimates for this year by 21% over the past two
months, and 7.3% in the past 30 days.

   PBR made the Zacks #1 Rank Top Performers List for the week ended
Jun 27 with a gain of 6.1%. The company also received an upgrade from
a major brokerage firm last Friday.

   About the Zacks Rank

   Since 1988, the Zacks Rank has proven that "Earnings estimate
revisions are the most powerful force impacting stock prices." Since
inception in 1988, #1 Rank stocks have generated an average annual
return of +32%. During the 2000-2002 bear market, Zacks #1 Rank stocks
gained +43.8%, while the S 500 tumbled -37.6%. Also note that the
Zacks Rank system has just as many Strong Sell recommendations (Rank
#5) as Strong Buy recommendations (Rank #1). Since 1988, Zacks Rank #5
stocks have underperformed the S 500 by 129% annually (+5 % vs.
+12%). Thus, the Zacks Rank system allows investors to truly manage
portfolio trading effectively.

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Hosts Brokering Change: A Wall Street Multicultural Women's Exchange Conference

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) hosted its Brokering
Change: A Wall Street Multicultural Women's Exchange conference last
week. The conference aimed to enhance the professional experience of
multicultural women by focusing on key issues related to their
commercial and professional development, while providing a platform to
facilitate relationship building and networking across the industry.

   The conference kicked-off with welcome remarks by Edith Cooper,
Goldman Sachs Managing Director and Head of Human Capital Management,
and a keynote address by Abby Joseph Cohen, President of Global
Markets Institute and Senior Investment Strategist at Goldman Sachs,
followed by various interactive breakout sessions covering topics from
emerging economies to career development. "Perspectives from the Top,"
was the closing panel discussion led by multicultural Wall Street
trailblazers, who gave their opinions, outlooks and experiences in the
business. At the evening reception, attendees had an opportunity to
network with other women from across the industry.

   In November 2007, Goldman Sachs' Office of Global Leadership and
Diversity (GLD) launched its inaugural Brokering Change event by
hosting a two-hour workshop. The event provided an opportunity for
multicultural women across financial services to discuss key issues
related to their commercial and professional development as well as to
bring a forum for multicultural women to network across the industry.
Due to the positive feedback from the first event, the firm held its
second workshop in February 2008 and decided to expand the two-hour
workshop series to a half-day conference. The conference drew close to
300 attendees from various investment banks and financial
institutions.

   Feedback from the speakers and participants has been
extraordinarily positive. Dr. Ella Bell an Associate Professor of
Business Administration at Tuck School of Business and President of
conference collaborating partner ASCENT, Leading Multicultural Women
to the Top said, "The conference says a lot about the firm. Goldman
Sachs walks the talk."

   "Brokering Change - A Wall Street Multicultural Women's Exchange -
was a powerful and dynamic educational forum that specifically
afforded multicultural women from the private, public and non-profit
sectors the opportunity to network, dialogue and learn from each other
and from industry leaders. The broad array of sessions and
presentations covered many practical aspects of career development
including professional networking and entrepreneurship skill
development," said Jyoti Chopra, Managing Director, Merrill Lynch
Banks U.S., Global Wealth Management.

   Jessica Faye Carter, CEO of WomenSuite and author of Double
Outsiders, said, "This event was groundbreaking as one of the first
corporate conferences for professional multicultural women. It
provided a rare opportunity for women of all backgrounds to discuss
the challenges that exist on Wall Street as well as critical success
factors."

   "It was remarkable to share a room today with so many dynamic
professional women. You could literally hear the excitement in
people's voices, see the enthusiasm in people's expressions and feel
the growing undercurrent of energy building up. I can't wait until
next year," said Darys Estrella Mordan, CEO of Bolsa de Varlores de la
Republica Dominicana, S.A. (BVRD).

   Goldman Sachs' goal for its Brokering Change program as well as
its other diversity initiatives is an ongoing effort to meet the needs
of its unique diverse workforce by focusing and supporting the career
advancement, representation and workplace experience of the growing
population of multicultural people at the firm. To be the best firm,
Goldman Sachs must have the best people, and the best people are drawn
from the broadest pool of backgrounds. The people that come to Goldman
Sachs can only be found by looking across the full spectrum of gender,
ethnicity, national origin, age, sexual orientation, gender identity,
religion, culture and level of physical ability.

   "The firm is very proud of our Multicultural Women's Exchange
initiative as well as our other diversity programs and affinity
networks," said Edith Cooper. "Our business is global and we operate
in an industry that demands constant innovation. Our clients rely upon
us to deliver unique solutions. We can only do this by having people
of diverse cultures, experiences and viewpoints. Establishing a
process to meet the needs of the growing population of multicultural
women supports our commitment to the business and our clients."

&lt;p&gt;  ZURICH, SWITZERLAND, Jul 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Using a Blue Gene supercomputer, scientists of the Swiss Federal
Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH) and the IBM (NYSE: IBM) Zurich
Research Laboratory demonstrated the most extensive simulation yet of
real human bone structures, providing doctors a "high definition" view of
the strength and fragility of bones they never had before. This
achievement could lead to better clinical tools to improve the diagnosis
and treatment of osteoporosis, a widespread disease that affects 1 in 3
women and 1 in 5 men over the age of 50.(1)

    The early detection of osteoporosis is crucial in order to prevent its
progress. This breakthrough simulation could greatly enhance a clinician's
ability to better treat fractures and analyze and detect osteoporotic
fragility, in order to take preventative measures before osteoporosis
advances in patients.

    Osteoporosis is the most widespread bone disease worldwide, affecting 75
million people in the US, Europe and Japan alone, and causing health costs
second only to those associated with cardiovascular diseases. Literally
"porous bone," this disease is characterized by loss of bone density,
resulting in a high risk of fractures, and is a major cause of pain,
disability and death in older persons.(2) Unfortunately, in many cases,
osteoporosis is not diagnosed until a fracture has occurred, but by then
the disease is already in an advanced stage, requiring implants or
surgical plates to treat or prevent further fractures.

    Today, osteoporosis is diagnosed by measuring bone mass and density using
specialized X-ray or computer tomography techniques -- a highly empirical
process. Studies have shown, however, that bone mass measurements are only
a moderately accurate way to determine the strength of the bone because
bones are not solid structures. Inside the compact outer shell, bones have
a sponge-like center. This complex microstructure accounts for the bone's
capability to bear loads and therefore represents a better indicator of a
bone's true strength.

    Aiming for an accurate, powerful and fast method to automate the analysis
of bone strength, scientists of the Departments of Mechanical and Process
Engineering and Computer Science at ETH Zurich teamed up with
supercomputing experts of IBM's Zurich Research Laboratory. The
breakthrough method they developed combines density measurements with a
large-scale mechanical analysis of the inner-bone microstructure.

    Using large-scale, massively parallel simulations, the researchers were
able to obtain a dynamic "heat map" of strain, which changes with the load
applied to the bone. This map shows the clinician exactly where and under
what load a bone is likely to fracture.

    "Knowing when and where a bone is likely to fracture, a clinician can also
detect osteoporotic damage more precisely and, by adjusting a surgical
plate appropriately, can determine its optimal location," explains Dr.
Costas Bekas of IBM's Computational Sciences team in Zurich. "This work is
an excellent example of the dramatic potential that supercomputers can
have for our everyday lives."

    Utilizing the massively large-scale capabilities of the 8-rack Blue Gene
/L supercomputer, the research team was able to conduct the first
simulations on a 5 by 5 mm specimen of real bone. In just 20 minutes of
computing time, the supercomputer simulation generated 90 Gigabytes of
output data.

    "It is this combination of increased speed and size that will allow
solving clinically relevant cases in acceptable time and unprecedented
detail," says Professor Ralph Mueller, the director of the Institute for
Biomechanics at ETH Zuerich.

    "Ten years from now, the performance of today's supercomputers will become
available in desktop systems, making such simulations of bone strength a
routine practice in computer tomography," predicts Dr. Alessandro Curioni,
manager of the Computational Sciences group at IBM's Zurich Research
Laboratory.

    Professor Peter Arbenz of the Institute of Computational Science, who
initiated the collaboration among the involved groups, explains that state
of the art numerical algorithms were also necessary to solve these
extremely large problems in this surprisingly short time. This work is the
first fundamental step towards a clinical use of large scale bone
simulations. "We are at the beginning of an exciting journey and we need
to further continue this line of research in order to achieve this goal,"
he states.

    In future work, IBM and ETH scientists plan to aim to advance their
simulation techniques to go beyond the calculation of static bone strength
and to be able to simulate the actual formation of the fractures for
individual patients, thereby taking another step towards achieving a fast,
reliable and early detection of people with high fracture risk.

    The work "Extreme Scalability Challenges in Analyses of Human Bone
Structures" by ETH scientists Peter Arbenz, Cyril Flaig, Harry van Lenthe,
Ralph Mueller, Andreas Wirth and IBM Zurich Research Lab scientists Costas
Bekas and Alessandro Curioni was presented at the IACM/ECCOMAS 2008
conference in Venice, Italy, on July 2.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds detail)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 2 (Reuters) - Sanford C. Bernstein upgraded Exxon
Mobil Corp (XOM.N) to "outperform" from "market perform",
believing the company is likely to outperform the broader
market if oil prices continue to rise, which could lead Wall
Street to revise future earnings estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company is also likely to outperform other energy
sub-sectors if the crude price stalls or falls -- offering an
attractive hedge for investors needing sector exposure, analyst
Neil McMahon said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McMahon said if the brokerage boosts its oil and gas prices
for 2008 and 2009 to be in-line with year-to-date average
prices, the brokerage would see a 25 percent increase in its
own 2009 earnings estimate, and other analysts would also
revise earnings upward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. crude oil hit $143 a barrel on Tuesday amid concerns
stirred by a lower global oil supply and tensions between
Israel and OPEC member Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McMahon thinks increases in buybacks are again on the cards
with potential buybacks rising to $9 billion or $10 billion per
quarter by the end of the year, if current commodity prices are
sustained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobil, the world's largest publicly traded company,
currently has a buyback run rate of $8 billion per quarter, he
noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McMahon also pegs "imminent rapid expansion" of the LNG
industry and exploration ventures in Brazil and Eastern Europe
as potential catalysts for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McMahon raised his price target on the company's stock to
$106 from $103, noting that the shares have been range bound at
$80-$95 over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The stock has consistently grown in value at an average
rate of 11 percent per annum since 1990 through economic
cycles, and given the market uncertainty it may start to look
attractive again to many investors," the analyst added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company were up 1.3 percent at $89.47 in
morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 2 (Reuters) - JP Morgan added apparel and home goods
retailer Kohl's Corp (KSS.N) to its focus list with a price
target of $50, saying the company's earnings estimates were
conservative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Charles Grom, who has an "overweight" rating on the
stock, said he had confidence in the company's ability to
navigate through the tough retail environment as it will have
some easy comparisons in the next few months.
 "We think Kohl's has set the bar appropriately conservative,
removing much of the risk from the numbers, and potentially
setting up for three quarters of upside beginning in
second-quarter," Grom said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kohl's expects full-year earnings in the range of $2.95 to
$3.15 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts on average expect earnings of $3.06 a share,
before special items, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage raised its second-quarter earnings estimates
for the retailer by a penny to 73 cents a share and estimated
June same-store sales to rise 2 percent. Shares of Menomonee
Falls, Wisconsin-based company were trading at $41.45 in
trading before the bell. They had closed at $41.01 Tuesday on
the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Issuance and acceptance continues to increase globally as Visa
migrates to enhanced contactless technology specification
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa, the global leader in payments, today announced significant
milestones in the adoption of Visa's contactless technology feature,
Visa payWave, demonstrating continued global momentum for the
technology around the world. Visa payWave-enabled cards allow
consumers to simply "wave and go" making every day transactions faster
and more convenient. The technology is expanding to new merchant
segments and is being added to an increasing number of Visa credit,
debit and prepaid cards globally.

   Visa also announced today that it is currently migrating to an
enhanced global specification, Visa Contactless 2.0, to further
support the growth of Visa payWave around the globe. The new global
contactless specification is based on the international EMV chip
standards, enabling Visa to take advantage of the industry's most
advanced cryptographic techniques for Visa payWave transactions,
regardless of where the card was issued or where the transaction takes
place.

   "Visa payWave is an excellent example of Visa's approach to
innovation and our ability to extend the value of Visa to new
stakeholders and new market segments," said Elizabeth Buse, Global
Head of Product at Visa Inc. "As the payments ecosystem expands, so
does Visa's opportunity to deliver innovative products and services to
a diverse set of stakeholders."

   Visa payWave Global Momentum Drivers

   According to Javelin Strategy &amp; Research, 24.8 million consumers
worldwide will use chip-embedded credit cards for contactless payments
this year, and the firm estimates that the number will double within
five years. This trend is also reflected in the increased adoption of
Visa payWave technology worldwide:

   --  Brazil: Visa and Banco Bradesco are the first to market in
        Brazil with contactless payment cards, and have recently
        introduced the first Visa payWave pilot program. The
        initiative brings the benefits and security of contactless
        technology to consumers and merchants, while building on the
        existing EMV infrastructure. The trial allows consumers to
        make no-PIN or no-signature Visa payWave transactions for all
        purchases below R$100 at any Starbucks location throughout
        Brazil.

   --  China: The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC),
        Beijing Parkson Shopping Center and Visa recently announced
        the launch of China's first co-branded Visa payWave card - the
        Peony-Parkson Visa payWave Credit Card.

   --  South Korea: Visa and Starbucks have announced an exclusive
        partnership whereby Starbucks customers can simply pay for
        their purchases with a wave of their Visa payWave card or
        mobile device. Throughout South Korea, 12 major card issuers
        have launched Visa payWave programs, including Shinhan,
        Samsung, Hyundai, BC and Lotte Card. Visa payWave cards are
        accepted at various merchant locations including CGV,
        Homeplus, Primus, 7-Eleven, Lotte World, Red Mango, Michaa,
        Kyobo Books and SK gas stations.

   --  Taiwan: Citibank became the eighth issuer of Visa payWave in
        Taiwan when it launched the Citibank Shopper's Choice card.

   --  Thailand: Visa, Bangkok Bank and Bangkok Mass Transit System
        (BTS) recently introduced the Bangkok Bank Blue Wave Credit
        Card. The Visa payWave-enabled card combines the features of a
        credit card, ATM card and BTS transit card into one simple
        design. Kasikorn Bank has also launched a Visa payWave program
        in Thailand with the rollout of its K-Wave Card. In Thailand,
        Visa payWave enabled-cards are accepted at merchants including
        Starbucks, Burger King, McDonald's, Paragon, Big C and Levi.

   --  United States: US Bank and Visa recently launched a Visa
        payWave debit program to bring the speed and convenience of
        Visa payWave to debit cardholders in California, Colorado,
        Missouri, and Utah.

   --  In the greater Washington DC region, National Capital Federal
        Credit Union (NCFCU) announced this week that it is adding the
        Visa payWave feature to its current portfolio of Visa credit
        cards.

   --  In the Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan regions,
        Visa and Coca-Cola are working together to install Visa
        payWave enabled vending machines, enabling consumers to simply
        "wave and go" when purchasing a beverage, instead of fumbling
        for coins and bills.

   --  Visa payWave rollouts and trials have been announced in
        Australia, Canada, China, Brazil, France, Guatemala, Hong
        Kong, Indonesia, Italy, Korea, Malaysia, Poland, Singapore,
        Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United
        Kingdom and the United States.

   Global Migration to Enhanced Contactless Specification

   Visa is currently migrating to a global contactless payments
specification that will ensure Visa cardholders can use their
contactless cards worldwide while still providing issuers with the
flexibility to customize programs to meet local market needs. The
specification provides additional security options and enhanced
performance for faster transaction processing.

   The new framework is compatible with existing Visa contactless
card programs in the market and in development. The specification also
supports all payment platforms - credit, debit and prepaid, and can
also be embedded in mobile devices.

   "With millions of contactless cards worldwide, Visa has developed
a global contactless platform built on the experience of implementing
programs in multiple countries and regions," said Elizabeth Buse,
Global Head of Product at Visa Inc. "This new specification will allow
card issuers and vendors globally to implement contactless solutions
that are globally interoperable while also providing advanced
EMV-based security."

   Visa first published a contactless specification in 2002,
primarily to focus on local market implementations and requirements.
Following extensive experience with numerous trial and commercial
programs around the world, Visa has updated the specification to
provide an effective roadmap for financial institutions and vendors to
move to interoperable programs. The specification provides flexibility
by allowing issuers to choose the options and features that best meet
their local market needs while ensuring global interoperability. It
also provides enhanced security options to enable greater card and
data protection.

   Another major feature of the specification is that communications
between the card and terminal have been streamlined to provide faster
transaction processing. This makes Visa payWave ideal for environments
where speed is of the essence, such as parking garages, mass transit,
quick service restaurants, and convenience stores.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, July 2 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) plans
to introduce a new way to sell its Office software suite on
Wednesday, offering customers a subscription model instead of
the traditional one-time license fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Starting in mid-July, the company will offer U.S. consumers
Microsoft Equipt, which comes packaged with the latest version
of Office, Windows Live online services and security software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Equipt, which was introduced under the code-name "Albany,"
will be available for $69.99 a year and it can be used on up to
three home computers, according to Microsoft. The product will
be available at around 700 Circuit City CC.N stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By getting a subscription service, customers can get the
latest updates and newest versions of the software. The regular
price for a one-time license of Office 2007, home and student
edition, is $149.99, according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company faces competition from Google Inc (GOOG.O) and
a slew of start-ups including privately-held Zoho, which are
offering applications comparable to Office but delivered
through a Web browser for free or a monthly subscription.

&lt;p&gt; (Changes source, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 2 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded BJ's
Wholesale Club Inc BJ.N to "overweight" from "neutral",
saying the No. 3 U.S. warehouse club operator has improved its
ability to convert free trial customers to paid trial members,
which has long-term benefits including higher traffic and
stronger membership fee income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Customers pay an annual fee to shop in BJ's warehouse
locations to get discounts on everything from digital cameras
and fresh food to bulk-sized packages of paper towels and soda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While we admittedly got off the bus a little early when we
downgraded the stock to neutral in January, we feel that
retailers with a value message will continue to drive higher
traffic/comps in this environment," analyst Charles Grom said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Warehouse operators like BJ's have emerged as a bright spot
in the U.S. retail sector as shoppers, squeezed by the economic
downturn, seek cheaper gas and food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grom, who pegs June same-store sales at 12 percent -- ahead
of the Street's 9.3 percent consensus estimate, said based on
the brokerage's checks June trends at BJ's seem solid, with the
last two months' double-digit momentum carrying into June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With weather in its favor, seasonal items look strong,
including outdoor patio furniture, grills, and patriotic items
ahead of the 4th of July, as well as a reversal of last month's
slow sell-through of air conditioners," Grom added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company closed at $41.13 Tuesday on the New
York Stock Exchange, near its 52-week high of $42.27.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details on scale of downgrades, quotes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 2 (Reuters) - Analysts at Goldman Sachs
(GS.N) on Wednesday lowered their six-month price targets on
U.S. airlines they cover by an average of 42 percent due to the
negative impact of sky-high oil prices on the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analysts cut their price target on American Airlines
parent AMR Corp AMR.N to $3.80 from $7.00, lowered their
Continental Airlines Inc CAL.N target to $10.50 from $20.00,
and cut Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) to $5.90 from $9.00.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Record fuel prices and a weakening economy have stalled the
U.S. airline industry's modest recovery from the 2001-2006
downturn. Oil prices have roughly doubled in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday, U.S. crude CLc1 rose 97 cents to settle at
$140.97 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a record
settlement price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To survive, U.S. airlines are slimming down. They have
slashed services and capacity, cut jobs, hiked fares, and added
new fees and surcharges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect airlines to continue to burn cash, revisit
capacity assumptions, and pull an assortment of liquidity
levers ranging from divestitures, forward mileage sales, and
debt refinancings, among other actions," the Goldman Sachs
analysts wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "And while we believe these are appropriate strategic
actions, we do not believe that the stocks will react
positively until oil price pressures abate," the analysts
wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Goldman analysts also cut their price target on JetBlue
Airways Corp (JBLU.O) to $3.40 from $5.00, lowered Northwest
Airlines Corp NWA.N to $6.50 from $9.50, cut US Airways Group
Inc LCC.N to $1.50 from $6.00, and lowered Alaska Air Group
Inc (ALK.N) to $14.00 from $21.00.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Dave Zimmerman)

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO, July 2 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) Japan group
oil refiner TonenGeneral Sekiyu's (5012.T) 156,000 barrels per
day Sakai refinery in western Japan has been ordered shut since
Tuesday evening after a fire, the local fire department said on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fire, thought to have occurred due to an oil leak near
the refinery's sole 156,000 bpd crude distillation unit (CDU),
was extinguished relatively quickly but the incident prompted a
suspension order on the CDU, a fire department official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a result of the order, all of the refining operations at
the Sakai plant have been shut, the official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He did not know when the plant would resume operations, and
said the damage did not appear to be major.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the suspected cause was confirmed, suspension orders in
similar cases were typically lifted in about a week, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Tokyo-based TonenGeneral spokesman said the company was
trying to minimise the impact on shipments from the refinery.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Jul 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
John R. Talbott, best selling author of 2003's "The Coming Crash in the
Housing Market" and his new book, "Obamanomics: How Bottom-Up Economic
Prosperity Will Replace Trickle-Down Economics," said on FOX News today
that the current housing, mortgage and banking crisis was a vast criminal
enterprise.

    Talbott said that realtors were pushing homes on people they couldn't
afford solely to garner the commission, appraisors were inflating
appraisals beyond reasonableness just to win business and mortgage brokers
were altering applications to change stated incomes to justify too much
lending to homebuyers.

    More importantly, banks and investment banks were packaging and selling
mortgages as high quality investments that they knew faced severe risk of
default in a market downturn. The investment banks were paying supposedly
independent rating agencies to provide AAA ratings to the packaged
mortgages. And finally, the banks and investment banks were spending over
$400 million annually in lobbying expenses and much more in campaign
contributions to "bribe" our congressmen and president so that their
illegal activities would continue unregulated and unenforced. Trillions of
dollars of losses have resulted and the housing market is still only about
halfway through its inevitable decline. Talbott sees home prices declining
as much as 25% nationwide and more than 50% on the coasts and in Las Vegas
and Phoenix.

    About John R. Talbott:

    A former investment banker for Goldman Sachs and Visiting Scholar at
UCLA's Anderson School of Management, John R. Talbott is the author of
five books on economics and politics, including the 2003 book "The Coming
Crash in the Housing Market" and his February 2006 book, "Sell Now! The
End of the Housing Bubble." Talbott's new book, "Obamanomics," out this
week, assesses Barack Obama's plans to improve the economy. He has
written for The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times, and The Boston
Globe, and appeared as a commentator on CNN, Fox, CNBC, and CBS.

&lt;p&gt;Remarks by the President at Ceremonial Groundbreaking of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center

BETHESDA, Md.--(Business Wire)--
Walter Reed National Naval Medical Center

   Bethesda, Maryland

   10:06 A.M. EDT

   THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, Deputy Secretary England, for
that generous introduction. I am so honored to be here at Bethesda
National Naval Medical Center. This is often called the "President's
Hospital." The reason why is this is where the President gets medical
care. But I'm relieved today not to be on the treadmill, weighing in
and getting a blood test. (Laughter.) I also will tell you that the
care that the President gets here is extraordinary.

   I am so excited to be here for what is a grand occasion. This is a
big deal, the breaking ground of a new joint medical facility for the
men and women of our Armed Forces. Thank you all for joining us.

   In a few years the current campus at Walter Reed will close, and
many of its services will be relocated to the new complex here on the
grounds at Bethesda. The two hospitals will be merged into one central
campus, which will be called the Walter Reed National Military Medical
Center. At this new center, wounds will be healed, medical knowledge
will be advanced, lives will be rebuilt. And those who wear our
nation's uniform will be reminded that they have the enduring
gratitude of the American people. I thank all who serve Walter Reed
and Bethesda. I love being with the healers and caregivers, and
incredibly compassionate people who makes our current facility
successful and will make this new center a great success.

   Congressman, thank you very much for joining us. I know you are
proud that this new facility is in your congressional district. Thank
you for working hard to see vision become a reality.

   Lieutenant Governor, proud to be with you. This man wear (sic) the
uniform of the United States military, and I'm proud to be with this
veteran, and now public servant for the state of Maryland.

   Members of the administration who are here, thank you all for
coming. Chaplain York, thanks for the blessings. And all those who
wear the uniform, thanks for sacrificing for the country.

   This morning, we gather in a place that was chosen by another
President to be the site of a world-class naval hospital. When
President Franklin Roosevelt dedicated Bethesda in the early years of
World War II, he placed this facility on the front lines of what he
called the "battle against disease, disability and death." The
military "surgeons and nurses, scientists and technicians," he said,
"are anonymous heroes of this war."

   More than six decades later, our nation is engaged in a very
different battle for our freedom. Yet our success still relies on
these "anonymous heroes" -- the healers who care for the troops, those
troops who keep the American people safe. In this new war, giving our
troops the care they deserve requires cutting-edge medical facilities.
And that is what this new medical center will provide.

   When the construction is complete, this facility will encompass
345 beds and 6.7 million square feet. It will join the resources of
the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and make it easier for medical
professionals in all three services to collaborate and care for the
patients. Our troops and their families will no longer have to travel
between Bethesda and Walter Reed to see multiple specialists. The new
complex will also benefit from the good work of the Dole-Shalala
Wounded Warriors Commission, which has issued recommendations for
modernizing and improving our military health care system. Those
recommendations will provide a strong foundation for effective,
accountable care here at the new Walter Reed National Military Medical
Center.

   This new medical center will be a place of healing. Every day, our
military doctors and nurses and medical staff demonstrate their
immense skill and their caring hearts. You soothe the pain and fear of
patients. You console families who keep constant vigil over their
loved ones. You share the joy of a neurology patient's first recovered
words, and an amputee's first steps. When required, you can show tough
love -- but you also like to remind patients that laughter is the best
medicine. And we look forward to the day when the joy of recovery
echoes through the halls of the new medical facility that will be
built here.

   This new medical center will be a place of innovation. Major
Walter Reed was the Army doctor who found that Yellow Fever is
transmitted by mosquitoes -- a discovery that has saved countless
lives. The new institution bearing his name will continue his legacy
of lifesaving research. Today, our nation's military doctors are
revolutionizing how we approach traumatic brain injuries,
Post-Traumatic-Stress Disorder, and amputee care. In many fields, you
are far ahead of civilian medicine. And when Bethesda and Walter Reed
merge into one campus across from the National Institutes of Health,
this will be the site of many more promising breakthroughs that will
benefit not only our troops, but all mankind.

   This new medical center will be a place of compassion. At Bethesda
and Walter Reed, volunteers organize holiday celebration, poker nights
and field trips. They distribute care packages from thousands of
Americans who want to show their gratitude for our troops. Recently,
schoolchildren from New York made pillows for soldiers at Walter Reed,
and sent letters along with the gifts. The children wrote: "(You are)
everyone's hero." "Thank you for fighting for our freedom." At this
new center, the Americans who fight for our freedom will get the
compassion and support they deserve.

   This new medical center will be a place of courage. Our wounded
warriors show that while the human body is fragile, the human spirit
is strong. Anybody who has met the wounded at Walter Reed and Bethesda
cannot help but be incredibly impressed by the courage and sacrifice
of our troops.

   Recently, I saw this strength in a young Air Force Staff Sergeant
named Scott Lilley. Scott was serving in Iraq when an IED left him
with a severe brain injury. I think it was last 4th of July that you
came to the White House. Yes, I was one who felt like this guy had no
chance. And yet, he -- the doctors here used state-of-the-art
technology and aggressive treatment to get Scott better. Their
perseverance paid off. And so has his. I welcomed he and his mom and
dad to the Oval Office the other day. He was more eloquent than I was,
which isn't all that hard. (Laughter.) He drives a car, he goes to
baseball games, he loves to joke.

   His doctor calls Scott's recovery "miraculous." And thanks to the
extraordinary care he received at Bethesda, as well his own
extraordinary resolve, he is now back on active duty in the Air Force.
And we are glad you're here. (Applause.)

   The greatest privilege of serving as President is to be the
Commander-in-Chief of such an extraordinary group of men and women who
wear our nation's uniform. And I'm pleased to help start construction
on the new hospital that will continue to provide the excellent care
our troops deserve. It is fitting that this new facility be built in a
place called Bethesda, which draws its name from the Biblical pool of
healing. It is there that a lame man was made to walk, and was
dispatched with the words: "Behold, thou art made whole."

   I pray that this will be the site of many miracles of healing --
where the lame will walk again, where broken bodies will be made
whole, and where you'll always know that you're in our prayers and in
the hearts of the American people.

   May God bless you, and may God continue to bless our country.
(Applause.)

&lt;p&gt;  NEW DELHI, INDIA and BANGALORE, INDIA, Jul 03 (MARKET
WIRE) -- 
Researchers at IBM's India Research Laboratory have developed advanced
data masking technology that helps call centers protect critical data
without disrupting customer service or business operations. As IBM (NYSE:
IBM) continuously seeks new methods to ensure privacy and security, the
company intends to utilize this capability in its own call center
operations to further protect information for its services clients around
the world.

    The new data masking technology helps call centers and Information
Technology Enabled Service (ITES) organizations by providing effective
security and privacy of data which helps in managing customer trust and
protecting the brand, which is critical for the call center industry.
Developed by IBM's India Research Laboratory, the technology is a speech
analytics tool that helps in complying with security and privacy
legislation and compliance standards, which in turn enhances customer
satisfaction.

    Designed to help dramatically improve call centers, this sophisticated IBM
technology detects and masks private and sensitive information collected
from audio recordings of conversations between call center agents and
customers. Previously, there was no known technology which provided this
functionality.

    "Call centers, and the agents who answer customer questions and address
their concerns, play a vital role in reinforcing their organization's
brand experience while maintaining customer trust. The ability to maintain
customer trust requires organizations to be able to ensure the security of
their customers' private information, such as credit card numbers,
personal identification numbers (PIN), social security numbers and other
information collected through agent-customer interactions," said Dr.
Guruduth Banavar, Director, IBM India Research Laboratory. "Designed to
transform data for better security and privacy, this technology,
developed by IBM Research, helps to ensure effective measures to
safeguard company brands and manage customer trust."

    Typically, in a contact center the audio recordings are stored and
subsequently shared with various individuals for different purposes such
as auditing, personnel training, and quality management. During the
process of sharing, audio files become vulnerable to unauthorized
individuals getting access to sensitive information, which opens
opportunities for personal and confidential information theft and other
misuse. This unique technology from IBM's India Research Laboratory
processes these audio recordings in order to detect and mask the
sensitive information and makes it accessible to authorized personnel
only; thus preventing misuse of the data.

    The new solution will help companies protect their data while taking
advantage of the best resources available throughout the world. Voice and
screen masking utilizes a combination of speech analytics and metadata to
locate portions of an audio or screen recordings that contain sensitive
data such as a credit card or bank account numbers. The masking solution
blocks that portion of the call or screen during playback for individuals
that are not authorized to hear or view the sensitive information.

    This novel technology helps in protecting audio files, particularly the
agent customer interaction in a contact center against misuse and theft.
It helps enterprises to comply with various security and privacy
legislations and comply with multiple industry standards. "Though the
technology can be used in any setting, it is especially vital for contact
centers and the ITES industry where sensitive information is exchanged,"
said Dr. Mukesh Mohania, who heads the Information Management research
team at IBM's India Research Laboratory.

    There is an increasing awareness for companies to protect the privacy of
their customer information. Given the pace at which outsourcing industry
is expanding and the sensitivity to potential misuse of customer data, it
becomes imperative to manage customer trust. This next-generation tool
will help the outsourcing industry to secure customer information in
agent-customer recordings by masking sensitive data in voice and screen
recordings from unauthorized users to protect against identity theft and
fraud.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Aetna Inc (AET.N) shares dropped 5 percent and Health Net Inc (HNT.N) tumbled 10 percent after a Goldman Sachs analyst slapped "sell" ratings on the two health insurers' stocks on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downgrades by Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Borsch, who had previously rated both stocks "neutral", sent health insurer stocks down broadly, further worsening the performance of the group this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aetna, the No. 3 U.S. health insurer, has been one of the few in the group to have stood by their 2008 profit forecasts, while earnings warnings from rivals have dragged down stocks this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Borsch said "our view is that the company cannot remain immune from the margin pressure impacting other carriers in the price-sensitive" commercial business of providing fully insured health plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Borsch maintained his 2008 earnings target for Aetna, saying he does not see immediate earnings downside, but cut his 2009 and 2010 estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cut his six-month price target on Aetna to $36 from $48.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aetna shares fell $2.14, or 5.4 percent, to $37.65 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares fell as low as $36.24 earlier in the session, the lowest point in nearly two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aetna shares have fallen some 34 percent this year, but that decline has actually outperformed most of its rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding Health Net, a smaller, regional carrier, Borsch said "we expect margin deterioration across most of the company's products this year." He cut his six-month price target to $15 from $31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health Net shares fell $2.71, or 10.6 percent, to $22.93. Its shares are off some 52 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Morgan Stanley Healthcare Payor index .HMO, a broad gauge of health-insurer stocks, fell 3.8 percent, with shares of Cigna Corp (CI.N), Humana (HUM.N) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH.N) each off more than 4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf, editing by Dave Zimmerman)&lt;/p&gt;

nearly 50 percent stake in money manager BlackRock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan expects Merrill to post a second-quarter loss of

$2.18 a share, compared with its earlier estimate of a loss of
4 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill still has significant exposure to residential and

&lt;p&gt;  WARREN, NJ, Jul 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Virgin Mobile USA, Inc. (NYSE: VM), a leading national provider of
prepaid and hybrid wireless plans, today signed a services agreement for
Information Technology (IT) operations and new applications development
with IBM (NYSE: IBM). The agreement will allow Virgin Mobile USA to
enhance its technology capabilities and improve its product portfolio for
new and existing customers by affording the Company access to IBM's
significant telecommunications industry experience and state-of-the-art
IT resources.

    Under the terms of the new services agreement, IBM will begin
transitioning Virgin Mobile USA's existing IT infrastructure and
application suite into its own environment. Simultaneously and continuing
over the course of the next five years, IBM will work with Virgin Mobile
USA to develop new and differentiated wireless applications and service
offerings. Specifically, IBM will provide Virgin Mobile USA with data
center outsourcing and application management services including
maintenance and development.

    The agreement provides Virgin Mobile USA with yet another strategic
milestone contributing to its growth profile.

    The Company recently announced its plans to acquire the postpaid carrier
Helio. This additional step, separate from the Helio acquisition, will
serve to enhance Virgin Mobile USA's technology capabilities and improve
its product portfolio by affording the Company access to IBM's significant
telecommunications industry experience and state-of-the-art IT resources.

    Virgin Mobile USA expects that, as a result of its new relationship with
IBM, the Company will realize IT-related operational cost savings over the
next five years, while amplifying the Company's competitive advantage in
new product and service delivery. The expected benefits of the Company's
new relationship with IBM are key components of Virgin Mobile USA's
focused expansion and value creation strategy.

    The Company expects the transition of its existing IT infrastructure and
application suite to IBM to be completed by December 31, 2008.

    "We have built our success as a customer-centric innovator, and always
seek to enhance our product and service offerings," said Jonathan
Marchbank, Chief Operations Officer, Virgin Mobile USA. "These steps will
continue to raise the standards in the prepaid market overall and allow
us to stay current with, and ahead of, trends and evolutions in the
overall wireless industry. With over 5 million customers, the scale we've
achieved now puts us in a position to take advantage of IBM's proven best
practices, scope and unparalleled experience in running and building IT
infrastructure."

    Marchbank emphasized that the agreement will allow Virgin Mobile USA to:


--  leverage IBM's investments in mobile technology to deliver better
    applications to customers, bring new services to market more quickly, and
    dynamically respond to market trends;
--  fund strategic initiatives to broaden the Company's offerings and
    accelerate its growth;
--  help support the integration of the assets of its new acquisition; and
--  reduce operational and R costs.
    

    
"The telecommunications industry must stay current with innovative
packages and solutions that promote anywhere and anytime communication
services such as instant messaging, photo sharing and GPS capabilities,"
said Don Lopes, IBM vice president, Telecommunications Industry. "IBM is
excited to apply its telecommunications industry insight, business
transformation expertise, and IT outsourcing best practices to enable
Virgin Mobile USA to deliver next-generation mobile solutions and service
to its customers."

    As outlined in the agreement, more than 40 Virgin Mobile USA IT employees
will transfer to IBM. In addition, select employees from the Company's
Walnut Creek, California facility will be offered the opportunity to
relocate to the Warren, New Jersey headquarters; others will be focused on
the Helio integration plan.

&lt;p&gt;  JAKARTA, INDONESIA, Jul 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
More than 5000 employees of Bosowa Corporation can collaborate with their
increasingly mobile colleagues at dozens of sites across the Indonesian
archipelago through a unified communications solution from Nortel(1)
(TSX: NT)(NYSE: NT) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT).

    From its roots as a single Mitsubishi dealer in 1978, Bosowa has expanded
into a major automotive industry operator and conglomerate with
businesses including automotive retailing, infrastructure development,
financial services, and project management in the engineering and
construction industries. While growth has delivered ongoing success to
the company, it has also created communications challenges in bringing
Bosowa employees closer together despite the vast distances between
branch offices.

    Bosowa found a way of bridging the distances with a unified
communications solution from the Innovative Communications Alliance, a
joint offering from Nortel and Microsoft that breaks down the barriers
across voice, email, conferencing, video, instant messaging and presence
applications to provide anytime, anywhere collaboration. The results have
been faster decision-making, better business-critical processes, and
enhanced collaboration for the growing number of Bosowa staff spending
time on the road.

    "After years of successful growth, we are looking for ways to capitalize
on our large and diverse workforce," said Sadikin Aksa, managing director
of Bosowa Corporation. "Unified communications has proved essential to
reaching this goal, fostering collaboration among employees no matter
where they are located or what communications method they use. In the
long term, this will give us a more flexible and effective workforce
that's able to work together to grow the business even more."

    "As companies expand and employees increasingly work out of the office,
the old rules of communication where employees have to work from the
office desk no longer apply" said James Demers, vice president, ASEAN &amp;
Pakistan, Nortel. "Bosowa's unified communications rollout has allowed it
to create a fully integrated communications environment that will enable
its workforce to realize new standards of efficiency through real-time,
online collaboration."

    "Bosowa has joined the ranks of companies around the world that are
looking for applications beyond email to help their employees collaborate
together," said Tony Chen president director of PT Microsoft Indonesia.
"The Microsoft and Nortel solution leverages cutting-edge technology to
ensure communications are never again limited by geographical or time
barriers."

    Bosowa's unified communications solution combines Nortel Communication
Server 1000 (CS 1000) with Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007(2)
and Microsoft Exchange Server 2007(2) to provide one-click access to a
broad range of collaboration capabilities. Bosowa is one of hundreds of
companies that have embraced the Nortel and Microsoft Innovative
Communications Alliance since it was formed in July 2006, to help
companies transform business communications by taking the complexity out
of implementing unified communications.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO, July 3 (Reuters) - RaQualia, a pharma venture that was
recently spun off by drug maker Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), aims to go
public by the first quarter of 2011, its president said on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; RaQualia Pharma Inc targets sales of 1.1 billion yen ($10.37
million) in 2009 and 4.1 billion yen in 2010 by capitalising on
the intellectual property inherited from the U.S. drug giant and
financial resources injected by venture capital funds as well as
Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With the support of venture capital funds, RaQualia has
raised enough funds to move towards an IPO," RaQualia president
Atsushi Nagahisa told a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If stock market conditions permit, we will aim to carry out
an IPO around the end of 2010 or in the first quarter of 2011. We
have an IPO-ready portfolio" of research and development
programs, compounds and drugs, Nagahisa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The venture started business on Tuesday, taking over 70
employees and a 2.2 billion yen-worth portfolio of compounds and
drugs in the pipeline from Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest drug maker decided in January 2007 to
spin off its research and development laboratory in Nagoya,
central Japan, as part of the company's global restructuring
program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The reorganisation programme features plans to slash Pfizer's
staff base by 10,000 worldwide and to concentrate its research
and development operations in the United States and the UK. The
Japan lab had about 400 employees at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Japan's NIF SMBC Ventures Co is the top shareholder of
RaQualia, which has capital of 10 million yen, with a 32 percent
stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The UK's Coller Capital holds the second biggest chunk of
ownership in the venture, with a 24 percent stake. Pfizer is the
third-largest shareholder, holding 19 percent. Seven other firms
are also investing in the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RaQualia has raised total 11.1 billion yen of funds, which
are needed for its research and development operations in the
next three to five years, from investors, with NIF SMBC
contributing 3.8 billion yen, Coller 2.9 billion yen and Pfizer
2.2 billion yen, Nagahisa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RaQualia will likely spend about 3.5 billion yen on
development each year, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nagahisa, like others, has joined RaQualia from Pfizer's
Japan unit where he was a managing director in charge of research
and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RaQualia, which will focus on pain and gastrointestinal
therapeutic areas, has inherited six drug discovery programs, six
compounds and three products from Pfizer. Pfizer has a prior
right to the Nav1.3 pain killer drug currently under a research
program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RaQualia aims to verify the clinical effects of two compounds
each year in one of international markets, Nagahisa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Yumiko Nishitani)

&lt;p&gt;MADRID (Reuters) - Chevron (CVX.N) believes high oil prices, which hit a record above $144/barrel this week, are driven by concerns about supplies, a senior company official said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In Chevron's view, most of the price increases we have seen, are related to fundamental concerns about the outlook for physical supplies in the long term," John Watson, vice president for strategy and development, told the World Petroleum Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watson's comments follow similar statements from the Chief Executives of the four largest non-government controlled oil companies in the world, Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L), BP Plc (BP.L) and France's Total (TOTF.PA) at the Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPEC representatives addressing the Congress continued to blame speculators and the weak dollar for the ramp up in oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tom Bergin)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp and Yahoo Inc have been holding separate talks with other potential media partners after their negotiations with each other broke down, sources familiar with the companies' thinking said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft -- rebuffed this year in efforts to buy all of Yahoo and then just its search business -- is talking about alternative deals with Time Warner Inc, which owns AOL, and News Corp, parent of MySpace, a source close to Microsoft said, but any negotiations remain in preliminary stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, talks have continued for months between Yahoo and Time Warner over a potential merger of AOL with Yahoo to create a more formidable advertising and media player, but they are no closer to a deal, a source close to the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Yahoo jumped as much as 9 percent on Wednesday after the Wall Street Journal reported that Microsoft, positioning for a new run for Yahoo's search business, had in recent days approached media companies to join together on a deal that would effectively lead to Yahoo's breakup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a Reuters source and a CNBC report, citing unnamed sources, later said there were no new talks or negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Journal also said Microsoft met with activist investor Carl Icahn in recent days to encourage him to press his proxy battle for control of Yahoo's board, the first sign Microsoft welcomed his month-old campaign. This development also was attributed to unnamed sources familiar with the talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn was not available to comment on the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, Yahoo, Time Warner and News Corp all declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REVIVING HOPE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street analysts said the latest news revived flagging hopes among some investors that Microsoft was still interested in doing a deal with Yahoo. "The hopes that Microsoft would come back were getting crushed over the last 10 trading days," Collins Stewart analyst Sandeep Aggarwal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo stock ended the day up 3.4 percent at $20.88. The stock had traded as low as $19.58 on Tuesday, near its level in late January before Microsoft made its unsolicited takeover bid for Yahoo, sending the stock above $30 by mid-February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares fell 3.7 percent to $25.88 on Wednesday. In the prior day's trading, Microsoft fell to two-year lows of $23.19, intraday, before recovering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyst Youssef Squali of Jefferies  Co said the sharp Yahoo stock reaction was most likely a defensive move by short-sellers seeking to cover bets a Microsoft deal was off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even the rumor that Microsoft is getting interested again is enough to have people to want to cover their bets against Yahoo stock," Squali said, adding that many investors have shorted Yahoo from the high $20s all the way down below $20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding to the volatility were options investors who placed fresh bets Yahoo would be trading up to $27.50 by October, said analyst Rebecca Engmann Darst of Interactive Brokers Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE WAITING GAME&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several financial analysts said a key detail in the Journal report was that Microsoft and Yahoo executives had sought to revisit the merger on May 17 -- two weeks after Microsoft walked away -- and that two Yahoo board members in the meeting had said they would settle for a merger worth $33-$34 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 3, Yahoo rejected a $33-a-share Microsoft offer worth $47.5 billion, and earlier this week questioned whether the software maker was ever serious about a full-scale merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source familiar with Microsoft's thinking confirmed that Yahoo had belatedly sought a deal in mid-May worth $33 to $34, but that Microsoft was no longer interested at that point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source said Microsoft executives considered the early May deadline as vital to winning regulatory approval before the end of the year -- when a new presidential administration arrives and months more delays would likely occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also become convinced that Yahoo executives were passively resisting the deal and unwilling to seriously negotiate. Meanwhile, the economy has taken a toll on the online ad market, and with it, the value of buying Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is going to let Icahn do the dirty work and hand Yahoo over to them," Jefferies  Co's Squali said, adding that it was in Microsoft's interest to hang back and let Yahoo shares settle lower as investors quit betting on a takeover premium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the long run, however, Microsoft needs Yahoo more than Yahoo needs Microsoft, he argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft has a gaping hole in its strategy and it's called the Internet and it's only getting worse because Google is encroaching on Microsoft's business," Squali said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, the U.S. Justice Department is pursuing a formal antitrust investigation into a deal reached last month between Yahoo and Microsoft-archrival Google Inc to team up on Web search advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google, with more than 60 percent of the Web search market, and Yahoo, with 16.6 percent, agreed to a deal for Google to run search ads on Yahoo's site in a partnership that could mean $250 million to $450 million in new cash flow for Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google said it was confident the deal would enhance overall industry competition, but declined to discuss the probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Ajay Kamalakaran in Bangalore, Franklin Paul in New York, Diane Bartz in Washington, D.C., Doris Frankel in Chicago; Editing by Derek Caney, Leslie Gevirtz, Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW, July 4 (Reuters) - The Kazakh government hit back at
claims by Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) it is delaying the development of
its enormous Kashagan oilfield, the country's energy and mineral
resources ministry said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "A chief executive of one of the major oil companies, a
Kashagan consortium member, has recently made statements seeking
to shift blame to the government for delays," the ministry said
in a statement, referring to this week's comments in Madrid by
Rex Tillerson, the CEO of U.S. oil major Exxon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kazakhstan and a consortium of Western oil companies
developing Kashagan have been locked in a standoff over cost
overruns and production delays at the multi-billion dollar
project since August 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The government has acted responsibly to protect the
interests of Kazakhstan in the face of the consortium's
inability to bring the field into production on schedule," the
statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In May, the consortium angered the Kazakh government by
proposing to delay the start of production further to 2013, but
consortium member Eni (ENI.MI) said earlier this week that the
project is going full steam and is on track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Kashagan consortium unites Eni, Royal Dutch Shell Plc
(RDSa.L), Exxon Mobil Corp, Total (TOTF.PA), ConocoPhillips
(COP.N), Kazakh KazMunaiGas [KMG.UL] and Japan's Inpex Holdings
Inc (1605.T).

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said the European banks sector needs to raise about 60 billion to 90 billion euros ($94 to $141 billion), or withhold one year of dividends, to reach an aggregate Tier I ratio of 9 percent -- a level achieved by European banks that have recapitalized recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bearish comment by the Goldman analysts weighed on European stocks, with the benchmark FTSEurofirst 300 index down 0.43 percent at 1,172.99 points by 5:40 a.m. EDT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysts said they do not expect the mounting writedowns per se to trigger additional capital calls at this point. "Instead, we believe that regulatory pressures and a sharp turn in the European credit cycle are the two main causes for concern for bank investors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access to liquidity, capital adequacy and post-crisis profitability are the key areas of near to medium-term uncertainty, the analysts said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European banks' share prices remain under pressure and the sector is weighed down by the risk for additional capital raisings to cover tighter capital standards, a more severe downturn in the European credit cycle, or a combination of both, the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs cut its rating on Spain's Santander (SAN.MC) to "neutral" from "buy" and took down price targets for Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Commerzbank (CBKG.DE), Deutsche Postbank (DPBGn.DE) and several others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Santander were down nearly 3 percent at 11.55 euros, while Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank and Deutsche Postbank fell 1-1.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Neha Singh in Bangalore; Editing by Amitha Rajan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Banks weigh, Barclays down 3.4 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Oil stocks rise on crude climb&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Sylvia Westall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FRANKFURT, July 4 (Reuters) - European shares fell on Friday
as a bearish brokerage comment dented banking shares, while oil
stocks were driven higher by rising crude prices, ahead of a
holiday weekend in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At 1142 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top
European shares was down 0.7 percent at 1,169.63 points. United
States markets are closed for the Independence Day holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks fell after Goldman Sachs cut its rating on Spain's
Santander (SAN.MC) to "neutral" from "buy" and lowered price
targets for Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Commerzbank (CBKG.DE) and
Deutsche Postbank (DPBGn.DE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The German banks fell between 2 and 3 percent, Barclays
(BARC.L) shed 3.4 percent, while Austria's Raiffeisen
International RIBH.VI fell 5 percent, a leading loser in
Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But UBS (UBSN.VX) bucked the trend, up 0.5 percent after
saying a tax credit should help it avoid a big second-quarter
loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; European shares climbed on Thursday after the European
Central Bank raised rates by 25 basis points as expected but
indicated that no further moves were imminent. But that relief
had faded by midday Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Royal Bank of Scotland analysts expressed scepticism about
the ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet saying he had "no bias" in
favour of further rate moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is obviously surprising ... in fact it is difficult to
believe -- given the amount of inflationary pressure in the
region and globally," the note said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gerhard Schwarz, head of global equity strategy at UniCredit
in Munich said the decision was a short-term positive as the
wording of statements was not as hawkish as feared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But we cannot get any big relief as long as the overall
stagflation fears hang over the market, and the oil price is a
major factor in this. There will be a wave of downward pressure
on equities after any recovery," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil teetered near $145 a barrel ahead of the holiday weekend
in the United States and within sight of its all-time high of
$145.85 hit on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE fell 0.8 percent,
Germany's DAX .GDAXI fell 0.6 percent, and France's CAC 40
.FCHI shed 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MORE CAPITAL RAISINGS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman lowered 2008-09 estimates for over 40 banks and said
the sector would be hampered by the risk of additional capital
raisings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; European banks may need to raise 60-90 billion euros in
total, Goldman said, noting that banks that had recently
recapitalised had reached an average Tier 1 ratio of around 9
percent and a core Tier 1 ratio of around 6.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil stocks, which rose 15 percent in the second quarter of
the year as crude prices hit record highs, rallied with BP
(BP.L) up 0.6 percent, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) up 0.3 percent
and Total (TOTF.PA) up 0.8 percent. The DJ Stoxx index of
European oil stocks .SXEP was up 0.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in luxury goods group LVMH (LVMH.PA) fell 5 percent
-- the biggest fallers on the CAC 40 -- as traders cited a
sell-off triggered when the stock crossed a technical floor.

&lt;p&gt;The Life Density Insurance Market For The Czech Republic Is Envisaged To Rise From US$208.42 Per Capita In 2007 To US$280.00 Per Capita In 2012

DUBLIN, Ireland--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/2dc1ff/czech_republic_ins)
has announced the addition of the "Czech Republic Insurance Report Q2
2008" report to their offering.

   The Czech Republic Insurance Report provides independent forecasts
and competitive intelligence on Czech Republics insurance industry.

   As was the case in Q108, the main focus of this report is BMI's
proprietary Insurance Business Environment Rating (IBER). The rating
brings together a number of pieces of relevant quantitative data,
together with BMI's Country Risk Rating (CRR). The IBER makes it
easier for the business environment for the insurance sector in a
particular country to be compared with the business environment for
any other industry in that country that is surveyed by BMI. The IBER
also allows an objective and meaningful comparison of the business
environment for the insurance sector in one country with the business
environment for insurance in another country. Over the coming months,
we will substantially change the format of the BMI insurance reports.
In essence, we will focus to a much greater extent on the companies
that are active in the non-life and life segments.

   The Czech Republic's IBER is 61.5. The Czech Republic is, relative
to other countries in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), a
moderately-sized market for foreign insurers, although still
relatively small by world standards. It stands out within the region
for the measure of openness of the non-life and life segments and the
overall economic outlook is also very positive. However, the relative
underdevelopment of the sector and the low levels of expected growth
and foreign penetration of both the life and non-life sectors, the
levels of taxation, bureaucracy and external risks have all held the
IBER is held back.

   The Czech Republic's excellent regulatory framework, development
and competitive landscape along with the strength of the general
economy, expected to grow at 6% in 2007, constitute the strengths of
the sector. Though the sector is crowded, the low penetration rates
and relative diversity of the market in relation to other countries in
the region may provide opportunities for growth in the future.

   Indeed, the Czech Republic's insurance market is amazingly crowded
- in this respect it is very similar to that of Slovakia. According to
the Insurance Information Institute (III), by far the largest player
in the Czech Republic, both the life and non-life segment in terms of
premiums written, is Ceska Poistovna, which had almost a third of all
premiums written in 2004. However, despite being the largest player,
it is not over-dominant and certainly no longer has the monopoly that
it once enjoyed. With a small market and numerous players, there is a
likelihood of rationalisation in the future. An economic slowdown or
volatility in regional financial markets may provide the catalyst for
a substantial rationalisation of the sector over the medium term.

   The main weakness of the Czech Republic's insurance sector, on the
other hand, is the relatively low total size of the sector and the low
expected growth and penetration rates. The sector is also still
dealing with issues related to taxation, bureaucracy and possible GDP
volatility. There are also possible risks from a reduction in capital
inflows following the US sub-prime crisis and possible inflationary
pressures.

   We anticipate that non-life premiums will grow by 11% annually in
local currency terms and by 13% in US$ terms over the forecast period.
Life premiums are expected to increase by 4% annually in local
currency terms and by 5% in US$ terms. An anticipated rise in nominal
GDP from around US$158.30bn to US$237.7bn and an expected increase in
non-life penetration from 2.35% of GDP to 2.80% are expected to be the
key drivers of growth in the non-life segment in 2007-2012. An
envisaged rise in life density from US$208.42 per capita in 2007 to
US$280.00 per capita in 2012 is, on the other hand, expected to be the
key driver of growth in the life segment. However, the total
population of the Czech Republic is declining very moderately.

&lt;p&gt; * Banks broadly weaker on bearish Goldman note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * UBS up after says expects at worst a small quarterly loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Sitaraman Shankar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, July 4 (Reuters) - European shares fell early on
Friday, as relief over interest rates quickly evaporated and
bearish brokerage comment weighed on banks, though UBS (UBSN.VX)
gained after saying it expected at worst a small quarterly loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At 0826 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top
European shares was down 0.8 percent at 1,168.86 points. United
States markets will be closed for the Independence Day holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks were broadly weaker after Goldman Sachs cut its rating
on Spain's Santander (SAN.MC) to "neutral" from "buy" and took
down price targets for Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Commerzbank
(CBKG.DE) and Deutsche Postbank (DPBGn.DE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Santander ranked among the top negative weights on the index
with a 2.5 percent fall, while Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank and
Deutsche Postbank fell 1-1.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But UBS gained 3 percent after saying a large tax credit
should help to save it from another hefty loss in the second
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; European shares rose on Thursday after the European Central
Bank raised rates by 25 basis points as expected but indicated
that no further moves were imminent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The rate decision was a short-term positive as the wording
of the statements was not hawkish as expected. Clearly the ECB
needs to see inflation expectations building and second-round
effects before they hike again," said Gerhard Schwarz, head of
global equity strategy at UniCredit in Munich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But we cannot get any big relief as long as the overall
stagflation fears hang over the market, and the oil price is a
major factor in this. There will be a wave of downward pressure
on equities after any recovery," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The big question on equity markets is: how far will the
derating go, and when will valuations find a bottom as we
consider inflationary pressures not seen in two and a half
decades?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil traded at around $145 a barrel, within striking distance
of its all-time high of $145.85 hit on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE fell 0.8 percent,
Germany's DAX .GDAXI fell 0.5 percent and CAC 40 .FCHI lost
0.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MORE CAPITAL RAISINGS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman lowered 2008-09 estimates for over 40 banks, saying
that the sector was weighed by the risk for additional capital
raisings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said in a note that the European banking sector may need
to raise 60-90 billion euros, noting that banks that had
recently recapitalised had reached an average Tier 1 ratio of
around 9 percent and a core Tier 1 ratio of around 6.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If this level represents a new capital standard
(self-imposed or more actively encouraged by regulators and
rating agencies" we estimate that the sector could need to raise
60 billion euros, or withhold one year of dividends," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Furthermore, should a turn in the European credit cycle
trigger losses in line with those seen in the early 1990s, the
sector could need to raise more than 90 billion euros, on our
estimates."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other major losers included Marks  Spencer (MKS.L) which
fell 5.3 percent on a Citigroup downgrade, extending weakness
after a profit warning on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mining stocks were generally lower, with BHP Billiton
(BLT.L), Rio Tinto (RIO.L) and Antofagasta (ANTO.L) down 1-2.2
percent as copper prices fell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But oil stocks, which rose 15 percent in the second quarter
to end-June on surging crude prices, were broadly weaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Index heavyweight BP (BP.L) fell 0.3 percent, Royal Dutch
Shell (RDSa.L) lost 0.5 percent and Total (TOTF.PA) dipped 0.1
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sitaraman Shankar; editing by Sue Thomas)

&lt;p&gt;PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) agreed to pay 
$137.5 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit that claimed the 
world's largest soft drink maker artificially inflated sales to 
boost its stock price, according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit, filed in October 2000, claimed that in 1999 
Coca-Cola had forced some bottlers to purchase hundreds of 
millions of dollars of unnecessary beverage concentrate in an 
effort to make its sales seem higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bottlers use the beverage concentrate to make soft drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Institutional investors, led by Carpenters Health  Welface 
Fund of Philadelphia  Vicinity, said the practice, known as 
"channel stuffing," artificially inflated Coca-Cola's results 
and gave investors a false picture of the company's health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The investors claimed that Coca-Cola had failed to disclose 
material facts about its business and these omissions and 
misrepresentations harmed investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Without admitting any wrongdoing, Coca-Cola agreed to the 
settlement on June 26, according to court documents obtained by 
Reuters. The settlement was filed with the court on July 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola had previously denied any wrongdoing or 
liability, but agreed to settle the case to avoid lengthy and 
uncertain litigation, the settlement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The settlement applies to anyone who acquired Coca-Cola 
common stock from Oct 21, 1999 through March 6, 2000, according 
to the settlement agreement, which was filed with the U.S. 
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2005, Coca-Cola settled a similar issue over the sale of 
excess beverage concentrate to bottlers in Japan between 1997 
and 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Coca-Cola misled investors by failing to disclose 
end-of-period practices that impacted the company's likely 
future operating results," the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola admitted no wrongdoing and paid no fines in that 
settlement pact, but agreed to cease and desist from future 
securities violations and maintain tight internal controls on 
sales to bottlers and customers. The U.S. Department of Justice 
had closed an investigation without filing charges against the 
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jessica Hall; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (For more MA news and our DealZone blog, go to

&lt;p&gt; The following was issued by Micrsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and
Israel's Internet Gold (IGLD.TA) (IGLD.O)):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; July 6 - Microsoft Corporation and Internet Gold (Nasdaq:
IGLD) (through its 100 percent owned subsidiary Smile Media Ltd)
have reached an agreement to have Microsoft independently
operate a MSN Israel portal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Established during 2000, MSN Israel Ltd is 50.1 percent
owned by the Internet Gold Group and 49.9 percent owned by
Microsoft Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The parties are currently discussing the terms of migration
and possible future cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The msn.co.il portal will continue to operate throughout the
transition period and both parties are working together to
support employees, advertisers and users through this period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MSN is a global portal network which operates in 44
countries. In almost all of these countries the MSN portal is
fully owned by Microsoft Corp. and only in a very few instances
has Microsoft joined forces with a domestic partner to establish
a local MSN portal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2007, MSN Israel accounted for less than 3 percent of
Internet Gold's total revenues. Eli Holtzman, CEO of Internet
Gold, said today: "We have been happy to partner with Microsoft
in establishing MSN Israel over the last eight years. Since
then, we have developed MSN Israel into a leading portal in
Israel. Given the change in the parties' online strategies we
have agreed it makes sense for Microsoft to operate msn.co.il
independently. We believe this is the right move for both
parties and anticipate it will have a positive impact on our
results."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "During the last few years, the Internet Gold Group has
significantly expanded its activities in a variety of
communications areas and, as a result, our MSN Israel operations
currently represent a minor portion of the group's total
revenues. Thus, we have decided recently to change course and
seek alternatives for growth.  We are continuing to actively
examine new and financially significant areas of activity in and
out of Israel, which have substantial growth potential and will
drive our group to its next phase of business," concluded Mr.
Holtzman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Danny Yamin, General Manager of Microsoft, Israel, said
today, "Our relationship with Internet Gold has worked well to
establish strong foundations for our online business but both
parties now feel that the time has come to operate independently
to allow us both to deepen our impact on the Israeli market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are very excited about our future in Israel and see some
fantastic opportunities for growth and development of both the
MSN portal and the Windows Live services. It is MSN's goal
worldwide to deliver the best of local and international content
-- integrated with our Windows Live services-- providing ways
for consumers to interact and engage with MSN and more
importantly, with each other. We call this 'the social portal.'
Content is a very important part of this strategy and we will
continue to partner with local and global premium content
providers to deliver this."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JP Morgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said U.S. regulators should investigate whether people betting on Bear Stearns' stock falling deliberately brought down the investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Where there is smoke, there's fire," Dimon said in an interview with Charlie Rose on PBS, televised on Monday. "I think the Securities and Exchange Commission should investigate it, okay? I think if someone knowingly starts a rumor or passes on a rumor, they should go to jail."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan completed its fire-sale acquisition of Bear Stearns in May, following that bank's stock plunge and collapse earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trading volumes in Bear shares spiked in the days before the buyout of what was once the fifth-largest U.S. investment bank. Some media reports have suggested that rumors spread by short sellers betting on a fall in Bear Stearns' share price helped to finish off the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is even worse than insider trading. This is deliberate and malicious destruction of value and people's lives," Dimon said. "They shouldn't go to jail for a short period of time. If I was the SEC, I'd find out who made the money and I'd investigate like they do when they come after us all the time, emails, phone records, you name it, and I'd find out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michael Erman; Editing by Lincoln Feast)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jul 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The IBM (NYSE: IBM) Data Governance Council today predicted five key
information challenges that will reshape corporate behavior and the
market's ability to trust information during the next four years.

    The global Council recently met to discuss how businesses will handle the
enormous amount and complexity of information generated by organizations
and financial markets. Their findings included the prediction of five
imminent, information-related issues:


--  Data governance will become a regulatory requirement in an increasing
    number of countries and organizations. In some countries, organizations
    will have to demonstrate data governance practices to regulators as part of
    regular audits. This will likely affect the banking and financial services
    industries first, and will emerge as a growing trend worldwide.

--  The value of data will be treated as an asset on the balance sheet and
    reported by the Chief Financial Officer while the quality of data will
    become a technical reporting metric and key IT performance indicator. New
    accounting and reporting practices will emerge for measuring and assessing
    the value of data to help organizations demonstrate how data quality fuels
    business performance.

--  Calculating risk will be used more pervasively across enterprises for
    small and large decision-making and will be increasingly automated by
    information technology. Today in most organizations, risk calculation is
    done by a select group of individuals using complicated processes. In the
    future, risk calculation will be automated providing greater transparency
    to more easily examine past exposure, forecast direct and indirect risk,
    and set aside capital to self-insure and cover risk.

--  The role of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) will change, making
    this corporate officer responsible for reporting on data quality and risk
    to the Board of Directors. The CIO will have the mandate to govern the use
    of information and report on the quality of the information provided to
    shareholders.

--  Individual employees will be required to take more responsibility for
    recognizing problems and participating in the governance process to
    facilitate greater operational transparency and the identification of risk.
    They will be aided by new categories of operational software that will
    demonstrate common data governance problems and allow employees to self-
    govern; sponsor and vote on new policies; provide feedback on existing ones
    and participate in dynamic data governance.
    

    
Data has become the new currency in today's information economy, but
many businesses make the wrong decisions by not using the right
information. "There is no one-size-fits-all approach to data governance,"
said Richard Livesley, head of information governance and quality, BMO
Financial Group. "Every company must configure their own data governance
program based on their individual needs. Likewise, there are different
levels of data governance maturity and different ways of attaining it. In
just a few years, data governance will become a key benchmark as boards
of directors recognize their fiduciary responsibility to enhance and
protect data, and markets measure business performance by looking at data
value and risk on the balance sheet."

    The IBM Data Governance Council is a group of 50 global companies,
including Abbott Labs, American Express, Bank of America, Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd, Bank of Montreal, Bell Canada, BMO Financial
Group, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, Discover Financial, Kasikornbank,
MasterCard, Nordea Bank, Wachovia, Washington Mutual and the World Bank,
among others, that have pioneered best practices around risk assessment
and data governance to help the business world take a more disciplined
approach to how companies handle data.

    According to the Council, investors and consumers alike will benefit as
data governance emerges as a required discipline for organizations, giving
rise to greater trust, better transparency and reduced risk. Data
governance today is at a crossroads, creating the opportunity for a marked
change over the next four years as data quality evolves into a key
performance indicator for businesses worldwide.

    To meet growing market needs, the Council plans to build an Information
Governance Framework based on their existing Data Governance Maturity
Model that will define standards and best practices. This new framework
will provide guidance for organizations to execute data governance at a
granular level with defined roles, tasks, activities and a broad set of
data governance procedures to make data governance a part of business
operations.

    "Organizations today understand that data governance is a strategic
imperative but they need help making it work," said Steve Adler, chairman
of the Council. "Upcoming work by the Council will help organizations
better understand governance, how it will benefit the bottom line and be
reported to the markets, as well as the desired end result for each
business. This is an important contribution the Data Governance Council
can make in the marketplace and we invite others to participate as we
build standards that define the next level of maturity for this important
discipline."

    Data governance helps organizations govern appropriate use of and access
to critical information such as customer information, financial details
and unstructured content, measuring and reporting information quality and
risk to enhance value and mitigate exposures. IBM's work in this area
supports and furthers the company's Information on Demand strategy,
announced two years ago, that has delivered results through consistent
earnings growth, hundreds of new customer wins, strategic acquisitions
and industry-first software offerings.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Monday it would be willing to reopen talks to buy all or part of Yahoo Inc, but only if a new Yahoo board is elected -- a big boost for financier Carl Icahn's board slate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which broke off months-long talks in early May to buy the Internet company for $47.5 billion, said it would resume talks immediately if a new board were elected at Yahoo's August 1 stockholder meeting. Yahoo shares leapt 12 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft statement came after Icahn, a billionaire who owns more than 4 percent of Yahoo, issued an open letter saying he had "spoken frequently" to Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer over the last week. Previously, the two had not spoken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first concrete confirmation we have that Microsoft is willing to come back to the table," UBS analyst Ben Schachter said. "It gives Icahn a much stronger hand going into the shareholder vote. It significantly raises his profile and his likelihood for success."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer told Icahn that a big impediment to any Yahoo deal was his concern that the current board could "mismanage" the company while the deal awaits regulatory approval, a process that could take nine months or more, according to Icahn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview, Icahn argued that his proposed dissident board slate would make Microsoft feel more secure in risking a large sum of capital to complete the deal during the regulatory approval process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to realize there is no great comfort zone between the current Yahoo board and Microsoft," Icahn said. "During this waiting period for regulatory approval, any acquirer -- not just Microsoft -- would want a steward they would feel comfortable with."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, Yahoo issued a statement saying it continues to be willing to reopen talks with Microsoft, but "we feel strongly" that any deal negotiated between Icahn and Microsoft "would not lead to an outcome that would be in the best interests of Yahoo stockholders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Microsoft and Mr. Ballmer really want to purchase Yahoo, we again invite them to make a proposal immediately," Yahoo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo is still talking to Time Warner Inc's AOL unit about a tie-up, a person familiar with those negotiations said on Monday. Any such deal -- which would factor in the expected boost to Yahoo's bottom line as a result of its recent search advertising deal with Google Inc -- is unlikely before the August 1 annual meeting, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW BOSS SEARCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn also said he was actively interviewing replacements for Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang and its management team. "I am moving towards getting a potential new management team for Yahoo, including a new CEO," he said in a phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-awaited signals that the Microsoft-Yahoo talks could be revived sent Yahoo shares up $2.56 to $23.91 on Nasdaq, while Microsoft added 5 cents to close at $26.03.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanford C. Bernstein senior Internet analyst Jeffrey Lindsay said that if Microsoft is serious about resuming talks, "there is rationale for voting for the Icahn slate and essentially ousting the current Yahoo board and probably the management too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the end of the day, you would have to expect that the big institutional shareholders would go for a deal with Microsoft," Lindsay added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mithras Capital partner Mark Nelson, whose firm controls 1.7 million Yahoo shares, said management change at Yahoo "has to happen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They've had plenty of time to right the ship," Nelson said. "The record over the past two or three years speaks for itself. They blew it and new management is needed to better exploit all the assets there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks between Yahoo and Microsoft broke down in early May. Microsoft originally offered $31 per share and raised it to $33, but Yahoo demanded $37 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After talks collapsed, Icahn amassed a stake in Yahoo and launched a proxy war to replace the Yahoo board and management, claiming they "botched" the Microsoft talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his letter, Icahn said: "Steve made it clear to me that if a new board were elected, he would be interested in discussing a major transaction with Yahoo," including purchasing either its "search" function with large financial guarantees, or an outright purchase of Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it would be premature to discuss details, such as the price it might offer for Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn said he would immediately move to replace Yang if his board slate were elected at the August meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo's biggest investor, Capital Research, has told Yang it may vote against the board in the proxy fight, the blog AllThingsD reported on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Robert MacMillan and Yinka Adegoke in New York, Dai Wakabayashi in Seattle, and Eric Auchard and Anupreeta Das in San Francisco; Editing by Derek Caney and Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details on Yahoo-AOL talks, report on Yahoo investor)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Dane Hamilton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 7 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said
on Monday it would be willing to reopen talks to buy all or
part of Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), but only if a new Yahoo board is
elected -- a big boost for financier Carl Icahn's board slate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, which broke off months-long talks in early May
to buy the Internet company for $47.5 billion, said it would
resume talks immediately if a new board were elected at Yahoo's
Aug. 1 stockholder meeting. Yahoo shares leapt 12 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Microsoft statement came after Icahn, a billionaire who
owns more than 4 percent of Yahoo, issued an open letter saying
he had "spoken frequently" to Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer over
the last week. Previously, the two had not spoken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is the first concrete confirmation we have that
Microsoft is willing to come back to the table," UBS analyst
Ben Schachter said. "It gives Icahn a much stronger hand going
into the shareholder vote. It significantly raises his profile
and his likelihood for success."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer told Icahn that a big impediment to any Yahoo deal
was his concern that the current board could "mismanage" the
company while the deal awaits regulatory approval, a process
that could take nine months or more, according to Icahn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an interview, Icahn argued that his proposed dissident
board slate would make Microsoft feel more secure in risking a
large sum of capital to complete the deal during the regulatory
approval process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to realize there is
no great comfort zone between the current Yahoo board and
Microsoft," Icahn said. "During this waiting period for
regulatory approval, any acquirer -- not just Microsoft --
would want a steward they would feel comfortable with."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In response, Yahoo issued a statement saying it continues
to be willing to reopen talks with Microsoft, but "we feel
strongly" that any deal negotiated between Icahn and Microsoft
"would not lead to an outcome that would be in the best
interests of Yahoo stockholders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If Microsoft and Mr. Ballmer really want to purchase
Yahoo, we again invite them to make a proposal immediately,"
Yahoo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo is still talking to Time Warner Inc's (TWX.N) AOL
unit about a tie-up, a person familiar with those negotiations
said on Monday. Any such deal -- which would factor in the
expected boost to Yahoo's bottom line as a result of its recent
search advertising deal with Google Inc (GOOG.O) -- is unlikely
before the Aug. 1 annual meeting, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW BOSS SEARCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn also said he was actively interviewing replacements
for Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang and its management team. "I am moving
towards getting a potential new management team for Yahoo,
including a new CEO," he said in a phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The long-awaited signals that the Microsoft-Yahoo talks
could be revived sent Yahoo shares up $2.56 to $23.91 on
Nasdaq, while Microsoft added 5 cents to close at $26.03.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sanford C. Bernstein senior Internet analyst Jeffrey
Lindsay said that if Microsoft is serious about resuming talks,
"there is rationale for voting for the Icahn slate and
essentially ousting the current Yahoo board and probably the
management too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At the end of the day, you would have to expect that the
big institutional shareholders would go for a deal with
Microsoft," Lindsay added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mithras Capital partner Mark Nelson, whose firm controls
1.7 million Yahoo shares, said management change at Yahoo "has
to happen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They've had plenty of time to right the ship," Nelson
said. "The record over the past two or three years speaks for
itself. They blew it and new management is needed to better
exploit all the assets there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talks between Yahoo and Microsoft broke down in early May.
Microsoft originally offered $31 per share and raised it to
$33, but Yahoo demanded $37 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After talks collapsed, Icahn amassed a stake in Yahoo and
launched a proxy war to replace the Yahoo board and management,
claiming they "botched" the Microsoft talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his letter, Icahn said: "Steve made it clear to me that
if a new board were elected, he would be interested in
discussing a major transaction with Yahoo," including
purchasing either its "search" function with large financial
guarantees, or an outright purchase of Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said it would be premature to discuss details,
such as the price it might offer for Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn said he would immediately move to replace Yang if his
board slate were elected at the August meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo's biggest investor, Capital Research, has told Yang
it may vote against the board in the proxy fight, the blog
AllThingsD reported on Monday.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Monday it is ready to resume talks to buy Yahoo Inc, but not with the current leadership, in a boost for activist investor Carl Icahn's proxy fight to replace Yahoo's board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Yahoo jumped nearly 11 percent to $23.68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is a timeline of key events in Microsoft's pursuit of Yahoo, stretching back more than two years, when the Web pioneer's financial results began weakening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early 2006 - Yahoo begins to report a string of weak quarterly results that have stretched on since then, reflecting competitive missteps by the company, market share gains by rival Google Inc, changes in the online advertising landscape and weakening spending in some ad segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late 2006/early 2007 - Microsoft and Yahoo begin preliminary talks on various partnerships, including a merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2007&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;February - Yahoo, under the leadership of previous Chief Executive Terry Semel, tells Microsoft it is not the right time to discuss a takeover, as the Yahoo board sees great potential in its new advertising technology and by making internal organizational changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;June 12 - A strong minority of Yahoo shareholders challenges Yahoo's direction, as CEO Semel comes under fire. Nearly a third of votes cast at the company's annual shareholders' meeting oppose some of Yahoo's directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;June 18 - Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang takes over as chief executive as Semel steps aside. Semel remains Yahoo chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2008&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;January 31 - Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer makes a $44.6 billion, $31-per-share, cash-and-stock takeover offer to Yahoo's board. Semel resigns as chairman and is replaced by Roy Bostock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;February 1 - Microsoft makes the offer public. Its shares fall 6.6 percent to $30.45; Yahoo shares rise 48 percent to $28.38.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;February 11 - Yahoo rejects the Microsoft offer as too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mid-February - Yahoo begins talks with Time Warner Inc on a deal to combine Time Warner's AOL unit with Yahoo in exchange for Time Warner taking a stake in the merged company. MySpace owner News Corp and Yahoo also discuss a tie-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 18 - Yahoo gives financial forecasts for the next two years, in an effort to prove it is worth more than Microsoft bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 28 - One of seven face-to-face meetings takes place between the "senior-most" executives of Microsoft and Yahoo to discuss the bid. Yahoo asks how Microsoft would handle regulatory issues, including antitrust concerns, in a merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 4-7 - Microsoft is reevaluating its bid for Yahoo because the Internet company may have lost value since Microsoft first made its off. Microsoft sets a three-week deadline for Yahoo to reach a deal or possibly face a proxy fight. Yahoo again rejects Microsoft's bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 9 - Yahoo says it will test Google search ads on its site, which could be more lucrative than selling its own search ads. Talks with Yahoo and Time Warner/AOL heat up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 15 - At another meeting between Yahoo and Microsoft executives and their financial advisers, Yahoo asks about Microsoft's integration plans and Yahoo raises a list of "key non-price deal terms" it believes are critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 26 - Microsoft's deadline to Yahoo passes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 3 - After several earlier meetings, Yang meets Ballmer in Seattle. Microsoft verbally raises its offer to $33 a share, or $47.5 billion, from its original $31/share bid. Yahoo wants $37 per share, or about $5 billion more. Late in the day, Ballmer calls off the talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 15 - Carl Icahn proposes a full dissident board slate for election at Yahoo's annual shareholder meeting in July. Icahn says he now holds a 4.3 percent stake in Yahoo, including 9.9 million shares and 49 million call options. Yahoo Chairman Bostock replies to Icahn that "none of the alternatives we are considering would preclude us from entering into a transaction with Microsoft or any other party."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 18 - Microsoft says it has raised with Yahoo an "alternative" deal that would not involve the software maker buying all of the web company but says it could reconsider pursuing a full acquisition. Microsoft proposed buying Yahoo's search business and as part of the deal Microsoft would buy a stake in what remains of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 22 - One Yahoo board member retires and the company nominates its nine remaining directors for reelection, setting the stage for a showdown with Icahn. It postpones its annual shareholders' meeting from sometime in early July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;June 6 - Icahn says Yahoo should offer to sell itself to Microsoft of $34.375 a share. Throughout June, the two sides exchange a series of letters in an acrimonious war of words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;June 12 - Yahoo announces search advertising deal with Google for up to 10 years, and says talks with Microsoft have ended. Yahoo forecast an $800 million annual revenue opportunity from the Google deal, and a $250 million-$450 million boost to cash flow in the first 12 months. U.S. lawmakers are expected to scrutinize the deal on antitrust concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;June 13 - Microsoft says it had offered to pay $8 billion, or $35 a share, for a 16 percent equity stake in Yahoo, and $1 billion in up-front payments to acquire Yahoo's search advertising assets. A revenue-sharing deal would have given Yahoo an added $1 billion in annual operating income, it says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;June 18 - The top Republican on the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee, Joe Barton, sends letter to Yahoo expressing concern about the effect of the Google deal on web users' privacy and advertising rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;June 26 - Yahoo unveils a reorganization plan that creates four operational units under President Susan Decker. The move comes amid the departure of several senior executives from the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same day, Icahn files his proxy for Yahoo, saying that if his slate is elected, it will seek to hire a new CEO to replace Yang, eliminate a severance plan, and sell Yahoo to Microsoft for at least $33 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;July 2 - Sources say Microsoft and Yahoo continue to hold separate talks with potential media partners, including Time Warner and News Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;July 7 - Microsoft says it is interested in discussing a major transaction with Yahoo, such as the purchase of all or part of the company, only if Yahoo elects a new board. Microsoft says it has concluded that it cannot reach an agreement with Yahoo's current management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;July 22 - Yahoo to announce second quarter results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;August 1 - Yahoo annual shareholders' meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources: Statements from Microsoft, Yahoo, Google and Icahn; Reuters stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Compiled by Tiffany Wu, Eric Auchard and Peter Henderson; editing by Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Card Designed for Alabama State Employees Credit Union Receives
       Elan Award for Best Secure Financial Card As It Delivers
                     Record-breaking New Business
SAN ANTONIO--(Business Wire)--
The International Card Manufacturers Association (ICMA) recently
awarded top honors to Harland Clarke for its first clear Visa(R) check
card created for a financial institution. The see-through card was
designed by Harland Clarke for Alabama State Employees Credit Union,
and printed in partnership with Oberthur Technologies of America Corp.
The clear card was created to support the 27,000-member credit union's
ClearChecking(TM) program.

   The ClearCheck(R) Card is a debit card designed as the cornerstone
of Alabama State Employees Credit Union's ClearChecking(R) program.
The innovative and eye-catching design is able to visually communicate
the new product offering to its audience in a way that traditional
print materials couldn't. Featured in television and print ads, the
ClearCheck(R) Card was created to appeal to the 24-35 age market and
differentiate Alabama State Employees Credit Union, but is generating
interest in other age groups, as well.

   "The card is very popular with prospective members and our
existing members," said Barry Mask, Marketing Director for Alabama
State Employees Credit Union. "In the first two weeks of its
introduction, new checking accounts increased by more than 300
percent. New members told us that they had considered switching
checking accounts and the new clear card was so unique and innovative,
they decided to make the move to Alabama State Employees Credit
Union."

   The Alabama State Employees Credit Union's ClearCheck(R) Card was
nominated for the ICMA's Elan Awards for Card Manufacturing Excellence
by Oberthur Technologies in partnership with Michelle Thornton,
Harland Clarke's Director of Emerging Businesses. The competition is
considered the pinnacle of design innovation and card technical
achievement in the plastic card industry. Entries were judged solely
on the card features since entries were not identified by company.

   "This card is the perfect example of the collaborative approach
Harland Clarke takes with our clients," noted Thornton. "From the
moment Mr. Mask discussed the idea with Peter Mickler, his Harland
Clarke account executive, the wheels were in motion. Peter and our
Card Services team, led by Amy Turnock, were absolutely focused on
ensuring that this card for Alabama State Employees Credit Union would
be the innovative card they wanted."

   Added Mask, "We've had a long and positive relationship with
Harland Clarke, so we weren't surprised with the efforts made to make
this clear debit card a reality. But we were so pleased with this
particular experience -- we sent Amy a bouquet of flowers!"

   The card for Alabama State Employees Credit Union won the Best
Secure Financial Card category, beating out finalists Citibank and
Banco de Popular de Puerto Rico. Other award categories were Best
Non-Secure Card, Technical Achievement, Best Gift Card, Best ID Card,
Unique Innovation and Design, Best "Free Form" Design, Judges' Choice,
People's Choice, Best Vendor New Product, Process or Material. Other
winners included Blockbuster, Apple, Sears, Nordstrom, Target
Corporation and Target Financial Services.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jul 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today unveiled the results of a cross-industry customer
survey indicating that businesses need to better inventory their
information to help reduce risk and derive more value from their business
information.

    According to the 2008 Metadata Market Survey conducted by IBM and Gavilan
Research Associates, risk mitigation and data governance are key drivers
of new projects to better track data through the use of metadata -- which
is literally information about information.

    Metadata describes data by relating key business and technical information
to it, making it possible to index, govern and use valuable corporate
information, similar to the way card catalogs supply information about
books. Metadata can also be found in many everyday applications. For
example, it is even embedded in music where digital music players display
song tracks, title information, genre and additional information about the
contents of the recording.

    Due to growing information management challenges associated with risk,
information overload, and regulations, companies are increasingly making
it a priority to better understand how their data is accessed or altered,
and improve their understanding of the accuracy and completeness of
information.

    According to the survey, respondents are focused on organizing, reusing
and sharing corporate knowledge and keeping up with increasing pressures
to supply better information to drive their businesses and remain
competitive.

    Respondents surveyed said that failure to address the problem of better
managing their metadata will result in increased costs to manage and
support their business operations and additional risk exposure. The
growing significance of this problem is attributed to increasing
operational complexities, loss of customer revenue and potential fines
from non-compliance with state and government regulations.

    Sixty-seven percent of respondents said that data governance and data
stewardship issues were among the top three metadata-related issues or
projects they were struggling with, yet 45 percent do not yet have a data
governance council or data governance projects underway. Eighty percent of
respondents said they are struggling with other information-related issues
such as documenting business metadata and 64 percent are documenting
metadata for data warehouses, data marts and analytical applications.

    "Unfortunately, most companies haven't solved the problem of effectively
managing corporate metadata, as evidenced by the survey results," said Stu
Carty, president and founder of Gavilan Research Associates. "One of the
key challenges is coordinating and synchronizing information across
disparate tools and information sources leading to better understanding of
where information resides and how it is used."

    While the need to search, integrate, and govern data across an enterprise
grows, managing metadata is becoming more important since every
application needs metadata to operate -- from data warehouses, master
data management software and enterprise applications to Web-based
applications.

    In a business setting, metadata can add context to information to allow it
to be better understood, used, and tracked throughout an organization.
Spreadsheets, word processing documents, databases and software
applications can be enhanced by associating critical metadata such as
information about business definitions and ownership, processing rules for
moving data, and tracing how information moves through the enterprise
impacting applications.

    The survey was conducted among more than 300 data management professionals
from leading Global 5000 companies throughout the US, Canada and other
countries.

    IBM offers an industry-unique approach to metadata through its InfoSphere
product portfolio, which accelerates the delivery of trusted information
throughout an enterprise. InfoSphere products make the capture,
maintenance, and association of metadata a natural and active consequence
of using the tools.

    The InfoSphere portfolio captures metadata from data sources, forms
metadata connections across systems, and continuously records metadata to
track exactly what happens to data as it is integrated. It also allows
business glossaries to be associated to data elements, bridging the gap
between business and IT. This allows information to be better understood
and trusted, and more easily integrated, both within source systems and as
it moves throughout the enterprise.

    Gavilan Research provides market research, training and industry insight
on metadata management applications, vendors and product research to help
companies address their key issues related to metadata management. For

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Monday said it would be willing to reopen talks to buy all or part of Yahoo Inc -- but only if a new Yahoo board is elected, a major boost for investor Carl Icahn's board slate.&lt;/p&gt;

Microsoft shares were up 4 cents to $26.02.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks between Yahoo and Microsoft broke down in early May. Microsoft originally offered $31 per share and raised it to $33, but Yahoo demanded $37 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After talks collapsed, Icahn amassed a stake in Yahoo and launched a proxy war to replace the Yahoo board and management, claiming they "botched" the Microsoft talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his letter Icahn said: "Steve made it clear to me that if a new board were elected, he would be interested in discussing a major transaction with Yahoo," including purchasing either its "search" function with large financial guarantees, or an outright purchase of Yahoo, said Icahn in the letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it would be premature to discuss details, such as the price it might offer for Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn said he would immediately move to replace Yang if his board slate were elected at the August meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(With reporting by Robert MacMillan and Anupreeta Das)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Dane Hamilton; editing by John Wallace and Gunna Dickson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The following is Microsoft Corp's statement on Yahoo Inc following activist investor Carl Icahn's open letter to the Internet company's shareholders on Monday:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past week we have had the opportunity to discuss with Carl Icahn the prospects for a possible agreement between Microsoft and Yahoo!.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite working since January 31 of this year, as well as in the early part of last year, we have never been able to reach an agreement in a timely way on acceptable terms with the current management and Board of Directors at Yahoo!. We have concluded that we cannot reach an agreement with them. We confirm, however, that after the shareholder election Microsoft would be interested in discussing with a new board a major transaction with Yahoo!, such as either a transaction to purchase the "Search" function with large financial guarantees or, in the alternative, purchasing the whole company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Mr. Icahn notes in his statement today, it would be premature to discuss at this time important details such as the price or other terms of a possible transaction. We respect the right of Yahoo!'s shareholders to determine the destiny of their company, and we do not intend to engage in ongoing commentary on these issues in advance of Yahoo!'s shareholder meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we explained on June 12 when Yahoo! announced an agreement with Google, we believe that our proposed search acquisition and partnership would have delivered superior value to Yahoo!'s shareholders and the marketplace as a whole. We have not changed our position, even as we continue to move forward with our own online search and advertising offerings. We therefore welcome interest by Mr. Icahn in pursuing this and other discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While of course there can be no assurance of a future transaction, we will be prepared to enter into discussions immediately after Yahoo!'s shareholder meeting if a new board is elected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 7 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded Canadian
company Suncor Energy Inc (SU.TO)(SU.N) to "overweight" from
"neutral," saying the 20 percent decline in the company's share
price in the last six weeks far exceeds the impact of it
possibly not meeting its oil production target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Friedman Billings Ramsey also raised its rating on Suncor,
Canada's biggest oil producer and refiner by market value, to
"outperform" from "market perform" on the stock's recent
underperformance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Suncor Toronto-listed shares have lost about 24 percent of
their value from a high of C$73.10 on May 21, while the TSX
Energy Index .SPTTEN has lost about 8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan analyst Katherine Minyard said expectations for
lower production outlook is likely driving negative sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street analysts doubt that Suncor will be able to meet
its 2008 oil sands production target, given its
lower-than-average production in the first half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Minyard believes the financial impact of lower
production expectations to be "far out of line with the
evaporation of C$13 billion in market cap in the past 6 weeks".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Minyard estimates that Suncor's operating cash flows would
be hurt by only C$800 million in the next 12 months, assuming a
crude oil price of $110 per barrel and lower production in the
second half of this year and first half of next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Friedman's Amir Arif said, "We believe that the issues
related to the underperformance are mostly out of the way. We
expect second half operational improvements and positive
earnings revisions in 2009 to be the key drivers for the
stock."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Arif raised his price target on the stock to $85 from $53.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Suncor shares were trading at C$57.67 on the Toronto Stock
Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;  HOUSTON, TX, Jul 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference 2008 -- Mondo (COPN: MONDO),
Denmark's largest provider of Microsoft-based solutions and services,
today announced the availability of its new Mondo Solution Selling(R)
Accelerator for Microsoft Dynamics CRM 4.0, an integrated CRM plug-in
designed to boost sales effectiveness with proven sales management
methodologies. The Solution Selling(R) Suite of planning, management,
execution methodologies and skills, developed by Sales Performance
International (SPI), is now available directly within Microsoft Dynamics
CRM exclusively via the new Mondo Solution Selling(R) Accelerator. The
new Accelerator also provides Microsoft Business Partners with a robust
foundation to extend the Mondo Solution Selling(R) Accelerator with
industry specific knowledge about buying and selling processes, key player
roles, pains and capability visions, resulting in improved CRM relevance
and adoption by sales professionals and managers.

    Within the new Mondo Solution Selling(R) Accelerator, Mondo is also
providing integrated access to its sales community web site, thereby
enabling the very first "Focused Social CRM" environment within Microsoft
Dynamics CRM. Mondo's sales community web site, with a specific focus on

experiences and advice with each other, deepening their Solution
Selling(R) knowledge base and broadening their contact network. The
integrated sales community also provides access to Solution
Selling(R)-specific knowledge from external sources, like news, podcasts
and blogs directly fed from SPI's web site. There are important
opportunities to extend the community space in future releases to
integrate with SPI's SalesWiki(TM) and Solution Selling(R) University for
online training in the methodology. Mondo's new Accelerator will be
highlighted in Microsoft Corporate Vice President Kirill Tatarinov's
keynote speech on July 8.

technologies and features within Microsoft Dynamics CRM 4.0, giving
Microsoft Business Partners a robust platform to build vertical solutions
that integrate the Solution Selling(R) tools," said Lars Munch Johansen,

hand-in-hand with the Solution Selling(R) concept. Both will add
tremendous value in boosting overall sales effectiveness."

effectively measured and assessed using tangible and "verifiable outcomes"
that keep sales teams on track. This results-based approach gives
management better insight into their sales pipeline and ensures that no
crucial steps are skipped along the way. By having sales people maintain
these outcomes in Microsoft Outlook, managers are ensured of a more
accurate sales forecast. The Accelerator leverages Microsoft's

&lt;p&gt;Patients More Likely to Stay on Lipitor Than Simvastatin, a Large Observational Study Shows

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer announced today that new statin users who took Lipitor(R) (atorvastatin
calcium) were significantly more likely to stay on their medication compared to
those who took simvastatin, according to an observational study of more than
186,000 patients in one of the largest U.S. managed care claims databases. The
results were published in the July issue of Current Medical Research and
Opinion.

"It is important for patients to remain on their medications, especially those
with chronic conditions such as high cholesterol, which when uncontrolled may
increase a patient's risk for heart attacks and strokes," said Dr. JoAnne M.
Foody, study lead author, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical
School and director of the Cardiovascular Wellness Center at Brigham and
Women's/Faulkner Hospitals, Boston. "In patients who take statins to manage
their cholesterol levels, poor persistence has been linked with an increase in
heart attacks and strokes in addition to higher healthcare costs."

According to the results:

    --  Of patients without prior cardiovascular events (n=175,322), those
        treated with Lipitor were a significant 15 percent less likely to
        discontinue therapy in the first year than those treated with
        simvastatin.

    --  Of patients who had at least one prior cardiovascular event (n=11,331),
        those treated with Lipitor were a significant 22 percent less likely to
        discontinue therapy than those treated with simvastatin.

A subanalysis examined the persistence rates of patients aged 65 years and
older, who are at a higher risk for cardiovascular events and are known to have
lower persistence rates than younger patients. In this retrospective database
analysis, persistence rates were defined as the number of days a patient
remained on treatment in the first year following medication start date.

According to the results:

-0-
*T
  --  Overall, persistence was worse in elderly patients than in
       younger patients for both statins, but the relative difference
       between Lipitor and simvastatin users was similar to that of
       the overall patient population.
      -- Elderly patients without prior cardiovascular events
          (n=8,278) treated with Lipitor were a significant 22 percent
          less likely to discontinue therapy than those treated with
          simvastatin.
      -- Elderly patients with at least one prior cardiovascular event
          (n=980) treated with Lipitor were a significant 26 percent
          less likely to discontinue therapy than those treated with
          simvastatin.
*T

"Today, physicians face increasing pressure to switch from established statin
therapy to generics, based on the perception that all statins are equivalent,"
said Dr. Rochelle Chaiken, vice president of Pfizer's global cardiovascular and
metabolic medical team. "This observational study provides important real-world
insights into statin usage patterns and suggests that the choice of statin may
have a significant effect on whether a patient remains on their prescribed
medication. When choosing a medication, it is critical for clinicians to
consider all of the factors that may influence the long-term effectiveness of
therapy."

About the study

This Pfizer-funded study was a retrospective analysis using anonymous
patient-level health plan data from IMS Health, a healthcare information and
consulting company. At the time of the analysis, the IMS database included fully
adjudicated medical and pharmacy claims for 52 million individual patients from
92 health plans across the U.S. A total of 186,653 primary and secondary
prevention patients with at least one complete year of follow up were included
in this study; 136,652 patients received atorvastatin, and 50,001 received
simvastatin.

As with all observational studies, this study has some limitations. For example,
the reasons for medication discontinuation were not tracked in the database.
Although the analysis accounted for a range of important variables, differences
in persistence after adjusting for all known baseline imbalances could still be
due in part to unmeasured confounding factors such as differences in
effectiveness, side-effects, cost or other attributes of the statins. Further
studies are required to explore these factors.

Important U.S. Prescribing Information

Lipitor is a prescription medication. It is used in patients with multiple risk
factors for heart disease such as family history, high blood pressure, age, low
HDL ("good" cholesterol) or smoking to reduce the risk of a heart attack and
stroke, certain kinds of heart surgery and chest pain.

Lipitor is also used in patients with type 2 diabetes and at least one other
risk factor for heart disease such as high blood pressure, smoking or
complications of diabetes, including eye disease and protein in urine, to reduce
the risk of heart attack and stroke.

Lipitor is used in patients with existing coronary heart disease to reduce the
risk of heart attack, stroke, certain kinds of heart surgery, hospitalization
for heart failure, and chest pain.

When diet and exercise alone are not enough, Lipitor is used along with a
low-fat diet and exercise to lower cholesterol.

Lipitor is not for everyone. It is not for those with liver problems. And it is
not for women who are nursing, pregnant or may become pregnant.

Patients taking Lipitor should tell their doctors if they feel any new muscle
pain or weakness. This could be a sign of rare but serious muscle side effects.
Patients should tell their doctors about all medications they take. This may
help avoid serious drug interactions. Doctors should do blood tests to check
liver function before and during treatment and may adjust the dose. The most
common side effects are gas, constipation, stomach pain and heartburn. They tend
to be mild and often go away.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Icahn comment, analyst comment, background, share price,
byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Dane Hamilton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 7 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on
Monday said it would be willing to reopen talks to buy all or
part of Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) -- but only if a new Yahoo board is
elected, a major boost for investor Carl Icahn's board slate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, which broke off talks in early May to buy the
Internet company for $47.5 billion, said it would resume
discussions immediately if a new board were elected at Yahoo's
Aug. 1 stockholder meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Microsoft statement came after Icahn, the billionaire
financier who holds over 4 percent of Yahoo, issued his own
statement that he had "spoken frequently" to Microsoft CEO
Steve Ballmer over the last week. Previously, the two had not
spoken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer told Icahn that a big impediment to any Yahoo deal
was his concern that the current board could "mismanage" the
company while the deal awaits regulatory approval, a process
that could take nine months or more, according to Icahn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an interview, Icahn argued that his proposed dissident
board slate would make Microsoft feel more secure in risking a
large sum of capital to complete the deal during the regulatory
approval process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to realize there is
no great comfort zone between the current Yahoo board and
Microsoft," said Icahn. "During this waiting period for
regulatory approval, any acquirer -- not just Microsoft --
would want a steward they would feel comfortable with."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an open letter disclosed on Monday, Icahn said the Yahoo
board was the major impediment to any Microsoft deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In response, Yahoo issued a statement saying it continues
to be willing to reopen talks with Microsoft, but "we feel
strongly" that any deal negotiated between Icahn and Microsoft
"would not lead to an outcome that would be in the best
interests of Yahoo stockholders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn also said he is actively interviewing replacements
for Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang and its management team. "I am moving
towards getting a potential new management team for Yahoo
including a new CEO," he said in a phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The long-awaited signals that the Microsoft-Yahoo talks
could be revived sent Yahoo stock up more than 10 percent in
early trade on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sanford C. Bernstein senior Internet analyst Jeffrey
Lindsay said that if Microsoft is serious about resuming talks,
"there is rationale for voting for the Icahn slate and
essentially ousting the current Yahoo board and probably the
management too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At the end of the day, you would have to expect that the
big institutional shareholders would go for a deal with
Microsoft," said Lindsay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo stock at midday was trading up $2.55, or 11.9
percent, to $23.90 on Nasdaq. Microsoft shares were up 4 cents
to $26.02.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talks between Yahoo and Microsoft broke down in early May.
Microsoft originally offered $31 per share and raised it to
$33, but Yahoo demanded $37 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After talks collapsed, Icahn amassed a stake in Yahoo and
launched a proxy war to replace the Yahoo board and management,
claiming they "botched" the Microsoft talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his letter Icahn said: "Steve made it clear to me that
if a new board were elected, he would be interested in
discussing a major transaction with Yahoo," including
purchasing either its "search" function with large financial
guarantees, or an outright purchase of Yahoo, said Icahn in the
letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said it would be premature to discuss details,
such as the price it might offer for Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn said he would immediately move to replace Yang if his
board slate were elected at the August meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (With reporting by Robert MacMillan and Anupreeta Das)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Dane Hamilton; editing by John Wallace and

&lt;p&gt;  EMERYVILLE, CA, Jul 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Ravenflow, the leader in rapid requirements solutions for business
analysts and requirements engineers, today unveiled RAVEN Express, the
world's first requirements elicitation and definition product that
directly integrates with Microsoft Word(TM). This innovative solution
empowers business analysts to play a more active role in the requirements
process, enabling them to automatically identify missing or incomplete
requirements in Word documents with the push of a button.

    "Improving developer/client communications is a critical area for all
software development teams. The integration of RAVEN Express and Microsoft
Word transforms Word into a powerful requirements modeling solution," said
Sam Guckenheimer, group product planner for Microsoft Visual Studio Team
System and author of "Software Engineering with Microsoft Visual Studio
Team System." "RAVEN's integration with Team Foundation Server provides an
integrated requirements definition and management environment. Now, for
the first time requirements can be written and validated in Word and
integrated directly into TFS."

    Unlike other requirements environments, RAVEN Express does not require the
business analyst to become skilled at additional applications or
languages, so the learning curve is minimal and the reward immediate. By
assessing requirements directly within Microsoft Word, analysts are able
to communicate more clearly with stakeholders and subject matter experts,
resulting in increased customer satisfaction, decreased project costs
downstream and better quality requirements overall.

    "Missing, incomplete or vague requirements are still the main reasons
software projects fail," said Susan Boers, President and CEO of Ravenflow.
"Ravenflow has analyzed thousands of specifications and enlisted the
feedback of customers and prospects in an effort to address this problem
in real-world environments. As a result, RAVEN Express was developed to
help business analysts improve the clarity of requirements in an
application format with which they are most comfortable -- Microsoft
Word."

    RAVEN dramatically accelerates requirements definition. Ravenflow
customers report cutting weeks and even months off their project
schedules as they use RAVEN to quickly build stakeholder consensus and
find missing requirements early in the process, before coding has
started. With RAVEN Express, business analysts can now additionally
pinpoint requirements problems in their Microsoft Word user stories and
use cases, as well as business process workflow descriptions.

    "RAVEN Express extends RAVEN's ability of capturing and validating
requirements to Microsoft Word -- arguably the most popular environment
for requirements definition, and one with which business analysts are both
familiar and comfortable," said Kurt Bittner, chief technology officer for
Ivar Jacobson International and author of "Use Case Modeling." "RAVEN
Express provides ease of use that stands alone or can serve as an entry
point to RAVEN's full functionality."

    Current Ravenflow customers leveraging previous versions of RAVEN qualify
for an upgrade that will include RAVEN Express as part of their
maintenance agreement. RAVEN Express is available immediately.

    Ravenflow and its partners will be hosting a weekly webinar series on
improving requirements practices. Registration for the webinar can be
completed online at http://www.ravenflow.com.

    Expands Document and Payment Processing Capabilities for Newest
                Version of Popular Microsoft ERP System
PORTSMOUTH, N.H. and HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
Bottomline Technologies (NASDAQ: EPAY), a leading provider of
collaborative payment, invoice and document automation solutions,
today at Microsoft's 2008 Worldwide Partner Conference announced
expanded functionality for automating business-critical transactional
processes within Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009. This new release allows
the growing number of organizations standardized on Microsoft Dynamics
AX to achieve the business benefits of more streamlined, electronic
processes involving transactional documents such as invoices, payments
and purchase orders.

   Integrating seamlessly with Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009,
Bottomline's document process automation solution allows organizations
seeking to quickly extend the capabilities of their Microsoft
application without custom programming. Through this functionality,
organizations can build upon the strengths of Microsoft Dynamics AX
2009 to further increase user productivity, reduce costs associated
with managing complex global financial and supply chain processes, and
respond to the changing demands of the regulatory environment.

   "The ability to manage the generation and delivery of
transactional documents electronically has become a strategic factor
in helping organizations compete more effectively in a global
marketplace," said Gareth Priest, Vice President of Global Product
Management, Bottomline Technologies. "Since first introducing support
for the Microsoft Dynamics AX platform in 2006, our solution has
provided this growing community with the transactional document
automation capabilities they need to maximize their investment in
Microsoft Dynamics AX as a core financial and business system."

   In deploying the new capabilities announced today, Microsoft
Dynamics AX 2009 users can:

   --  Improve the security of electronic transactional documents and
        payments through configurable preferences based on role and
        delivery destination;

   --  Share configuration options across multiple company accounts,
        and enable unattended batch processing based on
        recipient-specific delivery preferences during non-peak times
        to reduce operational complexity and IT overhead;

   --  Increase user productivity with a fully integrated and
        intuitive interface that mirrors the Microsoft Dynamics AX
        2009 user experience;

   --  Support global implementations through user interface
        localization in common international languages;

   --  Enhance communication and reporting through the ability to
        group related, but independent documents, into a single PDF
        file for preview and delivery; and

   --  Utilize Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009 Enterprise Portal to access
        and view Bottomline-generated reports on-demand without a
        Windows AX client.

   "We believe that with the combination of our domain expertise and
new capabilities specifically designed for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009,
customers will gain the security, reliability and control they require
to make efficient transactional document processes part of their
long-term, global business strategy," said Priest.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 7 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded Acme
Packet Inc APKT.O to "underweight" from "overweight," citing
the networking equipment maker's "negative" second-quarter
earnings view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Acme shares, which plunged more than 40 percent on Thursday
after the company forecast a quarterly profit below market
estimates, continued their slide on Monday -- falling as much
as 11 percent to a new lifetime low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan said the demand for session border controllers, a
product that Acme provides, could be decelerating faster than
either it or the company had been expecting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe it could take 1-2 quarters for Acme to
internalize a weaker demand environment and another 2-3
quarters to realign the business," analyst Ehud Gelblum wrote
in a note to clients and added that he sees low potential for
earnings upsides in the coming quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, Acme said it expected to earn 2 cents to 4 cents
a share, excluding certain items, and revenue of $24.5 million
to $25.5 million for the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts had expected the company to earn 9 cents a share,
excluding special items, on revenue of $33.6 million, according
to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company had attributed its bleak outlook to a delay in
closing of some transactions and its inability to recognize
revenue for a high volume of products that it shipped in the
last several days of the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company had, however, projected a return to sequential
revenue growth for the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gelblum said the new outlook for sequential growth in the
third quarter was "not overly comforting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Acme Packet were down almost 10 percent at $4.17

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 7 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded
Ameristar Casinos Inc ASCA.O, citing current weakness in
share price, and said the stock could trade up as investors can
expect a potential takeover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage raised Ameristar to "neutral" from
"underweight".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Penn National Gaming Inc (PENN.O) said on Thursday its $6.1
billion takeover pact had been terminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the termination agreement, Penn National would get
$1.475 billion, consisting of a $225 million break-up fee and
what effectively would be a seven-year, interest-free $1.25
billion loan from Fortress, Centerbridge, Wachovia Corp WB.N
and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The termination of takeover pact of Penn National and its
subsequent receipt of $1.475 billion could mean that Ameristar
is a viable target for Penn, the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock has fallen 26 percent since June 2, whereas the
SP 500 has fallen only 9 percent, the brokerage added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company rose about 5 percent to $14.06 in
morning trade on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;Lieberman Software President Joins Panel of Industry Leaders
  Discussing Certification, Support, and Future Deployment of Windows
                                 Vista
LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
Philip Lieberman, president of Lieberman Software Corporation,
will join an assembly of software executives for the "Windows Vista: A
View from Partners" press panel at the Microsoft Worldwide Partner
Conference 2008 in Houston, TX on July 8. This panel of industry
thought leaders will discuss Windows Vista product certifications and
the impact of these certifications on the security and manageability
of Windows Vista enterprise deployments.

   "The Windows Vista certification program provides a great business
value for us as an ISV," said Philip Lieberman, president of Lieberman
Software. "Windows Vista certification provides us with positive
market differentiation, and it ensures our customers that we are
offering the highest quality applications for the Microsoft platform.
Long term, the Microsoft community can expect low support costs and an
exceptional customer experience because of Windows Vista
certification."

   Lieberman Software is a managed Microsoft Gold Certified Partner
in the ISV Competency that provides end-to-end security and systems
management solutions for Windows-based client and server deployments.
The company launched a strategic initiative to develop Windows
Vista-certified applications several months before the launch of the
operating system. Based on the architectural and security advances of
Windows Vista, Mr. Lieberman anticipated that the new operating system
would be an integral element of customers' future enterprise
deployments.

   Lieberman Software participated in the Windows Vista beta program,
the Early Experience Program for Windows Vista, and the Microsoft
Technology Adoption Program for Windows Vista. This commitment to
Windows Vista testing and certification enabled the company to achieve
five Windows Vista product certifications prior to the launch of the
new platform.

   These products - including Random Password Manager(TM), User
Manager Pro(TM), Service Account Manager(TM), Account Reset
Console(TM), and COM+ Manager(TM) - provide privileged password
management, configuration management, and regulatory compliance
solutions for large organizations. The company's Windows Vista
certification initiative is chronicled in a Microsoft case study
titled Lieberman Software's Participation in Microsoft "Certified for
Windows Vista" Quality Logo Program.

   "Lieberman Software was an early ISV adopter of Windows Vista,
based on its significant technical and security improvements over
Windows XP," Lieberman said. "We also had some of the first
applications formally certified for the Windows Vista platform. These
investments helped us provide a smooth and secure migration path for
our large worldwide base of enterprise customers to Windows Vista, and
then on to Windows Server 2008."

   The Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference provides a forum for
Microsoft partners to learn more about business growth opportunities
and product innovation from Microsoft executives. This year's
conference takes place at the George R. Brown Convention Center in
Houston, TX from July 7 - 10.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) has told a European Union court that an antitrust fine of 899 million euros ($1.4 billion) against it is both excessive and disproportionate, the Court of First Instance said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 27 the European Commission found that Microsoft used high prices to discourage competition, failing to carry out sanctions imposed against it as part of a long-running case. Microsoft is appealing against the fine imposed in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Commission failed to take due account of the fact that the contested decision only concludes that the royalties allegedly established by Microsoft under one particular license ... were unreasonable," the court said in summarizing Microsoft's arguments, published in the EU's Official Journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Commission spokesman disagreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Commission is confident that its decision to impose the fine was legally sound," Jonathan Todd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company argued that the Commission made a "manifest error" by labeling its rates as unreasonable without considering that they were "intended to facilitate negotiations between Microsoft and the prospective licensees."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well, Microsoft and the Commission had agreed to have a trustee review the rates if need be, in a mechanism that had been used in another case, Microsoft argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission also erred by the yardstick that it used in requiring Microsoft to establish its trade secrets were innovative, ignoring many arguments prepared by patent experts, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Commission also denied Microsoft's right to be heard", because it failed to give the company a chance to give its views at the end of the period for which it was fined, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission has said it imposed the fine because the U.S. software group had defied a 2004 order from Brussels to provide information to competitors on reasonable terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been fined a total of 1.68 billion euros by the EU for abusing its 95 percent dominance of PC operating systems through its Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 899 million euro fine was the biggest ever imposed on a company by the EU executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission initially fined Microsoft 497 million euros in March 2004 for withholding interoperability information for "work group server" software and for deliberately damaging rivals by tying its Windows Media Player to its Windows system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft unsuccessfully appealed against that penalty and was also later fined 280.5 million euros by the Commission for non-compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest fine picked up from where the 280.5 million euro penalty left off, covering the period from June 21, 2006 until October 21, 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company announced its appeal of the latest fine in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Lawsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Jul 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Neocase Software, a global leader in collaborative customer service
solutions, announced today that the company has been selected as the 2008
Independent Software Vendor (ISV) for customer service applications for
the Microsoft's Dynamics CRM 4.0 product. Neocase's line of solutions --
Neocase CS, Neocase HR and Neocase CRM -- help customer service and HR
departments to improve interactions with end-customers and employees
while maximizing agent productivity and the quality of service operations.

    Neocase Software was chosen for the ISV Showcase based on its product
integration with Dynamics CRM and the business value that Neocase brings
to that solution. Neocase was among a select group of six software
vendors out of 75 ISVs chosen to be featured in a video and written
solution brief, which will be highlighted at Microsoft's WorldWide
Partner Conference in July 2008. According to Daniel Tian Sio Po,
Microsoft Dynamics Platform Evangelist, 'Microsoft is proud to highlight
Neocase as a global software developer for customer service solutions who
is meeting and exceeding today's demanding business needs with its
solutions.'

    Since 2001, Microsoft(R) Gold Certified Partner Neocase Software has
specialized in providing comprehensive customer service applications for
large, global corporations. Their applications have always emphasized
usability, collaboration and adoption. Julien Dahan, Neocase's President
and COO states, "We are very excited that Neocase Software was chosen as
the ISV Showcase for customer service applications. It shows the
confidence of Microsoft in Neocase's solutions and confirms Neocase's
leadership in the customer service solutions arena."

    To create the integrated solution, Neocase CRM, Neocase embedded its
stand-alone customer service solution, Neocase CS, to replace the standard
customer service module within Dynamics CRM. The embedded Neocase CS is
able to leverage the same database and data model and thus provides a
seamless, transparent experience to the end-user. In addition to that,
Neocase CS significantly enhances the customer service functionality
within Microsoft Dynamics CRM through advanced service level management,

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, quotes, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DUBAI, July 7 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi National Energy Co
TAQA.AD (Taqa) said on Monday it had bought northern North Sea
equity interests from Shell (RDSa.L) and ExxonMobil (XON.N) as
part of efforts to consolidate its presence in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Today's announcement brings us one step closer to our
stated strategy of building a global energy company, with an
equal distribution of assets in North America, Europe and the
Middle East," Taqa CEO Peter Barker-Homek said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe that the North Sea offers significant potential
for companies like Taqa and we will be making a significant
investment over the coming years to extend the productive life
and commercial viability of our assets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taqa did not give financial details of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sale includes all equity, infrastructure and production
licences for the Tern, Eider, Cormorant North, South Cormorant,
Kestrel and Pelican fields and related sub-sea satellite fields,
Taqa's wholly owned subsidiary Taqa Bratani said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fields produce around 40,000 barrels per day of oil
equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil majors have been selling their assets in the mature,
declining oil sector for years as they look to invest in cheaper
production regions with higher potential returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Taqa, which is majority owned by the Abu Dhabi
government, has already amassed over $1 billion of North Sea oil
and gas assets in purchases from Canada's Talisman and oil major
BP in November 2006 and January 2007 respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is further evidence of our long-term commitment to
Europe and will build on our asset optimisation successes in the
Netherlands and the UK to date," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The UAE is the world's fifth-largest oil exporter and Taqa's
expansion is part of the Gulf Arab state's drive to use record
oil revenues to diversify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company expects to announce four new deals worth around
$5 billion this year, including a joint venture with a major
U.S. utility and a windfarm in Morocco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taqa has appointed energy services company John Wood Group
to operate, maintain and manage offshore production in the
northern North Sea fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taqa itself would focus instead on building its presence in
the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The transaction is subject to regulatory approval. It is
expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2008.

&lt;p&gt;PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - GLG Partners has hired Goldman Sachs partner Driss Ben-Brahim, who oversees the firm's emerging-markets trading, the Wall Street Journal newspaper reported in its electronic edition on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GLG, a British hedge fund run by several former Goldman partners, targeted Ben-Brahim to help expand its special-situations business, the Journal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The job will include running the roughly $1.2 billion (600 million pound) emerging-markets special-situations fund that is now run by Greg Coffey, the GLG fund manager who is leaving the firm in October, the newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLG had about $24.6 billion of assets as of the end of March, the newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLG and Goldman Sachs could not be immediately reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), on Tuesday took aim at top Wall Street executives who claim the recent credit crisis and widespread bank loses were mainly due to accounting changes requiring extensive markdowns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Charlie Rose aired Tuesday on PBS, Dimon said, "It was not an accounting issue, okay?...The people who made the mistakes are to blame."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second part of a wide-ranging interview, Dimon said the regulatory systems covering the financial world need tightening in the wake of billions of dollars in losses at financial institutions in recent quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to do some serious work to try to avoid getting into this serious problem again," Dimon told Rose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also suggested that the next president should be prepared for a continuation of the existing problems facing the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the new president has to be prepared for dealing with a serious downturn," said Dimon. "And if we don't get our hands around this energy issue, we could severely damage the future health of the United States."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, who is a Democrat, also called for tax changes to make the system more "egalitarian."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think there is nothing wrong with taxing the wealthy a little bit more and having a more egalitarian society," said Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Dane Hamilton)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - While Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) is busy pursuing an independent strategy, forces beyond its control leave it increasingly vulnerable to a fresh takeover bid by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) without the increased premium shareholders once hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's initial unsolicited takeover bid was a half-cash, half-stock offer of $31 per share, for a value of $44.6 billion. Microsoft later raised it to a $33-a-share bid valued at $47.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo stock now rises or falls on speculation about what price Microsoft may end up paying for it. Earlier this month, as hopes of a new bid evaporated, Yahoo shares fell to $19.59, near their level in January before Microsoft began its bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Microsoft back in the picture as a potential acquirer, Yahoo shares traded up above $24 a share on Nasdaq on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, rebuffed by Yahoo in its original takeover bid, said on Monday it had given up on negotiating with current management but was ready to instantly reopen talks if activist investor Carl Icahn wrests control of Yahoo's board at its annual meeting on August 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also conspiring against Yahoo is a further decline in the U.S. economy and the online advertising market on which its revenue depends. Yahoo can only hold back or cut costs so far before having to lower its already weak outlook again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All this deal speculation is happening in the space of an increasingly dicey environment in terms of adverting," RBC Capital analyst Ross Sandler said. "If Yahoo starts missing its numbers, the stock moves back to $20," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street is looking for revenue to grow 11 percent but profits to fall nearly 13 percent when the Internet company reports second-quarter results on July 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Financial and pharmaceutical ads are under pressure," Canaccord Adams analyst Colin Gillis said of two heavy online ad spenders. "Yahoo is going to have a lackluster June quarter with disappointing September guidance likely," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fueling concern is Monday's warnings from personal finance company Bankrate Inc RATE.O, which cut its 2008 outlook, citing a sharp drop in spending on Web display ads by marketers in financial services -- a key sector for Yahoo as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOMETHING LESS THAN $33?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central issue, Wall Street analysts say, is not whether Yahoo has a coherent strategy for controlling its destiny but whether it has time to achieve its goals. Many are impressed by recent partnership deals and efforts to open up products and advertising systems, but see it as too little, too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors are back to debating what side of $30 Microsoft would end up paying if Icahn succeeds in turning over the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the stock component, the value of that offer sank from $44.6 billion in January to below $42 billion, or about $29 a share, by May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's potential new bid is unlikely to start as high as the $33 a share Microsoft offered just before calling off merger talks in early May, said UBS analyst Ben Schachter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it's likely to be a far cry from the $34-$35 a share that major investors called for earlier this year, or the $37 Yahoo management had made as a counterproposal to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think we've seen enough time passed that you're going to have Microsoft looking at where the business is today and what they want to pay for it," Schachter said. He predicts a renewed bid from Microsoft in the $31-$33 a share range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The business has weakened since the original offer was made. You have both the macroeconomic environment weighing on the stock as well as all the distractions from the original bid itself," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gillis said, "The only deal that was only ever really on the table -- $31 per share in cash and stock -- is probably the one that we see get revived."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gillis added, "In a deteriorating economic environment, an all-cash offer of $28, $29 or $30 (per share) starts to look pretty good" to shareholders who had once bet on a $35 takeout price. He too sees Microsoft reviving the $31-a-share offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOW LOW COULD MICROSOFT GO?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft may be tempted to offer even less if Icahn wrests control of Yahoo in his proxy campaign to elect an alternative slate of directors in three weeks. Icahn and Microsoft have said they are ready to reopen merger talks if he prevails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Jefferies  Co analyst Youssef Squali warned that Icahn may have few options other than selling to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Icahn wins a full slate and he doesn't have a 'Plan B' then Microsoft has him over the barrel," Squali said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's to keep Microsoft from letting Icahn push out Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang and board, then swooping in with a low-ball $18 per share offer, asks Trip Chowdry, a software financial analyst with Global Equities Research in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Pritchard, a Microsoft analyst at Cowen  Co, said another factor to consider is the effect on Yahoo employees if Microsoft comes in with a far lower bid, not to mention the resistance by major shareholders counting on a big premium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They (Microsoft) would like to discount, but I think they know it would be a lot harder to get a deal done if they were to put a significant discount on the deal," he said. "For a few billion dollars (extra), it's just worth it to get it done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think Microsoft will pay more than what they last said they'll pay -- they'll do it there rather than at $1 or $2 less. At worst they'll pay $33 for the whole thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi in Seattle; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sourcefire Vulnerability Research Team Protects Users from Latest
Microsoft Windows and SQL Server Vulnerabilities
COLUMBIA, Md.--(Business Wire)--
Open source innovator and SNORT(R) creator, Sourcefire, Inc.
(Nasdaq:FIRE), a leader in Enterprise Threat Management, announced
that the Sourcefire(R) Vulnerability Research Team (VRT) has delivered
rules to protect Sourcefire customers and Snort users from the four
Microsoft vulnerabilities disclosed today. These vulnerabilities
impact Microsoft Windows and Microsoft SQL Server.

   "As we enter the second half of 2008, attacks and vulnerabilities
are only continuing to increase in number and magnitude," said Matt
Watchinski, Director of the Sourcefire Vulnerability Research Team.
"Now more than ever, organizations need to take a proactive stance and
partner with their security providers to plug holes, address
weaknesses and stop the current onslaught of threats. Sourcefire takes
the protection of our customers very seriously, and we continually
work with them to ensure that their assets are protected from theft or
unauthorized access."

   Following Microsoft's disclosure earlier today, the Sourcefire VRT
created, tested and delivered Snort rules designed to detect attacks
targeting the Microsoft vulnerabilities listed below. These new rules
are included in the latest Sourcefire Security Enhancement Update
(SEU) released today.

   Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-037 - Important vulnerabilities
in the Windows Domain Name System (DNS) could allow spoofing. These
vulnerabilities exist in both the DNS client and DNS server and could
allow a remote attacker to redirect network traffic intended for
systems on the Internet to the attacker's own systems.

   Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-038 - Important vulnerability in
Windows Explorer could allow remote code execution when a specially
crafted saved-search file is opened and saved. If a user is logged on
with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully
exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an
affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view,
change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

   Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-039 - Important vulnerabilities
in Outlook Web Access (OWA) for Microsoft Exchange Server could allow
an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities to gain
access to an individual OWA client's session data, allowing elevation
of privilege. The attacker could then perform any action the user
could perform from within the individual client's OWA session.

   Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-40 - Important Microsoft Windows
and Microsoft SQL Server vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to
run code and to take complete control of an affected system. An
authenticated attacker could then install programs; view, change, or
delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jul 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today previewed a unique Social Accessibility
collaboration software, developed by IBM Research, which allows Internet
users to improve Web accessibility, particularly for those who are
visually impaired. View video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRB72rXXyXo

    The new collaboration software enables users with low or no vision to
report Web content accessibility issues they faced on specific Web pages.
In addition, any Internet users who wish to aid in improving Internet
accessibility can respond to such requests from visually impaired users by
using the tool to contribute alternative text to solve the reported issue.

    "The Web has become an important infrastructure for society," said Chieko
Asakawa, Distinguished Engineer in IBM Research. "Visually impaired users
have been experiencing inconvenience in not having good alternative texts
which are essential for screen reading software to tell them what's
showing on a Web page to support navigation. To overcome the issue, we
came up with an idea of creating a collaboration tool to, for the first
time ever, allow visually impaired users and any Internet users who wish
to participate in the Social Accessibility Project to work together to
make an impact on improving Web content accessibility."

    How It Works

    For example, a visually impaired individual wants to find out what image
is showing. The image shows a photo of Mount Fuji taken during sunset.
Existing screen reading software may not obtain the same information as
shown in the image, or a description of the photo is simply missing.
Whenever visually impaired users face such difficulties, they can report
that incident by using the collaboration tool developed by IBM Research
and ask for adding an improved alternative text to describe the image.

    The request then is automatically sent to a server hosting the Social
Accessibility Project Website where visually impaired users and any
Internet users who wish to take part in help improving Web accessibility
will register themselves to use the collaboration tool. Internet users who
are registered to the Social Accessibility Project can see this request on
the project Website, and may decide to respond to this request by using
the collaboration tool by clicking "start fixing it" button, and type a
short description, such as "Photo caption: Mount Fuji during a gorgeous
sunset." The short description will automatically be transformed to an
external metadata. The next time any visually impaired person tries to
revisit the Web page showing the photo image, screen reading software
will read the alternative text from the metadata to give better
explanation of what the photo shows.

    Metadata consists of useful information such as description of the content
and the physical location of the particular content. By having external
metadata to reside at the Web server, Web content will remain unchanged
while making the Web more accessible.

    To further enhance the usability of Web content, the Social Accessibility
Project Website offers an incentive mechanism where screen reading
software users can rate the quality of external metadata provided by
Internet users along with a comment to show their appreciation. Also,
active users are listed at the project's top page to recognize their
active participation on the project.

    In addition, screen reading software users can place a landmark whenever
they find an important position on a Web page, and other users can benefit
from those landmarks to help reach important information easier and
faster.

    Available via IBM alphaWorks

    In order to encourage participation in the project, the Social
Accessibility Project Website and collaboration tool are available free of
charge on IBM alphaWorks Services website. To make Web content more
accessible, it is vital to gain valuable feedback from screen reading
software users to report issues with Web content accessibility. Leveraging
the power of collaboration is vital to the project, and by placing the
Website and software on alphaWorks, IBM expects to receive significant
user feedback to help advance the project and the company's ongoing
accessibility technology research.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Dimon comments, byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Karey Wutkowski&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ARLINGTON, Va, July 8 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co
(JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on Tuesday some
problems in the credit markets have been resolved, but that
does not mean market conditions will not deteriorate further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I do think we have some very serious issues to face,"
Dimon said at a mortgage lending forum sponsored by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. "Things could actually get worse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street investment banks should not be considered too
big to fail, he said, adding the U.S. regulatory response to
the credit crisis has been appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon, whose bank is widely expected to acquire a regional
bank, said an accounting rule requiring banks to mark assets to
their current market value is a deterrent to mergers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FAS 157, as the rule is known, would force an acquirer to
write down the value of assets from a target bank -- even if
the loans and securities were sound -- to reflect current
depressed market values. In some cases, Dimon said, a target
bank could emerge with negative value under this mark-to-market
accounting, forcing an acquirer to raise more capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With more short-term suffering ahead for the economy, Dimon
said U.S. commercial banks, regional banks and jobs will be the
next areas to experience significant stress. Banks must get
more realistic about the risk with some products, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Capital requirements go too low in certain products," he
said. "You have to try to be as conservative as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RECEIVERSHIP FOR INVESTMENT BANKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regarding the U.S. regulatory response to the credit
crisis, Dimon said the top officials have done well within
their legislative limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think the government is taking proper, in my opinion,
monetary and fiscal policy at this point," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In March, the Federal Reserve helped engineer a takeover of
Bear Stearns by JPMorgan and guaranteed a $29 billion loan to
facilitate the transaction, out of concern that a Bear Stearns
bankruptcy could trigger a financial panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Fed also started making emergency loans to investment
banks for the first time since the Great Depression. That
measure expires in September, but Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke
said on Tuesday the emergency lending facility may stay open
past the year end to help restore market stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Long term, the U.S. government needs a mechanism to let it
act as a receiver for a failing investment bank and set up a
so-called bridge bank for an orderly liquidation, Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That model now exists for U.S. commercial banks. Treasury
Secretary Henry Paulson has called for a similar approach with
investment banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The government can take over the institution, wipe out the
equity holders and then deal with secured debt in a way that's
appropriate," Dimon said, referring to a receivership
mechanism. "It's complicated, but we need that option. They're
not too big to fail."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAVING THE GOLDEN GOOSE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also urged Congress to overhaul the patchwork system of
financial services regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "One day we have to stop saying it's not politically
feasible," Dimon said. "If we don't, we'll never have
policies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial
Services Committee, will launch a series of hearings on
Thursday laying the groundwork for financial services reform
legislation in 2009 after a new administration takes over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frank has proposed giving the Fed or another agency power
to monitor all risk in the financial system. U.S. Treasury
Secretary Paulson has said the Fed should be given permanent
authority as a "market stability regulator."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I hope things like that start to become serious policy
down the road," Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Dimon also said the financial services industry should
be wary of excessive regulation that could limit their
activities and drive business overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have to worry about the unintended consequences of
regulation," he said. "Let's not kill the golden goose here."

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp introduced on Wednesday pricing for its suite of online services targeted at corporate customers and a revenue-sharing plan to encourage other companies to sell the software company's products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company plans to charge corporate customers a monthly subscription of $15 per user for a suite of "hosted" software, which includes e-mail, Web meeting, collaboration and messaging applications running on Microsoft's computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Online Services is part of the software maker's effort to capitalize on the shift by corporate customers to abandon their own in-house computer systems for "cloud computing," a less expensive alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company built its business selling software to run on individual machines, both computer servers that power entire businesses and personal computers. But, in recent years, it has invested billion of dollars in massive data centers, which are the basic infrastructure for a wide range of Web services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has started offering corporate customers the option of having Microsoft run their e-mail, collaboration or sales programs on the software giant's computers and delivering those applications over the Web as a monthly subscription service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're seeing customers, partners and even competitors embrace this flexible approach to the cloud," Stephen Elop, president of Microsoft's business division, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it signed a number of new online services customers including Nokia and Danish shipping and oil group AP Moeller Maersk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's software suite is priced at $180 a year for each subscriber while rival Google Inc's competing product, Google Apps, which comes with e-mail, messaging and document sharing, costs around $50 a year per user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft argues that its offerings are more advanced than Google Apps. Technology administrators can manage Microsoft Online Services' accounts in the same way it deals with accounts of users running on their own computer systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said it will share 18 percent of the subscription fees with companies that bring in new customers to the online service suite in the first year and 6 percent each year over the life of the contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By employing a revenue-sharing model, Microsoft said it can probably add more customers than it could alone and it could encourage other companies to build applications to work with its online services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also introduced Deskless Worker Suite, which includes stripped-down online versions of its Outlook e-mail application and SharePoint collaboration software for $3 a month per user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software suite is targeted at workers such as nurses and factory employees who have traditionally not been given e-mail accounts or other forms of productivity software. By offering a low-cost product that can be accessed through a Web browser, Microsoft believes it can broaden its base of users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Eric Auchard in San Francisco; Editing by Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Wall Street bank JP Morgan said on Tuesday crude oil futures may hit $150 later this month while its rival Lehman Brothers LEH.N raised its oil price forecasts sharply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International benchmark U.S. crude futures struck a record high of $145.85 a barrel last week due to a combination of robust demand growth from emerging markets such as China, concerns over long-term supplies and inflow of investors' money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil's 50 percent rise this year has surpassed most analysts' expectations, prompting them to repeatedly revise their price forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the $150 in easy reach and a significant number of outstanding August WTI call options at that strike price, it seems almost a certainty ahead of the July 22 expiry," JP Morgan (JPM.N) said in its monthly research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said it expects the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), or the underlying grade of U.S. crude futures, to likely remain above $130 for the rest of the summer and $115 throughout this year even if demand weakens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Cheng with Lehman Brothers' equity research team raised its oil price forecast to an average $127 a barrel for 2008 from its previous assumption of $105.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He expected oil prices would average $115 next year, compared with its previous forecast of $90, he said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ikuko Kao; editing by James Jukwey)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junction Networks' VoIP Service to Be Offered Preconfigured for Microsoft Response Point

      Junction Networks to Offer Promotional Trial Account to All

   "Small-business people who want their PBX in-house and IP-based
have another important decision to make in VoIP service providers,"
said Rob Wolpov, president, Junction Networks. "They can realize
significant telecom savings, flexibility and location independence,
but only if the service is reliable, and voice quality comparable with
the PSTN. We view Microsoft's choice as a major validation of our
service quality."

adherence to SIP standards, its commitment to customer satisfaction

&lt;p&gt;  HOUSTON, TX and GOLDEN, CO, Jul 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference -- New Global Telecom (NGT), the
nation's leading provider of wholesale hosted and trunk-based VoIP
solutions, announced today that it is now accepting customer orders for
NGT Digital Voice for Microsoft(R) Response Point(TM). In April, NGT
became the first certified, Microsoft recommended service provider
offering industry-standard SIP (session initiation protocol) phone
services that works seamlessly with Response Point. Services require the
Response Point Service Pack 1 (SP1), which Microsoft made generally
available today, and NGT is now accepting orders from its Digital Voice
Authorized Partners.

    "Because Digital Voice is an easy add-on sale to Response Point, our
partners are eager to enter orders and experience the benefit of monthly
recurring revenue," said John Guillaume, senior vice president, product
marketing at NGT. "They find that by selling Response Point and Digital
Voice together to their small businesses customers, the sale is more
attractive for everyone."

    The NGT Digital Voice Partner Program makes NGT's carrier-class VoIP
services available to agents for the first time. Since the program's
launch in April 2008, NGT has added hundreds of partners who are trained
and actively selling NGT Digital Voice services.

    "I'm impressed with the quality of support and resources -- it has been a
higher quality than what I've seen in the marketplace," said Femi Dada,
Smarthost Design Technologies in Maryland.

    NGT will demonstrate its Digital Voice Service at the Microsoft Worldwide
Partner Conference, July 8-10, 2008, in Houston, Texas, within the
Microsoft Response Point booth (#566).

&lt;p&gt;  HOUSTON, TX, Jul 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
NextPage, a leader in proactive information risk management, announced
today that the NextPage Information Tracking Platform extends Microsoft
SharePoint information control to the unmanaged and uncontrolled
documents at the edge. By extending control to the edge, efficiently
disposing of documents that enterprises don't need becomes a reality. In
an average enterprise, 80 percent of its documents should be properly
disposed of based on policy. In complementary fashion NextPage tracks the
dissemination and evolution of documents beyond SharePoint to include
email attachments and document versions saved on local hard drives or
thumb drives. NextPage monitors and enforces document retention and
disposition policies in the complete enterprise environment and enables
SharePoint to become the enterprise document of record location.

    Interested parties can download a white paper discussing how NextPage plus
Microsoft SharePoint extends enterprise information control at
http://www.nextpage.com/products/np_sp.pdf.

    NextPage is showcasing the solution at the Microsoft Partner Conference in
Houston, Texas this week. NextPage is a Gold Certified Microsoft Partner
and was asked by Microsoft to be one of the few ISVs to co-edit the Open
XML standard.

    Over 7.5 billion Office documents are created annually, and approximately
80 percent of those are stored at the "edge" of the organization -- on
hard drives and scattered shared drives. Consequently, the costs of
gathering documents as required for eDiscovery can be high. Legal and
regulatory risks increase with uncontrolled information flowing through an
organization.

    "Enforcing document compliance policies and establishing a repository of
record are key to an organization's ability to function," said Darren Lee,
President and CEO for NextPage. "NextPage's unique capability to track the
evolution of Office documents and manage disposition across all points of
an enterprise provides assurance and protection."

    Ideally, information risk would be mitigated by having all corporate
documents and communications reside in a single central repository such as
SharePoint. However, despite the widespread adoption of the central
repository solution, there is significant, unmanaged data being created,
shared and stored outside of the central repository where regulatory
policies and procedures are difficult to enforce.

    The NextPage platform makes it easy to monitor document activity and
policy compliance across SharePoint, email, fixed drives and removable
drives. NextPage maintains classification information for each document,
tracks it through its lifecycle and verifies user compliance with
document management policies. Retention and disposition become an organic
extension of normal office activities and eDiscovery concerns are met and
managed.

    NextPage launched the industry's first-ever Information Tracking Platform
earlier this year. The platform supports all of NextPage's applications
including the award-winning NextPage Document Retention.

    About NextPage

    NextPage, a leading innovator in Compliance and Information Risk
Solutions, delivers the only Information Tracking Platform that mitigates
enterprise risk, increases document policy compliance and reduces the
cost of e-discovery by tracking and managing documents no matter where
they are located -- hard drives, USBs, servers, or Email attachments.
With patent pending technology, NextPage proactively tackles the risk by
tracking, classifying, executing policy, and reporting on the compliance
of all documents across the enterprise. The NextPage suite of
applications is being deployed across large enterprises to manage
information risk. NextPage has received top honors over the last year
including 2008 InfoWorld Technology of the Year Award, a CodIE Award for
Best Document Management Solution and KMWorld's Top 100 companies that
matter in 2008. For more information visit www.nextpage.com

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jul 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced it has signed two strategic outsourcing
contracts in emerging markets of South America.

    In Venezuela, Banco Fondo Comun (BFC), a universal bank offering its
customers leading customer service through its more than 170 national
branches, signed a five-year agreement with IBM. The agreement with BFC
includes the following information technology services: data center
outsourcing, technical support and database management operations, the
infrastructure of IBM's Business Innovation Center (BIC), planning
services, and computer hardware relocation.

    BFC executives described the strategic partnership with IBM as key to the
bank's growth plans.

    "In the mid-term, the bank is trying to position itself as its market
segment leader," said Carmen Salazar, BFC's Operations and Systems
Executive Vice President. "That is why we are looking for a strategic
partner that can help us both with IT functions and with maintaining the
highest operations, infrastructure, and technology standards, thus helping
BFC comply with the latest SUDEBAN regulations in terms of the
infrastructure of data centers. In this way, we can use our resources for
projects and activities that help BFC achieve its business goals."

    "Having a reliable Data Center infrastructure and an execution
organization that allows us to implement system operation methodologies,
and being able to use metrics to measure our administration, was a
fundamental task for the company's growth; and nowadays, IBM is
satisfactorily rendering all those services," added Juan Pedro Solorzano,
BFC's Systems Vice President.

    In Brazil, Panarello, a leading distributor of healthcare products, with
93% of the potential market of this segment, has expanded the scope of its
outsourcing agreement with IBM and signed a new contract for a ten-year
term. In 2004, the company transferred the responsibility of managing its
IT infrastructure to IBM. Through a contract expansion, Panarello will
integrate the group's financial, human resources, legal and procurement
processes. The company expects significant cost reduction as a result of
the implementation of a shared services model and the integration of its
entire IT infrastructure.

    "These agreements underscore IBM's unique capabilities and the strength of
its global business model to deliver high-value services to clients around
the world," said Gonzalo Escajadillo, general manager, IBM Global
Technology Services, Latin America. "That ability extends to growth
markets in Latin America where IBM is uniquely positioned to integrate
local and global capability to help our clients succeed."

    Both agreements were signed in the second quarter of 2008.

&lt;p&gt;  FOUNTAIN VALLEY, CA, Jul 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
D-Link, the end-to-end network solutions provider for consumers and
business, today announced that Microsoft Response Point Service Pack 1
(SP1) upgrade is now available for download. Small and medium sized
businesses using the D-Link VoiceCenter(TM) phone system can make the
transition from traditional analog phone systems to lower-cost digital
voice services easily with Response Point SP1.

    Introduced late last year, the D-Link(R) VoiceCenter is a feature-rich,
cost-effective IP phone system that is easy to use and manage, and is
ideally suited for small businesses requiring up to 50 phones and phone
lines. Among the essential features of the Response Point software are
voice-activated dialing and voicemail access, automated receptionist,
built-in auto-provisioning configuration, call-forwarding, call hold, find
me-follow me, 3-way call conferencing, voicemail-to-email forwarding,
voicemail retrieval over the phone and MS Outlook(R) contact integration.

    "The addition of the SP1 upgrade enables small businesses to easily
supplement their existing phone service with Voice over Internet Protocol
(VoIP) services," said William Brown, associate vice president, D-Link
Systems, Inc. in Fountain Valley, Calif. "As customers become more
comfortable with the reliability and quality of service offered by VoIP,
they can seamlessly move from traditional analog phone systems to VoIP
without needing telephony expertise."

    "We are pleased to release Service Pack 1 as a free download to
VoiceCenter customers," said Xuedong Huang, general manager of Microsoft
Response Point. "The improved performance and new features of SP1 offers
small businesses a complete, easy to use phone system that will meet the
changing needs of their business."

    SP1 addresses small business needs for scalability, allowing a much more
rapid and cost-effective move from traditional public-switched telephone
network (PSTN) lines, he said. With IP service in place, and using a
simple VoIP account setup wizard in the Response Point Administrator
software, a small business can connect with Internet telephony service
providers (ITSPs) to obtain new VoIP phone numbers in a matter of minutes.
Installing traditional analog lines can take hours, days or weeks.

    SP1 also addresses small businesses' need to maintain a local presence
through the use of a local VoIP phone number. VoIP providers allow
businesses to select a local phone number for use in remote locations,
alleviating costs to the business and customers for long-distance and
toll-free numbers. Using a local phone number, small businesses also can
secure their presence as part of local customer resources such as the
chamber of commerce and local White and Yellow Pages.

    Response Point SP1 also helps small businesses maintain close and
responsive relationships with customers through support for Direct Inward
Dialing, a key feature enabled by VoIP. A small business can configure
Response Point to route known inbound callers directly to a particular
extension or pool of extensions. It can furnish a main number or
individual employee extensions to ensure that someone is available --
virtually anytime or anywhere -- for important customers.

    D-Link VoiceCenter 5- and 10-phone kits include -- IP-PBX (DVX-2000MS), IP
phone (DPH-125MS) and PSTN gateway (DVG-3104MS). The D-Link VoiceCenter
phone handsets feature capabilities including auto discovery, and
one-touch access to parking, retrieving, transferring, voice dialing
other employees and voice dialing personal contacts.

    Other features of the D-Link VoiceCenter with Microsoft Response Point SP1
include SIP or PSTN trunking, DID-based inbound call routing to
extensions, click-to-dial, presence status, a dual-tone multi-frequency
(DTMF) and speech-based auto attendant, user directory, nicknames, simple
live operator access, customizable prompts, and call forwarding through
internal lines. It offers personal computer (PC) contact integration with
Microsoft Outlook, Windows Contact/Address Book.

    Pricing and Availability:

    The D-Link VoiceCenter is now available through D-Link's network of
value-added resellers, solution providers, distributors and the company's
online store, www.dlinkshop.com. Manufacturer's suggested retail prices
for the VoiceCenter system are: $2,499.99 for the DVX-2000MS-5 (5

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 8 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury debt investors
were less neutral on the outlook for bonds, taking both
increasingly optimistic and pessimistic positions on the week,
according to a poll released on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The number of investors who said on Monday they were
"neutral" Treasuries, or holding U.S. government securities
equal to their portfolio benchmarks, fell to 66 percent in the
week ended July 7 from 75 percent last week, J.P. Morgan
Securities said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The number of investors who said they were "short," or
holding less Treasuries than their benchmarks, rose to 18
percent from 14 while the share of "longs," or investors
holding more Treasuries than their portfolio benchmarks, rose
to 16 percent from 11, J.P. Morgan Securities said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts are not entirely sure of the Federal Reserve's
future direction in terms of interest rates. Some believe the
U.S. central bank will move to increase rates this year in an
effort to stifle rising price pressures, but others expect the
Fed will stand pat to avoid the risk that higher rates might
further damage an already struggling economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The amount of the J.P. Morgan survey's active clients,
including market makers and hedge funds, who said they were
"long" Treasuries rose to 5 percent from the previous week's 4
percent, while the number of active "short" clients was
unchanged at 3 percent. The number of active "neutral" clients
eased to 7 percent from 8 percent.

&lt;p&gt;ALBANY, Ga.--(Business Wire)--
Procter &amp; Gamble (P) has chosen CCLC, a nationwide child care
provider dedicated to quality employer-sponsored early childhood
education, to assume operations of its Albany, Georgia on-site Child
Development Center. The center offers programs for children ages
six-weeks to 12-years-old including enrichment options and summer
programs. The center also features oversized playgrounds, a full-size
basketball court, art room, a unique dining room that offers parents
and children a home-style dining experience, and a staff resource
room. The center was previously operated by Bright Horizons.

   "This transition marks P's continued efforts to provide its
employees with superior early childhood care and education. We are
excited to be working with CCLC to revamp the P Child Development
Center," said Teresa Travis, Personnel Manager, P "CCLC management
has been incredibly flexible throughout this process and has managed
to maintain stability of care while making the necessary changes to
the center's programs and curriculum that will help uphold our
center's high education and care standards."

   The P Albany Plant has more than 1,200 employees, with more than
40 families who have enrolled their children in the P Child
Development Center. During the transition from the previous provider,
CCLC placed great emphasis on a secure and consistent environment for
all children by retaining 90 percent of the center's staff and
managing very few disruptions during open hours. The smooth transition
around staff training, building and program changes also enabled CCLC
to retain 100 percent of the center's enrolled families and its NAEYC
accreditation. Accreditation is awarded only to high-quality early
childhood programs reviewed by a national commission comprised of
recognized experts in early childhood education and care.

   To confirm CCLC's commitment to providing a safe, nurturing
environment, the center will operate with low teacher/child ratios,
allowing staff to focus on the individual needs of each child. In
addition, CCLC will implement its developmentally appropriate programs
through their Guided Discovery Curriculum(TM) which incorporates
physical, social, language, cognitive and emotional development.

   "Our priorities during this transition were continuity of care for
the children and retaining as many of the current teaching staff as
possible and I am proud to say we met those goals," said Richard
Peterson, Director of Client Operations, CCLC. "We look forward to
working with both P and our families to establish long-term,
trusting relationships."

   The P Child Development Center is located at 510 Liberty
Expressway SE in Albany, Georgia. The center serves children from
6-weeks to 12 years of age and features a new and unique environment
to meet children's developmental needs.

   About CCLC

   Founded in 1992, CCLC is a national child care provider dedicated
to developing unique and effective employer-sponsored child care
programs. CCLC currently operates more than 100 employer-sponsored
child development centers offering high-quality child care programs
through on-site or near-site child development centers, before and
after school programs, summer camps and specialized dependent care
programs such as priority access and back up child care. CCLC has
extensive experience providing quality, convenient and affordable
child care programs for working families, creating professional work
environments for early childhood educators and helping companies

Linden Lab(R), creator of the virtual world Second Life(R), and
IBM (NYSE:IBM) have successfully demonstrated virtual world
interoperability by teleporting avatars between the Second Life
Preview Grid and an OpenSim virtual world server. The joint
development project represents an industry first of a quantifiable
milestone for virtual world interconnectivity.

   A video of Linden Lab and IBM's development teams successfully
teleporting avatars is available by clicking here
(http://torley.s3.amazonaws.com/Across-the-Metaverse.mp4).

   Teleporting an avatar between platforms has the potential to have
a significant impact on the future of virtual worlds. An open standard
for interoperability would allow users to cross freely from one world
to another in a seamless transfer, just as they can go from one Web
site to another on the Internet today.

   "Interoperability is a key component of the 3D Internet and an
important step to enabling individuals and organizations to take
advantage of virtual worlds for commerce, collaboration, education,
operations and other business applications," said Colin Parris, Vice
President, Digital Convergence, IBM. "Developing this protocol is a
key milestone and has the potential to push virtual worlds into the
next stage of their evolution."

   Linden Lab and IBM are exploring ways to expand the capabilities
of virtual worlds and to help meet the industry-wide demand to develop
platforms and protocols that will make these environments appropriate
for enterprise use. Interoperability is a key facet of this mission
and the recent work of Linden Lab and IBM's development teams is an
important proof point and step in that direction.

   To facilitate the continued development of this interoperability
function, technical details will be made available to the community.
The protocol interactions used for the teleport will be documented on
the Web site of the Architecture Working Group (AWG), an open forum
that is designing and publishing the Open Grid Protocol. IBM plans to
offer the extensions developed for OpenSim to the OpenSim community,
and Linden Lab plans to make the extensions developed for the Second
Life viewer available as open source. To foster testing and further
development, a test grid will be made available by Linden Lab.

   "IBM and Linden Lab both support an interoperable approach and see
the industry moving to an interconnected model in the future," said
Ginsu Yoon, Vice President of Business Affairs, Linden Lab.
"Interoperability is not only important for enterprise use but also
has the potential to improve overall scalability and stability."

   The interoperability protocol was tested and deployed on a
separated test environment involving the Second Life Preview Grid and
an OpenSim server. The companies have not announced plans or a
schedule for when it might be made available on the main Second Life
Grid(TM).

&lt;p&gt;  AUSTIN, TX, Jul 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
VDIworks, a virtual desktop software provider with a long history in
centralized computing, today announced it has integrated its solution
with Microsoft System Center Operations Manager 2007, which provides
management of physical and virtual deployments throughout the data
center, desktops and devices. With a new VDIworks plug-in, called
VDIvision for System Center, joint Microsoft/VDIworks customers can use
System Center to manage a variety of VDIworks-driven features, including
a highly configurable and scalable connection broker, leveraging the
power of desktop virtualization to reduce costs and improve security,
among other benefits. On the heels of Microsoft's release of Hyper-V,
VDIworks is the first virtual desktop management vendor to integrate with
Hyper-V and the System Center management offerings.

    VDIworks delivers one of the most comprehensive, flexible software
management platforms for creating, deploying and managing virtual desktop
infrastructure. Microsoft Hyper-V customers can now rely on VDIworks
technology that is built on five generations of proven centralized
computing solutions. In addition, companies looking to add
Microsoft-driven virtualization while maintaining their deployments
powered by other hypervisors can use VDIworks software to manage any
virtual desktop environment.

    "Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V delivers the next-generation of
hypervisor-based server virtualization technology and when coupled with
the System Center enterprise offerings, customers have the solutions they
need to deploy and manage a server virtualization infrastructure," said
Dai Vu, director of virtualization products and solutions at Microsoft.
"By integrating VDIworks with Hyper-V and System Center, customers have
available a broadened set of functionality for extending the management of
end-to-end virtual desktops through a single user interface."

    VDIworks integration with Microsoft's System Center results from close
cooperation among VDIworks and Microsoft developers. VDIworks utilized
APIs from Microsoft to ensure seamless functionality among both products.

    "We are pleased to have worked with Microsoft to integrate our VDI
management platform with System Center," said Rick Hoffman, president and
CEO of VDIworks. "This now provides customers a management platform for
reducing the complexity of managing a virtual desktop environment
leveraging Hyper-V."

    With VDIworks integration, System Center users will now be able to:


--  Discover their entire virtual desktop environments, including thin
    clients, multiple hypervisors, hosts and other systems from within System
    Center.

&lt;p&gt; (Changes source, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 8 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities initiated Dana
Holding Corp (DAN.N) with an "overweight" rating, saying the
auto parts maker's stock was cheap and that the company looked
set for an operational turnaround.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan said the company, which emerged from bankruptcy
in February this year, has a good management, a low-leverage
balance sheet and bankruptcy-achieved cost savings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dana seemed willing to redo its assets portfolio, the
brokerage said in a note to clients. "We sense there are no
sacred cows, and any or all units could eventually be sold or
partnered."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dana's shares, which have lost more than 60 percent of
their value since the company emerged from bankruptcy, closed
at $4.95 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;  LOS ANGELES, CA, Jul 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
magnify360 (www.magnify360.com), the leading provider of 1-to-1
personalization technology, has been tapped to build OneGreatPartner.com,
a Citrix community site for premier partner, Microsoft.

    OneGreatPartner.com launched on July 7, 2008 as the digital hub of the
Citrix-Microsoft alliance and marks the first partner site to leverage
both social networking and on-site personalization. Designed in
Microsoft's SilverLight application, the website includes private product
access, information on Citrix-Microsoft initiatives, educational content,
community-based features and magnify360's personalization technology to
improve visitor engagement and retention. ProAce, a web development
services company and magnify360 partner, also contributed to the project.

    From Garry Olah, Vice President, Citrix Systems, "With magnify360, we can
ensure that team members from both sides are able to access what they
need, when they need it. The reporting from the magnify360 Platform also
provides greater visibility into the product and support needs of the
Microsoft team, assisting us in strengthening this alliance."

    To facilitate the personalization of the site, magnify360 integrated its
platform, which combines real-time behavioral targeting, multivariate
testing and predictive modeling, to anonymously profile individual
visitors and serve the most relevant content, layout and flow of pages
accordingly. The magnify360 Platform analyzes users' self-published
information, regarding role, title and group as well as other explicit
data, such as comments and clicks. When combined with visitors' implicit
data such as geo-location and click speed, the compiled data provides
rich profile types to target and deeper insights into the needs of
Microsoft executives.

    OneGreatPartner.com represents the first project for magnify360, in which
personalization is focused purely on usability, rather than the goal of
increasing conversion rates or sales.

    "Generally, our platform is applied to lift conversion rates, sales or
other actions related to generating revenue. This is a fantastic
opportunity to observe the influence that website personalization can have
on engagement and retention in a pure environment. It's also a perfect
illustration of the variety of applications of our platform -- from
optimizing ecommerce and pay-per-click efforts to community sites and
partner education," said Olivier Chaine, CEO and founder of magnify360.

    magnify360 was recently featured in an independent report from Forrester
Research entitled Hot Companies to Watch in 2008 (April 2008). According
to Forrester's Christopher Andrews report, "Vendors like magnify360
deliver on the meaning of 'interactive'... With these features, Web site
interaction more closely resembles a personalized experience."

    About magnify360:

    magnify360 is bringing the reality 1-to-1 personalization to the online
user experience. Based in Los Angeles, CA, magnify360 provides a
software-as-a-service (Saas) platform that enables Web sites to adapt in
real-time to the behaviors of individual visitors. Marketers in lead
generation, ecommerce and paid search rely on magnify360 to improve
visitor engagement and conversion rates and reduce customer acquisition
costs.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Monday 
it would be willing to reopen talks to buy all or part of Yahoo 
Inc (YHOO.O), but only if a new Yahoo board is elected -- a big 
boost for financier Carl Icahn's board slate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, which broke off months-long talks in early May 
to buy the Internet company for $47.5 billion, said it would 
resume talks immediately if a new board were elected at Yahoo's 
August 1 stockholder meeting. Yahoo shares leapt 12 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Microsoft statement came after Icahn, a billionaire who 
owns more than 4 percent of Yahoo, issued an open letter saying 
he had "spoken frequently" to Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer over 
the last week. Previously, the two had not spoken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is the first concrete confirmation we have that 
Microsoft is willing to come back to the table," UBS analyst 
Ben Schachter said. "It gives Icahn a much stronger hand going 
into the shareholder vote. It significantly raises his profile 
and his likelihood for success."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer told Icahn that a big impediment to any Yahoo deal 
was his concern that the current board could "mismanage" the 
company while the deal awaits regulatory approval, a process 
that could take nine months or more, according to Icahn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an interview, Icahn argued that his proposed dissident 
board slate would make Microsoft feel more secure in risking a 
large sum of capital to complete the deal during the regulatory 
approval process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to realize there is 
no great comfort zone between the current Yahoo board and 
Microsoft," Icahn said. "During this waiting period for 
regulatory approval, any acquirer -- not just Microsoft -- 
would want a steward they would feel comfortable with."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In response, Yahoo issued a statement saying it continues 
to be willing to reopen talks with Microsoft, but "we feel 
strongly" that any deal negotiated between Icahn and Microsoft 
"would not lead to an outcome that would be in the best 
interests of Yahoo stockholders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If Microsoft and Mr. Ballmer really want to purchase 
Yahoo, we again invite them to make a proposal immediately," 
Yahoo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo is still talking to Time Warner Inc's (TWX.N) AOL 
unit about a tie-up, a person familiar with those negotiations 
said on Monday. Any such deal -- which would factor in the 
expected boost to Yahoo's bottom line as a result of its recent 
search advertising deal with Google Inc (GOOG.O) -- is unlikely 
before the August 1 annual meeting, the source said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW BOSS SEARCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn also said he was actively interviewing replacements 
for Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang and its management team. "I am moving 
towards getting a potential new management team for Yahoo, 
including a new CEO," he said in a phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The long-awaited signals that the Microsoft-Yahoo talks 
could be revived sent Yahoo shares up $2.56 to $23.91 on 
Nasdaq, while Microsoft added 5 cents to close at $26.03.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sanford C. Bernstein senior Internet analyst Jeffrey 
Lindsay said that if Microsoft is serious about resuming talks, 
"there is rationale for voting for the Icahn slate and 
essentially ousting the current Yahoo board and probably the 
management too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At the end of the day, you would have to expect that the 
big institutional shareholders would go for a deal with 
Microsoft," Lindsay added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mithras Capital partner Mark Nelson, whose firm controls 
1.7 million Yahoo shares, said management change at Yahoo "has 
to happen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They've had plenty of time to right the ship," Nelson 
said. "The record over the past two or three years speaks for 
itself. They blew it and new management is needed to better 
exploit all the assets there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talks between Yahoo and Microsoft broke down in early May. 
Microsoft originally offered $31 per share and raised it to 
$33, but Yahoo demanded $37 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After talks collapsed, Icahn amassed a stake in Yahoo and 
launched a proxy war to replace the Yahoo board and management, 
claiming they "botched" the Microsoft talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his letter, Icahn said: "Steve made it clear to me that 
if a new board were elected, he would be interested in 
discussing a major transaction with Yahoo," including 
purchasing either its "search" function with large financial 
guarantees, or an outright purchase of Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said it would be premature to discuss details, 
such as the price it might offer for Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn said he would immediately move to replace Yang if his 
board slate were elected at the August meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo's biggest investor, Capital Research, has told Yang 
it may vote against the board in the proxy fight, the blog 
AllThingsD reported on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Robert MacMillan and Yinka Adegoke

&lt;p&gt;Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: NVIDIA Corp, Sunoco Logistics Partners, L.P., ExxonMobil Corp., Spectranetics Corp. and Medtronic Inc.

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst
Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest
news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks
recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. (Nasdaq: NVDA),
Sunoco Logistics Partners, L.P. (NYSE: SXL), ExxonMobil Corp. (NYSE:
XOM), Spectranetics Corp. (Nasdaq: SPNC) and Medtronic (NYSE: MDT).

   Get the most recent insight from Zacks Equity Research with the
free Profit from the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=4579

   Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog:

   Expect Margin Pressure for NVIDIA

   Product-related issues for NVIDIA Corp (Nasdaq: NVDA) such as the
transition from the G80 to G92 series and the recently discovered
failure of certain notebook products will pressure gross margins,
which we believe will continue for few quarters. We therefore maintain
a Hold rating on the shares.

   To remain competitive, NVIDIA has invested heavily in research and
development, which increased 25.0% in fiscal 2008 and 38.2% in the
first quarter of fiscal 2009, and may require more investment, which
could further dampen margins. In addition, NVIDIA faces risks
associated with international operations as nearly 92% of fiscal 2008
revenue has been from businesses outside the U.S.

   Sunoco Logistics' Limited Upside

   We are maintaining our Hold recommendation on Sunoco Logistics
Partners, L.P. (NYSE: SXL) units ahead of the partnership's
second-quarter results. The partnership's last quarterly results were
strong and were accompanied by an 8.5% year-over-year increase in
quarterly distribution to the annualized rate of $3.58 per unit.

   In April, Sunoco bought a refined products pipeline system in
Texas and other related assets from ExxonMobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) for
roughly $200 million. The transaction is expected to be immediately
accretive to the partnership's cash distribution.

   Growing Spectranetics a Hold

   Spectranetics Corporation (Nasdaq: SPNC) acquired the endovascular
business of Kensey Nash and launched a new Lead Locking Device. SPNC
also announced the settlement of intellectual property dispute with
Medtronic Inc. (NYSE: MDT).

   At its current price of $9.72 per share, SPNC is trading at 3.1x
our current fiscal year revenue estimate of $106 million, which is at
a discount to the group average multiple of roughly 3.5x. We believe
the stock is fairly valued at 3.5x our 2008 revenue estimate. Our
target price is therefore $11.00.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon likes to talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the wake of his masterminding the bailout of Bear Stearns Cos, many on Wall Street like to listen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon has long been something of a golden child on Wall Street, ever since he was a protege of Sanford "Sandy" Weill at the company that would become Citigroup Inc (C.N), JPMorgan's chief New York commercial banking rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several books profiling the baby-faced Dimon are in the works, as his comments on Wall Street, its foibles and the economy grow more influential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of that is because JPMorgan has avoided much of the credit mess that has devastated rivals such as Citigroup and Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think Jamie has earned the right by his performance to be a spokesman that people should pay attention to," Weill, the former Citigroup chief executive and chairman, said in an interview with Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding problems is one reason JPMorgan shares have through Wednesday dropped only 17 percent this year, compared with a 28 percent slide in the Standard  Poor's Financials Index .GSPF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon's reputation and charisma is another reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a Jamie Dimon premium" in JPMorgan stock, said Richard Bove, an analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given that JPMorgan hasn't had a lot of the problems, it has allowed Jamie to step up and be a statesman and a spokesman for the entire industry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Bove said some worry Dimon's higher profile might lead him to set his sights farther afield. He questioned how long Dimon might stay with JPMorgan, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, but largest by market capitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maybe he is going to get bored with running JPMorgan," said Bove, who suggested Washington D.C. as Dimon's next career move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Weill played down the possibility of Dimon heading for the nation's capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's something he still might think," but that's something only Dimon could answer, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokesman declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TELLING OFF HIS PEERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Bruner, author of "The Panic of 1907" and dean of the Darden Business School at the University of Virginia, sees parallels between John Pierpont Morgan's handling of the 1907 financial markets' crisis and Dimon's acquisition of Bear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan took over Bear after the latter suffered the equivalent of a bank run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason JPMorgan got involved was that it was the financial institution widely considered best equipped to swallow the 85-year-old investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He sets an example at an institution that is itself exemplar," Bruner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After leaving Citigroup, Dimon became chief executive at Chicago's underperforming Bank One Corp, where he slashed costs and improved operations. He did so well that he engineered that bank's $58 billion takeover by JPMorgan in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 52, is also known for his staccato, broken syntax, perhaps a function of his being boisterous, opinionated and unafraid to speak his mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He sometimes has to be physically restrained from barging in on colleagues' calls with analysts and investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And he cuts his peers no slack, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a conference call for Wall Street chieftains while JPMorgan was rescuing Bear, Dimon shot down a somewhat technical question from Citigroup Chief Executive Vikram Pandit, who has a doctorate in finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to published reports, Dimon told Pandit: "Stop being such a jerk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sanford "Sandy" Weill, former chief executive and chairman of Citigroup Inc (C.N), believes Jamie Dimon's JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) is better positioned than many other Wall Street firms to cope with the credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan has positioned themselves better than a lot of others in this crisis," Weill told Reuters on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weill did not mention Citigroup in an interview but his comments are a vindication for Dimon, who was ousted from Citigroup in 1998. Weill was Dimon's mentor, and the two men worked for more than a decade to build what was once a small consumer lending company in Baltimore into Citigroup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weill and Dimon were briefly estranged after the ouster, but reconciled in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weill said JPMorgan is in a position to further improve "at a point of time when assets are being put on the market at very low prices."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think Jamie has done a very good job in being the leader of JPMorgan," said Weill, who said he last spoke to Dimon a few months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks have had a rough year and write-downs from losses on subprime mortgages and complex debt securities remain a concern. JPMorgan has avoided the large writedowns posted by its peers, but conditions remain difficult for banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am not sure things have settled down for anyone," said Weill, referring to current market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay; editing by Toni Reinhold/Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  OSLO, NORWAY, Jul 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) has signed an agreement with Matiq, the information
technology subsidiary of Nortura, Norway's largest food supplier, to use
radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to track and trace
poultry and meat products from the farm, through the supply chain, to
supermarket shelves. IBM and Matiq are developing the first food tracking
solution of its kind in the Nordics, which will help ensure that meat and
poultry products are kept in optimal condition throughout the supply
chain.

    The food manufacturing industry is facing some of the most challenging
market conditions in its history. Consumer pressure, government
regulations, and industry requirements for quality and traceability mean
that producers are under pressure to provide more detail on products. With
foods being sourced across international borders, consumers are demanding
to know more about the products they buy and the conditions they were
grown and kept in as they travelled from farm to dinner table.

    IBM and Matiq will develop and manage the technology infrastructure needed
to enable track and trace solutions for the Norwegian food market. Product
packaging will be tagged with RFID chips to help ensure that products are
kept in optimal conditions throughout the supply chain. Using this
solution, Norwegian suppliers and supermarkets using software that
complies with GS1 EPCglobal's Electronic Product Code Information
Services (EPCIS) standard -- which allows sharing of RFID data across and
between enterprises -- can monitor and analyze their entire value chain,
increasing efficiency and reducing costs.

    For retailers, the information provided by this solution will make it
easier to keep track of stock and avoid "out of stock" situations. It will
also help manufacturers and supermarkets to improve the responsiveness of
the supply chain to quickly adapt to changing consumer buying patterns.

    "IBM was one of the key players involved in creating the EPCIS standards
upon which the success of this project relies," said Are Bergquist, CEO of
Matiq. "We are therefore confident that IBM has the right technology and
expertise for this project. Consumers are becoming increasingly aware of
food quality, safety, origin and traceability. This creates greater
pressure on manufacturers to keep track of every component in the
manufacturing process, in order to ensure that their products are safe for
the consumer. IBM and Matiq are developing solutions that will help ensure
food safety on the consumer's terms," he said.

    At the core of the system will be IBM's WebSphere RFID Information Center,
software for enterprises seeking to share product movement information
with trading partners which are also using EPCIS compliant solutions.

    Specialists from IBM's Global Technology Services unit will implement the
end-to-end infrastructure solution for Matiq, and IBM experts on sensors
and RFID will work with Matiq to develop this first of a kind solution.

    "The integration of infrastructure and food tracing solutions is complex
and challenging," said Morten Thorkildsen, country general manager for IBM
Norway. "IBM is helping market leaders like Matiq remain at the forefront
of the retail industry by employing RFID in their entire IT
infrastructure, which enables new ways of doing business and at the same
time delights customers. This agreement is proof of how IBM's RFID
solutions improve efficiencies for our clients while building customer
loyalty in the store," he said.

    About IBM

    A pioneer in sensor technology and a leader in IT and business strategy,
IBM offers sensor and actuator solutions that unlock new business value
and help drive new insights and innovation. For more information on IBM's
RFID solutions, visit www.ibm.com/solutions/sensors and

    About Matiq

    Matiq is the fully owned IT-subsidiary of Nortura; the market leading food
manufacturer in Norway. Matiq is a full range IT Solution Provider
focusing primarily on the food manufacturing industry, developing and
delivering solutions across the entire value chain. Solutions for food
safety and traceability will be one of the key focus areas for Matiq in
the next few years.

&lt;p&gt;BIRMINGHAM, Ala., July 9 (Reuters) - Alabama's Jefferson
County has fired advisers Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N and
hired a group led by Goldman Sachs (GS.N) to advise it on
developing a plan to restructure its bond debt of more than
$3.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; County commissioners voted three to two at a public meeting
on Tuesday to replace Merrill Lynch and other legal and
financial advisers with Goldman Sachs, Sterne, Agee  Leach and
investment firm Morgan Keegan, persons attending the meeting
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new advisors face a deadline of Aug. 1, when the county
must pay $100 million in interest to J.P. Morgan (JPM.N) and
other Wall Street lenders to stave off what would be the
largest bankruptcy in U.S. municipal history. The debt was run
up through costly bond swaps and the failure of the sub-prime
market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill Lynch, which on Wednesday was cautioned by Fitch
Ratings that its debt rating may be cut because of expected
ongoing write-downs and diminished prospects for earnings, had
no comment on the county commission's action, a Merrill
spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At Tuesday's meeting, splits emerged between Republican and
Democratic commissioners that may make progress on resolving
the debt issue more difficult, persons attending said.
Republicans control the commission, with three seats.

&lt;p&gt;"Big Blue" Finds Success Reaching Mid-Market Audience With
 Vertically Focused Advertising Campaigns in SmartBrief e-Publications
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
SmartBrief Inc. announces strong results of an IBM Corp. test
campaign over the past 18 months using online association-based
advertising. A new case study describing IBM's experience and
outlining "best practices" for large enterprise advertisers has just
been published.

   IBM has had success conveying its value to mid-market companies by
targeting its advertisements in SmartBrief's e-newsletters to reach
specific audiences in businesses with 100 to 999 employees. Currently,
SmartBrief produces online publications covering 20 key industries
such as advertising, health care, retail and telecommunications, and
it has 1.5 million subscribers who have chosen to subscribe to free
publications in their area of interest.

   This self-selection of subscribers means that IBM and other
SmartBrief advertisers can choose to send their messages to a focused
and motivated group of readers. More than 70 trade associations keep
their members updated on news of their industries with SmartBrief
e-publications.

   "Good targeting is essential. That's why SmartBrief is an
excellent medium for us. Its audience is made up of association
members, so we can communicate our offers to retailers vs. educators,
consultants or competitors," says Christine MacDonald, one of IBM's
mid-market retail marketing managers.

   Since mid-market companies provide a wide spectrum of products and
services, IBM has taken its message on a granular level to select
e-newsletters in SmartBrief's highly respected line of
industry-specific online publications.

   IBM is pleased with the results. "Our marketing has to be executed
in a trackable media so that we can report on responses, leads and
wins, demonstrating a strong ROI (return on investment) for each
campaign tactic. SmartBrief has become an important part of that
equation," MacDonald says in the case study.

   IBM measures its success by demand-generation activities that
provide specific, actionable leads. With strong results from
SmartBrief, IBM has continued to expand its reach into online media
and association marketing.

   The IBM experience provides three "best practice tips" for large
enterprise advertisers:

-0-
*T
    1. Get more than just "clicks." Get leads. Advertisers should be
     able to gain actionable information about prospects, such as
     industry, company size and level of decision-making authority
     from every lead.

    2. Generic ad content yields generic results. You deserve better.
     Getting specific in the advertising message and addressing "hot
     button" issues that this particular audience experiences will
     produce more and higher-quality leads.

    3. Find alternative digital communities. Your prospects already
     have. By getting your message to people who are part of specific
     associations or groups, you are connecting with self-qualified
     motivated leads.
*T

   "IBM's experience with SmartBrief is encouraging. It's a success
shared by many of our other advertisers who derive value from our
targeted, association-based audience," said Jack Fordi, vice president
of Advertising Sales and Operations at SmartBrief. "IBM has come to
expect a sophisticated and highly engaged readership from SmartBrief.
We're pleased to deliver it to them every day."

   All SmartBrief publications rely on proprietary technology and the

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 9 (Reuters) - Stifel Nicolaus downgraded Coca-Cola
Enterprises Inc (CCE.N) to "hold" from "buy", and lowered its
estimates for the beverage bottler, citing the recent spike in
corn prices and increased sales of vitaminwater at convenience
stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said vitaminwater is cannibalizing Coca-Cola
and other fizzy single-serve soft drinks in convenience stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The weakening North American economy has been cutting into
sales volume of the world's largest bottler of Coca-Cola Co
(KO.N) beverages, especially in higher-margin 20-ounce bottles,
which are sold in convenience stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stifel also lowered earnings estimates for Pepsi Bottling
Group Inc PBG.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said both Coca-Cola Enterprises and Pepsi
Bottling are being hit by higher corn prices, increases in
estimated PET costs and deteriorating demand for non-alcoholic
beverages sold by both companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; High-fructose corn syrup is a key beverage ingredient,
while PET is used in plastic bottles. Last month, floods in the
U.S. Midwest destroyed millions of acres of corn, sending
prices to record highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage lowered its 2009 earnings estimate for
Coca-Cola Enterprises to $1.26 from $1.46, and Pepsi Bottling
to $2.37 from $2.53.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Coca-Cola Enterprises were down about 3 percent
at $16.55 in early morning trade on the New York Stock
Exchange, while Pepsi Bottling was flat at $27.88 on the NYSE.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'AA-/F1+' long- and short-term
Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Goldman),
along with all outstanding debt ratings. The rating affirmations
follow a review of the investment banking industry. Total unsecured
long-term debt of $182 billion was outstanding as of May 30, 2008. The
Rating Outlook is Stable. A complete list of ratings is detailed at
the end of this press release.

   Goldman prudently manages its balance sheet, and continues to
exhibit strong liquidity management throughout the currently stressed
environment. Goldman has been profitable, maintains its lead positions
in global advisory, equity underwriting, and prime brokerage.

   Goldman effectively limited its exposure to subprime mortgages and
related derivative instruments. In doing so, it has avoided the most
severe valuation losses incurred by many other participants in the
securitized mortgage arena. Mark-to-market valuations taken in recent
quarters on other high risk exposures - e.g., commercial real estate,
leverage finance and financial guarantees - have been modest.
Notwithstanding the liquidity and credit pressures prevalent in global
markets, Goldman's performance in first-half 2008 (1H'08) was solid,
and excelled among peers.

   It is Fitch's view that credit markets will remain challenged in
the near term, with earnings among investment banks expected to remain
highly variable. Recent contributions from both the Investment Banking
and FICC demonstrate Goldman's agility to navigate the current
environment, and in some instances, take advantage of dynamic market
conditions profitably.

   The diversity and scale of the franchise enables Goldman to commit
significant resources to principal investments without negative
ratings implications. These investments can produce unpredictable
gains and losses. The exposures created by these principal trading and
proprietary investment activities will be considered in the context of
overall franchise significance, earnings contributions, incremental
risk and capital consumption.

   The present ratings will accommodate continued positive
performance. Fitch may take negative rating actions if there is
increased risk-taking that is not supported by sufficient capital
growth, exceptional trading losses, impaired liquidity, rising
leverage and/or tangible equity erosion.

   Fitch has affirmed the following ratings with a Stable Outlook:

   Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

   --Long-term IDR 'AA-';

   --Long-term senior debt 'AA-';

   --Subordinated 'A+';

   --Preferred equity 'A+';

   --Short-term IDR 'F1+';

   --Short-term debt 'F1+';

   --Individual 'B';

   --Support '5';

   --Support Floor 'NF'.

   Goldman Sachs Capital I, II, III

   --Trust preferred 'A+'.

   Goldman Sachs Paris Inc. et Cie.

   --Long-term IDR 'AA-';

   --Short-term IDR 'F1+'.

   Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings
are available on the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com.
Published ratings, criteria and methodologies are available from this
site, at all times. Fitch's code of conduct, confidentiality,
conflicts of interest, affiliate firewall, compliance and other
relevant policies and procedures are also available from the 'Code of
Conduct' section of this site.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, July 9 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
said on Wednesday it had withdrawn from the leading
international banking lobby IIF, which it earlier criticised
over its plans to change fair value accounting rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We believe that in times of market stress, it is
particularly important to be rigorous about the value of your
assets and your liabilities," Goldman Sachs spokesman Lucas van
Praag said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have always had a rigorous approach to fair value
accounting," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Institute for International Finance (IIF) is working on
new accounting and other guidelines, as financial supervisors
ponder possible changes in regulation in response to the credit
crunch that has cost banks more than $300 billion in losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In April, the institute called for an urgent rethink of
standards that force banks to put a price on their assets
despite choppy markets, saying they could spark a downward
spiral and make problems worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Critics have said the plans would boil down to relaxing the
standards, and Van Praag said he had in May described the IIF
plan to change the existing fair value standards as "Alice in
Wonderland accounting".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs had left the body on June 2, Van Praag said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fair value rules puts a price on assets and liabilities by
looking at their current market value, as opposed to calculating
a value based on their original price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The IIF has been looking at refinements in fair value
accounting and has been discussing a range of alternative
valuation ideas, such as the use of underlying cash flow for
illiquid market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The IIF said on May 28 more discussion of valuation methods
is needed, and it is due to release this month recommendations
on valuation, risk management, bank executive compensation and
other issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley (MS.N), an IIF member, also opposes changes
to fair value accounting, a source close to the bank said.
Morgan Stanley declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The IIF is chaired by Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) Chief
Executive Josef Ackermann, and has more than 370 members. Its
regular meetings are closely watched by the sector.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp introduced on Wednesday pricing for its suite of online services targeted at corporate customers and a revenue-sharing plan to encourage other companies to sell the software company's products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company plans to charge corporate customers a monthly subscription of $15 per user for a suite of "hosted" software, which includes e-mail, Web meeting, collaboration and messaging applications running on Microsoft's computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Online Services is part of the software maker's effort to capitalize on the shift by corporate customers to abandon their own in-house computer systems for "cloud computing," a less expensive alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company built its business selling software to run on individual machines, both computer servers that power entire businesses and personal computers. But, in recent years, it has invested billions of dollars in massive data centers, which are the basic infrastructure for a wide range of Web services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has started offering corporate customers the option of having Microsoft run their e-mail, collaboration or sales programs on the software giant's computers and delivering those applications over the Web as a monthly subscription service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're seeing customers, partners and even competitors embrace this flexible approach to the cloud," Stephen Elop, president of Microsoft's business division, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it signed a number of new online services customers including Nokia and Danish shipping and oil group AP Moeller Maersk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's software suite is priced at $180 a year for each subscriber while rival Google Inc's competing product, Google Apps, which comes with e-mail, messaging and document sharing, costs around $50 a year per user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft argues that its offerings are more advanced than Google Apps. Technology administrators can manage Microsoft Online Services' accounts in the same way it deals with accounts of users running on their own computer systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said it will share 18 percent of the subscription fees with companies that bring in new customers to the online service suite in the first year and 6 percent each year over the life of the contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By employing a revenue-sharing model, Microsoft said it can probably add more customers than it could alone and it could encourage other companies to build applications to work with its online services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also introduced Deskless Worker Suite, which includes stripped-down online versions of its Outlook e-mail application and SharePoint collaboration software for $3 a month per user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software suite is targeted at workers such as nurses and factory employees who have traditionally not been given e-mail accounts or other forms of productivity software. By offering a low-cost product that can be accessed through a Web browser, Microsoft believes it can broaden its base of users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Eric Auchard in San Francisco; Editing by Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

   "The young men and women we are honoring today are the future
leaders of our nation so it is our responsibility to help them attain
higher educational achievements and to help prepare them to be
successful in their chosen field of interest. We congratulate the
national award recipients and look forward to hearing the great things
they will accomplish in the future."

   Of Mexican descent, Reyna is an AP Scholar with Honors, High Honor
Roll Student, a two-time Science Fair 1st Place Winner, and the
recipient of 2nd Place in the Science Bowl Competition. She is also a

paperwork at the U.S. Citizenship Workshop, and has volunteered
numerous hours in the Raul Yzaguirre School for Success' technology
department. Last summer, Reyna formed part of the Houston A+ Summer
Internship program for the Baylor College of Medicine where she was
able to conduct scientific research on cisplatin-induced toxicities.
Furthermore, she served as an intern for the Institute of Orthopedic
Research at the Methodist center. She is also a USA/MAES scholar,
recipient of the Phi Beta Kappa and the Jesse H. Jones Scholarship.

   "I'm thrilled and honored to receive this prestigious award from
ExxonMobil and the Hispanic Heritage Foundation," said Reyna. "My
Mexican heritage is a source of pride, strength and motivation to
succeed. I attribute all my determination and success to my family."

   Earlier this year, the Hispanic Heritage Youth Awards program
presented educational grants to 252 Hispanic high school seniors in 12
regions: Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City,
Northern California, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego and
Washington, DC. During regional ceremonies, students were awarded in
the following areas of accomplishment: Academic Excellence, Business,
Engineering and Mathematics, Education, Leadership, Journalism and
Sports.

   Award recipients were chosen by regional selection committees
based on their academic achievement, community service, category focus
and an essay about the important role their heritage played upon their
success.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Wall Street bank JP Morgan said on Tuesday crude oil futures may hit $150 later this month while its rival Lehman Brothers' LEH.N equities team raised their oil price estimates sharply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International benchmark U.S. crude futures CLc1 struck a record high of $145.85 a barrel last week due to a combination of robust demand growth from emerging markets such as China, concerns over long-term supplies and inflow of investors' money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil's 50 percent rise this year has surpassed most analysts' expectations, prompting them to repeatedly revise their price forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the $150 in easy reach and a significant number of outstanding August WTI call options at that strike price, it seems almost a certainty ahead of the July 22 expiry," JP Morgan (JPM.N) said in its monthly research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said it expects the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), or the underlying grade of U.S. crude futures, to likely remain above $130 for the rest of the summer and $115 throughout this year even if demand weakens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Cheng with Lehman Brothers' equity research team raised its oil price view to an average $127 a barrel for 2008 from its previous assumption of $105.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He expected oil prices would average $115 next year, compared with a previous forecast of $90, he said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ikuko Kao; editing by James Jukwey)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASTANA, July 9 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan urged a Chevron-led
(CVX.N) oil venture on Wednesday to work out a way to lock up
its vast open-air sulphur stocks in an indoor facility by 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The authorities have long accused the Tengiz oilfield
project of making slow progress in removing open air sulphur
stocks. A court slapped a 74 billion tenge ($609 million) fine
on Tengizchevroil last year but the fine was later halved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Raushan Sarmurzina, a senior Energy Ministry official, told
reporters the ministry had put forward its demands "in a strict
manner".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "By 2010 all the sulphur must be stored in a storage
facility if it's not sold by then," she said. "It's our goal and
we've put forward this question in a strict manner."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The oil from Tengiz contains toxic hydrogen sulphide which
is processed into huge piles of inert yellow sulphur and stored
near the oil wells before the crude is transported by pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Tengiz venture also includes Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), LUKOIL
(LKOH.MM), and Kazakh energy firm KazMunaiGas [KMG.UL]. The
venture has challenged Kazakh accusations, saying it was not
violating ecological legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "First of all we think that at the moment we are storing the
sulphur in a proper way," Murat Mynbayev, a Tengizchevroil
official, told reporters. "As for 2010, we have no information
about that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He added his company was working on various ways of storing
sulphur indoors and planned to cut stocks significantly by 2017.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Torpex Games Announce the Release of Schizoid(TM)! Available Now Exclusively for Xbox LIVE(R) Arcade

    Groundbreaking Xbox LIVE Arcade Title Is The First Built Using
                      Microsoft's XNA Game Studio
BELLEVUE, Wash.--(Business Wire)--
Prepare for a brain meltdown! Microsoft and Torpex Games announced
today the release of Schizoid(TM) for Xbox LIVE(R) Arcade. Billed as
"the most co-op game ever", Schizoid creates a new category of action
gaming where teamwork equals survival and players must protect each
other from waves of glowing enemies. Available for download now,
Schizoid is the first-ever Xbox LIVE Arcade title built using
Microsoft's XNA Game Studio.

   "Torpex Games assembled an all-star team that truly believed in
the vision of this singular game, and they ended up creating a unique
and innovative game that embodies Xbox LIVE Arcade," said Jeremy
Wacksman, Microsoft's Global Product Manager, Xbox LIVE. "We are very
happy that Schizoid is the superb first result of our XNA Game Studio
initiative on Xbox Live Arcade."

   Created by a team of veteran game developers, Schizoid features
addictively simple gameplay. One or two players control one red ship
and one blue ship, which are continually attacked by red and blue
enemies. Each ship can destroy enemies of its own color, but will be
destroyed by enemies of the other color. Quick reflexes help, but
sharp teamwork is the difference between winning and losing.

   "Schizoid is a landmark co-op gaming experience, unlike any other
game. It's a new experience that you've got to try," says Bill Dugan,
Torpex Games' president. "And although it has been reported that
Schizoid will 'make your brain melt and ooze out of your ears', I want
to reassure gamers that in our testing we found no evidence of actual
brain liquefaction."

   Two players can play cooperatively on the same Xbox 360(TM)
console or over Xbox LIVE. In single-player mode, players can opt to
control either one ship, while an AI "Wingman Bot" controls the other
ship; or control both ships in the hardcore "Uberschizoid" game mode.

   About Torpex Games

   Founded in 2005, Torpex Games is a video game development company
composed of distinguished, driven, and ferociously competent industry
veterans. Based in Bellevue, Washington, Torpex Games' mission is to
create console games that are, simply, addictive. More information on

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - While Yahoo Inc is busy pursuing an independent strategy, forces beyond its control leave it increasingly vulnerable to a fresh takeover bid by Microsoft Corp without the increased premium shareholders once hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's initial unsolicited takeover bid was a half-cash, half-stock offer of $31 per share, for a value of $44.6 billion. Microsoft later raised it to a $33-a-share bid valued at $47.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo stock now rises or falls on speculation about what price Microsoft may end up paying for it. Earlier this month, as hopes of a new bid evaporated, Yahoo shares fell to $19.59, near their level in January before Microsoft began its bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Microsoft back in the picture as a potential acquirer, Yahoo shares traded up above $24 a share on Nasdaq on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, rebuffed by Yahoo in its original takeover bid, said on Monday it had given up on negotiating with current management but was ready to instantly reopen talks if activist investor Carl Icahn wrests control of Yahoo's board at its annual meeting on August 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also conspiring against Yahoo is a further decline in the U.S. economy and the online advertising market on which its revenue depends. Yahoo can only hold back or cut costs so far before having to lower its already weak outlook again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All this deal speculation is happening in the space of an increasingly dicey environment in terms of adverting," RBC Capital analyst Ross Sandler said. "If Yahoo starts missing its numbers, the stock moves back to $20," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street is looking for revenue to grow 11 percent but profits to fall nearly 13 percent when the Internet company reports second-quarter results on July 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Financial and pharmaceutical ads are under pressure," Canaccord Adams analyst Colin Gillis said of two heavy online ad spenders. "Yahoo is going to have a lackluster June quarter with disappointing September guidance likely," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fueling concern is Monday's warnings from personal finance company Bankrate Inc, which cut its 2008 outlook, citing a sharp drop in spending on Web display ads by marketers in financial services -- a key sector for Yahoo as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOMETHING LESS THAN $33?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central issue, Wall Street analysts say, is not whether Yahoo has a coherent strategy for controlling its destiny but whether it has time to achieve its goals. Many are impressed by recent partnership deals and efforts to open up products and advertising systems, but see it as too little, too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors are back to debating what side of $30 Microsoft would end up paying if Icahn succeeds in turning over the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the stock component, the value of that offer sank from $44.6 billion in January to below $42 billion, or about $29 a share, by May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's potential new bid is unlikely to start as high as the $33 a share Microsoft offered just before calling off merger talks in early May, said UBS analyst Ben Schachter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it's likely to be a far cry from the $34-$35 a share that major investors called for earlier this year, or the $37 Yahoo management had made as a counterproposal to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think we've seen enough time passed that you're going to have Microsoft looking at where the business is today and what they want to pay for it," Schachter said. He predicts a renewed bid from Microsoft in the $31-$33 a share range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The business has weakened since the original offer was made. You have both the macroeconomic environment weighing on the stock as well as all the distractions from the original bid itself," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gillis said, "The only deal that was only ever really on the table -- $31 per share in cash and stock -- is probably the one that we see get revived."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gillis added, "In a deteriorating economic environment, an all-cash offer of $28, $29 or $30 (per share) starts to look pretty good" to shareholders who had once bet on a $35 takeout price. He too sees Microsoft reviving the $31-a-share offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOW LOW COULD MICROSOFT GO?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft may be tempted to offer even less if Icahn wrests control of Yahoo in his proxy campaign to elect an alternative slate of directors in three weeks. Icahn and Microsoft have said they are ready to reopen merger talks if he prevails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Jefferies  Co analyst Youssef Squali warned that Icahn may have few options other than selling to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Icahn wins a full slate and he doesn't have a 'Plan B' then Microsoft has him over the barrel," Squali said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's to keep Microsoft from letting Icahn push out Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang and board, then swooping in with a low-ball $18 per share offer, asks Trip Chowdry, a software financial analyst with Global Equities Research in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Pritchard, a Microsoft analyst at Cowen  Co, said another factor to consider is the effect on Yahoo employees if Microsoft comes in with a far lower bid, not to mention the resistance by major shareholders counting on a big premium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They (Microsoft) would like to discount, but I think they know it would be a lot harder to get a deal done if they were to put a significant discount on the deal," he said. "For a few billion dollars (extra), it's just worth it to get it done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think Microsoft will pay more than what they last said they'll pay -- they'll do it there rather than at $1 or $2 less. At worst they'll pay $33 for the whole thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi in Seattle; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sony Group, Toshiba and IBM Renew Cell Broadband Engine(TM) Center of Competence with Georgia Tech

   Upcoming Workshop to Focus on Developing Commercial Applications
    and Productivity Software for Cell Broadband Engine (Cell/B.E.)
                               Processor
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Georgia Tech College of Computing today announced the renewal
of the Sony Corporation/Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. (Sony
Group)-Toshiba-IBM Center of Competence (STI Center), based on Georgia
Tech's exceptional work in multiple areas of research and evangelism
for the Cell Broadband Engine(TM) (Cell/B.E.) technology. Through
Georgia Tech's efforts, the STI Center has been responsible for
creating and disseminating software optimized for Cell/B.E. systems,
and for performing research on the design of Cell/B.E. systems,
algorithms and applications. In conjunction with this renewal of the
STI Center, Georgia Tech is announcing a series of new research
projects that are being undertaken at the center to develop
applications and productivity tools based on the Cell/B.E.
microprocessor.

   Georgia Tech also announced today that it will host the Second
Annual Cell/B.E. Processor Workshop from July 10-11, 2008, focusing on
software, tools and applications for the Cell/B.E. processor,
including high performance computing applications and programmability
tools. The two-day workshop is sponsored by Sony Group, Toshiba and
IBM and will be held at the Klaus Advanced Computing Building on
Georgia Tech's campus. More information on the workshop may be found
at http:/sti.cc.gatech.edu/.

   The STI Center of Competence was created at Georgia Tech to test
the boundaries and demonstrate the extreme performance of the
Cell/B.E. architecture. "Today, we are carrying out the vision we
always intended - to generate breakthrough innovations using Cell/B.E.
technologies working hand-in-hand with researchers at Sony Group,
Toshiba and IBM," said David A. Bader, professor and executive
director of High-Performance Computing in the Georgia Tech College of
Computing. "We are very encouraged that our initial research results
are showing the multi-faceted applicability of this technology."

   One of the key research challenges that the collaborators will
address through continued applied research is the use of Cell/B.E.
technology to better monitor an aircraft's structural safety in
commercial and military airplanes. Researchers will develop Cell/B.E.
based data-processing software that will expeditiously and accurately
monitor structural components in flight by measuring and recording an
aircraft's vibrations through a distributed network of sensors.
Although a commercial signal processing application for airplanes is a
long term plan, researchers are working to develop a solid software
foundation in the labs.

   "IBM has invested in a strategy that applies the use of technology
to solve grand challenges with our trusted university partners," said
Jai Menon, IBM Fellow, vice president, Technical Strategy and
University Relations. "In our collaboration with Georgia Tech, we are
working together to better predict airline mechanical failures to make
flying in airlines safer for passengers like you and me."

   The other joint research projects in productivity enhancements
include:

   --  A useful signal processing kernel needed for oil and gas
        exploration and seismic monitoring;

   --  Data compression, used for file compression or reducing the
        size of messages sent between computers required in multiple
        industries;

   --  Financial services applications for consolidated debt
        optimization, as well as European and American options
        pricing;

   --  Encryption libraries for securing communications for privacy;

   --  High-speed multimedia codecs, such as MPEG2 and JPEG2000
        encoders and decoders;

   --  Bioinformatics, such as DNA sequence alignment and comparison;

   --  Software productivity enhancement tools that involve a
        cross-platform profiler, performance estimation and tuning
        system with IDE type features.

   --  Single-source automatic translator for generating PPU and SPU
        codes from a monolithic C/C++ application.

   "We anticipate a paradigm shift in computing and our collaboration
with the Georgia Tech College of Computing will create innovative
applications for Cell/B.E. processors," said Yasu Yokote, general
manager, CELL Application Development Center, Sony Corporation. "For a
year STI Center created at Georgia Tech, they created software
productivity enhancement tools, which are valuable for moving legacy
code bases to CELL/B.E. and will generate tremendous value to all
Cell-based products."

   "Within a year of the opening of the Center of Competence at
Georgia Tech, researchers are already generating outstanding results
on Cell/B.E.," said Mitsuo Saito, Chief Fellow, Toshiba Corporation
Semiconductor Company. "The future will see growing demand for
multi-core processor applications, and we are delighted that the
Center is playing a key role in anticipating and responding to such
demand."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) expects its refining and marketing operations to post a loss in the second quarter, somewhat restraining earnings that will be mostly driven by record oil and natural gas prices, the second-largest U.S. oil company said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company said its refining and marketing results are expected to drop "well in excess" of $500 million in the second quarter, from a profit of about $252 million in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said those operations were hurt by planned and unplanned maintenance at its refineries, higher operating expenses and the accounting impact of rapidly rising crude oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron expects its earnings from exploration and production to be higher than the $5.13 billion it posted in the first quarter as oil prices have continued their steady rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts, on average, expect Chevron's overall earnings per share to rise over 40 percent from first quarter levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The San Ramon, Calif., company said the price it received for a barrel of oil in April and May rose more than 20 percent from first quarter levels to an average of $109.19 per barrel. Its average international price for liquid hydrocarbons was $106.14 per barrel in those months, up from $86.13 in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its production in the first two months in the quarter fell about 2 percent from first quarter levels to an average of 2.54 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. It produced about 2.63 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year earlier quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past two quarters, weak refining profits have kept big, integrated oil companies from realizing as much upside from the record oil prices as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said its loss from refining and marketing would come even as benchmark refining margins have improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said input volumes at its U.S. refineries fell to 772,000 barrels per day in April and May from 894,000 barrels per day in the first quarter. Input volumes at its international refineries fell about 1 percent to 955,000 barrels per day in the first two months of the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron also expects its after-tax charges from corporate and other activities to be between $250 million and $300 million for environmental remediation and other corporate items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares closed up $2.34, or 2.5 percent, at $96.25 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michael Erman; Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
In its interim update for the second quarter 2008, Chevron
Corporation (NYSE:CVX) reported that upstream earnings are expected to
benefit from an increase in prices for crude oil and natural gas while
downstream earnings are expected to be significantly lower than the
first quarter. Additionally, "all other" charges are anticipated to be
substantially higher compared with the first quarter.

   Basis for Comparison in Interim Update

   The interim update contains certain industry and company operating
data for the second quarter 2008. The production volumes,
realizations, margins and certain other items in the report are based
on a portion of the quarter and are not necessarily indicative of
Chevron's quarterly results to be reported on August 1, 2008. The
reader should not place undue reliance on this data.

   Unless noted otherwise, all commentary is based on two months of
the second quarter 2008 vs. full first quarter 2008 results.

   U.S. liquids production was essentially unchanged during the first
two months of the second quarter, while international liquids
production declined about 2 percent. The increase in crude oil prices
during this period reduced the company's production under
cost-recovery and variable-royalty provisions of certain international
production contracts. U.S. natural gas production decreased nearly 5
percent primarily due to operational downtime and natural field
declines. International natural gas production decreased about 3
percent, reflecting the absence of the first quarter's favorable
unitization adjustment in Indonesia.

   U.S. crude oil realizations rose more than $19 per barrel to
$109.19. International liquids realizations averaged $106.14 per
barrel, up about $20 per barrel from the first quarter. U.S. natural
gas realizations increased $1.87 to $9.42 per thousand cubic feet,
while international natural gas realizations rose $0.63 to $5.46 per
thousand cubic feet.

   Compared with the first quarter, refining indicator margins for
the full second quarter improved. Marketing margins were mixed.
Asia-Pacific/Middle East/Africa marketing margins declined between the
first quarter and the first two months of the second quarter. U.S.
marketing indicator margins were lower, particularly on the West
Coast, comparing the first quarter to the full second quarter. Despite
improved refining indicator margins, earnings for the downstream
segment in the full second quarter are expected to decline well in
excess of $500 million compared with the first quarter.

   The projected decline in downstream earnings between sequential
quarters reflects the following factors:

   --  Timing effects associated with the increase in crude prices.
        From the start to the end of the second quarter, WTI crude
        prices increased $39 per barrel. This rapid rise in crude
        prices led to lower second quarter earnings, primarily due to
        impacts on provisionally priced crudes and derivative
        positions under mark-to-market accounting.

   --  The effects of planned and unplanned refinery downtime. The
        company did not fully benefit from higher U.S. Gulf Coast
        margins due to planned downtime at the Pascagoula, Mississippi
        refinery. The downtime was associated with scheduled
        maintenance of the refinery's No. 1 crude unit for 51 days and
        the coker for 63 days during the second quarter. The crude
        unit resumed operations in mid-May and the coker in early
        July. In addition, the company's refinery at Pembroke, United
        Kingdom experienced unplanned downtime in late April. The
        refinery resumed full operations in late May.

   --  Higher operating expenses, including fuel and costs associated
        with the refinery shutdowns.

   U.S. refinery daily crude-input volumes decreased primarily due to
scheduled maintenance of the Pascagoula Refinery's No. 1 crude unit.
Outside the U.S., refinery input volumes fell slightly due to the
unplanned shutdown at the Pembroke refinery, partially offset by the
completion of a planned shutdown at the company's refinery in South
Africa.

   In the Chemicals segment, earnings for the full second quarter are
expected to be roughly unchanged from the first quarter. The absence
of the first quarter's provision for environmental remediation is
projected to be largely offset by increased plant maintenance
activity.

   ALL OTHER

   The company's guidance for the quarterly net after-tax charges
related to corporate and other activities is between $250 million and
$300 million. Due to the potential for irregularly occurring accruals
related to income taxes, pension settlements and other matters, actual
results may significantly differ from the guidance range.

   For the full second quarter, net charges are expected to be
significantly higher than the standard guidance range, primarily
reflecting charges for environmental remediation, along with other
corporate items.

(Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries); the potential
liability for remedial actions or assessments under existing or future
environmental regulations and litigation; significant investment or
product changes under existing or future environmental statutes,
regulations and litigation; the potential liability resulting from
pending or future litigation; the company's acquisition or disposition
of assets; gains and losses from asset dispositions or impairments;
government-mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, changes in
fiscal terms or restrictions on scope of company operations; foreign
currency movements compared with the U.S. dollar; the effects of
changed accounting rules under generally accepted accounting
principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; and the factors set
forth under the heading "Risk Factors" on pages 32 and 33 of the
company's 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K/A. In addition, such
statements could be affected by general domestic and international
economic and political conditions. Unpredictable or unknown factors
not discussed in this report could also have material adverse effects
on forward-looking statements.

&lt;p&gt;  BUCHAREST, ROMANIA, Jul 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
BitDefender Labs released a signature update to protect clients against
the latest unpatched Microsoft(R) Word exploit. The vulnerability affects
Word 2002 SP3 and could be exploited by an attacker to "gain the same
user rights as the local user," according to Microsoft.

    The exploit is already being used in the wild.

    "The samples we retrieved were already being detected as malicious by
BitDefender software, as the exploit was being used to drop a malicious
executable file that we had already signed," explained Senior BitDefender
AV Researcher Attila Balazs. "As of this morning, we've also added
detection for the exploit itself, blocking this avenue of attack against
our clients once and for all."

    The dropped component is a backdoor detected by BitDefender as
Backdoor.PoisonIvy.CV. Once installed, PoisonIvy grants complete control
over the affected computer to an attacker.

    Malicious files containing the exploit are detected by BitDefender as
Exploit.Word.MS-953635.A. The vulnerability itself is detailed in
Microsoft Security Advisory 953635. An analysis of the PoisonIvy backdoor
variant used in the attacks is ongoing and will be published on the
BitDefender website as soon as possible.

&lt;p&gt;MultiFactor SecureAuth(R) for Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 Delivers Efficient, Inexpensive Solution for Secure Portals

IRVINE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
MultiFactor Corporation, an innovator in 2-factor authentication,
Microsoft web application security and VPN Authentication solutions,
today announced the availability of SecureAuth 4.5 for Microsoft
Office SharePoint Server 2007, a secure access solution for enterprise
portals.

   Office SharePoint Server 2007 is Microsoft's industry-leading

aggregation. Office SharePoint Server 2007 is increasingly utilized as
the offering of choice for scalable portals to both internal users,
extranet partners and customers. The ability of Office SharePoint
Server 2007 to expose content, previously only available to intranet
users, is unparalleled in portal products.

the business needs and resource constraints faced by the enterprise
today," said Deb Bannon, SharePoint Senior Product Manager. "The
integration of Office SharePoint Server with products like MultiFactor
SecureAuth enables the enterprise to further secure content shared
across the intranet and with extranet partners."

   "SecureAuth utilizes native ASP.NET authentication and data
integration features to seamlessly integrate into an Office SharePoint
Server 2007 deployment. SecureAuth takes advantage of the new forms
based authentication features in SharePoint Server 2007 to redirect
the user to the SecureAuth solution and then conduct a secure,
non-phishable validation," said Garret Grajek, COO of MultiFactor
Corporation. "Upon authentication the user is redirected back to
SharePoint Server 2007 to obtain the roles and permissions set up by
the SharePoint Server 2007 administrative console."

   In conjunction with the Office SharePoint Server platform,
SecureAuth is able to deliver a secure credential, mapped directly to
the individual user. SecureAuth utilizes the existing data store
shared by the Office SharePoint Server 2007 platform, thus eliminating
the need to create or replicate an additional data store.

&lt;p&gt;BELTSVILLE, Maryland (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said its epilepsy drugs do not increase the risk of suicidal behavior and should be exempt from tougher warnings being sought for similar medications, despite concerns from U.S. health regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company told a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel on Thursday that its Lyrica and Neurontin drugs work differently than those of rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A company review of available data showed they were not linked to higher rates of completed suicides or related thoughts, Pfizer told the FDA meeting of outside experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no evidence of an elevated risk," said Christopher Wohlberg, Pfizer's team leader for Lyrica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA is seeking the advisory panel's advice on whether a strong "black box" warning should be required for 11 drugs that treat seizure disorders or for only some of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDA officials told the panel that their analysis found a clear link between most of the drugs and greater suicidal behavior and there was no reason to exclude certain medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue is particularly complicated because suicidal behavior can be a symptom of epilepsy, a condition in which abnormal electrical activity in the brain triggers seizures that can cause involuntary movement or behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy medications aim to prevent seizures, and roughly 11 million patients take them, according to data from the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some epilepsy drugs already caution about possible suicide, but a boxed warning -- the strongest in the United States -- could dent sales as black boxes must be prominently displayed in advertising and could make doctors more cautious about prescribing the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Pfizer were to avoid a boxed warning, it could more freely market its medicines. Abbott Laboratories Inc's Depakote already has a boxed warning for liver damage and other complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other epilepsy drugs include GlaxoSmithKline Plc's Lamictal, Johnson  Johnson's Topamax and UCB Inc's Keppra, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medications brought in more than $10 billion in 2007 sales, according to healthcare information company IMS Health. Both Lamictal and Topamax saw roughly $2.1 billion in sales, while Lyrica reached nearly $1.1 billion and Keppra $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar suicide warnings have been added in recent years to drugs for depression. Some panel members expressed concerns about the effect those cautions had on patients, noting that prescriptions have declined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we saw ... was a real scare factor," said Gail Griffith, a consumer representative on the panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDA officials said it was too early to see what impact the depression drug warnings had on related suicides but boxed warnings are meant draw attention to risks, not deter use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For epilepsy products, FDA Director of Neurology Products Russell Katz told the advisers that while it was unclear how the various epilepsy drugs worked, they treat the same condition and should be considered as a group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is important that we avoid inappropriately shifting prescribing to members of the class that in fact have the same signal," Katz told the panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Pfizer said their drugs were unique and should be weighed separately, one of its rivals agreed with the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack Modell, Glaxo's vice president of clinical development for neurosciences, said available data was difficult to interpret, but Glaxo's analysis mirrored the FDA's findings and warnings should be included on all such drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of doctors and researchers expressed concern to the panel about the possible new warnings, saying current data was not conclusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But lawyers and family members for those who took some of the epilepsy drugs in question and committed suicide, said companies and the FDA should have done more sooner to warn the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Pfizer were unchanged at $18.03 in afternoon trading. Shares of Glaxo were down 1 percent to $48.07, while shares of Johnson  Johnson were up 1.1 percent to $66.93. Shares of Abbott were up 0.3 percent to $57.09. All four companies trade of the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Susan Heavey; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FDA Didn't Like Redux' Use of Chalky Fonts
MURRIETA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Redux Beverages, the makers of Cocaine Energy Supplement and
Brawndo: The Thirst Mutilator announced today that they are planning a
new look for Cocaine. Although Redux had been planning to update the
look and feel of its flagship product some time before 2009, a recent
letter from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prompted the
company to introduce those changes by the end of July instead.

   The majority of the objections raised in the FDA letter concerned
the chalky-looking fonts used to spell out the name of the product and
some of its ingredients. The names of the two fonts in question are
"Squeaky Chalk Sound" and "Boring Lesson," both licensed by Redux from
German font design firm Anke-Art (www.anke-art.de). On the Anke-Art
website, the fonts' designer explained that Squeaky Chalk Sound was
created because he "needed a chalk font" and that Boring Lesson came
about because "(t)here were quite a lot boring lessons at the
University. So I played around with my fountain pen and ink eraser."
The FDA found a much more sinister lesson in Anke-Art's font,
suggesting that it "appear(s) to be cocaine powder ... that has been
'cut' by an object (presumably a credit card or razor blade) to form
letters."

   Redux Beverages says that "School teachers everywhere should now
be on notice that things written in chalk will be scrutinized more
closely by the federal government and could subject the chalk-bearer
to civil and criminal liability. No word from the government on
whether a chalk ban is next, but school districts across the nation
would be well-advised to consider a shift to dry-erase boards. But
please, for goodness sake, do NOT sniff those markers!"

   "This is just a case of runaway regulators running roughshod over
free speech and the free market," said Jamey Kirby, founder of Redux
Beverages. "In the last year or so, the U.S. has experienced
life-threatening problems with our domestic supply of tomatoes,
spinach, peanut butter, imported seafood and even pet food. Worse,
many experts predict that the next terrorist attack could focus on our
food supply. So, why is the FDA wasting its precious resources
complaining about what fonts Redux is using to advertise our product?"

   "If there is any justice," Kirby continued, "our struggles with
the FDA will become a rallying cry against the wasteful practices and
upside-down priorities of the federal government. And it's not like
these guys are elected or accountable in any way. Hey, I know it's an
election year, but how, exactly, do we vote these regulators out of
office?"

   As part of its new branding campaign, Redux will also replace the
word "cut" in its marketing material with "mild" to signify the milder
version of the product that has less of a spicy kick. So, Cut Cocaine
will soon be sold as Cocaine Mild and might even be packaged in a
different-colored can. In its letter, the FDA made it clear that such
a change was important because the word "cut" constitutes "well-known
terminology associated with and suggestive of illicit drug use."
Similarly, Redux may begin advising customers not to use a straw to
drink Cocaine, or a dollar bill to pay for it, because both of those
actions could be misinterpreted by the FDA as use of illicit drug
paraphernalia.

   The FDA letter opined that the overall marketing and labeling of
the product - including the name of the product, the chalky fonts, and
the use of the word "cut" - violates FDA regulations because they
demonstrate that Redux is trying to market its product as a
replacement for an illicit street drug. The FDA was apparently
unimpressed with the explicit statement to the contrary found on each
can of the product: "This product is not intended to be anything more
than an energy drink."

   In an attempt to be even more explicit, Redux will soon introduce
cans of Cocaine that instruct consumers as follows: "This product is
not intended to be an alternative to an illicit street drug, and
anyone who thinks otherwise is an idiot, a government regulator, or
both."

   "Let's be clear: the FDA has never claimed that our product
contains anything harmful," said Clegg Ivey, general counsel for
Redux. "Moreover, it's not even the FDA's position that the name
itself is illegal. I asked them straight up if it's just about the
name, but they replied that no, the legality of the product depends on
whether, given the totality of the product's marketing, Redux is
intending to market it as an alternative to an illicit street drug.
Well, of course we're not marketing our product as an alternative to
the illicit street drug, and it's just silly to suggest otherwise."

   "Despite the fact that we find the FDA claims to be ridiculous,"
Ivey continued, "we have worked hard to address their concerns. Last
year, it was our slogan (we got rid of it) and this year it's the
fonts (we'll change them). The most expedient way to deal with their
issues is to change the aspects of our marketing that enable them to
mischaracterize our intentions - except for the name, of course, which
the First Amendment gives us the right to keep and which they will
have to pry from our cold, dead hands."

   Redux plans to introduce the new and improved look for Cocaine by
the end of July. Marketing changes will include chalkless fonts, even
cheekier warning labels, and fewer words and phrases that are liable
to quicken the pulses of federal regulators.

   About Redux Beverages LLC

   Redux Beverages LLC, founded in 2006, manufactures Cocaine, one of
the three most- talked about energy products on the market. In the
months after its release, Cocaine became the fastest selling product
in the history of the industry. In 2007, Redux introduced its second
product, Brawndo: The Thirst Mutilator. Some may recognize Brawndo as
the fictional energy drink from the cult-hit comedy, "Idiocracy,"
written by Mike Judge, who also created the classic movie, "Office
Space" as well as the hit animated tv shows "Beavis &amp; Butthead" and
"King of the Hill." Redux plans to announce its next product line,
which promises to be as every bit as edgy and innovative as Cocaine
and Brawndo, by the end of 2008. For more information visit

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters Life!) - Britain announced on Thursday that it is considering expanding visa requirements to citizens from 11 additional countries including South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nationals from more than 100 countries, equivalent to three-quarters of the world's population, need a visa to come to the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But following a "Visa Waiver Test" of all non-European countries, the government said there is a "strong case" to add 11 more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are: Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Lesotho, Malaysia, Mauritius, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test looked at the level of risk nationals from countries posed in terms of illegal immigration, and crime and security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain said visitors from these countries will now need a six-month visa. That will become a permanent requirement unless the "risk" posed by nationals from these countries is significantly reduced by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under a new system introduced in April, all visa applicants to Britain need to have their fingerprints checked before traveling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Border and Immigration Minister Liam Byrne said two million fingerprints of foreign nationals had already been examined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now we need to decide how to widen the visa net. We cannot and will not shy away from going wider and will wherever we think there's a risk to the UK," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michael Holden; Editing by Steve Addison and Paul Casciato)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ALPHARETTA, GA, Jul 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
JPC Capital Partners, Inc. (OTCBB: JPCI), a licensed broker-dealer based
in Alpharetta, Georgia, announced today that it has filed its Definitive
14C with the Securities and Exchange Commission setting the date for a
special shareholder meeting. The shareholder meeting will be held on July
30, 2008 to authorize the steps necessary to complete the acquisition of
DIAS Holding, Inc. DIAS Holding Inc. f/k/a Componus, Inc. ("Componus"),
is a Nevada Corporation involved in the multi-billion dollar industry of
providing automotive, trucking, railway and petroleum industries with
raw, finished and assembled components.

    As previously announced on March 26, 2008, JPC Capital executed a stock
purchase agreement and share exchange with Componus. The Agreement
provided for the acquisition of Componus by JPC Capital Partners, Inc.,
whereby Componus will become a wholly owned subsidiary of JPC Capital. In
connection with the acquisition of Componus, and after taking into effect
a 2 for 1 reverse split of JPC Capital common shares, JPC Capital will
issue 89,000,000 total shares of common stock. This will represent
approximately 87.25% of the total issued and outstanding common stock of
JPCI after the transaction is closed. These shares will be issued in
exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Componus. Upon
completion of the Closing, Componus intends to elect a new board of
directors and appoint new officers. Shareholders owning a controlling
interest in JPC Capital have indicated that they intend to vote to
approve the acquisition. Upon such vote, JPC Capital expects to complete
the acquisition on July 31, 2008.

    "We look forward to completing the acquisition of Componus," stated Jack
Canouse, chief executive officer of JPC Capital. "We believe that this
acquisition is in the best interest of our shareholders and will gain
positive attention in the public markets. As the big three US automakers
suffer record low sales and earnings due to overwhelmingly high cost in
the US, we believe Componus is strategically positioned to exploit the
multi-billion dollar metal forging and automotive supply industry between
the US, China and other certain Asian countries."

    Preliminary unaudited figures provided by Componus indicates that its
sales increased to $3,418,102 for the three month period ended March 31,
2008 from $2,178,449 for the three month period ended March 31, 2007. The
$1,239,653 or 57% increase in sales reflects deliveries for repeat and new
products ordered by existing clients, whose demand increased from the
previous year. Gross profit increased to $1,070,042, or 31% of sales, for
the three month period ended March 31, 2008 from $704,849, or 32% of
sales, over the three month period ended March 31, 2007. The increase
reflects the proportional rise relative to sales compared to the previous
year.

    Upon review of Componus's unaudited first quarter results, Jack Canouse
stated, "We are very pleased with the continuing growth and strength of
Componus's operations, and we are excited about the future opportunities
created by the Componus acquisition."

&lt;p&gt;  ALPHARETTA, GA, Jul 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
JPC Capital Partners, Inc. (OTCBB: JPCI), a licensed broker-dealer based
in Alpharetta, Georgia, announced today that it has filed its Definitive
14C with the Securities and Exchange Commission setting the date for a
special shareholder meeting. The shareholder meeting will be held on July
30, 2008 to authorize the steps necessary to complete the acquisition of
DIAS Holding, Inc. DIAS Holding Inc. f/k/a Componus, Inc. ("Componus"),
is a Nevada Corporation involved in the multi-billion dollar industry of
providing automotive, trucking, railway and petroleum industries with
raw, finished and assembled components.

    As previously announced on March 26, 2008, JPC Capital executed a stock
purchase agreement and share exchange with Componus. The Agreement
provided for the acquisition of Componus by JPC Capital Partners, Inc.,
whereby Componus will become a wholly owned subsidiary of JPC Capital. In
connection with the acquisition of Componus, and after taking into effect
a 2 for 1 reverse split of JPC Capital common shares, JPC Capital will
issue 89,000,000 total shares of common stock. This will represent
approximately 87.25% of the total issued and outstanding common stock of
JPCI after the transaction is closed. These shares will be issued in
exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Componus. Upon
completion of the Closing, Componus intends to elect a new board of
directors and appoint new officers. Shareholders owning a controlling
interest in JPC Capital have indicated that they intend to vote to
approve the acquisition. Upon such vote, JPC Capital expects to complete
the acquisition on July 31, 2008.

    "We look forward to completing the acquisition of Componus," stated Jack
Canouse, chief executive officer of JPC Capital. "We believe that this
acquisition is in the best interest of our shareholders and will gain
positive attention in the public markets. As the big three US automakers
suffer record low sales and earnings due to overwhelmingly high cost in
the US, we believe Componus is strategically positioned to exploit the
multi-billion dollar metal forging and automotive supply industry between
the US, China and other certain Asian countries."

    Preliminary unaudited figures provided by Componus indicates that its
sales increased to $3,418,102 for the three month period ended March 31,
2008 from $2,178,449 for the three month period ended March 31, 2007. The
$1,239,653 or 57% increase in sales reflects deliveries for repeat and new
products ordered by existing clients, whose demand increased from the
previous year. Gross profit increased to $1,070,042, or 31% of sales, for
the three month period ended March 31, 2008 from $704,849, or 32% of
sales, over the three month period ended March 31, 2007. The increase
reflects the proportional rise relative to sales compared to the previous
year.

    Upon review of Componus's unaudited first quarter results, Jack Canouse
stated, "We are very pleased with the continuing growth and strength of
Componus's operations, and we are excited about the future opportunities
created by the Componus acquisition."

&lt;p&gt; (Changes source, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 10 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded
railroad company Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC.N) to "overweight"
from "neutral," on the expectation of strong second-quarter
results, driven by high coal volumes and a tightening truckload
market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan said it expects the high-margin export coal to
account for about 12 percent of coal tons for Norfolk in 2008,
giving the company a greater leverage to the segment versus the
Western U.S. rails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brokerage said the stock had room for upside as earnings
estimates and valuation reflected lower expectations for
Norfolk versus its peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's shares closed at $60.35 Wednesday on the New
York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) Chief 
Executive Jamie Dimon likes to talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; And in the wake of his masterminding the bailout of Bear 
Stearns Cos, many on Wall Street like to listen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon has long been something of a golden child on Wall 
Street, ever since he was a protege of Sanford "Sandy" Weill at 
the company that would become Citigroup Inc (C.N), JPMorgan's 
chief New York commercial banking rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Several books profiling the baby-faced Dimon are in the 
works, as his comments on Wall Street, its foibles and the 
economy grow more influential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Part of that is because JPMorgan has avoided much of the 
credit mess that has devastated rivals such as Citigroup and 
Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think Jamie has earned the right by his performance to 
be a spokesman that people should pay attention to," Weill, the 
former Citigroup chief executive and chairman, said in an 
interview with Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Avoiding problems is one reason JPMorgan shares have 
through Wednesday dropped only 17 percent this year, compared 
with a 28 percent slide in the Standard  Poor's Financials 
Index .GSPF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon's reputation and charisma is another reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's a Jamie Dimon premium" in JPMorgan stock, said 
Richard Bove, an analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given that JPMorgan hasn't had a lot of the problems, it 
has allowed Jamie to step up and be a statesman and a spokesman 
for the entire industry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Bove said some worry Dimon's higher profile might lead 
him to set his sights farther afield. He questioned how long 
Dimon might stay with JPMorgan, the third-largest U.S. bank by 
assets, but largest by market capitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Maybe he is going to get bored with running JPMorgan," 
said Bove, who suggested Washington D.C. as Dimon's next career 
move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Weill played down the possibility of Dimon heading for 
the nation's capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's something he still might think," but that's something 
only Dimon could answer, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A JPMorgan spokesman declined comment.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TELLING OFF HIS PEERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Bruner, author of "The Panic of 1907" and dean of 
the Darden Business School at the University of Virginia, sees 
parallels between John Pierpont Morgan's handling of the 1907 
financial markets' crisis and Dimon's acquisition of Bear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan took over Bear after the latter suffered the 
equivalent of a bank run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Part of the reason JPMorgan got involved was that it was 
the financial institution widely considered best equipped to 
swallow the 85-year-old investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He sets an example at an institution that is itself 
exemplar," Bruner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After leaving Citigroup, Dimon became chief executive at 
Chicago's underperforming Bank One Corp, where he slashed costs 
and improved operations. He did so well that he engineered that 
bank's $58 billion takeover by JPMorgan in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon, 52, is also known for his staccato, broken syntax, 
perhaps a function of his being boisterous, opinionated and 
unafraid to speak his mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He sometimes has to be physically restrained from barging 
in on colleagues' calls with analysts and investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And he cuts his peers no slack, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On a conference call for Wall Street chieftains while 
JPMorgan was rescuing Bear, Dimon shot down a somewhat 
technical question from Citigroup Chief Executive Vikram 
Pandit, who has a doctorate in finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to published reports, Dimon told Pandit: "Stop 
being such a jerk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  STENNIS SPACE CENTER, MS, Jul 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVO) Major Shared Resource Center (MSRC)
will house a powerful new IBM (NYSE: IBM) supercomputer that will be used
principally to support the oceanographic modeling and analysis needs of
researchers at the Department of Defense.

    The supercomputer, a Power 575 Hydro-Cluster, has a peak speed of 90
teraflops (90 trillion floating-point operations per second), making it
one of the most powerful systems in the Department of Defense. The NAVO
MSRC is one of four Department of Defense High Performance Computing MSRCs
established under the auspices of the DoD High Performance Computing
Modernization Program.

    "The Power 575 supercomputer is specifically designed for the type of
computationally intensive work undertaken by NAVO," said Dave Turek, vice
president of deep computing for IBM. "This system will enhance DoD
research efforts and significantly enhance the ability to perform detailed
oceanographic modeling and weather forecasting that will help keep the
naval fleet and commercial shippers out of harm's way."

    The Power 575 Hydro-Cluster is powered by one of the world's fastest
microprocessors, POWER6, and is cooled by an innovative water system that
makes it highly energy-efficient. The Power 575 is designed to help users
tackle some of the world's most challenging problems in fields such as
energy, aerospace and weather modeling.

    "This new IBM system represents a tremendous increase in the Center's
computational capacity. Many DoD scientists and researchers are looking
forward to having this system available to support their computational
needs," said Tom Dunn, Director, NAVO Major Shared Resource Center.

    About the NAVOCEANO MSRC

&lt;p&gt;  STENNIS SPACE CENTER, MS, Jul 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVO) Major Shared Resource Center (MSRC)
will house a powerful new IBM (NYSE: IBM) supercomputer that will be used
principally to support the oceanographic modeling and analysis needs of
researchers at the Department of Defense.

    The supercomputer, a Power 575 Hydro-Cluster, has a peak speed of 90
teraflops (90 trillion floating-point operations per second), making it
one of the most powerful systems in the Department of Defense. The NAVO
MSRC is one of four Department of Defense High Performance Computing MSRCs
established under the auspices of the DoD High Performance Computing
Modernization Program.

    "The Power 575 supercomputer is specifically designed for the type of
computationally intensive work undertaken by NAVO," said Dave Turek, vice
president of deep computing for IBM. "This system will enhance DoD
research efforts and significantly enhance the ability to perform detailed
oceanographic modeling and weather forecasting that will help keep the
naval fleet and commercial shippers out of harm's way."

    The Power 575 Hydro-Cluster is powered by one of the world's fastest
microprocessors, POWER6, and is cooled by an innovative water system that
makes it highly energy-efficient. The Power 575 is designed to help users
tackle some of the world's most challenging problems in fields such as
energy, aerospace and weather modeling.

    "This new IBM system represents a tremendous increase in the Center's
computational capacity. Many DoD scientists and researchers are looking
forward to having this system available to support their computational
needs," said Tom Dunn, Director, NAVO Major Shared Resource Center.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds comments from Chevron)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PERTH, July 10 (Reuters) - U.S. energy major Chevron Corp
(CVX.N) said it has made a significant gas discovery at its
Iago field off western Australia, which could help expand its
nearby Wheatstone liquefied natural gas (LNG) project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gas discoveries at the Iago-2 well, a previously untested
reservoir, showed a flow rate of 53 million cubic feet a day,
Chevron said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said the Iago-2 well had strong future development
prospects given its relatively shallow water location and close
proximity to Chevron's Wheatstone field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said in March it plans to develop a 5
million-tonnes-a-year LNG export facility to be supplied from
Wheatstone, which has about 4.5 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of
gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We continue to progress a multi-train Wheatstone LNG and
domestic gas development with a view to entering the front-end
engineering and design phase next year for a green field
mainland gas facility," Roy Krzywosinski, Managing Director of
Chevron Australia, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron is also operator of the Gorgon LNG venture in west
Australia, in which Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) and Exxon
Mobil Corp (XOM.N) each have a 25 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 15 million-tonnes-per-year Gorgon project has suffered
repeated delays to an original 2006 approval date due to a
lengthy environmental approval process and cost pressures. But
some analysts have said there was uncertainty as to whether
Chevron and its partners will go ahead with Gorgon, as venture
partners commit to competing LNG projects in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron spokeswoman Nicole Hodgson said the venture
remained committed to developing Gorgon and was making good
progress, including finalising the engineering and design of
the project and a domestic gas proposal.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney is developing a comedy that pokes fun at the world of synchronized swimming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Synchronicity" will center on male synchronized swimmers and follow in the steps -- or strokes -- of sports comedies from the likes of Will Ferrell and Ben Stiller. Disney-based producer Scott Rudin will develop the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fictional sport of male synchronized swimming -- only women can compete in the sport at the Olympics -- has been a popular comedic target dating back to Harry Shearer and Martin Short's well-known "Saturday Night Live" skit in 1984.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Male cheerleaders are taking to the court at Disney, which is developing a dance comedy inspired by the professional squad that performs at every Chicago Bulls home game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project, tentatively titled "The Matadors," will be directed by Anne Fletcher, a one-time Laker Girl who went on to become a choreographer before making her feature filmmaking debut with "Step Up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story will follow two pro basketball superfans whose devotion to their home team led them to form a professional male cheerleading squad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These guys who are the ultimate fans, the biggest deed they can do is dance and cheerlead for their team," Fletcher said. "I wanted to do an all-out comedy, and having the dance elements, that was icing on the cake."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No actors are on board, but she is looking forward to the casting process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's an array of guys, with all sorts of shapes and sizes," Fletcher said. We'll be able to have fun with the casting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The script comes from Mike Bender, a writer on several MTV Movie Awards and on "Not Another Teen Movie," which Fletcher choreographed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

Break," "Split Ends," and "Just Jordan." Lovato became a household name as
she expanded her acting talent on the Disney Channel in "As the Bell
Rings," "Sketchpad," and "Camp Rock." While Lovato has proven herself an
on-screen talent, she also dominates on the concert stage. This

                   FEATURED TALENT ON SATURDAY, JULY 26

    
BIANCA RYAN

    Local rock superstar Bianca Ryan will headline Saturday, July 26.
Thirteen-year-old Ryan has excelled in the entertainment world for most of
her life. Surprisingly, however, she began competing not as the powerhouse
singer she has become, but as an award-winning tap dancer. Confident in
her dance abilities, her father encouraged her to audition for "Star
Search." To his surprise, Bianca took the stage without tap shoes and
belted out Aretha Franklin's "Think" instead. Ryan's newfound talent
earned her a coveted spot on the show. Her next big break came three
years later when she blew away another set of unsuspecting judges -- this
time at her "America's Got Talent" audition. Ryan went on to win the show
in 2006, thus jump-starting her track to stardom.

    Over the past few years, Ryan has worked with some of the most respected
record labels and producers, most notably her five-album contract as the
first American artist with SYCOmusic, run by Simon Cowell as part of
Columbia Records. Cowell, known as one of the toughest critics in the
business, claims "Bianca Ryan is potentially one of the best singers I
have ever heard in my life."

    KEKE PALMER

    Stage and screen star Keke Palmer has distinguished herself in both the
acting and singing arenas. At age nine, Palmer made her on-screen acting
debut as Queen Latifah's niece in "BarberShop 2 - Back In Business." As
she developed her craft, she dazzled in roles in television ("Medicine,"
"Cold Case," "ER," and "Law &amp; Order SVU"), the Emmy-nominated made for TV
movie titled, "The Wool Cap," her own Disney Channel series, "Keke &amp;
Jamal," and two LionsGate family movies -- "Madea's Family Reunion" and
"Akeelah and The Bee."

    For her talent, Palmer has been recognized with an NAACP Image Award
nomination for Best Actress in a Movie Made for Television, as well as a
Screen Actors Guild Nomination in the Best Leading Actress category. Yet
on the Penn's Landing stage, Palmer showcases her other impressive talent
-- her voice. This Atlantic Records recording artist personalizes her
up-tempo R tracks and inspirational love songs with a youthful
exuberance that makes her tunes unforgettable. Her debut album, "So
Uncool," hit stores in September 2007.

    THE CLIQUE GIRLZ

    Fresh off their appearance on the Ben Franklin Parkway on July 4, the
Clique Girls featuring sisters Paris and Destinee Monroe along with best
friend Ariel Moore will head to stage at the Great Plaza at Penn's Landing
for the first day of Fam Jams, Saturday, July 26. The three met at school
five years ago and became inseparable friends, driven by their love of
music and dance.

    The Clique Girlz have been making a name for themselves, since before
going into the studio to record their debut, singing their incredible
version of the "Star Spangled Banner" at a variety of sporting events,
including NASCAR, NBA, MLB, and US Open tennis events. They've also
opened for such groups as Backstreet Boys, The Click Five, Billy Ray
Cyrus, Kirk Franklin and the Jonas Brothers. Their debut album, releasing
on Interscope Records, is richly filled with three-part leads and
harmonies delivered with a modern and contemporary sound that contradicts
their ages. For more information, visit www.cliquegirlz.com

serious physical limitations of blindness and cerebral palsy to sing his
heart out for such audiences as the Philadelphia Eagles, President Bush,
and Governor Rendell. Timmy was born 3 1/2 months premature, weighing
just over 1 pound, blind with cerebral palsy and other problems that
required medical intervention for most of his early life. His parents,
Tim and Eileen, had one goal: To make him independent. He was the first
blind student mainstreamed in the Philadelphia School District. He loved
singing early on and has a strong voice, which, coming from such a slight
body, amazes people everyday.

the next 5 years until the show went off the air.

    Ashlee began her professional acting career at the age of 5, in the
Broadway production of "The Sound of Music." At the age of 8, Ashlee
performed the National Anthem in Atlantic City, NJ for the Miss America
Pageant. In 2004, at the age of 11, she was selected to appear on CBS
"Star Search." Now, at age 14, her stage presence, confidence, and

recently selected as a Radio Disney Incubator Artist (up and coming) and
performs at live events as a soloist at several venues. Ashlee has also
been in the studio with 4 times Number 1 hit Billboard

pint-sized singing sensation who scored her first hit with "Sure Don't
Feel Like Christmas." Tiffany awed a worldwide audience with a live,
power-packed performance on "Fox and Friends" that touched the hearts of

    Pop-sensation DEMI LOVATO, will close this fantastic FREE concert weekend
on Sunday, July 27. After entering the acting world at age six as Angela
on "Barney &amp; Friends," Lovato went on to guest star roles in "Prison
Break," "Split Ends," and "Just Jordan." Lovato became a household name as
she expanded her acting talent on the Disney Channel in "As the Bell
Rings," "Sketchpad," and "Camp Rock." While Lovato has proven herself an
on-screen talent, she also dominates on the concert stage. This
singer/songwriter will tour with last year's Fam Jam favorite, The Jonas
Brothers, in their 2008 summer "Burning Up" Tour.


                   FEATURED TALENT ON SATURDAY, JULY 26

    
BIANCA RYAN

    Local rock superstar Bianca Ryan will headline Saturday, July 26.
Thirteen-year-old Ryan has excelled in the entertainment world for most of
her life. Surprisingly, however, she began competing not as the powerhouse
singer she has become, but as an award-winning tap dancer. Confident in
her dance abilities, her father encouraged her to audition for "Star
Search." To his surprise, Bianca took the stage without tap shoes and
belted out Aretha Franklin's "Think" instead. Ryan's newfound talent
earned her a coveted spot on the show. Her next big break came three
years later when she blew away another set of unsuspecting judges -- this
time at her "America's Got Talent" audition. Ryan went on to win the show
in 2006, thus jump-starting her track to stardom.

    Over the past few years, Ryan has worked with some of the most respected
record labels and producers, most notably her five-album contract as the
first American artist with SYCOmusic, run by Simon Cowell as part of
Columbia Records. Cowell, known as one of the toughest critics in the
business, claims "Bianca Ryan is potentially one of the best singers I
have ever heard in my life."

    KEKE PALMER

    Stage and screen star Keke Palmer has distinguished herself in both the
acting and singing arenas. At age nine, Palmer made her on-screen acting
debut as Queen Latifah's niece in "BarberShop 2 - Back In Business." As
she developed her craft, she dazzled in roles in television ("Medicine,"
"Cold Case," "ER," and "Law &amp; Order SVU"), the Emmy-nominated made for TV
movie titled, "The Wool Cap," her own Disney Channel series, "Keke &amp;
Jamal," and two LionsGate family movies -- "Madea's Family Reunion" and
"Akeelah and The Bee."

    For her talent, Palmer has been recognized with an NAACP Image Award
nomination for Best Actress in a Movie Made for Television, as well as a
Screen Actors Guild Nomination in the Best Leading Actress category. Yet
on the Penn's Landing stage, Palmer showcases her other impressive talent
-- her voice. This Atlantic Records recording artist personalizes her
up-tempo R tracks and inspirational love songs with a youthful
exuberance that makes her tunes unforgettable. Her debut album, "So
Uncool," hit stores in September 2007.

    THE CLIQUE GIRLZ

    Fresh off their appearance on the Ben Franklin Parkway on July 4, the
Clique Girls featuring sisters Paris and Destinee Monroe along with best
friend Ariel Moore will head to stage at the Great Plaza at Penn's Landing
for the first day of Fam Jams, Saturday, July 26. The three met at school
five years ago and became inseparable friends, driven by their love of
music and dance.

    The Clique Girlz have been making a name for themselves, since before
going into the studio to record their debut, singing their incredible
version of the "Star Spangled Banner" at a variety of sporting events,
including NASCAR, NBA, MLB, and US Open tennis events. They've also
opened for such groups as Backstreet Boys, The Click Five, Billy Ray
Cyrus, Kirk Franklin and the Jonas Brothers. Their debut album, releasing
on Interscope Records, is richly filled with three-part leads and
harmonies delivered with a modern and contemporary sound that contradicts
their ages. For more information, visit www.cliquegirlz.com

   Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst Blog:

   Margins at Wipro Under Pressure

   Wipro, Ltd. (NYSE: WIT) reported upside in revenues and earnings
in 4Q08 which was well supported by large deal wins, geographic
expansion, alliances and partnerships. We remain concerned that
margins may continue to be pressured by strength of the rupee in the
near-term.

   However, the company has been able to maintain operating margins
despite salary hikes to onsite employees. It has also provided
improved revenue guidance for 1Q09 and integration of its acquisitions
seems to be well on track. We are revising our adjusted estimates to
reflect 25% revenue growth rate for 2009 in rupee terms and 24% in
dollar terms. We continue to rate WIT a Hold.

   Initiating BOK Financial a Hold

   We are initiating coverage on the shares of BOK Financial Corp.
(Nasdaq:BOKF) with a Hold recommendation. In recent years, the company
has successfully expanded outside its home state of Oklahoma and
broadened its non-interest income base, which represented more than
40% of revenues at year-end 2007.

   Until recently, while credit quality measures had moved off its
pristine levels over the past year, the metrics during 1Q08 could have
been described as being better than its peers. However, considering
the industry overhangs have yet to crest and the company's July 2,
2008 press release, we suspect results could be curtailed over the
next year and a half.

   Suspended '09 Guidance for KMX

   CarMax Inc. (NYSE:KMX) continues to face a difficult used vehicle
environment, largely due to aggressive incentives being offered by new
vehicle manufacturers. The company missed expected earnings in the
first quarter of fiscal 2009 due to a sluggish economy and rising gas
prices. CarMax suspended its guidance for fiscal 2009. In addition,
higher funding costs at CarMax Auto Finance is expected to affect
margins in fiscal 2009.

   However, the company is aggressively cutting prices on trucks and
SUVs to reduce inventory and shifting its focus to passenger cars. The
company's move into new markets and growth in existing markets are
likely to strengthen volumes. Thus, we rate the stock a Hold at a
six-month target price of $12.50.

   Range-Bound Coca-Cola Hellenic

   Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company (NYSE:CCH) enjoys an
attractive geographic mix with 66 percent of revenues being derived
from developing or emerging markets. In addition, the company's
product mix is less dependent on carbonated soft drinks than other
bottlers.

   A key core competency is the company's strong distribution
capabilities with its route-to-market assets. With fragmented trade
channels, Coca-Cola Hellenic's route-to-market systems can drive
increased delivery of the company's full product line and build
relationships with outlet owners.

   Iron Mountain Nearing Plateau

   We are encouraged by Iron Mountain Inc's (NYSE:IRM) continued
momentum throughout 2007 and early 2008, as the company reported its
77th consecutive quarter of increased storage revenues. The company
has a strong balance sheet with $107.4 million in cash and cash
equivalents ended March 31, 2008.

   While we remain encouraged by strength in Iron Mountain's storage
services business, much of the company's growth has been through
acquisitions, which involves integration risk. This becomes more
difficult with the company's growing revenue base as it will be
required to make larger acquisitions.

&lt;p&gt;PERTH, July 11 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firm Chevron Corp
(CVX.N) plans to triple the production capacity of its proposed
Wheatstone liquefied natural gas (LNG) project off western
Australia to 15 million tonnes a year, the firm said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron said expansion plans for the project came after it
found a significant gas extension at its Iago gas field, which
lies adjacent to its Wheatstone gas field in western Australia.
[ID:nSYD178898]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, which is also the operator of the proposed Gorgon
LNG project in the same region, said it was now looking at
combining the resources in the Wheatstone and Iago fields into
a single project with three processing units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We've now got enough gas to support a multi-train
development and we're also looking at the option of bringing in
third-party gas," Chevron's spokeswoman Nicole Hodgson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wheatstone LNG project, which will also supply
Australian markets as well as exports, is expected to enter the
front-end engineering and design (FEED) stage in 2009, she
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The planned expansion will bring the total capacity of
Chevron-operated LNG projects in Australia, Wheatstone and
Gorgon, to 30 million tonnes a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said in March that total gas reserves in Iago and
Wheatstone fields were estimated to be 4.5 trillion cubic feet
(tcf), while the Gorgon gas fields are estimated to be about 40
tcf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Iago field stretches two licence areas, one of which is
100 percent owned by Chevron, while the other is one-third held
by Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Gorgon project is still in the front-end engineering
and design (FEED) phase, which is expected to complete in the
second half of 2009.

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo! Suggests Microsoft Make A Proposal To Acquire Whole Company
SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq:YHOO), a leading global Internet company,
confirmed today that it has rejected a joint proposal from Microsoft
Corporation and Carl Icahn for a complex restructuring of Yahoo! that
would include the acquisition of Yahoo!'s search business by
Microsoft.

   The proposal was made on Friday evening and Yahoo! was given less
than 24 hours to accept the proposal, the fundamental terms of which
Microsoft and Mr. Icahn made clear they were unwilling to negotiate.
After reviewing the proposal with its legal and financial advisers,
Yahoo!'s Board of Directors determined that accepting the proposal is
not in the best interests of its stockholders.

   The Board's rejection of the proposal was based on a number of
factors, including the following:

   1. Yahoo!'s existing business plus its recently signed commercial
agreement with Google has superior financial value and less complexity
and risk than the Microsoft/Icahn proposal.

   2. The Microsoft/Icahn proposal would preclude a potential sale of
all of Yahoo! for a full and fair price, including a control premium.

   3. The major component of the overall value per share asserted by
Microsoft/Icahn would be in Yahoo!'s remaining non-search businesses
which would be overseen by Mr. Icahn's slate of directors, which has
virtually no working knowledge of Yahoo!'s businesses.

   4. The Microsoft/Icahn proposal would require the immediate
replacement of the current Board and removal of the top management
team at Yahoo!. The Yahoo! Board believes these moves would
destabilize Yahoo! for the up to the one year it would take to gain
regulatory approval for this deal.

   Roy Bostock, Chairman of Yahoo! said, "This odd and opportunistic
alliance of Microsoft and Carl Icahn has anything but the interests of
Yahoo!'s stockholders in mind. Clearly, Microsoft, having failed to
advance in search, is aligning with the short-term objectives of Mr.
Icahn to coerce Yahoo! into selling its core strategic search assets
on terms that are highly advantageous to Microsoft, but
disadvantageous to Yahoo! stockholders. Yahoo's Board of Directors
will not allow that to happen. Yahoo!'s Board remains open to any
transaction that delivers full value to our stockholders - we just do
not believe such a transaction should be dictated by Microsoft and a
single short-term investor."

   Mr. Bostock continued, "After negotiating among themselves without
the involvement of Yahoo!, Carl Icahn and Microsoft presented us with
a 'take it or leave it' proposal under which we would be required to
restructure the Company, hand over to Microsoft Yahoo!'s valuable
search business and to Carl Icahn the rest of the Company, giving us
less than 24 hours to respond. It is ludicrous to think that our Board
could accept such a proposal. While this type of erratic and
unpredictable behavior is consistent with what we have come to expect
from Microsoft, we will not be bludgeoned into a transaction that is
not in the best interests of our stockholders."

   Mr. Bostock also noted that Microsoft's position that it would not
deal with, or otherwise engage with, Yahoo!'s management to reach
agreement on this proposal or to implement it, is completely absurd
and irresponsible given the complexity of the deal - one that requires
the removal of half of Yahoo!'s business from Yahoo! and then the
integration of it into Microsoft.

   Yahoo!'s Board points out that a transaction to acquire the whole
company would be much more straightforward and involve far less risk
than the new proposal or any similar alternative. The Board believes a
whole company transaction could be negotiated and executed prior to
August 1st. In rejecting the Microsoft/Icahn proposal, Yahoo! not only
repeated its offer to sell the entire Company to Microsoft for at
least $33 per share, but also offered to negotiate an improved search
only transaction. Microsoft rejected both offers.

   Ironically, Carl Icahn, who jointly with Microsoft developed and
presented this proposal, had previously urged Yahoo! not to sell its
search business to Microsoft. Specifically, in an interview on CNBC's
Fast Money program, on June 4, 2008, Mr. Icahn said, "... it's crazy
for this company now to do this alternative deal and give the store
away, because obviously, an alternative deal is a poison pill because
once you've done an alternative deal and given the search to
Microsoft, you don't need Microsoft to buy you anymore. So, that would
be a poison pill...."

   Significantly, the Board believes Microsoft and Mr. Icahn are
overstating the value their search and restructuring proposal would
deliver to Yahoo! stockholders and are substantially understating the
risks. Yahoo! noted that a transaction that would separate the
Company's search and display businesses is an undertaking of great
complexity. While the Board acknowledges that the current proposal
contains a number of improvements over Microsoft's earlier proposal,
the Yahoo! Board's conclusion that the current proposal is not in the
best interests of stockholders is based on a number of factors,
including:

   --  The revenue guarantees suggested, which are conditional and
        subject to reduction, are well below the search revenue that
        the Company is expected to generate on its own and in
        association with its announced commercial agreement with
        Google. That agreement alone is estimated to generate $250 to
        $450 million of incremental cash flow for the first twelve
        months following implementation, while allowing Yahoo! to
        remain a principal in paid search;

   --  The success of the remaining Company is critically dependent
        on Microsoft's ability to effectively monetize search;

   --  Microsoft/Icahn's proposed Traffic Acquisition Costs rates are
        below market;

   --  The proposal calls for Yahoo! to sell its industry-leading
        algorithmic search business and its related strategic and
        valuable intellectual property portfolio for no incremental
        consideration; and

   --  Many of the components of the headline value that Mr. Icahn
        and Microsoft put forward, such as the spin-off of the
        Yahoo!'s Asian assets and the return of cash to stockholders,
        are steps that could be taken by Yahoo! on its own and the
        Board continues to evaluate these options.

   Mr. Bostock concluded, "Microsoft and Mr. Icahn are trying to
dismantle the Company and deliver our search business to Microsoft on
terms that would be disadvantageous to Yahoo! stockholders. We are
prepared to let our stockholders, not Microsoft and Carl Icahn, decide
what is in their best interests and we look forward to the upcoming
vote."

&lt;p&gt; (Adds additional details; byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Anupreeta Das&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, July 13 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
and billionaire investor Carl Icahn's joint proposal for Yahoo
Inc (YHOO.O), which was rejected on Saturday, included improved
revenue guarantees from search advertising, people familiar
with the matter said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In joining forces with Icahn, Microsoft sweetened the terms
of a proposal to control Yahoo's search business after
withdrawing its offer in May to buy the whole company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The improved terms included $2.3 billion in guaranteed
annual revenue from search advertising for five years, with the
option to extend the deal for another five, according to the
sources, who asked not to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal would also have carried a minimum annual payment
of $1.6 billion for the subsequent five years, The Wall Street
Journal reported on Sunday, citing sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Previously, Microsoft had sought an exclusive, 10-year
search ad agreement with Yahoo and had offered guarantees for
only three years, a source told Reuters in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It remains unclear whether Microsoft had previously put a
revenue guarantee amount on the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Saturday Yahoo rejected the joint proposal, which would
have given Microsoft its search business and left Icahn, who
owns nearly 5 percent of Yahoo, in charge of the remaining
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As part of its revised proposal, Microsoft also reiterated
its suggestion that Yahoo sell its Asian assets, but Yahoo's
board and advisers felt this was something the company could do
independently, one source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft also proposed making an equity investment of $3.9
billion and a preferred debt investment of $2.8 billion, The
New York Times reported on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a statement on Saturday, Yahoo said the Microsoft-Icahn
proposal carried more complexity and risk than a search ad
partnership it signed last month with Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After withdrawing its $47.5 billion full buyout offer,
Microsoft said in June it had offered Yahoo $9 billion in cash
for a partial deal, as well as revenue guarantees on search
advertising that would have brought Yahoo $1 billion a year in
operating income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Such an exclusive deal would have effectively outsourced to
Microsoft all the advertising that Yahoo runs alongside its
search results using its in-house Panama ad system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo instead chose to sign a non-exclusive search ad deal
with Google, which promises $800 million a year in revenue for
Yahoo and leaves it free to seek similar search advertising
partnerships with other companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft and Yahoo officials declined comment. Icahn did
not return a call seeking comment.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) on Saturday 
rejected a proposal to sell its search business to Microsoft 
Corp (MSFT.O) and hand over the remainder of the company to 
activist investor Carl Icahn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Yahoo said in a statement it received the joint proposal 
from Microsoft and Icahn on Friday evening and was given less 
than 24 hours to accept. It said Microsoft and Icahn made clear 
they were unwilling to negotiate the fundamental terms, which 
include the immediate replacement of Yahoo's board and removal

Yahoo into selling its core strategic search assets on terms 
that are highly advantageous to Microsoft, but disadvantageous 
to Yahoo stockholders," Bostock said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move comes a few weeks before Yahoo's annual meeting on 
August 1, when Icahn is seeking to oust Chief Executive Jerry 
Yang and replace the nine-member board with his own slate of 
directors. Icahn owns nearly 5 percent of Yahoo shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, which has been embroiled in on-again, off-again 
deal talks with Yahoo for six months, has said it no longer 
wants to negotiate with Yang's team, but that it is willing to 
resume talks if a new management is in place on August 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo did not detail the financial returns of the new 
proposal from Microsoft and Icahn, saying only that it was an 
improvement over an offer the software maker made in June but 
still carried less financial value and more risk than Yahoo's 
current search advertising deal with Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo had signed the deal with Google in June and said it 
was expected to generate $250 million to $450 million of 
incremental cash flow for the first 12 months after 
implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The AllthingsD blog quoted sources as saying the new 
Microsoft offer included a $20 billion advertising search 
revenue guarantee over 10 years, as well as other "small 
improvements" on the previous proposal."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; YAHOO OFFERS TO SELL FOR $33/SHR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A deal to separate Yahoo's search and display businesses 
was an undertaking of great complexity, the company said, and 
could take up to one year to obtain regulatory approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would be much more straightforward and less risky to 
sell all of Yahoo to Microsoft, and such a deal could be 
negotiated and executed before August 1, Yahoo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it added that Microsoft had again rejected its repeated 
offer to sell Yahoo for at least $33 per share. Yahoo, whose 
shares are trading at around $23.50, said Microsoft also 
refused to negotiate an improved search-only transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said the revenue guarantees suggested by 
Microsoft were conditional and subject to reduction, and were 
"well below" the search revenue that Yahoo was expected to 
generate on its own and with Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also said other components of the proposal that Icahn 
and Microsoft put forward, such as spinning off Yahoo's Asian 
assets, could be undertaken by Yahoo on its own and that its 
board continued to evaluate these measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo said it was ironic that Icahn, who had previously 
urged the company not to sell its search business to Microsoft, 
was now supporting a proposal to do exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But sources familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier 
that Icahn would support a partial deal with Microsoft if it 
guaranteed revenue of at least $2.5 billion a year to Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bostock called it "completely absurd and irresponsible" of 
Microsoft not to engage with Yahoo's management as it would be 
a very complex thing to do to hive off half the company's 
business and integrate it into the software maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While this type of erratic and unpredictable behavior is

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and billionaire investor Carl Icahn's joint proposal for Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) includes $2.3 billion in guaranteed annual revenue from search advertising for five years, with the option to extend the deal for another five, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo on Saturday rejected the proposal that would have led to Microsoft's buying its search business and left Icahn, who owns nearly 5 percent of Yahoo, in charge of the remaining company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One source familiar with the joint proposal said it was very similar to Microsoft's previous proposal to buy Yahoo's search business, but contained the improved revenue guarantee terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anupreeta Das and Daisuke Wakabayashi, editing by Martin Golan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - A portfolio manager at Legg Mason Capital Management said on Sunday he found the latest proposal for Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) from activist investor Carl Icahn and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to be "unappealing."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legg Mason (LM.N) is the second-largest institutional shareholder of Yahoo, with a 5.23 percent stake as of March 31, according to a regulatory filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our position is we prefer that Microsoft reenter negotiations to buy the entire company. $33 (per share) would be an attractive price," said Robert Hagstrom, whose Legg Mason Growth Trust counts Yahoo as its top holding as of end-March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have made no decision on Icahn because we have no information about how he would run the company if Microsoft does not buy Yahoo. Furthermore, the latest developments to sell Yahoo search to Microsoft is unappealing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo said on Saturday it had rejected a joint proposal from Icahn and Microsoft that would involve selling Yahoo's search business to the software maker, and handing control of the remainder of the company to Icahn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Murali Anantharaman, writing by Tiffany Wu, editing by Martin Golan)&lt;/p&gt;

Aug. 1, when Icahn is seeking to oust Chief Executive Jerry

wants to negotiate with Yang's team, but that it is willing to
resume talks if a new management is in place on Aug. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo did not detail the financial returns of the new
proposal from Microsoft and Icahn, saying only that it was an
improvement over an offer the software maker made in June but
still carried less financial value and more risk than Yahoo's
current search advertising deal with Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo had signed the deal with Google in June and said it
was expected to generate $250 million to $450 million of
incremental cash flow for the first 12 months after
implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The AllthingsD blog quoted sources as saying the new

improvements" on the previous proposal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; YAHOO OFFERS TO SELL FOR $33/SHR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A deal to separate Yahoo's search and display businesses

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The following is Yahoo Inc's statement rejecting a joint proposal from Microsoft Corp and billionaire investor Carl Icahn:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo! Inc., a leading global Internet company, confirmed today that it has rejected a joint proposal from Microsoft Corporation and Carl Icahn for a complex restructuring of Yahoo! that would include the acquisition of Yahoo!'s search business by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal was made on Friday evening and Yahoo! was given less than 24 hours to accept the proposal, the fundamental terms of which Microsoft and Mr.Icahn made clear they were unwilling to negotiate. After reviewing the proposal with its legal and financial advisers, Yahoo!'s Board of Directors determined that accepting the proposal is not in the best interests of its stockholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Board's rejection of the proposal was based on a number of factors, including the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Yahoo!'s existing business plus its recently signed commercial agreement with Google has superior financial value and less complexity and risk than the Microsoft/Icahn proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. The Microsoft/Icahn proposal would preclude a potential sale of all of Yahoo! for a full and fair price, including a control premium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. The major component of the overall value per share asserted by Microsoft/Icahn would be in Yahoo!'s remaining non-search businesses which would be overseen by Mr. Icahn's slate of directors, which has virtually no working knowledge of Yahoo!'s businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. The Microsoft/Icahn proposal would require the immediate replacement of the current Board and removal of the top management team at Yahoo!. The Yahoo! Board believes these moves would destabilize Yahoo! for the up to the one year it would take to gain regulatory approval for this deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roy Bostock, Chairman of Yahoo! said, "This odd and opportunistic alliance of Microsoft and Carl Icahn has anything but the interests of Yahoo!'s stockholders in mind. Clearly, Microsoft, having failed to advance in search, is aligning with the short-term objectives of Mr. Icahn to coerce Yahoo! into selling its core strategic search assets on terms that are highly advantageous to Microsoft, but disadvantageous to Yahoo! stockholders. Yahoo's Board of Directors will not allow that to happen. Yahoo!'s Board remains open to any transaction that delivers full value to our stockholders - we just do not believe such a transaction should be dictated by Microsoft and a single short-term investor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Bostock continued, "After negotiating among themselves without the involvement of Yahoo!, Carl Icahn and Microsoft presented us with a 'take it or leave it' proposal under which we would be required to restructure the Company, hand over to Microsoft Yahoo!'s valuable search business and to Carl Icahn the rest of the Company, giving us less than 24 hours to respond. It is ludicrous to think that our Board could accept such a proposal. While this type of erratic and unpredictable behavior is consistent with what we have come to expect from Microsoft, we will not be bludgeoned into a transaction that is not in the best interests of our stockholders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Bostock also noted that Microsoft's position that it would not deal with, or otherwise engage with, Yahoo!'s management to reach agreement on this proposal or to implement it, is completely absurd and irresponsible given the complexity of the deal - one that requires the removal of half of Yahoo!'s business from Yahoo! and then the integration of it into Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo!'s Board points out that a transaction to acquire the whole company would be much more straightforward and involve far less risk than the new proposal or any similar alternative. The Board believes a whole company transaction could be negotiated and executed prior to August 1st. In rejecting the Microsoft/Icahn proposal, Yahoo! not only repeated its offer to sell the entire Company to Microsoft for at least $33 per share, but also offered to negotiate an improved search only transaction. Microsoft rejected both offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, Carl Icahn, who jointly with Microsoft developed and presented this proposal, had previously urged Yahoo! not to sell its search business to Microsoft. Specifically, in an interview on CNBC's Fast Money program, on June 4, 2008, Mr. Icahn said, "... it's crazy for this company now to do this alternative deal and give the store away, because obviously, an alternative deal is a poison pill because once you've done an alternative deal and given the search to Microsoft, you don't need Microsoft to buy you anymore. So, that would be a poison pill...."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significantly, the Board believes Microsoft and Mr. Icahn are overstating the value their search and restructuring proposal would deliver to Yahoo! stockholders and are substantially understating the risks. Yahoo! noted that a transaction that would separate the Company's search and display businesses is an undertaking of great complexity. While the Board acknowledges that the current proposal contains a number of improvements over Microsoft's earlier proposal, the Yahoo! Board's conclusion that the current proposal is not in the best interests of stockholders is based on a number of factors, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- The revenue guarantees suggested, which are conditional and subject to reduction, are well below the search revenue that the Company is expected to generate on its own and in association with its announced commercial agreement with Google. That agreement alone is estimated to generate $250 to $450 million of incremental cash flow for the first twelve months following implementation, while allowing Yahoo! to remain a principal in paid search;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- The success of the remaining Company is critically dependent on Microsoft's ability to effectively monetize search;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- Microsoft/Icahn's proposed Traffic Acquisition Costs rates are below market;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- The proposal calls for Yahoo! to sell its industry-leading algorithmic search business and its related strategic and valuable intellectual property portfolio for no incremental consideration; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- Many of the components of the headline value that Mr. Icahn and Microsoft put forward, such as the spin-off of the Yahoo!'s Asian assets and the return of cash to stockholders, are steps that could be taken by Yahoo! on its own and the Board continues to evaluate these options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Bostock concluded, "Microsoft and Mr. Icahn are trying to dismantle the Company and deliver our search business to Microsoft on terms that would be disadvantageous to Yahoo! stockholders. We are prepared to let our stockholders, not Microsoft and Carl Icahn, decide what is in their best interests and we look forward to the upcoming vote."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) and 
Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) traded new accusations on Monday over 
the latest breakdown in deal talks, as the battle for control 
of Yahoo heated up ahead of an August 1 showdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Activist investor Carl Icahn, leading a proxy campaign to 
dump Yahoo's current management and board at the August 
shareholder meeting, blasted Yahoo for rejecting a joint 
proposal he made with Microsoft that he said contained enhanced 
protections to Yahoo and its investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All three parties were involved in talks on Friday on a new 
Microsoft offer to buy Yahoo's search business and take a 14 
percent stake in the Web pioneer if it agreed to shed its Asian 
assets and focus on its remaining businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During the negotiations, according to Icahn, Microsoft 
Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said Yahoo's concerns over who 
would control the company were a distraction from the deal at 
hand. "'First, tell us if you like the deal,"' Icahn quoted 
Ballmer as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft and Mr. Icahn are trying to dismantle the 
company and deliver our search business to Microsoft on terms 
that would be disadvantageous to Yahoo stockholders," Yahoo 
Chairman Roy Bostock said of the latest Microsoft offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo turned down that offer Saturday night, complaining 
that it had only 24 hours to consider a deal it called 
financially inferior and more risky than its current business 
prospects and a search ad partnership with rival Google Inc 
(GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo also said it was now open to a full-scale merger with 
Microsoft if it offered at least $33 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo shares closed down $1, or 4.2 percent, to close at 
$22.57, while Microsoft shares fell 10 cents, or 0.4 percent, 
to close at $25.15, both on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sandeep Aggarwal, an Internet sector analyst with brokerage 
Collins Stewart, said investors are discounting the prospect of 
a full-scale Microsoft merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What is becoming increasingly clear is that Microsoft's 
heart is set on Yahoo search," Aggarwal said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ULTIMATUM?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For its part, Microsoft said it made the new offer in 
response to a request for a new proposal from Bostock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft denied it set a 24-hour ultimatum, saying it was 
seeking only a commitment by Yahoo to accept the framework and 
agree to a timeline to move to intensive talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn said Microsoft's new offer provided assurances to 
Yahoo of $2.3 billion in annual search revenue for up to 10 
years, assuming Yahoo's audience remains intact and the parties 
agree to renew. Yahoo said the offer, with all of its 
conditions, would leave it at the mercy of Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn said Microsoft's offer valued Yahoo at $33 per share, 
which included a proposal for Microsoft to tender $3.9 billion 
for 14 percent of Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The offer assumed Yahoo could realize $9 a share on its 
Asian assets, Microsoft would provide debt financing worth $2 a 
share, leaving around $16.73 for the remainder of Yahoo, Icahn 
said in a U.S. financial regulatory filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The latest proposal follows six months of on-again, 
off-again talks that started when Microsoft made an unsolicited 
$31-per-share cash-and-stock offer to buy Yahoo in late 
January. Microsoft then raised its offer to $33 per share, or 
$47.5 billion, before pulling that bid in May when Yahoo's 
leaders said they would not settle for less than $37 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn mocked Yahoo's current willingness to accept a 
Microsoft buyout of around $33 a share, after rejecting the 
same a few months back: "It is hard to understand why it 
(Yahoo) turned down $33 and is now willing to accept it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Within the past month, Yahoo's bargaining power has come 
down dramatically," Aggarwal said. "Clearly, from Yahoo's 
perspective, they were working on a certain set of wrong 
assumptions about Microsoft's willingness to buy it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Jeffrey Lindsay disagreed, 
saying the latest push by Microsoft and Icahn to reach a deal 
with Yahoo appeared to have been a long-shot attempt to reach a 
last-minute deal or, more likely, a way of gaining ammunition 
in its August 1 proxy vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lindsay said Icahn and Microsoft may have overplayed their 
hand by giving Yahoo the chance to look reasonable by saying it 
was willing to sell the company for as little as $33.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While acting in concert with Microsoft, Icahn has failed to 
answer questions about whether he will have any serious 
negotiating power with Microsoft if he succeeds in removing 
Yahoo's board and Yang as CEO, the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "For investors to get behind Icahn they have to be 
convinced that he has a credible alternative," Lindsay said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn, who controls about 5 percent of Yahoo shares, has 
nominated a slate of nine directors to replace Yahoo's board 
and oust CEO Jerry Yang on August 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yang would remain at the company as "Chief Yahoo," 
according to Icahn, who also said he was open to discussing 
keeping a number of the current board members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yang co-founded the pioneering Web company in 1994 and held 
the irreverent executive-without-portfolio title until becoming 
CEO in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc and Microsoft Corp traded new accusations on Monday over the latest breakdown in deal talks, as the battle for control of Yahoo heated up ahead of an August 1 showdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activist investor Carl Icahn, leading a proxy campaign to dump Yahoo's current management and board at the August shareholder meeting, blasted Yahoo for rejecting a joint proposal he made with Microsoft that he said contained enhanced protections to Yahoo and its investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three parties were involved in talks on Friday on a new Microsoft offer to buy Yahoo's search business and take a 14 percent stake in the Web pioneer if it agreed to shed its Asian assets and focus on its remaining businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the negotiations, according to Icahn, Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said Yahoo's concerns over who would control the company were a distraction from the deal at hand. "'First, tell us if you like the deal,'" Icahn quoted Ballmer as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft and Mr. Icahn are trying to dismantle the company and deliver our search business to Microsoft on terms that would be disadvantageous to Yahoo stockholders," Yahoo Chairman Roy Bostock said of the latest Microsoft offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo turned down that offer Saturday night, complaining that it had only 24 hours to consider a deal it called financially inferior and more risky than its current business prospects and a search ad partnership with rival Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo also said it was now open to a full-scale merger with Microsoft if it offered at least $33 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo shares closed down $1, or 4.2 percent, to close at $22.57, while Microsoft shares fell 10 cents, or 0.4 percent, to close at $25.15, both on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandeep Aggarwal, an Internet sector analyst with brokerage Collins Stewart, said investors are discounting the prospect of a full-scale Microsoft merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What is becoming increasingly clear is that Microsoft's heart is set on Yahoo search," Aggarwal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ULTIMATUM?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its part, Microsoft said it made the new offer in response to a request for a new proposal from Bostock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft denied it set a 24-hour ultimatum, saying it was seeking only a commitment by Yahoo to accept the framework and agree to a timeline to move to intensive talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn said Microsoft's new offer provided assurances to Yahoo of $2.3 billion in annual search revenue for up to 10 years, assuming Yahoo's audience remains intact and the parties agree to renew. Yahoo said the offer, with all of its conditions, would leave it at the mercy of Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn said Microsoft's offer valued Yahoo at $33 per share, which included a proposal for Microsoft to tender $3.9 billion for 14 percent of Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The offer assumed Yahoo could realize $9 a share on its Asian assets, Microsoft would provide debt financing worth $2 a share, leaving around $16.73 for the remainder of Yahoo, Icahn said in a U.S. financial regulatory filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest proposal follows six months of on-again, off-again talks that started when Microsoft made an unsolicited $31-per-share cash-and-stock offer to buy Yahoo in late January.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, July 14 (Reuters) - Google (GOOG.O) and
Microsoft (MSFT.O) will spar on Tuesday at a congressional
hearing called to examine whether Google's revenue-sharing deal
with No. 2 search rival Yahoo (YHOO.O) will harm competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Google, with more than 60 percent of the Web search market,
and Yahoo, with 16.6 percent, announced a deal on June 12 that
would allow Yahoo to place Google advertisements on its site
and collect the revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal, which the firms have said would garner Yahoo at
least $250 million in the first year, was widely seen as an
effort by Yahoo to fend off Microsoft's on-again, off-again
efforts to buy all or part of Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's most recent offer to acquire Yahoo's search
business was rejected Saturday evening by Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google chief legal officer David Drummond, defending his
company's deal with Yahoo in written testimony for Tuesday's
hearing, took a shot at Microsoft's 90 percent share of the
personal computer operating system market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Dominance of the desktop can let one company favor its own
products and services and obstruct the interoperability of
competing products or services, overriding the desires of
consumers," said Drummond in testimony prepared for the Senate
Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith hit back, saying
Google's deal would reduce Yahoo's incentive to compete against
Google, would push Yahoo's search advertising platform into a
downward spiral and establish an illegal price floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When it comes to the issues before this subcommittee,
Google should not be allowed to achieve an outcome through an
agreement that it would not be permitted to achieve otherwise,"
said Smith in his written testimony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The revenue-sharing deal has not been implemented by Google
and Yahoo while they wait for an opinion from the Justice
Department's Antitrust Division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Several state attorney generals have expressed concern
about the arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft believes the Google/Yahoo deal harms competition
in several critical ways. Advertisers and online content
providers would be harmed through price coordination that will
establish higher prices and limit choice," said Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Consumers would be put at risk as Google expands its
ability to collect the personal information of users passing
through its search gateway. On an even more fundamental level,
Google's monopoly power would increase its ability to shape
what people get to see and experience online."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee will
hold a similar hearing later on Tuesday.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds byline, more details, analyst comment)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Daisuke Wakabayashi and Kemp Powers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, July 14 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
said on Monday its Xbox 360 console will sell better than Sony
Corp's (6758.T)(SNE.N) rival PlayStation 3 over the lifetime of
the machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft also displayed a line-up of games to drive demand
for the console, including "Gears of War 2," a much-anticipated
sequel to its blockbuster science-fiction shooter game. It will
debut exclusively for the Xbox 360 on Nov. 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company is locked in a three-way competition with
Nintendo Co Ltd's 7974.OS Wii and the PlayStation 3, which
comes with a high-definition Blu-ray video player. The Wii is
the current leader, while Sony's PS2 was the winner of the last
generation of consoles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Xbox 360 will sell more consoles worldwide this generation
than PlayStation 3," Don Mattrick, a senior vice president at
Microsoft's Xbox division, said at a Microsoft news conference
before the start of the E3 video game industry trade show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said on Sunday it will cut the price of its
best-selling Xbox 360 Pro with a 20-gigabyte hard drive to $299
from $349 while supplies last. In early August, it will
introduce a new model with a 60-gigabyte hard drive for $349.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A cut to $299 makes the Xbox 360 Pro $100 less than one of
the console's major rivals, Sony's PlayStation 3 with a
40-gigabyte hard drive. Microsoft said the Xbox 360 has outsold
the PS3 in the United States by 5 million units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft introduced the Xbox 360 in November 2005, a year
before Sony released the PS3 and Nintendo rolled out the Wii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a sign that the company is positioning the Xbox 360 as an
entertainment hub instead of just a game machine, Microsoft said
it signed a deal to make TV shows and movies from NBC Universal
available on its Xbox Live online platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft also announced a tie-up with Netflix Inc (NFLX.O)
to let subscribers of the movie rental company watch streamed
films and TV shows on Xbox 360 game consoles starting this
fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Xbox 360 does not come with a high-definition video
player like the PS3 but the company expects digital download of
video to eventually overtake demand for packaged movies and TV
shows. Currently, Xbox Live offers some high-definition movies
but the Netflix service does not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said a third of all paid content downloaded in the
United States is movies and television shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MII TOO?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the major announcements at the press conference was a
planned fall overhaul of the Xbox 360 console interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new suite of features will include a community games
channel to showcase user-created titles and the addition of
personalized avatars reminiscent of those on Nintendo's Wii
console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The avatars on the Xbox 360 will have a deeper level of
customization than Nintendo's "Miis," and users will be able to
select from a wide variety of clothes, accessories and
hairstyles, Microsoft said during the press conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft also unveiled a number of casual and family games
hoping to capitalize on the popularity of the Wii such as
"Lips," a karaoke-style music game that employs a
motion-sensitive wireless microphone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I really do think it's going to help them close the gap
against Nintendo and help shore up its online business against
Sony," said analyst Billy Pidgeon of IDC. "It was a lot more
than I had expected from Microsoft. It was doing well with
casual games on Live, but this will definitely help it get more
users per household."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A major U.S. government plan to shore up mortgage finance firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will not revive the ailing U.S. housing market yet, wrote Goldman Sachs economists in a research note dated Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Ultimately, we do not view these measures, dramatic as they look, as either a turning point for the U.S. housing market or as a sign that the downturn will be much worse than previously believed," Goldman Sachs analysts including economist Jan Hatzius wrote in the note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve plan, announced on Sunday, called for sweeping measures to lend money and buy equity if necessary in the government-sponsored enterprises, which own or guarantee $5 trillion in debt -- close to half the value of all U.S. mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measures by the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve to underpin the mortgage giants "simply reaffirm our long-held -- and widely shared -- view that the government will do everything it can to avert a meltdown in the conforming mortgage market and will continue to stand behind the government-sponsored enterprises," Goldman wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congressional approval for the plan "is highly likely", the analysts wrote, because U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson has said he has consulted with Congressional leaders of both parties and because of "the political peril of standing in the way of measures to support the flagging housing market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by John Parry; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said
on Monday it awarded contracts for work needed to start its
drilling program at the Point Thomson oil field in Alaska,
despite attempts by the state to take away the company's leases
for the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Alaska is fighting a legal battle to take the properties
from Exxon and its partners, claiming they violated the terms
of the leases by not developing the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Point Thomson is estimated to hold hundreds of millions of
barrels of oil and 8 trillion to 9 trillion cubic feet of
natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon said it gave contracts to Nanuq Inc and Alaska
Frontier Constructors to build and maintain ice roads and an
ice air strip needed to transport the drilling rig, personnel
and materials to the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Point Thomson working interest owners are proceeding
with the drilling plan and the project while we seek to resolve
the dispute with the State over the Point Thomson Unit," Craig
Haymes, Alaska production manager for Exxon Mobil, said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are hopeful that we will resolve the differences to our
mutual satisfaction. Even if we cannot do so quickly, we intend
to carry out the drilling program as leaseholders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon and its partners -- BP Plc (BP.L), Chevron Corp
(CVX.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) -- have not drilled on the
Point Thomson leases since 1982, but maintain they have met
commitments and have turned to the Alaska court system to fight
for their leases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company previously said it planned to start the
development program at Point Thomson this winter.

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Awards Contracts to Alaskan Companies for Work to Put Point Thomson Field on Production

ANCHORAGE, Alaska--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Production Company today announced it has awarded
contracts for work in support of the first well of a multi-well
drilling program at Point Thomson. The work is part of the plan
submitted to the Department of Natural Resources earlier this year to
develop the Point Thomson Unit. ExxonMobil is operator of the unit.

   A contract to Nanuq, Inc, together with Alaska Frontier
Constructors, Inc. (Nanuq/AFC), both of Anchorage, Alaska, is for
construction and maintenance of nearly 50 miles of ice roads and an
ice air strip needed to transport the drilling rig and associated
materials, camps and personnel to the Point Thomson site.

   Barges to move the construction equipment to the Point Thomson
site have been contracted. Additional contracts are planned for other
key project activities.

   The construction activity advances the development of the Point
Thomson hydrocarbon resource for the mutual benefit of Alaskans and
the 27 Point Thomson Unit working interest owners.

   Craig Haymes, Alaska production manager for ExxonMobil, said, "The
Point Thomson working interest owners are proceeding with the drilling
plan and the project while we seek to resolve the dispute with the
State over the Point Thomson Unit. We are hopeful that we will resolve
the differences to our mutual satisfaction. Even if we cannot do so
quickly, we intend to carry out the drilling program as leaseholders.
We have already hired Alaskans, commenced upgrades on a drill rig and
ordered long-lead materials in preparation to commence drilling this
winter. The plan will provide jobs for over 200 people this winter."

   Point Thomson is remotely located 60 miles east of Prudhoe Bay.
Use of ice roads is a well established Arctic practice that enables
the transportation of heavy equipment and materials for development
operations while protecting the North Slope environment.

   The project includes an investment of approximately $1.3 billion,
including a multi-year development and delineation drilling program
that will commence in the 2008-09 winter season, to construct
production facilities, pipelines, and support infrastructure.

   Under the initial phase, approximately 200 million cubic feet per
day of Point Thomson gas is expected to be produced. Approximately
10,000 barrels per day of liquid condensate that is separated from the
gas is planned to be delivered for sale through new and existing oil
pipelines. The remaining gas will be injected back into the Thomson
Sand reservoir to maintain pressure for continued hydrocarbon recovery
and for subsequent gas sales.

   In addition to ExxonMobil, the other major Point Thomson Unit
owners include BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc., Chevron U.S.A. Inc. and
ConocoPhillips Alaska Inc. In addition, there are 23 other Point
Thomson owners.

   ExxonMobil announced the plan to put Point Thomson field on
production in February.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Monday its Xbox 360 console will sell better than Sony Corp's (6758.T)(SNE.N) rival PlayStation 3 over the lifetime of the machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also displayed a line-up of games to drive demand for the console, including "Gears of War 2," a much-anticipated sequel to its blockbuster science-fiction shooter game. It will debut exclusively for the Xbox 360 on November 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is locked in a three-way competition with Nintendo Co Ltd's 7974.OS Wii and the PlayStation 3, which comes with a high-definition Blu-ray video player. The Wii is the current leader, while Sony's PS2 was the winner of the last generation of consoles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Xbox 360 will sell more consoles worldwide this generation than PlayStation 3," Don Mattrick, a senior vice president at Microsoft's Xbox division, said at a Microsoft news conference before the start of the E3 video game industry trade show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said Sunday it will cut the price of its best-selling Xbox 360 Pro with a 20-gigabyte hard drive to $299 from $349 while supplies last. In early August, it will introduce a new model with a 60-gigabyte hard drive for $349.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cut to $299 makes the Xbox 360 Pro $100 less than one of the console's major rivals, Sony's PlayStation 3 with a 40-gigabyte hard drive. Microsoft said the Xbox 360 has outsold the PS3 in the United States by 5 million units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it signed a deal to make TV shows and movies from NBC Universal available on its Xbox Live online platform. The company said a third of all paid content downloaded in the U.S. is movies and television shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also announced a tie-up with movie rental company Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) to let Netflix subscribers watch streamed movies and TV shows on Xbox 360 game consoles starting this fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi and Kemp Powers; editing by John Wallace/Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A long-rumored tie-up between online movie rental company Netflix Inc and Microsoft Corp to let Netflix subscribers watch streamed movies and TV shows on Xbox 360 game consoles will become a reality this fall, the companies said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service, expected to launch as a software upgrade for the Xbox 360, will be offered at no additional cost to Netflix subscribers who also hold Xbox 360 Live Gold memberships, the companies said at the E3 Media and Business Summit in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XBox users will be able to access more than 10,000 Netflix titles now available as part of a feature called "Watch Instantly" that Netflix launched in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Netflix announced two other partnerships with set top box makers -- Roku and LG Electronics Inc -- in its quest to bring streamed content from its Web-based catalog to the television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $100 Netflix Player by Roku sold out its first shipment within weeks of its launch earlier this year. The LG box is expected to be available in the second half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rumors of a partnership with Microsoft have swirled in the blogosphere since last year, when Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings joined Microsoft's board of directors and Netflix began surveying subscribers about their interest in accessing movies through an Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix has more than 8.2 million subscribers. Microsoft has sold more than 10 million Xbox consoles and offers limited movie rental through its Xbox Live subscription service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear on Monday how many Netflix subscribers own Xbox 360s and have Xbox Live Gold memberships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Netflix were up 90 cents, or 3.3 percent, at $28.11 in afternoon Nasdaq trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gina Keating; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

 Pfizer to Host Analyst Meeting on July 28th to Review Neuroscience Pipeline and
                                    Platform
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer, Inc announced today that it will present nine abstracts from its
Alzheimer's disease (AD) research and development program, including three on
the two promising investigational therapies in the early stages of development,
at the 2008 Alzheimer's Association International Conference on Alzheimer's
Disease (ICAD) in Chicago, July 26-31.

Pfizer will also host an analyst briefing at ICAD to review its neuroscience
pipeline and platform on Monday, July 28. In addition, Pfizer will sponsor a
satellite symposium, "Innovative Approaches to Alzheimer's Disease: Developing
the Next Generation of Treatment," on Tuesday, July 29.

"With the expected huge increase in the incidence of Alzheimer's disease
worldwide in the next 25 years, Pfizer's neuroscience team has made this
devastating illness our highest priority," said Dr. Liam Ratcliffe, senior vice
president and development head for Pfizer Neuroscience. "With new insights into
the underlying causes of Alzheimer's discovered in only the past few years, our
scientists are working to develop new medicines that improve memory and other
cognitive function, and importantly halt or significantly slow the progression
of the disease. We are also working on approaches that could lead to earlier and
better diagnosis."

Pfizer's investigational compounds target multiple pathways to combat AD, beta
amyloid, the harmful protein that builds up in the brains of AD patients;
amyloid plaques, the sticky deposits made of beta amyloid fragments that impair
the function of brain cells; chronic inflammation of neurons, and loss of
function across the synapses (or gaps) between neurons.

Data from Pfizer to be presented at the meeting include:

-0-
*T
-- Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE) Antagonist:
   Pfizer is in collaboration with TransTech Pharma to develop and
   commercialize a portfolio of RAGE modulators. RAGE is a
   cell-surface receptor that may play a key role in multiple aspects
   of AD. Targeting RAGE for Alzheimer's is a novel approach and
   Pfizer is pioneering this approach in the clinic.

   -- Initial Phase II data on the safety and tolerability of Pfizer's
      oral RAGE antagonist known as PF-04494700 will be presented by
      Dr. Marwan Sabbagh, FAAN, director of The Cleo Roberts Center of
      Clinical Research at the Sun Health Research Institute in Sun
      City, AZ, on Wednesday, July 30th at 12:30 p.m. CST.

   -- Preclinical data on the effect of PF-04494700 on chronic
      inflammation and buildup of amyloid plaques - two abnormal
      processes that are implicated in causing damage and death to
      brain cells in AD - will also be presented by Dr. Jeffrey
      Webster of TransTech Pharma on Monday, July 28th at 12:30 p.m.
      CST.

-- Humanized Anti-Amyloid Monoclonal Antibody: Preclinical data on the
   effect of PF-04360365, Pfizer's investigational monoclonal antibody
   in Phase 1 trials, on beta amyloid levels in the brains of mice
   will be presented by Dr. Thomas Lanz, Senior Scientist at Pfizer, 
   on Monday, July 28th at 12:30 p.m. CST. Monoclonal antibodies are
   designed to selectively target a specific protein, which, in the
   case of AD, is beta amyloid.
*T

Additional Preclinical Research: Pfizer will also present data on a potential
blood biomarker that could help in identifying patients with AD; two studies on
the role of the brain's immune system in the formation of amyloid plaques; a
potential method of using novel imaging and microscopic analysis to quantify AD
neuropathology, and early research on an additional investigational Pfizer
compound on the inhibition of an enzyme in the brain.

About Alzheimer's Disease

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive disorder characterized by the gradual loss
of memory and a decline in cognitive ability; changes in behavior, and a loss in
ability to carry out daily activities. It places a tremendous burden on
patients, those caring for them, and healthcare systems, costing the U.S.
Government more than $148 billion annually. Alzheimer's disease remains one of
the world's most undiagnosed diseases, with only one-third of the world's
approximately 18 million sufferers receiving treatment.

&lt;p&gt;  PIKEVILLE, KY and ARMONK, NY, Jul 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Pike County School today announced they have signed
an enhanced internet access agreement to provide Virtual Infrastructure
Access desktop hosting services to the school district.

    As part of the 5-year agreement, IBM will provide Pike County Schools with
an internet access service that gives older PCs the ability to access the
internet and applications in a manner similar to more current systems.
Schools traditionally purchase classroom PCs each year, resulting in a mix
of vintages, models, and compute resources. There is an inherent
inequality in this approach because some classrooms may have computers up
to six years old whiles other deploy workstations that are less than one
year old.

    This service is made possible via IBM hosted virtual desktops delivered as
part of Pike County's internet access service. IBM storage, xSeries
servers, VMware, and Desktone software are part of the hosted architecture
used to deliver the service to Pike County's 25 schools.

    "As an educator, I know the importance of providing equality in the
classroom," said Maritta Clark, chief information officer, Pike County
Schools. "Current K-12 technology funding challenges our ability to
provide equal information technology access.

    "With IBM's innovative, enhanced internet access approach, the
six-year-old PCs perform at the same level as the new systems and have
the added benefit of delivering the district's standard desktop image on
any PC or thin client device with the ability to support an internet
browser."

    The technology will also allow the potential for students who may be home
bound and teachers who may need to work from home to have access to their
work from any location with an internet connection with the same security
and filtering as if they were in the classroom.

    "This potential means students who may be too ill to be in the classroom
can still keep up with their coursework and not fall behind their
classmates," Clark said.

    The agreement, supporting more than 1,400 devices, was signed in June of
2008.

    "We think this is an answer to our replacement dilemma during this time of
budget constraints," said Roger Wagner, Superintendent for Pike County
Schools. "Our district will be able to provide equitable access with our
existing equipment. Now we don't have to forego our technology initiative
for lack of adequate equipment."

    About Pike County Schools

    The Pike County School District is in the rural foothills of the
Appalachian Mountains in Pike County, the eastern most and largest county
in the state of Kentucky. Pike County is the home of 25 public
educational facilities, administered by the Pike County Board of
Education, located at the county seat, in Pikeville, Kentucky. The Pike
County School District is comprised of 15 elementary schools, three
middle school programs, five high schools, and two day treatment centers.
It is also affiliated with, and is an integral part of two Kentucky Tech.
Vocational education facilities. The school district, having the sixth
largest pupil enrollment in the state, boasts an academic performance
level above most state testing indices, placing it among the leading
districts in the state. The school system is a diverse combination of
educational programs, offering equitable and safe educational
environments, which translate into successful learning experiences for
all students.

    The primary focus of technology in our district is to ensure equity of
access to the most modern and effective voice, video and data technology
tools and services possible for students, teachers and administrators. At
the district level, we assist schools by providing the skills training and
resources needed to promote a high level of instructional use of
technology in the classroom, guaranteeing to our students the skills and
confidence needed to not only compete, but excel in our global society. A
few of the district technology initiatives currently being supported are:
Pike's BEST Academy (Better Education with Standards and Technology) for
teachers, integrating Ky. Technology Teaching Proficiency Standards in our
curriculums, introduction of web based online testing and alignment of
curriculums and course content through web based software which will allow
teachers to share resources from classroom to classroom.

&lt;p&gt;RIYADH, July 14 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's cabinet
authorised on Monday the extension of an oil concession held by
U.S. major Chevron (CVX.N) in its Neutral Zone shared with
Kuwait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The concession is the only oil production agreement that
survived the Saudi nationalisation of the oil industry in the
1970s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 60-year deal was first granted in 1949 to a company
founded by U.S. industrialist Jean Paul Getty, helping. It
helped make him the richest man in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The cabinet approved authorising... the petroleum and
mineral resources minister to sign a project of agreement to
extend and amend the Saudi Arabian government and Chevron Saudi
Arabia (concession) at the neutral zone," Saudi state news
agency SPA reported on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SPA gave no further details on the extension or amendment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saudi Arabia and Kuwait share the estimated 550,000 barrels
per day (bpd) output from the Neutral Zone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The zone is a region between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait that
dates back to 1920s treaties to establish regional borders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron acquired the concession when it bought Texaco in
2001. Texaco had acquired it from Getty Oil in 1984.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since the nationalisation of the Saudi oil industry, the
world's largest oil reserves have been off limits to
international oil companies. Saudi Arabia holds around 264
billion barrels, over a fifth of the world's proven reserves,
and is the world's top oil exporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Simon Webb and Inal Ersan; editing by William

&lt;p&gt; (Changes source; adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded IT services
companies Sapient Corp (SAPE.O) and Computer Sciences Corp
(CSC.N) to "sell" from "neutral" based in part on their
exposure to reduced technology spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also added Computer Sciences to its Americas
conviction sell list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The current financial and credit market turmoil will
likely persist through at 2009. Against this backdrop, we
believe that Computer Sciences and Sapient are among the most
exposed within our US IT Services coverage group," Goldman said
in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman cut its 6-month price target on shares of Computer
Sciences to $41 from $45, and on those of Sapient to $6 from
$6.50, reflecting the brokerage's reduced revenue expectations
for both companies in calendar years 2008 and 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Sapient were down more than 7 percent at $6.00 on
Nasdaq, and those of Computer Sciences were down more than 3
percent at $44.79 in morning trade on the New York Stock
Exchange.

&lt;p&gt; (Changes source, recasts, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded Zions Bancorp
(ZION.O) to "sell" and said it expects U.S. regional banks to
continue to incur heavy losses as cost of capital rises and
credit conditions worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We do not see a peak for losses until the first quarter of
2009, but risk of rolling peaks is rising," the brokerage said
in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman almost halved its price target on Zions' stock to
$21, its second cut on the regional bank in less than a month.
Shares of the bank fell as much as 15 percent to touch a new
52-week low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said the downgrade was based on the bank's
high exposure to construction and land loans, low capital
ratios, risk of a capital raising that could reduce earnings
and potential securities losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman added the bank to its conviction sell list and said
most of the company's loans were concentrated in the
hardest-hit markets of California, Arizona and Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage lowered its 2008 earnings estimates on Zions
and Regions Financial (RF.N) and forecast a loss for Wachovia
WB.N, saying these banks were at the highest risk of capital
raising. [ID:WNA0520]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Credit problems are likely to be worse than previously
estimated as was evident in Wachovia's pre-announced second
quarter," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SunTrust Bank (STI.N), Comerica (CMA.N) and Bank of America
(BAC.N) are also at the greatest risk of dividend cut, the
analyst wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Zions were trading down $3.95 at $21.78 in
morning trade on Nasdaq, after touching a low of $21.65 earlier
in the session.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jul 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that IBM Australia Limited has been
selected by the Australian Government to support its Standard Business
Reporting (SBR) initiative, which aims to reduce the reporting burden for
business. As part of the initial design phase, IBM will provide
architectural and design services under a contract valued at

to electronically interact with Government through a range of software and
accounting packages.

    IBM's partnership with the Australian Government aims to deliver a more

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JustSystems, the largest independent software vendor in Japan and
a worldwide leader in XML and information management technologies,
today announced that it has successfully completed testing of xfy
(pronounced 'x-fye'), its document-based composite application for the
IBM Retail Integration Framework. xfy serves as a management
interface, providing retailers optimal management and decision support
through real-time views of data in underlying applications and
repositories.

   "Today, retailers need real-time information at their fingertips
to make faster, better decisions," said Jake Sorofman, senior vice
president of marketing and business development for JustSystems. "At
the same time, they expect to work in an environment that is familiar,
flexible and easy to understand. JustSystems' xfy achieving Ready for
IBM Retail Integration Framework status reflects the power of xfy as
an information visualization component to deliver up-to-date views of
constantly changing data from multiple sources and present that data
as context relevant information that can be interacted with and shared
as necessary."

   "In today's marketplace, retailers need an intimate understanding
of their customers to quickly and cost-effectively respond to changing
demand patterns across sales channels," said Patrick Gibney, director,
distribution sector solutions, IBM Software Group. "The Retail
Integration Framework creates a technology foundation for solutions
that combine the real-time data access capabilities of xfy to help
retailers utilize an SOA environment. This helps them respond
dynamically to customer and employee needs, aligning evolving customer
requirements with business imperatives."

   xfy Helps IBM Deliver Real-Time Visualization of SOA

   IBM Retail Integration Framework utilizes open standards --
including Association for Retail Technology Standards (ARTS), Open
Application Group Integration (OAGIS) and Global Standards (GS1) -- to
unlock communications between services, information sources, and
business processes, making the store and the retail enterprise one
seamless landscape rather than disconnected islands. xfy, among the
first solutions to take advantage of IBM's DB2 pureXML innovation,
unifies and processes data from multiple sources within a simple and
intuitive dynamic document interface.

   The Retail Integration Framework initiative brings together
platform-independent software vendors that deliver proven solutions
designed and built for the retail industry. Through this initiative,
IBM works with select IBM Business Partners to validate solutions that
meet a rigorous assessment of next-generation, open-standards-based
store environments.

   xfy provides an end-user interface that unifies and processes data
from multiple sources into a clear, contextually-rich dynamic document
interface. xfy connects directly to the native information sources
that drive the retail environment, allowing the data processing to be
done within the dynamic document itself and providing a truly
real-time view of information.

   Continued JustSystems' Sorofman, "In retail, xfy dynamic documents
are a novel supplement to traditional business intelligence tools,
which provide sophisticated analytics at the expense of timeliness.
We're giving users a true, real-time view of information, and we're
giving it to them in a familiar format -- the document -- that
promotes fast, informed decisions on inventory control, demand
forecasting, process performance, and other business activities."

&lt;p&gt;Unisys Introduces Free Service for Clients to Test Drive Microsoft Unified Communications Technologies

   Trial Service Allows Companies to 'Kick the Tires' on Microsoft
Office Communication Server, Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 and
Microsoft Office LiveMeeting.
BLUE BELL, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
Unisys Corporation (NYSE:UIS) today announced the availability of
a trial service enabling enterprise customers to test drive Microsoft
Exchange Server 2007, Microsoft Office Communication Server 2007, and
Microsoft Office LiveMeeting at no cost.

   In today's world of anywhere, instant communication, this service
allows global enterprises to try - free of charge - the latest unified
communications technology from Microsoft to enable their workforces to
communicate more productively in an integrated platform via PC, the
Web or mobile phone.*

   The trial service, implemented and managed by Unisys, will offer
organizations the opportunity to evaluate the features available in
the Microsoft unified communications suite, including e-mail,
calendaring and unified messaging, in addition to multi-party instant
messaging, and voice and video conferencing. Up to 20 accounts can be
established per customer, extending the trial experience to a larger
group of individuals across the company. Organizations interested in
participating in a 30-day trial should contact their Microsoft Sales
Executive.

   "Through this trial, Unisys is able to provide customers with a
first-hand look at the potential the Microsoft unified communications
platform can bring to their organization. We hope they'll see how
seamlessly blending the multiple ways in which workers are already
communicating in today's workplace can be a boon for productivity,"
said Peter Boit, vice president for Microsoft Enterprise Partners at
Microsoft Corp. "Microsoft's ongoing relationship with Unisys provides
our enterprise customers with new levels of business value, helping to
create efficient, high-quality communication and collaboration
experiences."

   While e-mail has become a commonplace, mission-critical
communications tool, unified communications is ushering in a new era
of enterprise productivity and in turn will help organizations get the
most from their business initiatives and IT investments. Several
components of the Microsoft unified communications platform included
in this trial include:

   --  Exchange Server 2007 - Email, Calendaring, Managed Folders,
        Voicemail, and Outlook Voice Access

   --  Office Communication Server 2007 - IM/Voice/Video, OCS Web
        Conferencing, PSTN calling (US-only), and Presence integration

   --  Office Live Meeting - Web conferencing &amp; Collaboration

   "Unisys builds and manages secure, scalable enterprise systems for
the world's largest public and private sector organizations," said
Gary Erickson, vice president of business development, Microsoft
Alliance, Unisys. "This trial lets us showcase our expertise in
large-scale unified communications solutions on the Microsoft
platform. It also gives our clients an easy way to experiment with new
collaboration tools enabled by Microsoft's unified communications
technology stack."

   Unisys teamed with Quintum Technologies, a provider of VoIP
solutions designed to bring the reliability and voice clarity of
public telephone networks to Internet telephony. Quintum's experience
in telephony, specifically VoIP, provides back-end support for the
unified communications platform, including dynamic call failover,
interoperability with voice and data network environments, SIP and
H.323 support.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs removed Eaton Corp
(ETN.N), a diversified industrial manufacturer from America's
conviction buy list, citing in part a possible lower outlook
for the year, given weaker aerospace, auto and truck market
indicators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, however, kept its "buy" rating on the stock,
saying it expects Eaton to outgrow its peers in 2009, helped by
acquisitions and portfolio diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said in a note to clients that it expects
"2008-2009 earnings downgrades for many industrials in coming
weeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said Eaton's aerospace aftermarket business may lose 5
cents to 10 cents a share as many airlines cut capacity to
tackle rising oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage has a price target of $108 on the stock,
which closed at $80.93 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;  FRANKFURT, GERMANY, Jul 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
arvato systems, subsidiary of Arvato AG, the media and communication
services provider of the German Bertelsmann Group, is streamlining its
internal communications to achieve seamless unified communications (UC)
between voice, email, conferencing, video and instant messaging. The
successful deployment is enabled by the Innovative Communications
Alliance between Nortel(1) (TSX: NT)(NYSE: NT) and Microsoft (TSX:
MSFT)(NYSE: MSFT) and is one of the first deployments in Germany of a
joint, integrated UC architecture with Microsoft OCS2007 and Nortel IP
Telephony working together to deliver business benefits for arvato
systems employees and clients.

    arvato systems workers now have all the advantages of UC including
one-click access to communications from any Microsoft application with a
seamless user experience using IP phones or laptops. The UC solution also
enables arvato systems users to instantly find available colleagues
across the enterprise, to communicate and collaborate with them in
real-time via existing desk or computer software phones, instant
messaging, e-mail, video-conferencing or within web-based team
workspaces. The presence feature allows users to see, at a glance,
whether a specific person is available or on the phone before making
contact, this feature improves productivity and customer service by
speeding up information sharing and decision making.

    "With our new unified communications capabilities, we gained immediate
productivity benefits without needing to train workers on how to use new
devices and user interfaces," says Rainer Flottmann, product manager at
arvato systems. "The cooperation between Microsoft and Nortel was a major
advantage because their hardware and software solutions integrate
seamlessly and were easily configured to meet our exact needs and
expectations. Now we have a solid first phase system on which we can
easily add future internal users and also showcase to our customers such
as the Bertelsmann Group and other companies."

    "arvato systems was able to launch unified communications in ways that
were easy to deploy and highly cost-effective because its investment in
its existing hardware could be retained and new capabilities were simply
layered onto devices and interfaces that were already familiar to arvato
systems employees," says Wim te Niet, president, Central Europe, Nortel.
"We also provided extensive consultancy services throughout the project
to enable arvato systems to plan, integrate and rapidly deploy its
unified communications solution."

    The consulting services delivered by Nortel covered a three-stage
implementation process. The architecture design service, using Nortel and
Microsoft's unique Collaboration Center, was critical in enabling the
arvato systems network management teams to collaborate on all business
and technical aspects of successfully rolling out their UC network. In
the second stage, design and integration, Nortel delivered a network and
integration plan down to the component level. In the third stage,
integration and acceptance, Nortel worked with its Gold Solution Partner
DeTeWe Communications GmbH to provide hardware and consulting services
for the roll-out and integration of the solution. A final acceptance test
verified that the whole solution worked precisely according to arvato
system's requirements and expectations. DeTeWe Communications also
upgraded and customized arvato system's existing Nortel IP-PBX and
components of the Microsoft solution.

&lt;p&gt;  BELMONT, CA, Jul 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
As instant messaging becomes preferred over e-mail for real-time
collaboration in large organizations, security and compliance concerns
rise to top of mind for IT managers. In answer to these concerns,
FaceTime Communications today announced that its newly enhanced version
of IMAuditor provides a dynamic system for information leak prevention
that detects and scans message communications as well as file transfer
content in real-time.

    Since 2001, FaceTime has been the definitive choice for instant messaging
management and security in the enterprise. Partnering with both Microsoft
(as a Gold Level Partner) and IBM, FaceTime provides perimeter security
and deep compliance for unified communications and enterprise IM
deployments. With FaceTime, organizations can block in-bound malware
threats, prevent information leakage and maintain corporate and
regulatory compliance requirements while realizing the productivity and
cost saving benefits of real-time communications.

    The IMAuditor system scans and applies established policies to all the
popular file types transferred over unified communications platforms such
as Microsoft OCS and IBM Lotus Sametime, as well as public instant
messaging networks such as AIM, Yahoo! Messenger, GoogleTalk and MSN. The
system analyzes and detects sensitive or confidential information in both
messages and file attachments, can prevent transmission of the
information, and will warn the user about established company policy
regarding the sharing of corporate intellectual property.

    In an information leak prevention survey conducted in June 2008 for
FaceTime by Osterman Research, nearly 40 percent of IT staff at mid- to
large-sized organizations in North America said they believed that
unintentional leaks by employees are a bigger threat to their data
security than spyware or malicious software, and 57 percent believe their
corporate data is not adequately protected from leaks via IM and/or
unified communications.

    "This survey confirms that security and compliance issues such as
e-mail-based spam and malware are among those that the IT community feels
confident have been adequately solved," said Michael Osterman, principal
of Osterman Research. "However, compliance for unified communications and
the real-time Internet is an area that many realize they must address."

    The survey also revealed that nearly 50 percent of IT managers are very
concerned about information leak prevention in their current or planned
unified communications implementations and 23 percent of those view it as
a top priority. Conversely, only 16 percent of respondents said the issue
of information leak prevention is not on their radar, and less than 10
percent said they have no plans for unified communications deployment.

    "Organizations are deploying unified communications to help their
employees be more efficient and to reduce costs," said Frank Cabri, vice
president of marketing and product management for FaceTime
Communications. "The last thing IT wants to do is to create yet another
open security hole for intellectual property to be leaked. File
attachments can contain sensitive information and unless their content
can be detected and evaluated, control is lost at the gateway."

    IMAuditor 9.5 helps organizations realize the benefits of unified
communications and enterprise instant messaging deployments by providing
guaranteed compliance to meet  regulatory and corporate requirements,
including logging, archiving and easy retrieval of messaging
communications.

    About IMAuditor 9.5

    FaceTime IMAuditor is a full-featured instant messaging proxy that secures
and manages all public and enterprise instant message use over an
organization's network. IMAuditor, which resides on the local area
network, maintains an integrated trust relationship with FaceTime's
secure Web gateway appliance, the Unified Security Gateway (USG). Working
together IMAuditor and USG deliver complete end-to-end security,
management and compliance for real-time communications in the enterprise,
ensuring that corporate data is protected both from outside threats such
as spyware, viruses and worms, as well as from intentional or
unintentional information leakage from within the company.

    The following new features are incorporated into the IMAuditor System with
version 9.5:


--  Information leak prevention -- protect intellectual property by
    scanning contents of all the popular file types including Microsoft Office
    and other leading software applications. This capability allows powerful
    data leakage polices to be enforced based on restricted phrase matching,
    detecting and blocking encrypted files and controlling the types of files
    that can be sent internally or externally.

--  BlackBerry support -- management, compliance and security for mobile
    workers using BlackBerry devices within an IBM Sametime environment.

--  Advanced text search -- delivers fast Boolean and regular expression
    searches across IM conversations to make information retrieval simple and
    efficient during a discovery event, regardless of database size.

--  Usage trend reporting -- provides detailed usage information including
    unique logins, number of messages, number of unified communications events
    as well as reports by time interval to provide flexible reporting options
    for IT management.
    

    
IMAuditor 9.5 is available now from FaceTime and authorized
distributors and partners worldwide. For pricing and additional
information call 1-888-349-3223 or visit www.facetime.com.

&lt;p&gt;  FRANKFURT, GERMANY, Jul 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
arvato systems, subsidiary of Arvato AG, the media and communication
services provider of the German Bertelsmann Group, is streamlining its
internal communications to achieve seamless unified communications (UC)
between voice, email, conferencing, video and instant messaging. The
successful deployment is enabled by the Innovative Communications
Alliance between Nortel(1) (TSX: NT)(NYSE: NT) and Microsoft (TSX:
MSFT)(NYSE: MSFT) and is one of the first deployments in Germany of a
joint, integrated UC architecture with Microsoft OCS2007 and Nortel IP
Telephony working together to deliver business benefits for arvato
systems employees and clients.

    arvato systems workers now have all the advantages of UC including
one-click access to communications from any Microsoft application with a
seamless user experience using IP phones or laptops. The UC solution also
enables arvato systems users to instantly find available colleagues
across the enterprise, to communicate and collaborate with them in
real-time via existing desk or computer software phones, instant
messaging, e-mail, video-conferencing or within web-based team
workspaces. The presence feature allows users to see, at a glance,
whether a specific person is available or on the phone before making
contact, this feature improves productivity and customer service by
speeding up information sharing and decision making.

    "With our new unified communications capabilities, we gained immediate
productivity benefits without needing to train workers on how to use new
devices and user interfaces," says Rainer Flottmann, product manager at
arvato systems. "The cooperation between Microsoft and Nortel was a major
advantage because their hardware and software solutions integrate
seamlessly and were easily configured to meet our exact needs and
expectations. Now we have a solid first phase system on which we can
easily add future internal users and also showcase to our customers such
as the Bertelsmann Group and other companies."

    "arvato systems was able to launch unified communications in ways that
were easy to deploy and highly cost-effective because its investment in
its existing hardware could be retained and new capabilities were simply
layered onto devices and interfaces that were already familiar to arvato
systems employees," says Wim te Niet, president, Central Europe, Nortel.
"We also provided extensive consultancy services throughout the project
to enable arvato systems to plan, integrate and rapidly deploy its
unified communications solution."

    The consulting services delivered by Nortel covered a three-stage
implementation process. The architecture design service, using Nortel and
Microsoft's unique Collaboration Center, was critical in enabling the
arvato systems network management teams to collaborate on all business
and technical aspects of successfully rolling out their UC network. In
the second stage, design and integration, Nortel delivered a network and
integration plan down to the component level. In the third stage,
integration and acceptance, Nortel worked with its Gold Solution Partner
DeTeWe Communications GmbH to provide hardware and consulting services
for the roll-out and integration of the solution. A final acceptance test
verified that the whole solution worked precisely according to arvato
system's requirements and expectations. DeTeWe Communications also
upgraded and customized arvato system's existing Nortel IP-PBX and
components of the Microsoft solution.

QuickTransit(R) software will run within Hyper-V(TM), the Windows Server
2008 hypervisor released this month by Microsoft. This innovative product
combination will allow enterprise customers to run Solaris/SPARC
applications on the latest Windows-based servers without porting or
recompilation, resulting in cost-effective new solutions for scalability,
high availability, disaster recovery and legacy application re-hosting.

    "QuickTransit and Hyper-V are a great fit," said Ian Robinson,
vice-president of marketing for Transitive. "The combination of a leading
cross-platform virtualization solution and a robust, affordable hypervisor
integrated into the most broadly-deployed server operating system is a
'win-win' for enterprise customers. Used in Hyper-V, QuickTransit allows
thousands of additional non-Windows applications to run on the latest
Windows Server 2008 systems without the costs, delays or disruption of
porting."

    To run native Solaris/SPARC software on Windows Server 2008 requires
deployment of a guest operating system such as Novell SUSE Linux
Enterprise Server 10 in a Hyper-V virtual machine, with Transitive's
QuickTransit 1.5 for Solaris/SPARC-to-Linux/x86-64. A broad range of
Solaris/SPARC executable files can then be run within that virtual
machine, and these applications can interoperate with native Windows
applications running on the same server. All of the considerable benefits
of server virtualization, such as consolidation and rapid provisioning,
are thereby available for legacy Solaris/SPARC workloads migrated from
older RISC-based hardware.

    To address the most typical customer deployments, Transitive offers three
configurations of its QuickTransit product line: QuickTransit Workstation
is intended for use on desktop and laptop PCs; QuickTransit Server is used
for large-scale datacenter consolidation projects; and QuickTransit Legacy
is a specialized version for application re-hosting from very old legacy
hardware running operating system versions that are no longer supported.

    Evaluation versions of QuickTransit can be downloaded from the Transitive
Web site at: http://www.transitive.com/evaluate.

    About Transitive Corporation

    Transitive is a leader in cross-platform virtualization, and its
award-winning QuickTransit technology is built into more than 12 million
computers worldwide. QuickTransit allows software applications that have
been compiled for one processor and operating system to run on systems
with different processors and operating systems, without any source code
or binary changes and at speeds comparable to native ports. As a result,
QuickTransit allows IT managers to quickly and easily replicate legacy
enterprise applications from the original hardware and run them on modern,
standardized platforms without incurring the costs and delays of porting
projects, and without disruption to end users. This workload replication
helps enterprise customers improve business continuity, including superior
disaster recovery, scalability and high-availability solutions.

    Transitive's cross-platform virtualization technology is the foundation
for Apple's Rosetta translation software (built into Apple's Intel-based
Macintosh computers) and also for PowerVM Lx86, which is available for all
IBM Power Systems enterprise servers. Transitive Corporation is located in
Los Gatos, California with a research and development team in Manchester,
UK. For more information, please visit Transitive's Web site at

&lt;p&gt;  BELMONT, CA, Jul 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
As instant messaging becomes preferred over e-mail for real-time
collaboration in large organizations, security and compliance concerns
rise to top of mind for IT managers. In answer to these concerns,
FaceTime Communications today announced that its newly enhanced version
of IMAuditor provides a dynamic system for information leak prevention
that detects and scans message communications as well as file transfer
content in real-time.

    Since 2001, FaceTime has been the definitive choice for instant messaging
management and security in the enterprise. Partnering with both Microsoft
(as a Gold Level Partner) and IBM, FaceTime provides perimeter security
and deep compliance for unified communications and enterprise IM
deployments. With FaceTime, organizations can block in-bound malware
threats, prevent information leakage and maintain corporate and
regulatory compliance requirements while realizing the productivity and
cost saving benefits of real-time communications.

    The IMAuditor system scans and applies established policies to all the
popular file types transferred over unified communications platforms such
as Microsoft OCS and IBM Lotus Sametime, as well as public instant
messaging networks such as AIM, Yahoo! Messenger, GoogleTalk and MSN. The
system analyzes and detects sensitive or confidential information in both
messages and file attachments, can prevent transmission of the
information, and will warn the user about established company policy
regarding the sharing of corporate intellectual property.

    In an information leak prevention survey conducted in June 2008 for
FaceTime by Osterman Research, nearly 40 percent of IT staff at mid- to
large-sized organizations in North America said they believed that
unintentional leaks by employees are a bigger threat to their data
security than spyware or malicious software, and 57 percent believe their
corporate data is not adequately protected from leaks via IM and/or
unified communications.

    "This survey confirms that security and compliance issues such as
e-mail-based spam and malware are among those that the IT community feels
confident have been adequately solved," said Michael Osterman, principal
of Osterman Research. "However, compliance for unified communications and
the real-time Internet is an area that many realize they must address."

    The survey also revealed that nearly 50 percent of IT managers are very
concerned about information leak prevention in their current or planned
unified communications implementations and 23 percent of those view it as
a top priority. Conversely, only 16 percent of respondents said the issue
of information leak prevention is not on their radar, and less than 10
percent said they have no plans for unified communications deployment.

    "Organizations are deploying unified communications to help their
employees be more efficient and to reduce costs," said Frank Cabri, vice
president of marketing and product management for FaceTime
Communications. "The last thing IT wants to do is to create yet another
open security hole for intellectual property to be leaked. File
attachments can contain sensitive information and unless their content
can be detected and evaluated, control is lost at the gateway."

    IMAuditor 9.5 helps organizations realize the benefits of unified
communications and enterprise instant messaging deployments by providing
guaranteed compliance to meet  regulatory and corporate requirements,
including logging, archiving and easy retrieval of messaging
communications.

    About IMAuditor 9.5

    FaceTime IMAuditor is a full-featured instant messaging proxy that secures
and manages all public and enterprise instant message use over an
organization's network. IMAuditor, which resides on the local area
network, maintains an integrated trust relationship with FaceTime's
secure Web gateway appliance, the Unified Security Gateway (USG). Working
together IMAuditor and USG deliver complete end-to-end security,
management and compliance for real-time communications in the enterprise,
ensuring that corporate data is protected both from outside threats such
as spyware, viruses and worms, as well as from intentional or
unintentional information leakage from within the company.

    The following new features are incorporated into the IMAuditor System with
version 9.5:


--  Information leak prevention -- protect intellectual property by
    scanning contents of all the popular file types including Microsoft Office
    and other leading software applications. This capability allows powerful
    data leakage polices to be enforced based on restricted phrase matching,
    detecting and blocking encrypted files and controlling the types of files
    that can be sent internally or externally.

--  BlackBerry support -- management, compliance and security for mobile
    workers using BlackBerry devices within an IBM Sametime environment.

--  Advanced text search -- delivers fast Boolean and regular expression
    searches across IM conversations to make information retrieval simple and
    efficient during a discovery event, regardless of database size.

--  Usage trend reporting -- provides detailed usage information including
    unique logins, number of messages, number of unified communications events
    as well as reports by time interval to provide flexible reporting options
    for IT management.
    

    
IMAuditor 9.5 is available now from FaceTime and authorized
distributors and partners worldwide. For pricing and additional
information call 1-888-349-3223 or visit www.facetime.com.

&lt;p&gt; (adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 14 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded Dean
Foods Co (DF.N) to "overweight" from "neutral," saying shares
of the No. 1 U.S. dairy company have been oversold due to fears
of a coming dairy inflation and current increases in energy and
resin costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dairy costs will decrease year on year, for the next one
and half years, the brokerage said in a report, and added that
dairy farming remains quite profitable and cuts in production
were unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Dean Foods could rise by more than 20 percent by
the end of the year, the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the brokerage also said some concerns remain,
including an accelerating trade down from branded to lower
margined private labels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company closed at $17.99 Friday on the New
York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and billionaire investor Carl Icahn's joint proposal for Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), which was rejected on Saturday, included $2.3 billion in guaranteed annual revenue from search advertising for five years, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In joining forces with Icahn, Microsoft sweetened the terms of a proposal to buy Yahoo's search business after withdrawing its offer in May to buy the whole company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The improved terms included $2.3 billion in guaranteed annual revenue from search advertising for five years, with the option to extend the deal for another five, according to the sources, who asked not to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday Yahoo rejected the proposal, which would have given Microsoft its search business and left Icahn, who owns nearly 5 percent of Yahoo, in charge of the remaining company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After withdrawing its $47.5 billion full buyout offer, Microsoft said in June it had offered Yahoo $9 billion in cash for a partial deal, as well as revenue guarantees on search advertising that would have brought Yahoo $1 billion a year in operating income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft wanted an exclusive, 10-year search ad partnership with Yahoo and was willing to guarantee revenue for only three of those 10 years, a source told Reuters at that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo instead chose to sign a non-exclusive search deal with Google Inc (GOOG.O), which promises $800 million a year in revenue for Yahoo and leaves it free to seek similar search advertising partnerships with other companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its latest proposal, Microsoft had joined forces with Icahn to increase to five the number of years it would guarantee revenue. It remains unclear whether Microsoft had previously put a revenue guarantee amount on the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Yahoo officials declined comment. Icahn did not return a call seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anupreeta Das and Daisuke Wakabayashi, editing by Martin Golan, Toni Reinhold)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  (Adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, July 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) hired
former Citigroup (C.N) veteran Kaven Leung as deputy head of Asia
private wealth management, a memo said on Wednesday, as the bank
builds its team catering to wealthy clients across the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leung, who was at Citi for 21 years, will be based in Hong
Kong and responsible for Goldman's wealth management business
strategy and clients in Asia, excluding Japan, the internal memo
says. He starts at the end of the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While at Citi, Leung was in charge of around 2,000 private
bankers from Australia to Hong Kong, Singapore to India. The bank
last week announced his resignation as CEO of Asia-Pacific wealth
management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asia's booming economy has created heavy demand for wealth
management. Goldman in the last few years has bulked up its own
Asia wealth group, as have other investment banks including Citi,
UBS (UBSN.VX) (UBS.N) and HSBC (HSBA.L) (0005.HK) .

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top Microsoft Corp executive said Yahoo Inc's advertising search partnership with Google Inc would leave only one major player in the Internet search business, and said he had been told as much by Yahoo's own chief executive last month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testifying at a congressional hearing, Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith said that in a June 8 meeting in San Jose Yahoo chief Jerry Yang described Internet search as a "bipolar" market, with Google on one side and Yahoo and Microsoft on the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(Yang) said 'If we do this deal with Google, Yahoo will become part of Google's pole and Microsoft,' he said, 'would not be strong enough in this market to remain a pole of its own,'" Smith told the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Microsoft executives met later in a separate conference room. "We sat down and we said, 'We can't believe that Jerry just said those things.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith used the anecdote to bolster Microsoft's contention that the Google-Yahoo deal would violate antitrust law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's pretty explosive stuff and we'll have to consider that," agreed the antitrust subcommittee's chairman, Democratic Sen. Herb Kohl of Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo General Counsel Michael Callahan, also testifying at Tuesday's hearing, said he had been at the June 8 meeting but he disputed Smith's description of what Yang had said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I disagree with how Mr. Smith characterized what Mr. Yang thinks about the market," said Callahan. "Our board of directors made a conscious decision to stay in search."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kohl shot back: "Clearly what you said contradicts what your boss said."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google, with more than 60 percent of the Web search market, and Yahoo, with 16.6 percent, announced a deal on June 12 that would allow Yahoo to place Google advertisements on its site and collect the revenue. It has raised antitrust concerns because of their dominance of the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yahoo-Google partnership was widely seen as an effort by Yahoo to fend off Microsoft's on-again, off-again efforts to buy all or part of Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google and Yahoo have refrained from consummating the deal while they wait for an opinion from antitrust authorities at the Justice Department. Several state attorneys general were also looking into the arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Callahan accused Microsoft of teaming up with investor Carl Icahn to force down Yahoo's price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft ... has turned to activist shareholder Carl Icahn, in the apparent hope that this will force a fire sale of Yahoo's core strategic search business," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn is leading a proxy campaign to dump Yahoo's current management and board at the August shareholder meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's most recent offer to acquire Yahoo's search business was rejected Saturday evening by Yahoo, which said it was open to a full-scale merger with Microsoft if it offered at least $33 a share, or $47.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had offered $31-per-share cash on January 31, when it tendered its first offer, and then raised it to $33 per share. Yahoo rejected it, demanding at least $37 a share, and Microsoft pulled the offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo closed down 4.56 percent at $21.54 on Tuesday on the Nasdaq. Microsoft shares were up 3.98 percent to $26.15, and Google shares slipped 1.06 percent to $516.09.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google's Chief Legal Officer David Drummond also defended the partnership with Yahoo and dismissed the idea that it would hurt competition in the Internet search market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google and Yahoo will remain fierce competitors," Drummond said. "This agreement will not remove a competitor from the field."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drummond argued that any Microsoft deal with Yahoo would raise antitrust issues in the markets for display advertising, e-mail and instant messaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most energetic critic of ours is Microsoft," he said, adding that it was "not exactly a mom-and-pop show."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Tim Dobbyn, Derek Caney, Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) reports quarterly results this week, looking to ease the concerns of investors about slower growth at its Windows business and prove that its pursuit of Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) is not a distraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker kicks off a crucial three-week period with earnings on Thursday, followed by an annual financial analysts meeting at its Redmond, Washington campus a week later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, Yahoo holds its annual shareholders meeting on August 1, which could determine whether Microsoft will be able to buy all or part of the Internet pioneer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, investors will look for signs in Microsoft's results that corporate customers and consumers are upgrading to its new Windows Vista operating system. A weak U.S. economy and a poor reception for Vista has raised fears adoption may be weak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts forecast Microsoft would report fiscal fourth- quarter earnings of 47 cents a share on a 17 percent rise in revenue to $15.6 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last quarter, revenue at the Windows division, which accounts for more than half of the company's profit, were lower than expected due to an inventory build-up of computers and a lack of progress in the battle against piracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What happened last quarter in the (Windows) client division was something that might persist," said Sid Parakh, an analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen. "That's what everybody is still concerned about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another concern is that large organizations will postpone upgrades to Vista, opting to wait for the next version of Windows code-named "Windows 7." Microsoft is targeting a 2010 debut for "Windows 7."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a survey of chief investment officers conducted by Goldman Sachs, 43 percent said Vista deployment is likely to be delayed if technology budgets tighten in the second half of 2008. It was the highest percentage of all software projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors will also be probing Microsoft's updated forecasts for fiscal 2009 and estimates for its current quarter as an indicator of technology spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late April, the company forecast fiscal 2009 earnings in a range between $2.13 and $2.19 per share on revenue of $66.9 billion to $68 billion. Analysts expect the results to be in the middle of the range, with EPS of $2.16 on revenue of $67.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the current quarter, analysts on average forecast the company will earn 49 cents per share on revenue of $15.1 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YAHOO QUESTIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts are expected to grill Microsoft executives about the company's on-again, off-again pursuit of Yahoo and alternative options to turn around its online service business, which has posted seven straight quarters of losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The negotiations between the two companies have turned ugly and Microsoft is now teaming up with investor Carl Icahn, who wants to oust Yahoo Chief Executive Jerry Yang and replace the Web company's board with a group of directors more open to a deal with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These things can be distracting. I just worry that Microsoft's taking its eye off the ball to try to replicate what Google has put together on the Internet search side and its Web advertising model," said Todd Lowenstein, co-portfolio manager at HighMark Capital Management's Value Momentum Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can't say we're all that crazy about it buying into Yahoo. It's not our favorite use of capital."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares have fallen about 20 percent since it went public with its unsolicited offer to buy Yahoo. By comparison, the SP 500 has declined about 12 percent and the Nasdaq is down about 8 percent during that period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pullback on Microsoft shares is overdone, said Lowenstein, who manages 444,000 Microsoft shares in his fund, if you consider the amount of cash generated by the company, its debt-free balance sheet and competitive businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a lot at the company that people don't give them enough credit for," said Lowenstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock is now trading at 13 times estimated 2008 earnings compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of around 20 for software companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's other businesses continue to hum along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Office division is attracting customers to its SharePoint collaboration software, while rolling out new products that allow companies to pay a monthly subscription to have Microsoft run its e-mail and other software programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The server and tools division rolled out a new version of Windows for computer servers with a new Hyper-V virtualization feature that allows customers to save money by running powerful computers more efficiently. It is an area where Microsoft has lagged behind VMware Inc (VMW.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entertainment and device division announced a price cut to its Xbox 360 game console and introduced a new model with a larger hard drive ahead of this week's E3 video game industry trade show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

of Liebow, Dexterra also announced that Rob Loughan, Dexterra's current
chief executive officer, would continue as chairman of the board.

    Liebow brings more than 25 years of sales, marketing, and management

Global Business Services where he was responsible for creating a new
portfolio of composite business solutions. This initiative involved

of independent software vendors.

    "Liebow is an excellent addition to the Dexterra team. We will benefit

success," said Loughan. "More than ever, Dexterra's growth opportunities
abound as a result of our strong product innovation and global partner
ecosystem. Michael's executive leadership at aligning business and
technology will help ensure we harness this potential and fully realize
the growth opportunities before us."

business operations. With industry leading expertise in helping clients
use dynamic business applications based on a service-oriented architecture

rapidly growing community of development, service and channel partners
including Vodafone, Accenture, IBM, AT, Microsoft, Verizon, and more.

    "I'm excited to help Dexterra bring new capabilities to customers faced
with the challenge of extending business processes to the mobile worker,"
said Liebow. "This is a great opportunity to play a lead role in a
company that possesses needed innovation to help businesses of all sizes
accelerate adoption of mobile technology. I look forward to working
closely with Rob and the entire Dexterra team, our partners and
customers."

    Loughan will continue his active involvement as chairman of the Board and
as an evangelist for Dexterra. With his successful track record of sales
leadership and building effective global teams, he will continue to play a
critical role in the growth of the company.

    Michael Liebow Background

    Prior to joining Dexterra, Michael Liebow served as vice president of
business development, Global Consulting Services and SOA for IBM Global
Business Services, a $20 billion division. A 10 year veteran of IBM,
Liebow led SOA, one of IBM's major growth initiatives, since its
inception to its evolution as the underpinning to IBM's extensive
portfolio of business solutions, and one of the most powerful examples of
cross IBM integration. He has held a variety of management positions
across a diverse range of industries, including the high-technology
sector, consumer package goods, communications, media and entertainment.

    During his leadership at IBM, Liebow created the predecessor to IBM's X
Series Servers from the remains of IBM's PC Server business, and
articulated a long-term technical vision through the creation of the
X-architecture; a technical blueprint for bringing mainframe attributes to
the Intel server market which IBM continues to follow today.

    In addition to his career at IBM, Liebow started an Internet venture
targeting media and entertainment companies. Clients included the National
Football League, Arista Records, U.K. Premiership, and David Bowie. He has
also led marketing and product management for a leading commercial
satellite communications firm, consulted at America Online and worked in
the consumer packaged goods industry for 15 years. Liebow received his
bachelor's of science degree from the University of Wisconsin at Madison.
He currently resides with his wife and children in Weston, Connecticut.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed JP Morgan Commercial Mortgage Finance
Corp., commercial mortgage pass-through certificates, series 2000-C10
as follows:

   --$28.5 million class A-2 at 'AAA';

   --Interest-only class X at 'AAA';

   --$31.4 million class B at 'AAA';

   --$29.5 million class C at 'AAA';

   --$9.2 million class D at 'AAA';

   --$23.1 million class E at 'AAA';

   --$10.2 million class F at 'AAA';

   --$14.8 million class G at 'A';

   --$14.8 million class H at 'BBB-';

   --$7.4 million class J 'at 'BB-';

   --$5.5 million class K at 'B+';

   --$7.4 million class L at 'B-'.

   The $1.4 million class M remains at 'C/DR5'. Fitch does not rate
the $1.5 million class Q. Class A1 has been repaid in full.

   The affirmations are a result of stable pool performance and
minimal paydown since Fitch's last rating action. As of the June 2008
distribution date, the transaction's aggregate principal balance has
been reduced 21% to $584.8 million from $740.1 million at issuance. In
total, 48 loans (46.7%) are defeased. There are no delinquent or
specially serviced loans.

   Fitch has identified 15 loans (4.1%) as Fitch loans of concern due
to declining performance. The largest Fitch loan of concern (0.6%) is
secured by a 172-room extended stay hotel in Decatur, GA. The
performance of the property has declined due to weak local economic
conditions. Servicer reported debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) was
0.9 times(x) with 88% occupancy rate as of year-end (YE) 2007,
compared to a DSCR of 1.52x with occupancy rate of 95.4% at issuance.

   The second largest Fitch loan of concern (0.5%) is secured by a
194 unit manufactured housing community in Randolph, NC. The
performance of the property continues to deteriorate due to declining
occupancy. Servicer reported DSCR was 0.79x with 70% occupancy rate as
of YE 2007, compared to a DSCR of 1.39x with occupancy rate of 95% at
issuance.

   There are no loan maturities or anticipated repayment dates (ARD)
in 2008. 43% of the pool is scheduled to mature in 2009, 71.2% of

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 15 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) will invest $1.5

research center in upstate New York at a site yet to be chosen,
Gov. David Paterson said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The state will contribute $140 million in economic

the upstate economy and the Democratic governor said the
investments will create 1,000 high-tech jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition to the new research center, IBM will expand its

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, July 15 (Reuters) - A Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O)
executive accused Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) of teaming up with
activist investor Carl Icahn to force a "fire sale" price for
Yahoo's search business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Yahoo General Counsel Michael Callahan, in testimony
Tuesday to a congressional committee, defended his company's
advertising partnership with Google Inc (GOOG.O) and said Yahoo
would not be sold off piecemeal on terms that disadvantage
Yahoo stockholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft... has turned to activist shareholder Carl
Icahn, in the apparent hope that this will force a fire sale of
Yahoo's core strategic search business," Callahan said in
written testimony prepared for a hearing before the Senate
Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google, with more than 60 percent of the Web search market,
and Yahoo, with 16.6 percent, announced a deal on June 12 that
would allow Yahoo to place Google advertisements on its site
and collect the revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal, which the firms have said would garner Yahoo at
least $250 million in the first year, was widely seen as an
effort by Yahoo to fend off Microsoft's on-again, off-again
efforts to buy all or part of Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's most recent offer to acquire Yahoo's search
business was rejected Saturday evening by Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn is leading a proxy campaign to dump Yahoo's current
management and board at the August shareholder meeting.

&lt;p&gt;Absoft &amp; Visual Numerics Announce First IMSL Numerical Library Qualified for
Microsoft's HPC Platform

ROCHESTER HILLS, Mich., July 15, 2008 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- Absoft(r) and Visual
Numerics(r) today announced the first implementation of the IMSL Fortran
Numerical Library qualified for Microsoft Windows(r) Compute Cluster Server
(WCCS) 2003. Built with Absoft's Pro Fortran compiler, the newly qualified IMSL
Library build includes MPI multi-threaded support and significantly improves
performance and scalability of numerically intensive HPC applications running on
WCCS 2003 based clusters. Future support for Windows HPC Server 2008, the
successor to WCCS, is planned.

The IMSL Library for WCCS includes 1000+ mathematical and statistical
subroutines that have been optimized for AMD and Intel processors using Absoft's
latest Pro Fortran Compiler for x64 Windows environments. Windows Compute
Cluster Server 2003 with Microsoft-MPI is designed for easy application
deployment across multiple x64 HPC cluster nodes. The Absoft Fortran, WCCS, IMSL
Library combination provides a complete, high performance solution for
development of computationally intense applications on cluster systems. The
Absoft/IMSL Library build expands the computational and numerical capabilities
of Windows systems previously targeted primarily at workstation environments.
Prices start at $400. http://www.absoft.com/Absoft_IMSL.htm

introducing the first IMSL Numerical Library qualified for Windows Compute
Cluster Server 2003 platforms," said Wood Lotz, president of Absoft. "The IMSL
Libraries are the gold standard of numerical libraries and are available on over
60 different platforms worldwide. Using the IMSL Libraries' pre-built functions
as application building blocks means Absoft customers save both time and money.
Microsoft's robust WCCS environment and Absoft Fortran's advanced optimizers
assure maximum performance and reliability for the applications," continued
Lotz.

"For over 15 years, Visual Numerics and Absoft have collaborated to advance 
computational solutions for the Windows platform. Adding qualified WCCS  support
means a higher level of performance, and large cluster scalability is now
available to distributed application developers on Windows through the
combination of the Absoft Pro Fortran compiler and the IMSL Fortran Library,"
states Dr. Ed Stewart, product manager for the IMSL Libraries.

"Windows Compute Cluster Server 2003 brings together the power of commodity x64
computers with the ease of use and security of Windows. We are pleased that
Absoft and Visual Numerics have announced the first implementation of the IMSL
numerical libraries certified for WCCS 2003," said Shawn Hansen, director of HPC
marketing at Microsoft.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


JPMorgan Chase Bank has earned an overall outstanding rating for its community
reinvestment across the United States from its primary regulator, the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency.

"This Outstanding rating reflects the dedication and leadership of thousands of
our colleagues who are helping families buy homes, finance small businesses and
make our communities better places to live and work," said William Daley, Head
of Corporate Responsibility at JPMorgan Chase.

This is the first Community Reinvestment Act rating of the bank created by the
2004 merger of Bank One and JPMorgan Chase Bank. The Community Reinvestment Act
rating reflects a bank's effectiveness at serving the credit and capital needs
of low- and moderate-income communities.

Chase's strong network of convenient and accessible bank branches and ATMs as
well as community development commitment helped earn the Outstanding rating.

Under the Community Reinvestment Act, banks are required to meet the credit
needs of low-and moderate-income communities. Federal agencies provide a
periodic review, which rates banks on the number of loans, investments and
services provided to low- to moderate-income communities.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency evaluated the bank's activity from
January 2004 through December 2006. It looked at mortgage, small business and
community development lending as well as community development investments,
retail banking and community development services.

Chase serves consumers and small businesses through 3,150 bank branches, 9,200
ATMs and 290 mortgage offices as well as through relationships with over 14,500
auto dealerships, 5,200 schools and universities. It also serves more than
30,000 commercial banking clients, including corporations, municipalities,
financial institutions and not-for-profit entities.

Parent company JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) is a leading global financial
services firm with assets of $1.6 trillion, as of March 31, 2008, and operations
in more than 60 countries. The firm is a leader in investment banking, financial
services for consumers, small business and commercial banking, financial
transaction processing, asset management, and private equity. A component of the
Dow Jones Industrial Average, JPMorgan Chase serves millions of consumers in the
United States and many of the world's most prominent corporate, institutional
and government clients under its JPMorgan and Chase brands. Information about
the firm is available at www.jpmorganchase.com.

&lt;p&gt;  BURLINGTON, MA, Jul 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 


-- Kalido (http://www.kalido.com), the active information management
   company, today announced that the latest version of the Kalido(R)
   Universal Information Director(TM) (http://www.kalido.com/products-for
   -business-universal-information-director.htm) will extend Kalido's BI
   support to Microsoft Office(R), Microsoft PerformancePoint(TM) business
   intelligence software and Microsoft SharePoint(R) services.

   -- Kalido's Universal Information Director automates the generation
      and population of Microsoft SQL Server(R) Analysis Services (SSAS)
      cubes with data from the Kalido Dynamic Information Warehouse(TM),
      (http://www.kalido.com/products-for-business-dynamic-information-
      warehouse.htm) Kalido's flagship data warehousing software.

   -- These cubes can be accessed by Microsoft Office, Microsoft
      PerformancePoint and Microsoft SharePoint. They are also available
      to any third party BI tool that connects to SSAS cubes, extending
      the reach to users of more than 40 other BI tools.

-- By making the information in the Kalido Dynamic Information Warehouse
   available to users throughout the enterprise, more managers can use
   their company's information assets and BI tools to secure answers to
   complex business questions.

   -- Once the SSAS cubes are built by Kalido, they can be widely
      distributed throughout an organization and accessed even while
      disconnected from the server.

-- With this release, enterprises of all sizes can now seamlessly deploy a
   fully integrated, end-to-end business intelligence (BI) solution based
   on Microsoft and Kalido.

   -- Customers committed to a Microsoft strategy can develop a robust BI
      infrastructure using the Kalido Information Engine(TM)
      (http://www.kalido.com/products-for-business-kalido-inform.htm),
      including the Kalido Dynamic Information Warehouse and Kalido
      Universal Information Director, with Microsoft SQL Server database
      software, SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), and SSAS
      technologies.

-- This release complements the Kalido Dynamic Information Warehouse's
   current support for Microsoft Excel(R), making the information within the
   Kalido data warehouse even more widely available to users of Microsoft's
   BI tools.

    
Kalido Universal Information Director Highlights


-- First released in October 2007 (http://www.kalido.com/4f9276a4-8098-4094
   -885d-16005661a6f3/news-and-events-press-center-press-releases
   -detail.htm) as a key component of the Kalido Information Engine, the
   Kalido Universal Information Director seamlessly feeds data into BI
   reporting systems, eliminating manual integration efforts and speeding
   report updates.

-- The Kalido Universal Information Director uses a wizard-driven interface
   to build reports in such market-pervasive tools as Business Objects,
   Cognos and now Microsoft, thereby eliminating the need for costly and
   time-consuming metadata integration.

-- As a result, business analysts and executives will get their reports
   faster and with the added assurance that the reports are built on
   timely, accurate and consistent data.

    Quotes

Claudia Imhoff, president and founder of Intelligent Solutions, Inc. said:
-- "Even when companies 'standardize' on a single platform for business
   intelligence, they often still struggle to turn raw data from their
   myriad source systems into the accurate, consistent and timely data
   that BI tools need to deliver valuable insights. With this
   announcement, Kalido addresses this problem head on, giving Microsoft
   customers an integrated, end-to-end BI stack that enables business
   decision makers to secure better answers to their business questions."

Bill Hewitt, president and CEO of Kalido, said:
-- "While Microsoft Excel continues to be the most popular BI tool
   available for simple reporting and analysis, many organizations select
   Microsoft's more robust BI tools to institute a level of control and
   consistency in their reporting process. With our deep experience
   deploying Microsoft SQL/Server, coupled with this announcement, we will
   now deliver a fully integrated, end-to-end solution for the millions of
   Microsoft customers out there who need a more robust information
   management infrastructure to feed their Microsoft-based environments."

&lt;p&gt;July 15 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs added metals processor
Worthington Industries Inc (WOR.N) to its "conviction sell

commercial buildings markets and expected margin and earnings
deterioration in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe that Worthington will have difficulty passing
rising steel prices through to its auto and construction
customers," Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also lowered its price target on the stock to

&lt;p&gt;July 15 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs removed ATT Inc (T.N)
from its America's Conviction Buy List, saying a tough seasonal
second quarter and a negative trend in earnings per share
revisions could pressure the stock in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, which still keeps a "buy" rating on the stock,
lowered its 12-month price target by about 14 percent to $42.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although remaining confident in longer-term growth for the
company, Goldman said in a note to clients that in the near
term it sees further negative estimate revisions, as well as a
guarded tone on the upcoming second quarter earnings conference
call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said recent data points to
greater-than-expected pressure from the economy and wireless
competition, which has led it to lower 2008 earnings per share
estimate on the company to $3.01 from $3.10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of ATT, which Goldman said have declined 19.6
percent since it added the company to its Conviction Buy List
about a year back, closed at $32.37 Monday on the New York
Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;
COSTA MESA, Calif., July 15, 2008 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- Emulex Corporation
(NYSE:ELX) today announced that its LightPulse(r) 8Gb/s Fibre Channel host bus
adapters (HBAs) are now available with IBM System x servers.

The Emulex LightPulse HBAs provide System x clients with the increased
bandwidth, manageability and CPU efficiency required to support the increased
deployment of virtualized servers. IBM System x is a portfolio of robust servers
built on IBM X-Architecture(r) -- IBM's blueprint for bringing innovation to
Intel processor-based servers.

"Emulex has taken a leadership role in tandem with IBM to introduce greater
functionality and support for virtualization and blade server environments,"
said Mike Smith, executive vice president, worldwide marketing, Emulex
Corporation. "Incorporating Emulex 8Gb/s HBAs within IBM System x servers
provides customers with higher performance and throughput, enabling greater
scalability within virtualized server environments."

For example, Emulex recently teamed with IBM and Microsoft to enable a new
record-level Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC) benchmark. When
coupled with the IBM System x 3850 M2 server, the Emulex 8Gb/s HBAs produced a
14 percent increase in the total number of transactions performed per second
over a similar test conducted in 2007. This record-setting performance is a
direct result of the advanced features of Emulex 8Gb/s HBAs, including support
for Message-Signaled Interrupts eXtended (MSI-X), an interrupt handling
mechanism, which is ideal for transaction-intensive environments. For more
information on this TCP benchmark, visit:
http://www.emulex.com/press/2008/0318-01.jsp.

Additionally, the new Emulex LPe12000 family of 8Gb/s PCI Express HBAs offer
customers 37 percent greater transaction rates and 33 percent more effective CPU
utilization over competing 8Gb/s HBA products, providing the performance and
scalability necessary to support the growing number of applications running on
virtualized servers and blade servers.

Emulex's LPe12000 family of 8Gb/s HBAs also support Virtual HBA technology,
which allows users to effectively virtualize the HBA functionality so each
virtual machine running on a server can independently access its own protected
storage. Emulex Virtual HBA technology also allows customers to leverage SAN
management tools and best practices, such as fabric zoning and LUN
mapping/masking. For more information on the Emulex LPe12000 single-channel (IBM
42D0485) and LPe12002 dual-channel (IBM 42D0494) 8Gb/s Fibre Channel HBAs for
IBM System x servers, visit: http://www.emulex.com/ibm/index.jsp.

&lt;p&gt;
ALISO VIEJO, Calif., July 15, 2008 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- QLogic Corp.
(Nasdaq:QLGC), a leader in networking for storage and high performance computing
(HPC), today announced it is now shipping QLogic(r) 2500 Series 8Gb Fibre
Channel adapters for IBM System x servers. The 2500 Series host bus adapters
(HBAs) are key contributors to a "greener" data center and are set apart from
all other 8Gb HBAs with Dynamic Power Management and Cool HBA(tm) technologies
-- two breakthrough innovations developed under the QLogic Star Power Green
Initiative.

Dynamic Power Management gives the QLogic 2500 the unique ability to sense the
type of PCI Express bus that is present and consume only the amount of power
necessary to run at full speed. QLogic Cool HBA technology allows QLogic
products like the QLogic 2500 Series HBAs to operate up to 55 degrees centigrade
without any air flow, unlike competitive products which require fans in order to
run cool.

IBM System x is a portfolio of robust servers built on IBM X-Architecture(r) --
IBM's blueprint for bringing innovation to Intel processor-based servers.

"Data center administrators are asking for high performance networks that are
also energy efficient," said Amit Vashi, vice president of marketing, QLogic
Host Solutions Group. "QLogic 2500 Series HBAs respond with powerful 8Gb
performance while reducing the amount of power and cooling required for
connecting servers to a SAN. We believe these will enhance IBM's already energy
efficient System x servers."

QLogic 2500 Series HBAs -- Transforming Server Connectivity into Competitive
Advantage

The QLogic 2500 Series is a family of 8Gb Fibre Channel-to-PCIe Gen2 adapters
designed for next generation virtualized data centers with powerful
multi-processor, multi-core servers. QLogic 2500 Series adapters are optimized
for virtualization, power, RAS (reliability, availability, serviceability),
security and management to transform server connectivity into competitive
advantage. QLogic 2500 Series adapters also provide complete investment
protection by maintaining backward compatibility with previous Fibre Channel
network and PCIe host bus speeds.

&lt;p&gt;Disney Interactive Studios Continues Commitment to Create High Quality Games for a Broad Audience at E3 Media &amp; Business Summit 2008

   New video games to provide innovative and engaging entertainment
  for all members of the family leveraging both Disney franchises and
            original titles such as Pure and Ultimate Band
LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
Disney Interactive Studios announced today its lineup of upcoming
video games that will be on display at the E3 Media &amp; Business Summit
2008, July 15-17. The lineup includes titles across the major console
and handheld platforms that appeal to every member of the family,
whether they are putting on the ultimate rock performance or pulling
off death-defying aerial tricks while soaring over huge peaks on a
four-wheel vehicle. The complete lineup of video games can be viewed
during the show in Meeting Room # 309. The E3 Media &amp; Business Summit
is an invitation-only industry event.

   "The notion that video games only appeal to a small subset of
consumers is long gone, and the demand for titles that reach every
member of the family is rapidly increasing," said Graham Hopper,
executive vice president and general manager, Disney Interactive
Studios. "Whether leveraging popular Disney franchises such as High
School Musical and Disney Fairies, or through innovative new
properties such as Ultimate Band and Pure, Disney Interactive Studios
is the leader in delivering broad appeal entertainment."

   Disney Interactive Studios' legacy of developing high quality
video games stems from a long-standing commitment to grow its
self-publishing business. During its 2007 calendar year, Disney
Interactive Studios was the No.10 publisher across all video game
platforms.

   With a significant commitment to product development, the company
is continuing its strategy to dedicate nearly 70 percent of its
investment to develop titles that support major existing Disney
franchises and properties. This approach has proven to be extremely
successful in recent years, most notably for titles within the High
School Musical franchise. During the 2007 holiday season, the company
shipped more than 3.8 million copies of the widely popular High School
Musical video games worldwide, achieving Top 20 positions on each
published platform for the month of December 2007, according to NPD
data. This holiday season, Disney Interactive Studios will deliver
videogames that continue to support the High School Musical brand, as
well as the new Disney Fairies and Disney Sing It franchises and Bolt,
a game inspired by the upcoming animated feature film.

   Disney Interactive Studios' also continues to develop original
video games that leverage the talent and expertise of its internal
studios. This holiday season alone, Disney Interactive Studios will
release three original titles for tweens and families across multiple
genres and platforms. Fall Line Studio, the company's Nintendo
Platform-dedicated entity, is developing Ultimate Band, a music
performance game for Wii(TM) home video game console and Nintendo
DS(TM). The studio also created the innovative DGamer online
community that launched earlier this year on Nintendo DS. Black Rock
Studio, formerly Climax Racing, is working on the much anticipated
action sports off-road game, Pure for the Xbox 360(R) video game and
entertainment system from Microsoft, PLAYSTATION(R)3 computer
entertainment system, and Windows-based PC. Finally, Disney
Interactive Studios will release the next installment in the popular
anime-inspired Spectrobes franchise, Spectrobes: Beyond The Portals
for Nintendo DS.

&lt;p&gt;Zacks Analyst Interview Highlights: Noble Energy, Occidental Petroleum, Exxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com releases the latest Analyst Interview. Today's interview
is with Director of Zacks Equity Research Dirk van Dijk, who discusses
Noble Energy (NYSE: NBL), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY), Exxon
(NYSE: XOM), Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP).

   Looking toward second quarter numbers, in which industries do you
see particular strength?

   Energy is currently expected to win the growth derby - not exactly
a shocking idea with oil currently hovering in the $140 a barrel area.
Perhaps the bigger question is: Why isn't the expected growth rate
much higher than it is?

   After all, the price of crude has just about doubled since this
time last year. Since it cost them something to get the oil out of the
ground last year one would expect that gross profits would more than
double as a result. The 30.0% year-over-year growth in EPS for the
sector looks very conservative to me.

   So would you say that near-term investors should stay overweighted
in energy stocks?

   Energy was far and away the strongest sector, with almost four
increases for every cut. While estimate increases were widespread in
the sector, firms worth highlighting would include Noble Energy (NYSE:
NBL) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). From a total economic
impact point of view, significant increases were also seen for all of
the big three, Exxon (NYSE: XOM), Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and
ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP).

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A long-rumored tie-up between online movie rental company Netflix Inc and Microsoft Corp to let Netflix subscribers watch streamed movies and TV shows on Xbox 360 game consoles will become a reality this fall, the companies said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service, expected to launch as a software upgrade for the Xbox 360, will be offered at no additional cost to Netflix subscribers who also hold Xbox 360 Live Gold memberships, the companies said at the E3 Media and Business Summit in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XBox users will be able to access more than 10,000 Netflix titles now available as part of a feature called "Watch Instantly" that Netflix launched in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Netflix announced two other partnerships with set top box makers -- Roku and LG Electronics Inc -- in its quest to bring streamed content from its Web-based catalog to the television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $100 Netflix Player by Roku sold out its first shipment within weeks of its launch earlier this year. The LG box is expected to be available in the second half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rumors of a partnership with Microsoft have swirled in the blogosphere since last year, when Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings joined Microsoft's board of directors and Netflix began surveying subscribers about their interest in accessing movies through an Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix has more than 8.2 million subscribers. Microsoft has sold more than 10 million Xbox consoles and offers limited movie rental through its Xbox Live subscription service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear on Monday how many Netflix subscribers own Xbox 360s and have Xbox Live Gold memberships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Netflix were up 90 cents, or 3.3 percent, at $28.11 in afternoon Nasdaq trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gina Keating; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ABUJA, July 15 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Chevron (CVX.N)
said on Tuesday production has been restored at its
120,000-barrel per day Escravos crude oil pipeline in Nigeria,
nearly a month after armed youths sabotaged it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The pipeline is back into service and production is
restored," said Chevron spokeswoman Margaret Cooper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gunmen in June sabotaged Chevron's Abiteye-Olero crude oil
pipeline in the country's restive Niger Delta, slashing output
in the world's eighth largest exporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron was forced to declare a force majeure on Escravos
shipments following the attack, which released the company from
its contractual obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A wave of attacks in the West African country has cut
production by a fifth since early 2006, helping push world oil
prices to record highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Violence in the Niger Delta stems from a complex set of
factors including poverty, lack of basic services, corruption
among government officials and security forces, resentment
toward foreign oil companies, and political thuggery.

&lt;p&gt;Inetium Helps Customers with the Upcoming Release of Microsoft Essential Business Server 2008 Implementations

MINNEAPOLIS--(Business Wire)--
Inetium, a leading Microsoft Gold Certified partner, announces its
Accelerated Deployment Program for Microsoft Essential Business Server
2008. As Microsoft launches this new product in the fall of 2008,
Inetium has developed a program to help organizations get started
quickly and more effectively. This product targets organizations with
approximately 75 to 250 users, a customer segment Inetium is familiar
with due to over 200 Microsoft Small Business Server (SBS)
implementations it has conducted over the course of the past four
years.

   "The Microsoft Essential Business Server is an exciting product
for organizations that have either outgrown their Microsoft Small
Business Server implementation or are looking to deploy Microsoft
Exchange2007 in their environment," states Ryan Toenies, VP of CRM and
Infrastructure at Inetium. "Companies are looking for efficiencies
with technology investments. This new product along with our
deployment offering will allow organizations to optimize their
technical infrastructure with a simpler, cost effective solution."

   Essential Business Server combines software for management,
messaging and security features into one integrated server solution
that dramatically reduces IT complexity and improves efficiency across
the business, putting IT in control. By combining Microsoft
technologies such as Windows Server 2008, Exchange Server 2007, SQL
Server 2008 and other Microsoft products and services, these solutions
make the benefits of enterprise-class IT accessible, affordable and
simpler for smaller organizations.

   Inetium has had early access to this product through two exclusive
initiatives including participation in a Microsoft-sponsored Essential
Business Server 2008 Technology Adoption Program and an Advisory
Council on Microsoft Essential Business Server 2008. Inetium is
well-positioned to provide customers with early and deep expertise on
the product. Inetium's Microsoft Essential Business Server 2008
Accelerated Deployment Program so that companies can:

   --  Quickly assess the migration path from their current
        environment to Microsoft Essential Business Server

   --  Get their new environment operational more quickly by
        leveraging Inetium's experience

   --  Increase understanding and acceptance of the server solution
        through tailored training

   The Five Step Program:

   Step one - Discovery. Inetium will talk to key technical business
users to understand their current technical infrastructure and
requirements.

   Step two - System Design. Using the information uncovered and
documented in the Discovery phase, Inetium will design the new
environment for the Microsoft Essential Business Server 2008.

   Step three - System Implementation. Inetium will install and
configure all settings on the server as agreed to the System Design.
This would include email, database, security and networking scenarios.

   Step four - System Review. Before going live, Inetium will meet
with the client to review the Microsoft Essential Business Server 2008
configuration and finalize deliverables.

   Step five - Training and Go Live. Inetium will train technical
resources to ensure a complete understanding of the new implementation
to ensure the client's successful independent management.

   Inetium has used this methodology successfully with hundreds of
clients on various technologies in the past five years.

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats to fix typographical error in first paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 16 (Reuters) - Although the worst of the
credit crisis scarred reputations and frayed relationships
between traders and dealers of fixed-income securities,
JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc
LEH.N  kept their clients happiest, a study said on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the largest players, the two institutions scored
highest in providing their clients the best support and
understanding during the market turmoil, the survey of U.S.
institutional investors by Greenwich Associates found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banc of America also did well in the survey conducted
between February and April -- encompassing the build-up of the
crisis that began in the U.S. subprime mortgage market and
spread to global financial firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The findings from this year's research suggest that
dealers' decisions about the level of support they would
provide to clients have had a dramatic impact on the overall
reputation of sell-side firms among institutions," the report
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan was found to have slightly more institutional
trading relationships, while Lehman Brothers had slightly more
market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The study -- which interviewed 1,246 institutions active in
the U.S. fixed income market -- also noted that investors grew
increasingly concerned about liquidity risk and the solvency of
their counterparties as the crisis escalated.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW ORLEANS, LA, Jul 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Master P and Romeo took to the stage to empower thousands of excited and
eager local youth at the Essence Music Festival in New Orleans. The
father/son duo returned to their hometown, not to perform their music at
the festival, but rather to give back to their community through their
message of change, education, hard work and following one's dreams.

    While addressing the crowd, many of whom had lined up hours before their
arrival, Master P and Romeo emphasized the importance of education and
vision as tools for inner-city kids to overcome the extreme challenges
they face in daily life. They conveyed the need for youth to set goals,
follow their dreams, and resist the temptations of drugs and violence.

    As a former resident of New Orleans' notorious Calliope Projects, Master P
stood before the audience as a living example of how one can break free
from the confines of a negative environment and become a successful role
model for others. He now counts promoting education, financial literacy
and aiding underprivileged children among his responsibilities. Romeo then
spoke about his commitment to schooling and his choice to place his
entertainment career on hold in order to attend the University of Southern
California as a student athlete.

    Powerful brands such as Coca-Cola and Wal-Mart joined Master P and Romeo
in supporting the Essence Music Festival. Together, the sponsors,
speakers, and entertainers pledged to continue the rebuilding efforts
after the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina. The community finds
itself at the mercy of a high crime rate and lack of education, which
Master P and Romeo seek to rectify through their inspirational messages
and actions.

    "New Orleans is my home, it's where I was born and raised," said Master P.
"I was able to overcome an environment filled with poverty, drugs, and
violence through education, setting goals, and dreaming big. I understand
the financial struggles faced by inner-city families, so I created high
fashion clothing at affordable prices that will be available at Wal-Mart
in August for back-to-school season. I look forward to coming back to
Essence year after year to empower our youth and watch my people grow."

&lt;p&gt;NRF Urges Committee to Approve Legislation Requiring Visa/MasterCard to Negotiate Over Hidden Credit Card Fee

WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
The National Retail Federation urged the House Judiciary Committee
to approve legislation scheduled for a vote today that would require
Visa and MasterCard to negotiate over a hidden credit card fee that
costs the average family more than $400 a year.

   "At a time when Americans are struggling to pay for groceries and
to fill the gas tank, doing something about a hidden fee that drives
up the cost of basic necessities should be one of Congress' top
priorities," NRF Senior Vice President for Government Relations Steve
Pfister said. "This legislation is a sensible solution to an
escalating problem that's costing consumers more every day."

   "In a functional market, one would expect that the cost of
accepting credit cards would decrease over time as transaction volumes
increase, fraud risks go down and technology improves, but interchange
fees continue to skyrocket," Pfister said. "Credit card companies
continue to impose these fees on retailers and consumers on a
take-it-or-leave-it basis while pretending that they're no different
than any other cost of doing business. If they really aren't any
different, then they should be subject to fair and open negotiation
like any other cost."

   The Judiciary Committee is scheduled to consider H.R. 5546, the
Credit Card Fair Fee Act of 2008, during a voting session this
morning. Sponsored by Chairman John Conyers, D-Mich., and committee
member Representative Chris Cannon, R-Utah, the bill would require
credit card systems possessing "substantial market power" to negotiate
with merchants to reach a voluntary agreement on credit card terms and
conditions. If an agreement could not be reached, both sides would be
required to submit their final offers to binding arbitration by a
panel of antitrust experts appointed by the Department of Justice and
Federal Trade Commission.

   At issue is credit card "interchange," a non-negotiable fee
averaging close to 2 percent that Visa and MasterCard banks charge
merchants every time a credit card or signature debit card is used to
pay for a transaction. Visa and MasterCard effectively force merchants
to pass the fees on to consumers by requiring them to be included in
the advertised price of items and making cash discounts difficult. But
interchange is largely unknown to most consumers because Visa and
MasterCard keep merchants from disclosing it on receipts and don't
disclose the fee on monthly statements.

   Unlike other vendors who provide services to retailers, Visa and
MasterCard refuse to negotiate over the fees regardless of the size of
the merchant. NRF has argued that interchange practices violate
antitrust law because banks issuing the cards agree to charge the same
rates.

   According to NRF estimates, the average U.S. family will pay $427
in hidden credit card interchange fees in 2008, up from $378 in 2007.
The amount has nearly tripled from the $159 paid in 2001, the year NRF
began tracking interchange. Total interchange collections are
projected at $48 billion this year, up from $42 billion last year and
$16.6 billion in 2001.

   The National Retail Federation is the world's largest retail trade
association, with membership that comprises all retail formats and
channels of distribution including department, specialty, discount,
catalog, Internet, independent stores, chain restaurants, drug stores
and grocery stores as well as the industry's key trading partners of
retail goods and services. NRF represents an industry with more than
1.6 million U.S. retail companies, more than 25 million employees -
about one in five American workers - and 2007 sales of $4.5 trillion.
As the industry umbrella group, NRF also represents over 100 state,
national and international retail associations. www.nrf.com

                 Competency in ISV/Software Solutions
INDIANAPOLIS--(Business Wire)--
ExactTarget today announced it has attained Gold Certified Partner
status in the Microsoft Partner Program with a competency in
ISV/Software Solutions, recognizing ExactTarget's expertise and impact
in the technology marketplace. As a Gold Certified Partner,
ExactTarget has demonstrated expertise with Microsoft technologies and
a proven ability to meet customers' needs. Microsoft Gold Certified
Partners receive a rich set of benefits, including access, training
and support, giving them a competitive advantage in the channel.

   ExactTarget helps clients increase sales, optimize marketing
investments and strengthen relationships through integrated, on-demand
software that powers permission-based email marketing, mobile
messaging and one-to-one communications.

   "We are extremely pleased to have attained Gold Certified Partner
status in the Microsoft Partner Program. This allows us to clearly
promote our expertise and relationship with Microsoft to our

partnerships for ExactTarget. "The benefits provided through our Gold
Certified Partner status will allow us to continue to enhance the

   "Customers are looking for partner companies that can bridge the

Microsoft Gold Certified Partners, which have certified expertise and

resources that support that specific area of focus.

   The ISV/Software Solutions Competency recognizes the skill and
focus partners bring to a particular solution set. Microsoft Gold
Certified Partners that have obtained this competency have a
successful record of developing and marketing packed software based on
Microsoft technologies.

   "Solutions competencies are an important way for Microsoft to
better enable ISVs to meet customer needs," said Sanjay Parthasarathy,
corporate vice president of the Developer and Platform Evangelism
Group at Microsoft Corp. "They allow ISVs to keep and win customers

our mutual customers, and the Microsoft Competencies are an important
step in continuing to enhance vital relationships with ISVs
worldwide."

represents Microsoft's ongoing commitment to the success of partners
worldwide. The program offers a single, integrated partnering

&lt;p&gt;Response Point Service Pack 1 Pre-Configured with Cbeyond
                        Simplifies Installation
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Cbeyond(R), Inc. (NASDAQ: CBEY), a leading IP-based managed
services provider to small businesses, today announced the
availability of its BeyondVoice(R) with SIPconnect service
pre-configured on the Microsoft Response Point IP-based phone system.
BeyondVoice with SIPconnect helps to simplify the installation of
services for small businesses using Response Point Service Pack 1,
which is now generally available.

   "We selected Cbeyond as a preferred provider because of its
high-quality service," said Xuedong Huang, general manager of
Microsoft Response Point. "Combining Cbeyond's service with the

   Cbeyond's BeyondVoice with SIPconnect service is an integrated
package of local and long distance voice, high speed Internet and
mobile services that leverages the SIPconnect specification to
interoperate with IP-PBX phone systems, like Microsoft Response Point.

   Cbeyond helped to pioneer the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
trunking industry standard, called SIPconnect(R), which institutes a
common protocol among digital voice providers worldwide. SIPconnect
eliminates the need for a VoIP gateway on the premise, improves voice
quality and creates a strong foundation for personalized applications
and rich media services. Microsoft Response Point customers using
Cbeyond's service will be able to take advantage of digital voice
service based on SIPconnect.

   "Our strategic alliance with Microsoft allows us to provide a
complete solution to our joint customers that is both reliable and
cost effective," said Rob Consolazio, vice president of Marketing and
Business Development for Cbeyond. "By leveraging the tried and tested
SIPconnect specification for full featured telephony, small businesses
can take advantage of extensive calling features provided by service
providers such as Cbeyond who have a reputation for delivering premium
customer service."

   Cbeyond channel partners selling the combined solution are able to
take advantage of Cbeyond's generous compensation plans and have
access to extensive training and resources. Through Cbeyond
PartnerAccess (cbeyondpartners.net) the company's channel partners can
manage their customer accounts, download sales collateral, create
on-demand marketing materials, view account reports, and peruse
product information at their convenience.

   "With the combined Microsoft and Cbeyond solution we can quickly
configure and install an IP-based phone system to our small business
customers," said Olivier Havette, Cbeyond channel partner, Microsoft
Gold Certified partner, and CEO of The Net Doctor. "The ease-of-use
and service reliability offers our customers a complete solution that
is cost effective and reliable."

   Earlier this year, Cbeyond fortified its relationship with
Microsoft by integrating the Hosted Microsoft Exchange solution into
its service offering, which is the first hosted service based on
Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 that is fully integrated with mobile
access from a single provider. For more information about Cbeyond and
its small business communications services, visit www.cbeyond.net.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 16 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded
Chicago Bridge  Iron Co (CBI.N) to "neutral" from
"overweight," on concerns that the engineering, procurement and
construction company could take further charges related to its
liquefied natural gas projects in Great Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cost overruns of $317 million on two terminal projects
forced the company to lower its 2008 earnings forecast to the
range of 40 cents to 60 cents a share, from its earlier view of
$2.40 to $2.65 a share, analyst Scott Levine wrote in a note to
clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Levine said there was a formidable risk of further charges,
and that this risk could last until early 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst, however, said strong second-half bookings and
the resolution of a U.S. Federal Trade Commission dispute would
augment positive trends taking place outside Great Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs also downgraded the stock to "neutral" from
"buy" and removed it from ts Americas Buy List, mainly citing
nagging execution risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman lowered its six-month price target to $34 from $48.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company closed at $36.39 Tuesday on the New
York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;July 16 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded T.W.
Telecom (TWTC.O) to "underweight" from "overweight", saying
enterprise trends are deteriorating in the struggling economy
and could have an impact on the company's core business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With more than 71 percent of revenue from enterprise
customers, T.W. Telecom is the most exposed company in its
coverage universe, the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan said its recent channel checks suggest that
contract negotiations may be extending longer than in the past,
reflecting lengthening sales cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the brokerage said it has not seen evidence that
overall spending is slowing, it believes enterprises may be
delaying decisions given the uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan also removed its December 2008 price target of
$25 a share for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the business Ethernet service provider have
fallen more than 25 percent year-to-date. The brokerage expects
a further drop in the shares due to lag in signs of economic
stabilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of T.W. Telecom closed at $14.74 Tuesday on the
Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) has been questioned by chiefs of rivals Bear Stearns Cos and Lehman Brothers LEH.N about speculation that the securities firm had a role in putting pressure on their firms' stocks, the Wall Street Journal said on Wednesday citing people familiar with their talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alan Schwartz, who headed Bear Stearns when it collapsed in March, has asked Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein whether there was any truth to talk that in the days preceding Bear Stearns's fall, traders in Goldman's London office manipulated the struggling firm's stock, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers CEO Richard Fuld Jr., whose firm's shares also have been battered, has also spoken with Blankfein. The Lehman chief also contacted traders he felt may have been bad-mouthing his stock, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spreading rumors one knows to be false with the intention of manipulating a public company's price is illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been investigating whether investors have looked to profit by spreading rumors to push down Lehman and Bear shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which strongly denied wrongdoing, never altered its terms for doing business with Bear even as lenders pulled their financing and some trading partners retreated during the troubled securities firm's struggles in early March, the paper said citing a Goldman spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) acquired Bear Stearns for a fire-sale price, after the latter collapsed under the weight of the credit crisis and suffered the equivalent of a bank run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the weeks before Bear reached its initial deal to sell itself, Goldman Sachs International, which encompasses the firm's European trading units, was one of the most-active parties in trading securities known as credit default swaps that it had bought from or sold to Bear, the paper said citing trading documents involved in a regulatory probe into the collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The documents show that a handful of other prominent firms cut their exposures to Bear Stearns, including Chicago hedge fund Citadel Investment Group and New York hedge fund Paulson  Co., which is run by a Bear Stearns alumnus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, Lehman, Citadel and Paulson could not be immediately reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Dhanya Skariachan in Bangalore;; Editing by Erica Billingham)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 16 (Reuters) - U.S. securities regulators subpoenaed
firms including Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Goldman Sachs (GS.N)
and Merrill Lynch MER.N as it probes suspected manipulation of
Lehman Brothers LEH.N and Bear Stearns shares, Bloomberg said,
citing two people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

Bear Stearns and for the significant slide in Lehman shares this
month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With financial stocks dropping dramatically over the year,
lawmakers have been calling on the SEC to investigate whether
short sellers and speculators are behind the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over the weekend, the SEC announced plans to crack down on
false rumours and said it was examining whether broker dealers
and investment advisers had controls in place to prevent market
manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deutsche, Goldman, Merrill and SEC officials could not be

&lt;p&gt; (Adds background, recasts headline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Kenneth Li&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 15 (Reuters) - Time Warner Inc's (TWX.N)
discussions to merge or sell its AOL Internet division with
Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) or Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) have taken on new
urgency ahead of Yahoo's Aug 1 shareholders meeting, a source
familiar with the discussions told Reuters on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The structure of any deal is not immediately clear, though
a combination of any of the parties is expected to redraw the
landscape for advertising on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources had said earlier that a deal with Yahoo would
likely involve merging AOL with the Web pioneer, with Time
Warner taking a minority stake in the combined company. A deal
with Microsoft would likely be a sale of AOL, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Time Warner and Microsoft declined comment. A
representatives of Yahoo was not immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Time Warner's talks come after Microsoft's buyout talks
with Yahoo fell apart, with Microsoft withdrawing its $47.5
billion bid in May. Since then the two have waged a public war
of words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Discussions with Time Warner have accelerated as both Yahoo
and Microsoft view AOL as potentially beneficial to leverage
their positions in the Internet marketplace, where Google Inc
dominates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AOL plans to split its dial-up Internet business and has
focused on building a one-stop online advertising shop over the
past two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo's interest in AOL is designed to show shareholders
that it could grow without Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo needs to be convincing because it faces a proxy
battle against activist investor Carl Icahn on Aug 1. Icahn,
who owns about 5 percent of Yahoo shares, has aligned himself
with Microsoft, and seeks to replace Yahoo's board and oust CEO
Jerry Yang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn this week said he and Microsoft had structured a deal
to buy out Yahoo's search advertising business that would have
guaranteed Yahoo $2.3 billion in search revenue annually for up
to 10 years assuming Yahoo's audience remained intact and the
parties renewed after five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Microsoft's interest in acquiring AOL would serve to bulk
up its display advertising business as well as gain more
traffic to weaken Yahoo's and Google's position. The software
company also needs to convince shareholders it has an Internet
strategy independent of its so far unsuccessful pursuit of a
Yahoo takeover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo rejected the Icahn/Microsoft deal over the weekend
and has said it remained open to a full buyout of the company
at $33 per share, Microsoft's last offer before walking away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has said it would only strike a deal to buy
Yahoo's search business or the entire company if Yahoo's board
was replaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since Microsoft walked away from it initial bid to buy
Yahoo, Yahoo has separately struck a nonexclusive search
advertising deal with Google Inc, which is currently under
review by U.S. regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Meanwhile, Time Warner is shopping AOL as part of a
strategy to realign its business to focus on content, not
distribution. It plans to complete a deal to separate from its
Time Warner Cable (TWC.N) by the end of the year.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) reported a 22 percent rise 
in quarterly profit, blowing past Wall Street targets and 
raising its 2008 forecast, as emerging markets used its 
services, software and equipment to expand, and larger 
countries turned to technology to save money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; IBM posted a 12 percent rise in service contract signings, 
a business in which it leads the world, and said major Western 
countries were buying technology to reduce costs, as well as 
manage risks and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results were much sunnier than those posted by Google 
Inc (GOOG.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), which both missed 
analysts' targets, with the software maker citing a tough U.S. 
economy and Google blaming lower returns managing its cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge told a 
conference call that U.S. revenue grew 5 percent in the 
quarter, the weak dollar helped IBM and that currency hedges 
would help it mitigate any strengthening of the dollar next 
year. It was difficult not to say IBM was ahead on reaching its 
2010 profit target, he concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company is widely seen as a defensive play for 
investors in a troubled market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Once again pretty impressive," said Zach Rosenstock, an 
analyst at Wayne Hummer Wealth Management. "They're focusing 
outside the U.S. to ride through the domestic downturn."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp said second-quarter 
net income rose to $2.77 billion, or $1.98 per share, from 
$2.26 billion, or $1.55 per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue rose 13 percent to $26.8 billion. Currency gains 
added 7 percentage points to the growth rate, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts, on average, expected profit of $1.82 per share 
and revenue of $25.92 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But shares sagged slightly in after-hours trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Google number may cast a shadow on this stock," Fifth 
Third Asset Management Chief Investment Officer Keith Wirtz 
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM raised its 2008 earnings per share forecast to at least 
$8.75 from a previous outlook of at least $8.50 a share, taking 
it ahead of the Wall Street average view of $8.54 per share.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BUYER CONFIDENCE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Armonk, New York-based IBM gets about two-thirds of its 
revenue from outside the United States. Recurring revenue from 
services and software contracts accounts for about half its 
business, providing a buffer from sharp turns in the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New signings in the quarter rose 12 percent to $14.7 
billion. Loughridge said in an interview that he expects them 
to grow at a similar rate in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also said that corporate scrutiny of purchases has not 
increased over the past six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Did we see in the second half of 2007 a lengthening of the 
approval process, more layers of approval? Sure we did," he 
said. "Do I think that's gotten to be more restrictive as we 
have gone through the first and second quarter? I don't think 
so."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue from IBM's Global Technology Services business - 
which includes outsourcing, security and maintenance - rose 15 
percent to $10.1 billion. Revenue at IBM's Global Business 
Services, which does consulting and software development, rose 
18 percent to $5.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daniel Genter, chief investment officer of RNC Genter 
Capital Management, said that strong services growth showed 
IBM's customers are relatively confident about the economic 
outlook because they are willing to make new investments in 
technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What we are seeing is that they are not cutting back on IT 
spending," said Genter, whose firm holds about 500,000 IBM 
shares and manages a $2.8 billion portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Armonk, New York-based company's sluggish hardware 
business got a boost thanks to the February launch of a new 
line of mainframe computers, its first upgrade in almost three 
years. Mainframe revenue rose 32 percent, helping push hardware 
revenue up 2 percent to $5.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue from software, IBM's most profitable business, 
climbed 17 percent to $5.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Due to its stability, many investors view IBM shares as a 
safe haven in tough economic times. The stock has risen about 
17 percent this year, compared with a 15 percent decline in the 
Dow Jones Industrial index .DJI and a 14 percent drop in the 
Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM trades at about 13 times next year's expected earnings 
per share, compared with about 11 for rival Hewlett-Packard Co&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (HPQ.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM posted strong revenue in the United States and the rest 
of the Americas region even as the economy slowed due to the 
banking crisis and slowdown in construction and retail sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue in the Americas region rose 8 percent to $10.9 
billion. Growth was 6 percent after currency adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue from Europe, the Middle East and Africa rose 20

adjustments. IBM's revenue in Asia rose 16 percent, or 6 
percent after currency adjustments, to $5.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Income from continuing operations rose 22 percent to $2.8 
billion. The year-earlier results included a gain from the sale 
of a printing unit that the company has since divested. Without

26 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM shares fell to $126.12 in-after hours trading after

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) posted a quarterly profit and outlook below Wall Street expectations on Thursday, citing "tough" economic conditions, and its shares fell 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software maker, which is locked in an on-again, off-again pursuit of Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), said its current-quarter forecast factors in difficult economic conditions continuing for the remainder of 2008 before some improvement in the first half of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's what I would describe as a tough environment. It's clear other companies around us are suffering," Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said in an interview with Reuters. "It hasn't hurt us significantly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, for the current quarter, Microsoft forecast earnings per share to range from 47 cents to 48 cents on revenue between $14.7 billion and $14.9 billion, below Wall Street forecasts on average of 50 cents per share in earnings on $15.06 billion in revenue, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker has weathered a soft U.S. economy by ramping up sales to emerging markets and offering a diverse set of products aimed at corporate customers and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andy Miedler, analyst at Edward Jones, said Microsoft is not immune from the challenging economic conditions and that it was reasonable for the company to scale down its forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Particularly hard-hit by the weak U.S. economy, according to Liddell, is online advertising, a business in which Microsoft is already trailing rival Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The search leader also reported quarterly earnings on Thursday, saying its online advertising business has held up well despite weak economic conditions. It reported a weaker-than-expected 35 percent rise in quarterly profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft sees an acquisition of part or all of Yahoo as a way to strengthen its position in the advertising business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company confirmed details of its latest proposal, revealed earlier this week by investor Carl Icahn, to buy the Web company's search business. The proposal included $19.5 billion to $26.5 billion in revenue guarantees over 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We clearly continue to believe that our proposal is a compelling one," Liddell said on a conference call with analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, also said it plans to invest an additional $500 million in its online strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MISS IN THE QUARTER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its fiscal fourth quarter ended June, Microsoft reported a net profit of $4.3 billion, or 46 cents per diluted share, up from a profit of $3.04 billion, or 31 cents per diluted share, in the year-ago period. Revenue rose 18 percent to $15.84 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earnings were a penny per share below the average analyst forecast of 47 cents per share, but the revenue beat their forecast of $15.65 billion in the June quarter, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Liddell cited a 15 percent rise in hiring expenses during the quarter as one factor for coming in below Wall Street expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software maker was aided by strong demand for Windows 2008, the flagship software at its server and tools division. Customers signed up for long-term contracts for new software and revenue at the division rose 21 percent from a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's main Windows division bounced back with a strong quarter, posting a 15 percent increase in revenue, helped by adoption of its new Vista operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unit's performance was a disappointment last quarter when revenue came in lower than expected from an inventory build-up of computers and a lack of progress in fighting piracy. The inventory build-up was resolved, according to Liddell, and 180 million Vista licenses have now been sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft forecast Windows division revenue to grow between 9 percent and 10 percent this fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quarterly profit growth looked even bigger due to a $1.06 billion charge that Microsoft incurred during last year's June quarter to fix problems with its Xbox 360 game console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The online division posted an eighth straight quarter of decline with an operating loss of $488 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The online services business is on everyone's mind," said Sid Parakh, analyst at McAdams, Wright, Ragen. "It's back and forth with Yahoo and Microsoft every day. That's distracting for investors and employees and even advertisers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Microsoft went public with its unsolicited bid to buy Yahoo on February 1, the stock is down 16 percent, as of the close of trade on Thursday, versus a 9 percent slide in the SP 500.

&lt;p&gt; By Daisuke Wakabayashi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, July 17 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
posted a quarterly profit and outlook below Wall Street
expectations on Thursday, citing "tough" economic conditions,
and its shares fell 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The software maker, which is locked in an on-again,
off-again pursuit of Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), said its
current-quarter forecast factors in difficult economic

reported a net profit of $4.3 billion, or 46 cents per diluted

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, July 17 (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster
Televisa posted a surprise 8.6 percent decrease in second
quarter net majority profit on Thursday, hurt by expenses
related to one of the company's television stations in San
Diego, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grupo Televisa (TV.N) (TLVACPO.MX) earned 1.841 billion
pesos ($179 million) in the April-June period compared with
2.013 billion pesos in the same quarter of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The net fall reflected an impairment adjustment to reduce
the carrying value of goodwill related to the operations of the
San Diego station, the company said in a release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Legal fees from Televisa's ongoing court battle with U.S.
partner Univision Communications also hurt results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts in a Reuters survey were expecting a quarterly net
profit of 2.147 billion pesos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net sales rose 17 percent to 11.504 billion pesos, getting
a big boost from its pay television units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa's cable unit Cablevision (CABLECPO.MX) posted a 20
percent rise in quarterly sales. The subsidiary also benefited
from the consolidation of Cablemas and Bestel, two cable
companies that the broadcaster bought over the past 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Direct-to-home satellite television provider SKY also had
good quarterly results thanks to a broader subscriber base in
Mexico, Central America and the Dominican Republic. Televisa
will launch this service in Panama in the second half of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Core broadcast television sales rose 7.5 percent to 5.291
billion pesos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa maintained its 2008 outlook of broadcast
television sales and net profit growth of about 4.5 percent in
nominal terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's shares in Mexico gained 5.01 percent to close
at 48.40 pesos on Thursday, before results were disclosed. Its
New York-traded stock jumped 6.74 percent to $23.91.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($10.3070 as of end June)

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - IBM reported a 22 percent rise in quarterly profit, blowing past Wall Street targets and raising its 2008 forecast, as emerging markets used its services, software and equipment to expand and larger countries turned to technology to save money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM posted a 12 percent rise in service contract signings, a business in which it leads the world, and said major Western countries were buying technology to reduce costs, as well as manage risks and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were much sunnier than those posted by Google Inc and Microsoft Corp, which both missed analysts' targets, with the software maker citing a tough U.S. economy and Google blaming expenses for foreign currency hedges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge told a conference call U.S. business grew in the quarter, the weak dollar helped IBM and that currency hedges would help it mitigate any strengthening of the dollar next year.

That they are maintaining and increasing in what would be the discretionary part of IT (information technology) spending," said Genter, whose firm holds about 500,000 IBM shares and manages $2.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to its stability, many investors view IBM shares as a safe haven in tough economic times. The stock has risen about 17 percent this year, compared with a 15 percent decline in the Dow Jones Industrial index and a 14 percent drop in the Nasdaq Composite Index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM trades at about 13 times next year's expected earnings per share, compared with about 11 for rival Hewlett-Packard Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM managed to post strong sales in the United States and the rest of the Americas region even as the economy slowed due to the banking crisis and slowdown in construction and retail sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales in the Americas region rose 8 percent to $10.9 billion. Growth was 6 percent after currency adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from Europe, the Middle East and Africa rose 20 percent to $9.8 billion, or 7 percent after currency adjustments.

Without that gain, income from continuing operations would have been up 26 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares fell to $126 in-after hours trading after initially rising about 2 percent from the New York Stock Exchange close of $126.52.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle, Peter Henderson and Sue Zeidler, editing by Phil Berlowitz and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

services and software contracts accounts for about half its
business, providing a buffer from sharp turns in the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New signings in the quarter reached $14.7 billion, compared
with the $10.6 billion target set by Bernstein analyst Toni
Sacconaghi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daniel Genter, chief investment officer of RNC Genter
Capital Management, argued that strong services growth showed
IBM's customers are relatively confident about the economic
outlook because they are willing to make new investments in
technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What we are seeing is that they are not cutting back on IT
spending. That they are maintaining and increasing in what
would be the discretionary part of IT (information technology)
spending," said Genter, whose firm holds about 500,000 IBM
shares and manages $2.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Due to its stability, many investors view IBM shares as a
safe haven in tough economic times. The stock has risen about
17 percent this year, compared with a 15 percent decline in the
Dow Jones Industrial index .DJI and a 14 percent drop in the
Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM trades at about 13 times next year's expected earnings
per share, compared with about 11 for rival Hewlett-Packard Co
(HPQ.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM managed to post strong sales in the United States and
the rest of the Americas region even as the economy slowed due
to the banking crisis and slowdown in construction and retail
sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales in the Americas region rose 8 percent to $10.9
billion. Growth was 6 percent after currency adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue from Europe, the Middle East and Africa rose 20
percent to $9.8 billion, or 7 percent after currency
adjustments. IBM's revenue in Asia rose 16 percent, or 6
percent after currency adjustments, to $5.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Income from continuing operations rose 22 percent to $2.8
billion. The year-earlier results included a gain from the sale
of a printing unit that the company has since divested. Without
that gain, income from continuing operations would have been up
26 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM shares fell to $126 in-after hours trading after
initially rising about 2 percent from the New York Stock
Exchange close of $126.52.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit and outlook for its current quarter on Thursday, citing a "tough" environment, and its shares fell 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software maker, which is locked in an on-again, off-again pursuit of Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), lowered its fiscal 2009 forecast range while slightly increasing its revenue outlook for this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's what I would describe as a tough environment. It's clear other companies around us are suffering," Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said in an interview with Reuters. "It hasn't hurt us significantly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the current quarter, Microsoft forecast earnings per share to range from 47 cents to 48 cents on revenue between $14.7 billion to $14.9 billion. That is below Wall Street forecasts on average of 50 cents per share in earnings on $15.06 billion in revenue, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker has weathered a soft U.S. economy by ramping up sales to emerging markets and offering a diverse set of products aimed at corporate customers and consumers. However, analysts noted that this was proof that Microsoft is not immune to a broader downtown in spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft narrowing their outlook a bit for the coming year, we think it's reasonable given the challenging economic conditions," said Andy Miedler, analyst at Edward Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock fell to $25.85 in after-hours trade after closing at $27.52 on the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft reported a net profit of $4.3 billion, or 46 cents per diluted share, in its fiscal fourth quarter ended June, up from a profit of $3.04 billion, or 31 cents per diluted share, in the year-ago period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue rose 18 percent to $15.84 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earnings were a penny per share below the forecast of analysts, on average, of 47 cents per share but the revenue beat their forecast of $15.65 billion in the June quarter, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software maker was aided by strong demand for Windows 2008, the flagship software at its server and tools division. The profit growth looked even bigger due to a $1.06 billion charge that Microsoft incurred during last year's June quarter to fix problems with its Xbox 360 game console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Microsoft went public with its unsolicited bid to buy Yahoo on February 1, the stock is down 16 percent, as of the close of trade on Wednesday, versus a 10 percent slide in the SP 500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft lowered its full-year estimates to an earnings range of $2.12 to $2.18 per share on revenue from $67.3 billion to $68.1 billion. Its previous estimates were for earnings per share in a range from $2.13 to $2.19 and revenue of $66.9 billion to $68 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts, on average, are forecasting the company to post earnings per share of $2.16 on revenue of $67.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Windows division posted a 15 percent increase in revenue, helped by adoption of its new Vista operating system. The unit's performance was a disappointment when revenue came in lower than expected from an inventory build-up of computers and a lack of progress in its ongoing battle against piracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft forecast Windows division revenue to grow between 9 percent to 10 percent this fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liddell said the company's online advertising business was being hurt by the difficult U.S. economy. Microsoft will make additional investments in its online services business unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rival Google Inc (GOOG.O) said its online advertising business has held up well despite weak economic conditions, but it reported a weaker-than-expected 35 percent rise in quarterly profit due to expenses for foreign currency hedges and lower yields on cash holdings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Ritsuko Ando in New York and Tiffany Wu in San Francisco)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi; Editing by Gary Hill and Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc, IBM and Microsoft Corp reported quarterly results on Thursday, giving investors a mixed snapshot of the health of the technology sector amid a slowing global economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google posted a 35 percent rise in quarterly net profit but missed Wall Street's consensus forecast. IBM reported a higher quarterly profit that beat expectations. Microsoft also posted a rise in quarterly profit, but issued a forecast below Wall Street expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMMENTARY ON GOOGLE:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JEFFREY LINDSAY, ANALYST, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In this market, unless you blow results in this market, investors are going to be very skeptical. It looks as if they've beaten consensus on revenue. But the issue is the margins, they're a little disappointing. That's why earnings are low."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Interest income looks low. That would come down for several reasons, including its DoubleClick acquisition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks like there has been some expense discipline. It could be that there's some weakness in the social networks deal but it hasn't been fully offset by the expense discipline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The economy's been hard on Google's network rather than Google's owned and operated business. That's why we're seeing lower gross margins. Overall, it could be that investors will be disappointed with earnings per share and in this market there will be a strong reaction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COLIN GILLIS, ANALYST, CANACCORD ADAMS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's hard to love the numbers. There's the initial shock of this being the best company in the space and it just fell short. But when we wake up tomorrow, they're still taking market share and still the best company in the space. They're still innovating."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People will be worried about the U.S advertising market continuing to roll over or decline. You saw it with ValueClick missing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The rebound party is over."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
COMMENTARY ON IBM:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ZACH ROSENSTOCK, ANALYST, WAYNE HUMMER WEALTH MANAGEMENT, WHICH HOLDS IBM SHARES IN ITS $1 BILLION PORTFOLIO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once again pretty impressive. They beat by about 16 cents this quarter after beating the prior two quarters. It's becoming a common thing for now. The revenues were up 13 percent, but largely foreign-exchange related, so you're seeing the change of the business model. They're focusing outside the U.S. to ride through the domestic downturn."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think people will be focusing on Google actually because they missed. Revenues from services and IBM's consulting side were strong, which bodes well because it's ahead of implementation. It's a positive that there's so much demand for product, but there will be more focus in the market on Google and Microsoft because they were worse than they expected. IBM had been expected to beat again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KIM CAUGHEY, SENIOR ANALYST, FORT PITT CAPITAL GROUP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They had a really strong quarter both in top and bottom lines. The software and services signings looked pretty strong. The company has been focusing on growing its new growth markets, which are small businesses and emerging geographic markets and that looked very strong. IBM has its toe in every tech water but it looks pretty good. In 2002, when we had a sudden downturn, Q2 was a bad quarter. But it doesn't look like IBM is going to have a very bad quarter. Companies are still buying technology and that's great."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a little surprising the strength in the Systems Z mainframe. You think of mainframe being used most often in financial services companies so I'd like to hear who is buying these things since we all expect financial service companies will be pulling in on their spending."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KEITH WIRTZ, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, FIFTH THIRD ASSET MANAGEMENT, WHICH HOLDS IBM SHARES IN ITS $22 BILLION PORTFOLIO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They beat the number. I am very pleased about that....I take it as a good report."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Google number may cast a shadow on this stock."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are in a sweet spot as related to new product launches. We think in fact that the mainframe upgrade cycle is going to last for three or four more quarters."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Things are just tracking really well for IBM now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMMENTARY ON MICROSOFT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAT BECKER JR., CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BECKER CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, PORTLAND, OREGON, WHICH OWNS MICROSOFT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think you're seeing the quarter come in in line with expectations for the most part. Microsoft was in line to slightly better. With IBM, it was a very solid number. They came in at $1.98 versus estimates of 1.82. I think you're seeing a little more caution on guidance reflecting this uncertain environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KIM CAUGHEY, ANALYST, FORT PITT CAPITAL GROUP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The top line was great. I'm trying to figure out where the penny went."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The thing I'm extremely bullish about is their forecast for the future for top line growth. This is a company that brings in $60 billion dollars in revenue in a year and for it to constantly say that it's going to do more and better year after year that's always a good sign."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The other thing is Microsoft generally underpromises and overdelivers. So I think that it's bullish for technology that they see demand out there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANDY MIEDLER, ANALYST, EDWARD JONES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their core business did okay. However we were a little disappointed in the traction we're seeing out of Microsoft's Internet advertisement business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The guidance was a little light....We would expect the technology area to be impacted by what's going on in the economy. Microsoft narrowing their outlook a bit for the coming year, we think it's reasonable given the challenging economic conditions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the big thing is while Microsoft's core businesses of Windows, Office and server did well, investors are really keying in on Internet advertisement given all the Yahoo drama over the last few months."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Vista:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the fourth quarter, results in this unit were a bit ahead of what we were expecting so that looked okay. However, we are a bit cautious given if companies are going to cut back on spending, upgrading to Vista is one of those areas we can see them being cautious on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;((Reporting by Sue Zeidler in Los Angeles; and Kenneth Li, Jim Finkle, Ritsuko Ando and Calvin Mankowski in New York; compiled by Adam Tanner)&lt;/p&gt;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Optimism about the earnings picture may have driven Wall Street higher on
Thursday, but earnings released after the closing bell told a different story.

 Shares of Google (GOOG.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) fell in trading after the
closing bell after the two technology bellwethers posted earnings that fell
short of analysts estimates. Google shed about 9 percent, while Microsoft
dropped about 4 percent.

 Among financials, Merrill Lynch MER.N and Capital One (COF.N) shares
dropped after releasing results. Merrill shares dropped 4 percent and Capital
One shares fell 3 percent.

 These companies could weigh on the market on Friday. Nasdaq and SP 500
futures were pointing to a lower open.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Google Inc (GOOG.O) is seeing active options trading ahead of the quarterly
earnings results after the close. Shares are down nearly 5 percent $531 in late

calls, two times the normal volume, according to Trade Alert. Implied
volatility in the July $530 options is 125 percent, compared to 48 percent for

share, when the numbers are released, said WhatsTrading.com analyst Frederic
Ruffy. "People are looking for a major move in either direction," said options
strategist William Lefkowitz at vFinance Investments. Earlier there was
interest in Google's out-of-the-money July $610 calls and $450 puts, he said.

1509 ET 17July2008-Follow-through stock gains a welcome change-analyst
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Today's follow-through to yesterday's big stock market rally is
encouraging, as it marks the first time the market has been able to tack on
additional gains after a big up day in nearly a month, assuming the gains hold
into the close, said Jason Goepfert of sentimenTrader.com  Putting this into an
historical context, he noted there have been six times since 1950 when the SP
500 index .SPX set a new 52-week low, then rallied at least 2 percent the
next day and at least 1 percent the day after that. These instances marked the
very end of the 1970, 1987 and 2002 bear markets. It wasn't perfect, though, as
it led to some further short-term losses in 1962 and pretty much flat-out
failed in 1973, he added. For those curious, the dates were 05/31/62, 05/28/70,
12/07/73, 10/21/87, 12/08/87 and 10/11/02.

 To get out of the current bear market, the SP 500 has to rally 20 percent
from its low. If July 15 was the low, the index needs to rally to 1,457.89 to
be in a new bull market, Bespoke's Justin Walters and Paul Hickey said.

 In a separate post, Bespoke noted that the gains from the financial
sector's strong rally over the last couple of days are hardly enough to qualify
as a reversal considering their losses over the last month.

1452 ET 17July2008-Equity market forming a bottom? You must be joking--CitiFX
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 "The equity markets remain at the center of attention in this environment.
Our overall bearish outlook has not changed and we find few, if any, bright
spots in the market place that indicate that the financial and economic strains
may be behind us," market technicians at CitiFX Technicals said.

 "Instead our concerns have become elevated as we foresee an ongoing bear
market in stocks which are probably far from basing," they said in a research
note.

1425 ET 17Jul08-Recently, key reversals in leading sectors -Bespoke
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recently, Bespoke Investment Group noted on their blog, there have been some
key reversals in what were the market's leading sectors.

For example, energy and materials have broken their uptrends, while the
utilities sector's relative strength peaked last week and has since had a quick
reversal below support, Bespoke wrote.

1420 ET 17July2008- Merrill put spreaders turn busy ahead of earnings
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Merrill Lynch MER.N is seeing active option trading ahead of earnings
after the close. Although the stock rose more than 12 percent to $31.50,
trading in the U.S. options market is cautious as roughly 188,000 puts compared
to 118,000 calls changed hands in the afternoon session, Trade Alert data
showed. Among today's top trades were orders for 4,000 contracts of Aug. $25
puts trading ask side or for $1.90 and 4,000 Aug. $15 puts trading bid side for
40 cents a contract. This trade, a bear put spread, was repeated, not once or
twice, but no fewer than 25 times earlier in the day, said strategist Frederic
Ruffy at WhatsTrading.com. Implied volatility is elevated, with the July $30
puts and calls sporting IV of 200 percent vs. 88 percent in August. The big
skew indicates the options market is priced for a possible move of 7.6 percent,
or $2.33 a share, when the earnings are released, he said.

1354 ET 17July2008-Beginning of the end of a bear market?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The following are some of the key signals that in the past have indicated
the beginning of the end of a bear market, according to Incademy.com, an
investor education resource.

 - Indiscriminate selling after a long period of slowly declining prices, a
development sometimes called "capitulation."

 - A major potential corporate or political crisis, particularly if it has
ramifications for more than one company or market.

 - Highly negative but irrational rumors about companies

 - Low stock market ratings/valuations

 - Low real interest rates and the beginnings of a downtrend in bond prices.
Low real interest rates presage an economic revival, a scenario that in turn
could mean interest rates may have to head higher to ward off inflation.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, July 17 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
posted a rise in quarterly profit on Thursday, boosted by a
steady increase of personal computer sales in emerging markets
and demand for new computer server software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, which is locked in an on-again, off-again
pursuit of Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), reported a net profit of $4.3
billion, or 46 cents per diluted share, in its fiscal fourth
quarter ended June versus a profit of $3.04 billion, or 31
cents per diluted share, in the year-ago period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue rose 18 percent to $15.84 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts, on average, were forecasting Microsoft to earn 47
cents per share on revenue of $15.65 billion in the June
quarter, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The software maker was aided by strong demand for Windows
2008, the flagship software at its server and tools division.
The profit growth looked even bigger due to a $1.06 billion
charge that Microsoft incurred during last year's June quarter
to fix problems with its Xbox 360 game console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since Microsoft went public with its unsolicited bid to buy
Yahoo on Feb. 1, the stock is down 16 percent, as of the close
of trade on Wednesday, versus a 10 percent slide in the SP
500.

ARMONK, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced second-quarter 2008 diluted
earnings of $1.98 per share from continuing operations, an increase of
28 percent as reported, compared with diluted earnings of $1.55 per
share, including a 5 cents per share gain from the sale of the
Printing Systems Division (PSD), in the second quarter of 2007.
Excluding the gain in the prior-year period, diluted earnings for the
second-quarter 2008 increased 32 percent year over year.

   Second-quarter income from continuing operations was $2.8 billion,
an increase of 22 percent, compared with $2.3 billion, including the
gain from the sale of PSD, in the second quarter of 2007. Without the
gain, income from continuing operations increased 26 percent versus
the comparable period last year. Total revenues for the second quarter
of 2008 of $26.8 billion increased 13 percent (6 percent, adjusting
for currency) from the second quarter of 2007.

   "IBM had an outstanding quarter and a strong first half for 2008.
These results demonstrate that IBM has the ability to thrive in both
emerging and established markets. Once again, IBMers performed very
well around the world," said Samuel J. Palmisano, IBM chairman,
president and chief executive officer.

   "We are continuing to see the benefits of IBM's transformation in
recent years. Today IBM is a company with a distinctive business model
that gives us a competitive edge in a global economy. We enjoy a
steady base of recurring revenue and profits; a truly global reach and
scale; services and products that deliver genuine value to clients
wherever they do business; and a strong and flexible financial
foundation that generates powerful cash flow and fuels our investment
in growth opportunities.

   "We feel good about our full-year outlook and our 2010 roadmap for
$10 to $11 of earnings per share."

   From a geographic perspective, the Americas' second-quarter
revenues were $10.9 billion, an increase of 8 percent as reported (6

Europe/Middle East/Africa were $9.8 billion, up 20 percent (7 percent,
adjusting for currency). Asia-Pacific revenues increased 16 percent (6

21 percent (14 percent, adjusting for currency) and represented 18
percent of geographic revenues.

   Total Global Services revenues grew 16 percent (8 percent,
adjusting for currency). Global Technology Services segment revenues
increased 15 percent (8 percent, adjusting for currency) to $10.1
billion, with significant growth from existing clients. Global
Business Services segment revenues, which benefited from strength in
consulting services, increased 18 percent (9 percent, adjusting for
currency) to $5.1 billion. IBM signed services contracts totaling
$14.7 billion, at actual rates, up 12 percent ($12.2 billion,
adjusting for currency, up 4 percent). Short-term signings increased
18 percent, at actual rates, to $7.0 billion (up 9 percent to $5.8
billion, adjusting for currency). The company ended the second quarter
with an estimated services backlog, including Strategic Outsourcing,
Business Transformation Outsourcing, Integrated Technology Services,
Global Business Services and Maintenance, of $117 billion, adjusting
for currency, an increase of approximately $1 billion year over year.

   Revenues from the Systems and Technology segment totaled $5.2
billion for the quarter, up 2 percent (down 3 percent, adjusting for
currency). Revenues increased 5 percent (flat, adjusting for currency)
excluding the year-to-year impact of the PSD divestiture in June 2007.
Systems revenues grew 10 percent (4 percent, adjusting for currency).
Revenues from System z mainframe server products increased 32 percent
compared with the year-ago period. Total delivery of System z
computing power, which is measured in MIPS (millions of instructions
per second), increased 34 percent. Revenue from the converged System p
server products increased 29 percent compared with the 2007 period.
Revenues from the System x servers decreased 5 percent, and revenues
from the System i servers decreased 47 percent. Revenues from System
Storage increased 12 percent and revenues from Retail Store Solutions
were flat. Revenues from Microelectronics OEM decreased 19 percent.

   Revenues from the Software segment were $5.6 billion, an increase
of 17 percent (9 percent, adjusting for currency) compared with the
second quarter of 2007. Revenues from IBM's total middleware products,
which primarily include WebSphere, Information Management, Tivoli,
Lotus and Rational products, were $4.3 billion, up 17 percent versus
the second quarter of 2007. Operating systems revenues of $592 million
increased 4 percent compared with the prior-year quarter.

   For the WebSphere family of software products, which facilitate
customers' ability to manage a wide variety of business processes
using open standards to interconnect applications, data and operating
systems, revenues increased 9 percent. Revenues for Information
Management software, which enables clients to leverage information on
demand, increased 30 percent. Revenues from Tivoli software,
infrastructure software that enables clients to centrally manage
networks including security and storage capability, increased 9
percent, and revenues for Lotus software, which allows collaborating
and messaging by clients in real-time communication and knowledge
management, increased 21 percent year over year. Revenues from
Rational software, integrated tools to improve the processes of
software development, increased 37 percent compared with the year-ago
quarter.

   Global Financing segment revenues increased 6 percent (down 2
percent, adjusting for currency) in the second quarter to $634
million.

   The company's total gross profit margin was 43.2 percent in the
2008 second quarter compared with 41.8 percent in the 2007 period.

   Total expense and other income increased 15 percent to $7.8
billion compared with the prior-year period. SG expense increased 12
percent to $6.3 billion. RD expense increased 8 percent compared
with the year-ago period. Intellectual property and custom development
income increased to $285 million compared with $246 million a year
ago. Other (income) and expense was income of $24 million, down $228
million as a result of hedging and the year-to-year impact of the gain
on the sale of PSD in the second quarter of 2007. Interest expense
increased to $145 million compared with $130 million, primarily due to
the increase in debt to finance the company's accelerated share
repurchase agreements.

   IBM's effective tax rate in the second-quarter 2008 was 27.5
percent compared with 28.0 percent in the second quarter of 2007.

   Shares repurchased in the second quarter were approximately $4.7
billion on a cash-paid basis. The weighted-average number of diluted
common shares outstanding in the second-quarter 2008 was 1.40 billion
compared with 1.46 billion shares in the same period of 2007. As of
June 30, 2008, there were 1.35 billion basic common shares
outstanding.

   Debt, including Global Financing, totaled $34.2 billion, compared
with $35.3 billion at year-end 2007. From a management segment view,
Global Financing debt increased $639 million from year-end 2007 to a
total of $25.2 billion at June 30, 2008, resulting in a debt-to-equity
ratio of 6.8 to 1. Non-global financing debt, which reflects financial
leverage associated with accelerated share repurchase agreements,
totaled $9.1 billion, a decrease of $1.7 billion since year-end 2007,
resulting in a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 26.9 percent from 30.0
percent at year-end 2007. The cash balance was $9.8 billion at the end
of the second quarter.

   Year-To-Date 2008 Results

   Income from continuing operations for the six months ended June
30, 2008 was $5.1 billion, an increase of 24 percent, compared with

period. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations
increased 32 percent to $3.63, compared with $2.75 per diluted share,
including the gain from the sale of PSD, for the 2007 period. Without
the gain, income from continuing operations for the six months ended
June 30, 2008 increased 26 percent and diluted earnings per share
increased 34 percent. Revenues from continuing operations for the six-
month period totaled $51.3 billion, an increase of 12 percent (5
percent, adjusting for currency) compared with $45.8 billion for the
six months of 2008.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares in major banks rallied Thursday after JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), the third-largest U.S. bank, topped analyst forecasts by posting a smaller-than-expected decline in second-quarter profit, a day after Wells Fargo  Co's (WFC.N) results sent stocks soaring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When stocks are priced as they have been, anything that is not horrible is supported," said Michael Jones, a portfolio with Rochester, New York-based Clover Capital Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones also said regulatory attempts to curb some forms of short-selling, a bet that stocks will fall, may have provided support to the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The KBW Bank Index .BKX, which includes 24 major banks stocks, was up 8 percent in late-afternoon trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares were up 11 percent, while Citigroup Inc (C.N) was up 8 percent, Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) 12 percent and Washington Mutual Inc (WM.N) 9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Phil Wahba; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * JPMorgan spurs 2nd-day rally in financials&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Oil drops over $5, easing inflation worry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Initial quarterly earnings show unexpected strength
  (Updates to 3 pm)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Walter Brandimarte&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks climbed over 1
percent on Thursday as oil prices dropped sharply for the
third day, while banks rallied after stronger-than-expected
results from JPMorgan Chase  Co increased optimism about the
current earnings season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil prices fell more than $5, dropping below $130 a barrel
for the first time in over a month. The steep decline in oil
futures prices reduced concerns about inflation and the impact
of possibly higher rates on the fragile U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of JP Morgan (JPM.N) jumped 12 percent after the
third-largest U.S. bank posted profit above Wall Street's
expectations. Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) rose nearly 13
percent and Citigroup (C.N) gained over 8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The news supported investor optimism about corporate
earnings, one day after Wells Fargo  Co's (WFC.N) results
catapulted financial stocks to their biggest gains in almost
two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N also
benefited from the rally in financials, soaring 20 percent or
more in a second day of sharp gains. They were further boosted
by news that Freddie pulled off its second successful debt
sale following Sunday's announcement of a U.S. rescue plan for
the two huge housing finance companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In order to have a sustainable rally, what you need is
oil prices coming down, and some good earnings numbers coming
out," said John Praveen, chief investment strategist at
Prudential International Investments Advisers LLC in Newark,

points, or 1.25 percent, to 2,313.31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In general, the first batch of corporate earnings has
positively surprised analysts, who currently expect SP 500

the diversified manufacturer rose 5.3 percent to $64.36 on the
results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola (KO.N) and e-Bay (EBAY.O) also beat analysts'
profit estimates, but shares of the world's largest
soft-drinks company fell 4 percent to $50.24 on mounting
evidence that the weakening U.S. economy is taking a toll on
its performance. [ID:nN17256203]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of eBay slipped 14.2 percent to $24.12 after the

be available later on Thursday as Merrill Lynch MER.N,
Google (GOOG.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and International Business

market closes.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc.'s (NYSE: CCE) ratings are unaffected
by the company's announcements today, according to Fitch Ratings. CCE
reported earnings for the second quarter ended June 27, 2008,
recording a significant net loss due to a non-cash $5.3 billion
pre-tax impairment charge related to its North American franchise
license intangible assets. The company also revised its 2008 full-year
adjusted EPS guidance down 10 cents per share from a range of $1.50 to
$1.55 to a range of $1.40 to $1.45.

   The impairment charge was due to a re-assessment of the fair value
of the North American franchise license assets as the company
experiences near-term declines in operating income. While this is the
second impairment charge for these intangible assets in the past two
years and further impairments may become necessary should the business
deteriorate more than anticipated, Fitch believes the longer term cash
flow generating ability of the company remains strong.

   While CCE's credit statistics will be modestly weaker as a result
of the difficulties experienced by its U.S. operations, the company's
ratings are considered within the context of the credit profile of the
Coca-Cola system, which comprises The Coca-Cola Company and its
significant and/or strategic bottlers, of which CCE is the largest.
CCE's ratings reflect its continued importance within the Coca-Cola
bottling system, its ongoing debt reduction and its strengthening
non-carbonated beverage line-up.

   The company's current ratings incorporate expectations of near
term operating pressures from the inflationary commodity cost
environment and weaker consumer demand. Despite the challenging
environment, which is negatively impacting the company's margins, CCE
continues to generate substantial discretionary cash flow. The company
anticipates generating $675 million in free cash flow in 2008, in line
with Fitch's expectations.

   For the last twelve months ended June 27, 2008, the company's
credit statistics were in line with Fitch's expectations. Total
debt-to-operating earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization (EBITDA) was approximately 3.9 times (x) and operating
EBITDA-to-gross interest expense was roughly 4.1x.

   For the year ended Dec. 31, 2007, total debt-to-operating EBITDA
on an aggregated basis was 1.8x for the Coca-Cola system. The system's
FFO fixed charge coverage on an aggregated basis was 6.8x.

   Fitch rates CCE and its subsidiaries as follows:

   Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.:

   --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A';

   --Bank credit facility 'A';

   --Senior unsecured debt 'A';

   --Short-term IDR 'F1';

   --Commercial Paper 'F1'.

   --Senior unsecured debt 'A'.

   Bottling Holdings (Luxembourg) Commandite S.C.A.:

   --Short-term IDR 'F1';

   --Commercial Paper 'F1'.

   The Ratings Outlook is Stable.

&lt;p&gt;Jay Rasulo, Chairman, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts to Be Inducted into TIA's Hall of Leaders

WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
Jay Rasulo, chairman, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, has been
named the 2008 inductee into the Travel Industry Hall of Leaders.

   Rasulo will be honored during a dinner attended by several hundred
travel industry leaders October 28th in Portland, Oregon during the
Marketing Outlook Forum, an annual industry conference run by the
Travel Industry Association (TIA). Distinguished individuals are named
to the Hall of Leaders for "sustained, noteworthy contributions that
have positively impacted the travel industry, stimulated greater
achievement, and raised industry-wide standards."

   "Jay was the catalyst that has given us a much bigger voice in
Washington," remarked Roger Dow, TIA president and CEO. "He invested
time and energy to ensure that policymakers understand the importance
of travel economically and as resource for public diplomacy. He
exemplifies the leader this award was created to honor."

   "The travel industry's significant and pervasive impact on our
nation's economy, social and cultural life and international image is
understood better today than ever because of Jay Rasulo's unwavering
commitment to the industry," said Barbara Richardson, a past national
chair of TIA and also the chair of the selection committee. "Over the
years, he has worked tirelessly as an advocate for the industry, for
those who rely on the industry for their livelihood and for millions
of travelers. It is an honor to recognize his commitment and to
publicly thank him by inducting him into the Hall of Leaders."

   Rasulo served for two years as national chair of TIA. During that
time he called on the industry to create a blueprint for success that
would be the equivalent of an Apollo project to improve marketing the
U.S. as an international destination and send a more welcoming message
to international travelers around the world. He then led the effort to
generate that blueprint, which included creation of the Discover
America Partnership, an industry coalition aimed at improving
international travel to the U.S.

   The Partnership, now part of TIA, has since had a string of public
affairs victories, including expansion of the Visa Waiver Program,
reform of visa and entry processes, and creation of model airports to
improve the arrival process for international visitors.

   Last year Rasulo had Disney produce a multimedia experience which
includes a seven-minute video entitled, "Welcome: Portraits of
America." The video was donated to the Departments of State and
Homeland Security for use at major U.S. international airports, and at
U.S. embassies and consulates around the world.

   Under Rasulo's leadership, TIA also entered a public-private
partnership with the U.S. government that created DiscoverAmerica.com,
the first-ever official travel and tourism website of the United
States, which promotes the country internationally.

   Rasulo will be the 78th travel industry professional inducted into
the Travel Industry Hall of Leaders since it was created in 1969. The
2007 inductee was Stephen Holmes, chairman and chief executive officer
of Wyndham Worldwide.

   The Travel Industry Association is the national, non-profit
organization representing all components of the $740 billion travel
industry. TIA's mission is to promote and facilitate increased travel
to and within the United States. TIA is proud to be a partner in
travel with American Express. For more information, visit www.tia.org.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co posted a smaller-than-expected drop in earnings on resilient stock and bond underwriting revenue, sending its shares surging, but the company cautioned that the mortgage market and the economy are getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bank's second-quarter profit fell more than 50 percent to $2 billion, hurt by $1.1 billion in write-downs at its investment bank and charges linked to the bank's acquisition of Bear Stearns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even amid write-downs, the third-largest U.S. bank generated stronger than expected results, helped by underwriting and bond trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Things aren't as bad as the market has feared," said Thomas Russo, partner and portfolio manager at Gardner Russo  Gardner in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase posted net income of 54 cents a share, compared with $4.23 billion, or $1.20 a share, in the same quarter last year.

The company currently pays 38 cents per share quarterly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan set aside an additional $1.3 billion during the second quarter as a buffer against further losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank will also not record a gain from its Bear Stearns purchase in May, which it had previously hoped would contribute $1 billion. JPMorgan had agreed in March to buy Bear Stearns after the fifth-largest U.S. securities firm faced a run on the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acquisition of Bear Stearns instead contributed $540 million of losses and charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there were glimmers of good news as well.

But since Tuesday's close, the bank's shares have risen more than 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the results, the cost to insure JPMorgan debt against a default with credit default swaps fell 5 basis points to 115 basis points, or $115,000 per year to insure $10 million of debt for five years, according to Phoenix Partners Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of capital strength, rose to 9.1 percent from 8.4 percent in the same quarter last year -- though it would have been 8.1 percent without regulatory relief stemming from the Bear Stearns takeover, which was assisted by federal regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators consider a bank with a Tier 1 ratio above 6 percent to be well capitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Brian Moss and Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - A measure of JPMorgan Chase 
Co's (JPM.N) commodities trading risk fell 23 percent in the
second quarter from the same quarter last year, implying that
the investment bank is being cautious in ramping up its
commodities trading business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The No. 3 U.S. bank said in its latest earnings report on
Thursday that the average daily trading value-at-risk for
commodities stood at $31 million for the three months ended June
30, meaning that the bank's maximum losses on 99 percent of
trading days was $31 million, down from $40 million in the same
quarter last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan is planning to start trading in physical crude oil
later this year, but could be moving more cautiously after
recent record fluctuations in oil prices, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When you look at your at-risk calculations, one of the
fundamental applications in it is often your assumed
volatility," said Rick Meckler, analyst at Libertyview Capital
Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's commodities chief, Blythe Masters, told Reuters
in an interview in May that the bank will start trading in
physical oil and refined products by the end of the year after
its takeover of failed rival Bear Stearns and that firm's energy
trading unit, Bear Energy. [ID:nSP148501]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan announced a 50 percent drop in second-quarter
profit on Thursday due to mortgage writedowns, but did not
comment about its commodities operations in a statement about
the results. A spokesperson did not return a call seeking
comment.

&lt;p&gt;  MCLEAN, VA, Jul 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
CIBT, Inc. (http://www.cibt.com), the world's largest visa and passport
expediter, reports that tourist travel to China demonstrates that
Americans' love of sports, particularly the Olympics, is alive and well.

    Steven Diehl, CIBT, Inc. Vice President, said, "Visa processing from year
to year is up because of the Olympics, even though Chinese requirements
have become more restrictive in recent months. Because we process so many
visas and are very familiar with Chinese visa regulations, we have been
able to ensure that travelers will get to the Olympic Games and not miss a
minute of the action.

    "Just as Olympic athletes keep their eyes on the prize of Olympic
championships, fans of the Games have been waiting to cheer them on in
person. CIBT continues to create customized plans for companies sending 50
or more people to China this summer. We are assisting athletes and
coaches, corporate travelers, tour operators, VIPs, and some very large
groups to accommodate the unique needs of each of our clients. And there
is still time for CIBT to expedite visas for last-minute travelers," Mr.
Diehl added.

    Mr. Diehl cautioned Olympics-bound travelers that "going directly to the
Chinese Embassy or consulates to obtain visas has proven frustrating for
many individuals and groups who have been turned away due to the lack of
proper support documentation often resulting in multiple return trips.
Sending your application by mail is even riskier. Until recently, a
Chinese visa was valid for one year and permitted multiple entries. Now,
people need official invitations, flight and hotel confirmation, and in
some cases bank statements and other documents to apply for a visa."

    CIBT has developed special visa kits for international groups. The kits
have become especially valuable for companies trying to coordinate travel
for global employees and customers departing for the Olympics from various

&lt;p&gt; * JPMorgan, United Technologies spark profit optimism&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Financials extend prior session's advance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Oil rebounds after two days of declines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Factory activity shrinks in U.S. Mid-Atlantic region
 (Updates to midmorning)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were little
changed on Thursday as a rebound in oil prices and weak
regional economic data offset stronger-than-expected earnings
from financial services companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors snapped up shares of embattled banks after
JPMorgan Chase  Co's (JPM.N) reported a stronger-than-expected
profit a day after Wells Fargo  Co's (WFC.N) results
catapulted financial stocks to their biggest gains in nearly
two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But oil prices reversed two days of deep losses, sparking
caution about inflation and consumer spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shortly after the open, the Dow and the SP 500 pared gains
and the Nasdaq briefly turned negative following a report that
showed factory activity shrunk in July in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic
region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I just think there's still plenty of fear out there. A one
day rebound is not going to change the mood," said Scott Wren,
senior equity strategist at Wachovia Securities. "You're going
to need continued good news over this earnings period to put in
a bottom."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI edged up 16.69
points, or 0.15 percent, to 11,255.97. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX gained 2.09 points, or 0.17 percent, to
1,247.45. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC added 1.74 points,
or 0.08 percent, to 2,286.59.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of JPMorgan, the No. 3 U.S. bank, jumped more than 9
percent, making the stock the top boost on the SP 500 and the
No. 2 boost on the Dow, behind United Technologies (UTX.N), up
more than 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N surged nearly 20
percent, adding to sharp jumps a day earlier, after Freddie Mac
completed its second successful debt sale this week. The $3
billion note sale helped calm fears about the strength of the
two housing finance companies after the announcement of a U.S.
rescue plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; United Technologies, a diversified manufacturer posted
results that also topped Wall Street's forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. crude CLc1 rose $1.23 to $135.82 a barrel as a fresh
cut to Nigerian output on Thursday underscored the risk to
supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In other news on the economy, a government report showed a
surprise jump in U.S. housing starts, but the Commerce
Department said the gain in June was due chiefly to a change in
New York City building codes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SP financial index .GSPF jumped more than 3 percent.
 JPMorgan shares rose to $39.79, and United Technologies
climbed $63.88. Another standout among financials was Bank of
America Corp (BAC.N), up 10.4 percent at $25.01 on the New York
Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Coca-Cola (KO.N) declined more than 3 percent to
$50.50 as lagging volume growth overshadowed the soft drink
maker's stronger-than-expected profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Nasdaq, a 14.4 percent slide to $24.05 in the shares of
Internet auctioneer and retailer eBay (EBAY.O) kept a lid on
gains, a day after the company sounded a cautious tone on its
outlook.

&lt;p&gt;OTTAWA (Reuters) - The lead singer of the popular Canadian band the Barenaked Ladies will fight a recent cocaine charge in the United States, the band said in a statement posted on its website on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven Page was arrested last Friday in an apartment in Fayetteville, New York, and charged with possession of a controlled substance. Court documents show Page allegedly told police "Yeah, it's cocaine", when asked about a white powdery substance in his possession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Page, 38, posted $10,000 bail and is due back in court late next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many of you have probably read or heard press accounts about Steven Page's recent arrest in New York state. Steven has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him and the validity of the charges against Steven will be strongly contested," the band statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five-man group is best known for hit songs such as "One Week", "Pinch Me", and "If I Had a Million Dollars". It has just released an album of songs for youngsters and next month is due to play at a Long Island, New York, children's charity concert organized by Walt Disney Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While this is happening, it's business as usual for Barenaked Ladies. We will continue to perform and look forward to heading into the studio later this year to record a new album. We want to thank our loyal fans for their continued support during this difficult time," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Ljunggren; Editing by Peter Galloway)&lt;/p&gt;

Tabernacle (Atlanta, August 8); Park West (Chicago, August 17); LOVE
(Washington D.C., August 21); and, The Filmore at Irving Plaza (New

the show.

tradition of connecting African American teens with something they
love - Coca-Cola and music," said Yolanda White, assistant vice
president, African American Marketing, Coca-Cola North America. "Not
only will each concert offer the teens an unforgettable musical

lauded by critics and fans alike for his clean, underground,

by his love for Japanese animation, comic books, video games, art,
literature and philosophy. MTV recently ranked him No. 7 on the list
of "hottest MCs in the Game 2008." His highly anticipated sophomore
album, "The Cool" was released in December 2007 and has garnered

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - Debt protection costs on
JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) and other financial companies fell
on Thursday as U.S. stocks rose after the third-largest U.S.
bank reported stronger-than-expected earnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Shares in JPMorgan climbed more that 11 percent after its
second-quarter profit fell more than 50 percent due to $1.1
billion in write-downs at its investment bank but still beat
expectations. For details click on [ID:nN17472235].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cost to insure JPMorgan debt against a default with
credit default swaps fell 5 basis points to 115 basis points,
or $115,000 per year to insure $10 million of debt for five
years, according to Phoenix Partners Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan reported its results a day after Wells Fargo's
(WFC.N) earnings catapulted financial stocks to their biggest
gains in nearly two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit default swaps on Wells Fargo continued to tighten on
Thursday, narrowing 8 basis points to 122 basis points, and the
cost to protect Merrill Lynch MER.N debt against a default
fell 4 basis points to 316 basis points, according to Phoenix
Partners Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill Lynch, which has suffered huge write-downs on
complex mortgage-backed securities in prior quarters, is slated
to report its earnings on Thursday after the market close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill is expected to announce that it has reached a deal
to sell its 20 percent stake in Bloomberg LP back to the news
and financial data company for about $4.5 billion, a source
familiar with the situation told Reuters on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) said on Thursday Merrill was not
selling its 49.8 percent state in the U.S. money manager.
[ID:nN16408347].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Debt protection costs on CIT Group Inc (CIT.N) also dropped
by 60 basis points to 780 basis points, according to Phoenix
Partners Group, as it stock rose more than 7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The commercial lender, which has been hit hard by the
credit crunch and has struggled to raise funds to pay back
billions of dollars of maturing debt, said measures it has
taken, such as selling assets and borrowing on a secured basis,
should allow it to meet its liquidity needs through the end of
2009. [ID:nN17262053].

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analysts' estimates, price increases, background;
changes headline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - Beverage bottler Coca-Cola
Enterprises Inc (CCE.N) reported better-then-expected quarterly
profit on Thursday excluding a $5.3 billion impairment charge
related to the weak U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also lowered its full-year outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest bottler of Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) drinks
reported a net loss of $3.17 billion, or $6.52 per share, in
the second quarter, compared to a net profit of $270 million,
or 56 cents per share, a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excluding 2 cents per share in restructuring charges and
the one-time charge, related to a reduction in the value of its
North American franchise licenses, Coke Enterprises earned 56
cents per share, topping analysts' average estimate, according
to Reuters Estimates, by 2 cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company cited favorable tax and foreign exchange rates
for the beat, as well as modest operating income growth in
Europe. Operating income in North America declined, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bottler said the charge was needed in light of an
expected near-term decline in operating income and a recent
decline in its stock price, "both largely the result of
deteriorating North American macroeconomic conditions and
expected substantial increases in commodity costs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company sells about 80 percent of all Coke drinks in
North America and is the sole licensed bottler for Coke
products sold in Belgium, France, Britain, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands and Monaco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net operating revenue rose 5 percent to $5.94 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In May, the company said second-quarter profit excluding
items would be in the mid- to high-single-digit percentage
range. Before that, analysts had expected a gain of 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke Enterprises, which is about 35 percent owned by
Coca-Cola, said at the time that the weakening North American
economy was cutting into sales volume, especially in
higher-margin 20-ounce bottles, which are sold in convenience
stores and gas stations. Higher gasoline prices have cut into
convenience store traffic, analysts have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also lowered its full-year earnings outlook,
saying it now expects to earn $1.40 to $1.45 per share in 2008,
excluding items, but including a benefit from foreign exchange
rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In May the company said it would be hard to meet its
full-year earnings forecast of $1.50 to $1.55 per share if
current economic and market trends did not improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts had been expecting $1.41 per share for the year,
according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bottler also said it would accelerate work to create
fundamental changes in its North American operations, such as
with a price increase on take-home drinks across the country,
implemented after Labor Day.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) reported better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday before one-time items, helped by the weak dollar, and its shares rose 1.6 percent in premarket trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest soft-drink maker said net income was $1.42 billion, or 61 cents per share, in the second quarter ended June 27, compared with $1.85 billion, or 80 cents per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding a charge of 40 cents per share at bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc (CCE.N), which is about 35 percent-owned by Coca-Cola, the company earned $1.01 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts' average earnings forecast was 96 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net operating revenue for the quarter rose 17 percent to $9.05 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola, which derives about 70 percent of its revenue from outside North America, said 9 percentage points of the revenue increase was due to the weak dollar, which boosts the value of international sales when they are converted to dollars for inclusion in the company's financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The revenue rise included 3 percentage points from higher sales of drink concentrate, 2 points from bottler acquisitions, and 3 points from higher prices and more sales of higher-priced products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall unit case volume rose 3 percent, led by a 5 percent increase in markets abroad. North American volume was flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said sales growth was strong in Latin America, China, Turkey, India, Eastern Europe, Southern Eurasia, the Middle East and North and West Africa. Volume fell 1 percent in Japan and the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like other soft-drink makers, Coke's U.S. sales have slowed as consumers grapple with soaring food and fuel costs, declining home values and job uncertainty. Also, increasingly health-conscious consumers have been opting for drinks seen as good for you, such as bottled teas or vitamin-enhanced waters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, whose brands include Minute Maid juice, Powerade sports drink and Dasani bottled water, said it is targeting $400 million to $500 million in annual cost-savings by the end of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke shares rose to $53.20 in premarket trading, up from a close at $52.34 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Martinne Geller; Editing by Derek Caney and John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co, the third-largest U.S. bank, said on Thursday that second-quarter profit fell, hurt by hurt by $1.1 billion in write-downs at the investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Net income fell to $2 billion, or 54 cents per share, from $4.2 billion, or $1.20 a share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earnings beat analysts' consensus forecast of 44 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is reaction from industry analysts and investors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACHIM MATZKE, EUROPEAN STOCK INDEXES ANALYST AT COMMERBANK,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IN FRANKFURT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The reaction is clearly regarding expectations. Through last week, the market got the impression that every bank was in trouble. But now with results coming from JP Morgan, as well as from Wells Fargo yesterday, it looks like these fears were not justified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The market was too skeptical about the sector. Now we see that not all the banks are in danger, and it has sparked short coverage on banking stocks all over Europe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PETER BOOCKVAR, EQUITY STRATEGIST, MILLER TABAK  CO, NEW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; YORK, NY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JP Morgan is obviously much better positioned in a very tough environment and in light of that tough environment they executed, but overall business is weak for everybody. I think in the short term the banks should stabilize here after the drumming they've taken but I think the environment they're in will continue to be poor and will likely weaken and the banks likely have not seen their ultimate bear market lows."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIKE LENHOFF, CHIEF STRATEGIST AT BREWIN DOLPHIN IN LONDON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is what market needs, following on Wells Fargo, though we can't expect very much from Citi next.

They seem to be less involved in subprime lending and mortgage-backed securities than any of their peers. Their results today are not only pleasing but not that surprising when you think about it.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Beverage bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc (CCE.N) reported a quarterly net loss on Thursday, versus a year-ago profit, due to a large one-time impairment charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest bottler of Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) drinks reported a net loss of $3.17 billion, or $6.52 per share, in the second quarter, compared to a net profit of $270 million, or 56 cents per share, a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding a $5.3 billion charge, due to an expected decline in near-term North American operating income, the bottler earned 56 cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, the company said second-quarter profit excluding items would fall in the mid- to high-single-digit percentage range.

ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Coca-Cola Enterprises (NYSE: CCE) today reported a second-quarter
2008 net loss of $3.2 billion, or $6.52 per diluted share, including a
non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $5.3 billion, or $7.06 per
diluted share after tax and previously announced restructuring charges
of 2 cents per diluted share.

   The non-cash impairment charge is the result of CCE's impairment
analysis in accordance with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets." The charge is necessary to reduce the book value
of the company's North American franchise license intangibles to their
estimated fair value in light of an expected near term decline in
operating income and a recent decline in CCE's stock price - both
largely the result of deteriorating North American macroeconomic
conditions and expected substantial increases in commodity costs.

   Excluding these charges, comparable second quarter earnings per
diluted share were 56 cents driven by volume and operating income
declines in North America, modest operating income growth in Europe,
and favorable tax and currency exchange rates.

   The following table provides a reconciliation of reported and
comparable earnings per diluted share:

   "Over the past two years, we have implemented a new, global
operating framework that is strengthening our company," said John F.
Brock, chairman and chief executive officer. "In North America, we
have developed a stronger brand portfolio through the addition of
glaceau, Fuze, and Campbell's, and heightened efficiency and
effectiveness through new programs, including initiatives to transform
our go-to-market model. In Europe, we improved our operating approach
thereby creating efficiencies that have contributed to Europe's
ability to deliver performance in-line with our expectations during
the first half of 2008.

   "Our operating framework and its destination remain the right
long-term vision for CCE. As we undertook these extensive changes, we
recognized our North American business had fundamental issues that
needed to be addressed to achieve our long-term growth objectives,"
Mr. Brock said. "We targeted the 2008-2010 period to make the
substantial changes required to resolve these challenges, which
include improving profitability on future consumption packages,
addressing multi-year margin compression, and recruiting new consumers
to the sparkling beverage category.

   "Continued significant declines in the North American economy,
coupled with unprecedented escalating commodity costs, are negatively
impacting our results and restricting our outlook for near term
growth. This creates an immediate need to accelerate substantive
operating changes in our business," said Mr. Brock.

   "As a result, we are taking action including establishing pricing
levels that cover input costs, strengthening execution, restoring
growth to immediate consumption by recruiting new consumers, and
reducing operating expenses," Mr. Brock said. "One immediate step is
to implement, post-Labor Day, a price increase targeted at future
consumption packages in the United States. This will improve our
financial performance and further our efforts to balance value and
volume across packages and channels.

   "In addition, we have initiated a 120-day review to evaluate how
best to accelerate and expand the scope and pace of change in key
operating areas and will look at fundamental issues and opportunities
including our system supply chain, operations, and price-package
architecture and put into motion the essential changes required to
drive long-term profitable growth and shareowner value in North
America. This work requires continued cooperation with The Coca-Cola
Company as we work together to improve the long-term outlook for our
North American business over the coming months," said Mr. Brock.

                      SECOND QUARTER PERFORMANCE

   In the second quarter, North American volume declined 1 1/2
percent. This result reflects persistent weakness in sales of higher
margin 20-ounce packages of sparkling beverages and Dasani, a low
single-digit decline in future consumption sales, the benefits of
glaceau brands, and continued strong growth in Coca-Cola Zero. On a
currency-neutral basis, pricing per case grew 4 percent and cost of
goods per case increased 7 1/2 percent. Both pricing and costs were
affected by the mix impact of increased sales of purchased finished
goods. On a comparable and currency-neutral basis, operating expenses
grew 1 1/2 percent.

   European volume declined 1 percent in the second quarter, affected
negatively by the impact of a two-week labor disruption in France and
offset by the benefits of the activation for the Euro 2008 soccer
event. In Great Britain we achieved modest growth on the strength of a
mid single-digit increase in brand Coca-Cola. On the continent,
Coca-Cola Zero achieved solid growth in the quarter despite lapping
introductory volume from a year ago. Pricing per case grew 2 1/2
percent, cost of goods per case rose 2 percent, and operating expenses
grew 1 percent. These results were in-line with expectations and are
comparable and currency-neutral.

                           FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

   Management now expects full year comparable 2008 earnings per
diluted common share to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.45. Including
currency benefit, full year operating income will decrease in a low
single-digit range, with solid growth in Europe and a decline in North
America in the low teens. The company now expects full year free cash
flow from operations less capital spending of approximately $675
million, with capital spending of approximately $1 billion. The
comparable effective tax rate for 2008 is expected to be approximately
25 percent to 26 percent. Guidance excludes items affecting
comparability and includes expected currency translation impact.

                            CONFERENCE CALL

   CCE will host a conference call with analysts and investors today
at 10:30 a.m. EDT. The call can be accessed through the company's web
site at www.cokecce.com.

(a)The non-GAAP financial measure "Bottle and Can Net Pricing per
    Case" is used to more clearly evaluate bottle and can pricing
    trends in the marketplace. The measure excludes the impact of
    fountain gallon volume and other items that are not directly
    associated with bottle and can pricing in the retail environment.
    Our bottle and can sales accounted for approximately 91 percent of
    our net revenue during the first six months of 2008.

(b)The non-GAAP financial measures "Currency-Neutral Bottle and Can
    Net Pricing per Case" and "Currency-Neutral Bottle and Can Cost of
    Sales per Case" are used to separate the impact of currency
    exchange rate changes on our operations.

(c)The non-GAAP financial measure "Bottle and Can Cost of Sales per
    Case" is used to more clearly evaluate cost trends for bottle and
    can products. The measure excludes the impact of fountain
    ingredient costs as well as marketing credits and Jumpstart
    funding, and allows investors to gain an understanding of the
    change in bottle and can ingredient and packaging costs.

(d)"Comparable Bottle and Can Volume" excludes the impact of changes
    in the number of selling days between periods. The measure is used
    to analyze the performance of our business on a constant period
    basis. There was one less selling day in the first six months of
    2008 versus the first six months of 2007. There were the same
    number of selling days in the second quarter of 2008 versus the
    second quarter of 2007.

(e)The non-GAAP measure "Free Cash Flow" is provided to focus
    management and investors on the cash available for debt reduction,
    dividend distributions, share repurchase, and acquisition
    opportunities.

(f)The non-GAAP measure "Net Debt" is used to more clearly evaluate
    our capital structure and leverage.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks extended gains on Thursday from a recent 21-month low after JP Morgan became the latest bank to report forecast-topping earnings results and oil prices retreated further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan, the third-largest U.S. bank, reported second quarter net income of $0.54 a share, against Reuters estimates' consensus of $0.44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This followed Wednesday's unexpectedly strong results at Wells Fargo, the fifth largest U.S. bank and a big mortgage lender, which dragged financial shares up from their record lows and helped stabilize the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors are now looking to a series of U.S. corporate quarterly earnings results later from firms including Merrill Lynch, IBM, Microsoft and Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results will set the tone for equities and risky assets which have been sold off in recent sessions on concerns about the financial sector -- which many analysts say would take a series of extremely strong results to wipe out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even if we get a positive surprise here and there, that doesn't mean the financial crisis is over.

ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company today reported second quarter earnings per
share of $0.61, a decrease of 24 percent versus the prior year on a
reported basis, and $1.01 after considering items impacting
comparability, an increase of 19 percent. Earnings per share for the
quarter included a net charge of $0.40 per share primarily related to
a non-cash impairment charge at Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. ("CCE"), an
equity investee. Earnings per share for the second quarter of 2007
were $0.80 and included a net charge of $0.05 per share, primarily
related to restructuring charges and a non-cash impairment charge at
an equity investee.

   "Our results in the quarter underscore our ability to continue
delivering volume growth and double-digit comparable earnings per
share growth, despite the combined impacts of several one-off events
and a more challenging economic environment," said Neville Isdell,
chairman of the Board, The Coca-Cola Company. "We continue to manage
the business for the long term by investing in brand building and
innovation with an unrelenting focus on improving our effectiveness
and efficiency. We have made significant progress since the turnaround
began in 2004 and I am confident going forward under Muhtar's
leadership that the business will continue to be managed by investing
for long-term sustainable growth and value."

   President and Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent said, "Our
second quarter performance demonstrates our ability to leverage the
strengths of our system to achieve balanced growth. Our results were
once again led by our international operations, which delivered 5
percent unit case volume growth, and we maintained volume in North
America despite significant challenges. Latin America continues to be
a key contributor to our results, along with solid performance in many
of our emerging markets including China, Turkey, India, Eastern
Europe, Southern Eurasia, North and West Africa and the Middle East.
We have accelerated our global volume and value share gains as
consumers connect with our brands and our system executes in the
marketplace.

   "We are clearly operating in a more challenging macroeconomic
environment. A strength of our system is the ability to work with our
bottling partners and customers to understand the local factors
impacting consumer behavior, adjust our plans where appropriate, while
continuing to invest and build share for the long term. Both the
fundamentals of our business and the strength of our brands remain
solid. Through our focus on superior execution and driving
productivity, I remain confident we are building a stronger Coca-Cola
system for the future."

   Financial Highlights

   --  Second quarter net operating revenues increased 17 percent.
        Revenue growth reflected a 3 percent increase in concentrate
        sales, a 2 percent increase from structural changes primarily
        resulting from acquisitions of certain bottlers, a 3 percent
        benefit from pricing and mix and a 9 percent positive currency
        impact.

   --  Operating income in the quarter increased 18 percent on a
        reported basis and 20 percent after considering items
        impacting comparability. Items impacting comparability
        negatively affected second quarter pre-tax operating income by
        $97 million in 2008 and by $48 million in 2007. Currency
        benefited operating income in the quarter by 11 percent.

   --  Year-to-date, the Company repurchased $1.0 billion of its
        stock and intends to repurchase a total of $1.75 to $2.0
        billion of its stock for the full year.

   --  The Company is targeting $400 to $500 million in annualized
        savings from productivity initiatives by year-end 2011 to
        provide additional flexibility to invest for growth.

   Operational Highlights

   (All references to unit case volume percentage changes in this
section are computed based on average daily sales.)

   Total Company

   --  Unit case volume increased 3 percent in the second quarter and
        4 percent year-to-date, successfully cycling 6 percent growth
        in the prior year quarter and year-to-date periods.
        Acquisitions contributed 1 point of unit case volume growth
        for both the quarter and year-to-date.

   --  International operations delivered 5 percent unit case volume
        growth in the quarter, successfully cycling 9 percent growth
        from the prior year quarter. Solid growth across Latin America
        and in key emerging markets including China, Turkey, India,
        Eastern Europe, Southern Eurasia, North and West Africa and
        the Middle East continued to drive the results. North America
        unit case volume was even in the quarter, while unit case
        volume in Japan and the European Union Group were each down 1
        percent.

   --  The Company continued to achieve growth in sparkling
        beverages, which increased unit case volume 1 percent in the
        quarter. Trademark Coca-Cola unit case volume was slightly
        positive in the quarter and Trademarks Fanta and Sprite
        increased unit case volume 1 percent and 3 percent,
        respectively.

   --  Still beverage unit case volume increased 13 percent in the
        quarter, led by strong growth across the Company's still brand
        portfolio, including juice and juice drink brands, tea brands
        and water brands.

   --  Globally, the Company gained volume and value share in
        nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages as well as in sparkling
        beverages and key still beverage categories including bottled
        water and juice and juice drinks.

   --  The Africa Group's unit case volume increased 5 percent in the
        quarter, with most key markets contributing to growth. South
        Africa's unit case volume was even in the quarter, cycling 12
        percent growth from the prior year and reflecting the
        lingering effects of carbon dioxide shortages. Nigeria unit
        case volume increased 4 percent in the quarter. Net revenues
        for the quarter increased 6 percent, reflecting a 2 percent
        increase in concentrate sales, positive pricing and mix and a
        slight negative currency impact. Operating income increased 61
        percent in the quarter reflecting the increase in net
        revenues, effective management of operating expenses and the
        cycling of restructuring charges in the prior year quarter,
        partially offset by the continued investment in key marketing
        initiatives.

   --  The Eurasia Group's unit case volume increased 7 percent in
        the quarter, successfully cycling 15 percent growth in the
        prior year quarter. Solid unit case volume growth in India,
        Turkey, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Southern Eurasia
        drove the results. Russia's unit case volume increased 2
        percent in the quarter, primarily reflecting the impact from
        adverse weather conditions late in the quarter, and resulted
        in volume and value share gains in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink
        beverages. Net revenues for the quarter increased 30 percent,
        benefiting from a 13 percent increase in concentrate sales,
        positive pricing and mix and a high single-digit currency
        benefit. Operating income growth in the quarter of 21 percent
        reflected the benefit of the net revenue increase and the
        continued investment in key business initiatives.

   --  Unit case volume in the European Union Group declined 1
        percent in the quarter, cycling 5 percent growth from the
        prior year. The group gained volume and value share in
        nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages as well as in sparkling
        beverages and key still beverage categories in the quarter.
        Unit case volume results in the quarter were negatively
        impacted by labor strikes in several key markets, the shift of
        Easter into the first quarter as well as unfavorable weather
        early in the quarter. Net revenues for the quarter increased
        13 percent, reflecting a 2 percent decrease in concentrate
        sales, positive pricing and mix and a low double-digit
        currency benefit. Operating income increased 16 percent in the
        quarter primarily reflecting the higher net revenues while
        continuing to invest behind key marketing initiatives across
        the group.

   --  The Latin America Group continued to deliver strong unit case
        volume growth of 7 percent in the quarter, successfully
        cycling 9 percent growth in the prior year quarter. Solid unit
        case volume growth across the group and the benefit of
        acquisitions drove the results for the quarter and led to
        volume and value share gains in both sparkling and still
        beverages. Net revenues increased 23 percent in the quarter,
        reflecting a 5 percent increase in concentrate sales, positive
        pricing and mix and a low double-digit currency benefit.
        Operating income increased 29 percent in the quarter,
        reflecting the net revenue increase while continuing to invest
        in key marketing initiatives.

   --  In Mexico, unit case volume increased 10 percent in the
        quarter. The growth was led by brand Coca-Cola, which
        increased unit case volume 3 percent and the successful
        integration of Jugos del Valle, which contributed 3 points of
        the overall unit case growth. Strong performance in sparkling
        and still beverages led to share gains in sparkling beverages,
        energy drinks, packaged water, juices and sports drinks.

   --  In Brazil, unit case volume growth for the quarter was 1
        percent, successfully cycling 22 percent growth in the prior
        year. Performance in the quarter was impacted by a volume
        decline in April resulting from a slowdown in industry growth
        as consumers used the availability of credit to drive durable
        goods growth. Trademark Coca-Cola unit case volume increased 1
        percent in the quarter, and both sparkling and still beverages
        gained volume and value share in the quarter.

   --  In Argentina, strong sparkling beverage growth, led by
        Trademark Coca-Cola, contributed to unit case volume growth of
        7 percent in the quarter, successfully cycling 7 percent
        growth in the prior year quarter and driving sparkling
        beverage share gains.

   --  Unit case volume in the North America Group was even in the
        quarter, reflecting a continued difficult U.S. economic
        environment and a shift in the impact of holidays out of the
        second quarter. Retail unit case volume increased 1 percent,
        including a benefit from acquisitions, and Foodservice and
        Hospitality declined 3 percent, reflecting the continued
        challenging foodservice industry environment. Net revenues for
        the quarter increased 8 percent, reflecting a 3 percent
        decrease in concentrate sales, positive pricing and mix of
        finished goods businesses and an increase from acquisitions.
        Operating income decreased 9 percent in the quarter reflecting
        the growth in net revenues, including the benefit of
        acquisitions, offset by higher input costs in the finished
        goods businesses, unfavorable mix and continued investment in
        key business initiatives.

   --  Sparkling beverage unit case volume declined 4 percent in the
        quarter, primarily reflecting the decline in foodservice and
        other on-premise businesses. The continued successful
        execution of the three-cola strategy resulted in Coca-Cola
        Classic, Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero combined gaining volume
        and value share in the U.S. Coca-Cola Zero continued to
        deliver strong performance, increasing unit case volume more
        than 40 percent in the quarter, cycling strong double-digit
        growth in the prior year quarter.

   --  Still beverage unit case volume increased 9 percent in the
        quarter and achieved volume and value share gains, reflecting
        the continued strong performance of glaceau and Fuze as well
        as strong growth in juices and juice drinks. The growth in
        juices and juice drinks was led by double-digit unit case
        volume growth of warehouse-delivered juices, which continued
        to gain volume and value share, reflecting the success of
        Trademark Simply and Minute Maid Enhanced Juices.

   --  The Pacific Group increased unit case volume 4 percent in the
        quarter, cycling 9 percent growth in the prior year quarter,
        and reflected the impact from natural disasters and
        unfavorable weather. Net revenues increased 13 percent,
        reflecting a 3 percent increase in concentrate sales, positive
        pricing and a low-teens currency benefit, partially offset by
        unfavorable country mix. Operating income increased 19 percent
        reflecting the increase in net revenues while investing in key
        business initiatives, including the Olympics activation.

   --  In Japan, unit case volume declined 1 percent in the quarter,
        cycling 4 percent growth in the prior year quarter, while

        volume growth driven by the success of Coca-Cola Zero and the
        execution of the three-cola strategy. Georgia Coffee unit case
        volume increased 4 percent in the quarter and 3 percent
        year-to-date, its third consecutive quarter of growth and its
        highest growth rate in more than 5 years. Volume declines in
        Sokenbicha and Aquarius reflected unfavorable weather late in
        the quarter. Our outlook for Japan remains positive reflecting
        initiatives to stabilize and return the business to
        sustainable growth.

   --  In China, despite being impacted by earthquakes and flooding
        across various regions, unit case volume increased 13 percent
        in the quarter led by strong growth in Trademark Coca-Cola,
        Trademark Sprite and Minute Maid. The strong performance
        across the brands resulted in share gains in both sparkling
        and still beverages. Olympic activation through innovative
        consumer and customer marketing continues with The Coca-Cola
        Company recently being recognized as the most effective
        sponsor of the Olympics in China.

   --  In the Philippines, unit case volume increased 3 percent in
        the quarter, cycling 11 percent growth in the prior year
        quarter. While unit case volume was negatively impacted
        primarily by poor weather conditions in the quarter as well as
        pressure from the impact of food inflation on consumer
        discretionary spending, the performance reflected volume and
        value share gains in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages and
        in sparkling beverages.

   --  The Bottling Investments Group's unit case volume increased 16
        percent in the quarter, reflecting unit case volume growth
        across the group as well as a benefit from the acquisitions of
        certain bottlers in the prior year. Net revenues increased 30
        percent in the quarter as a result of the unit case volume
        increase, the acquisition of certain bottlers and a mid-teens
        currency benefit. Operating income more than doubled in the
        quarter due to the increase in net revenues, the cycling of
        restructuring charges in the prior year quarter and the
        continued focus on driving sustained financial performance
        through investments in market execution capabilities, enhanced
        supply chain efficiencies and controlled operating expenses.

   Financial Review

   Operating Results

   Net operating revenues for the quarter increased 17 percent,
reflecting a 3 percent increase in concentrate sales, a 2 percent
increase from structural changes resulting primarily from acquisitions
of certain bottlers, a 3 percent benefit from pricing and mix and a 9
percent positive currency impact.

   Cost of goods sold increased 16 percent for the quarter,
reflecting a 3 percent increase in concentrate sales, a 2 percent
increase from structural changes resulting primarily from acquisitions
of certain bottlers, an 8 percent increase from currency and increases
in commodity-based input and freight costs.

   Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter
increased 16 percent, with structural changes primarily related to
bottler acquisitions, increased costs from brand acquisitions and
currency increasing selling, general and administrative expenses by 14
percent. The Company continued to achieve expense leverage through
investing in marketing to support brand growth while effectively
managing general and administrative expenses through productivity
initiatives.

   The Company had other operating charges in the quarter of $97
million related to restructuring charges, contract termination costs
and asset write-downs.

   Operating income for the quarter increased 18 percent, reflecting
the growth in gross profit, the investments in marketing and increased
sales and service expenses. After considering items impacting
comparability, operating income increased 20 percent. Currency
increased operating income in the quarter by 11 percent. Based on
current expectations of market rates for the remainder of the year and
benefits of hedging coverage in place, the Company currently expects a
favorable currency impact on 2008 operating income of at least
mid-single digits.

   Equity income declined in the quarter primarily as a result of our
proportionate share of the non-cash impairment charge recorded by CCE.

   In the quarter, the Company recorded gains on the sales of assets
of $102 million primarily related to the sale of a Brazilian bottler
to Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V.

   Effective Tax Rate

   The reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.0 percent
and the underlying effective tax rate on operations for the quarter
was 22.0 percent. The variance between the reported rate and the
underlying rate was due to the tax impact of various separately
disclosed items impacting comparability.

   The Company anticipates that its underlying effective tax rate on
operations for the full year 2008 will be 22.0 percent. The Company's
estimated underlying effective tax rate does not reflect the impact of
discrete events, which, if and when they occur, are separately
recognized in the appropriate period.

   Productivity Savings

   The Company is targeting $400 to $500 million in annualized
savings from productivity initiatives by year-end 2011 to provide
additional flexibility to invest for growth. The savings are expected
to be generated in a number of areas, including aggressively managing
operating expenses supported by lean techniques, redesigning key
processes to drive standardization and effectiveness, better
leveraging our size and scale, and driving savings in indirect costs
through the implementation of a "procure-to-pay" program. In realizing
the savings, the Company expects to incur total nonrecurring costs by
2011 approximately equal to the annualized savings.

   New Operating Structure

   As previously communicated, effective July 1, 2008, the Company
made certain changes to its operating structure to align geographic
responsibility. The European Union Group was reconfigured to include
the Adriatic and Balkans Region and was renamed the Europe Group; and
the remaining Eurasia Group was combined with the Africa Group into
the new Eurasia &amp; Africa Group. The changes in operating structure did
not impact the other existing geographic operating segments, Bottling
Investments or Corporate. Reporting on the new structure will start
with third quarter 2008 results. Reclassified operating segment
information will be published during the third quarter of 2008.

   Items Impacting Prior Year Results

   In 2007, the second quarter results included a net charge of $0.05
per share primarily related to restructuring charges and a non-cash
impairment charge at an equity investee. In 2007, the first quarter
results included a net charge of $0.02 per share primarily related to
an asset write-off in the Philippines bottler, partially offset by
gains on the sales of the equity interest in a Brazilian bottler and
real estate in Spain.

   Conference Call

   The Company will host a conference call with investors and
analysts to discuss the second quarter results today at 8:30 a.m.
(EDT). The Company invites investors to listen to the live audiocast
of the conference call at the Company's Web site,
www.thecoca-colacompany.com in the "Investors" section. A replay in
downloadable MP3 format will also be available within 24 hours after
the audiocast on the Company's Web site. Further, the "Investors"
section of the Company's Web site includes a reconciliation of
non-GAAP financial measures that may be used periodically by
management when discussing the Company's financial results with
investors and analysts to our results as reported under GAAP.

The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U. S.
 generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management
 believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used in managing
 the business may provide users of this financial information
 additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results
 in prior operating periods. Management believes that these non-GAAP
 financial measures can provide additional meaningful reflection of
 underlying trends of the business because they provide a comparison
 of historical information that excludes certain items that impact the
 overall comparability. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial
 measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in
 evaluating the Company's performance. See the Table above for
 supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP
 financial measures for the three months ended June 27, 2008 and June
 29, 2007. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition
 to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results
 prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U. S.
 generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management
 believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used in managing
 the business may provide users of this financial information
 additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results
 in prior operating periods. Management believes that these non-GAAP
 financial measures can provide additional meaningful reflection of
 underlying trends of the business because they provide a comparison
 of historical information that excludes certain items that impact the
 overall comparability. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial
 measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in
 evaluating the Company's performance. See the Table above for
 supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP
 financial measures for the six months ended June 27, 2008 and June
 29, 2007. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition
 to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results
 prepared in accordance with GAAP.

(after-tax) related to the acquisition of The Bear Stearns Companies Inc., which
closed on May 30, 2008. Excluding these items, net income would have been $2.5
billion.

Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the quarter:
"Our earnings were down significantly due to the unfavorable credit environment
and market conditions. The Investment Bank took additional markdowns on
leveraged loans and mortgage-related positions. Retail Financial Services
experienced further deterioration in its home lending portfolio, which resulted
in higher charge-offs and an increase in the allowance for credit losses.
However, the firm overall continued to maintain solid underlying business
momentum. We had market share gains in Investment Banking fees and key product
areas. Retail Financial Services posted organic revenue growth of 15%, and all
of our major businesses produced growth in accounts, balances and volumes.
Further positive results in the quarter included record performance from both
Commercial Banking and Treasury &amp; Securities Services."

Mr. Dimon added, "We also completed the highly complex Bear Stearns acquisition
as planned. Through the truly remarkable partnership and efforts of our people
in extremely difficult times, we made great progress towards full integration,
while also significantly reducing our combined risk positions. We now have an
expanded platform to better serve our institutional clients - one which we fully
expect will make our franchise stronger over time."

Mr. Dimon further remarked, "I am pleased with the strength of our balance sheet
and capital positions, particularly in the context of the market challenges we
have faced during the past year. During the quarter, we added $1.3 billion to
our allowance for credit losses (which now totals $13.9 billion) and maintained
strong capital ratios."

Discussing the firm's outlook, Dimon said, "Our expectation is for the economic
environment to continue to be weak - and to likely get weaker - and for the
capital markets to remain under stress. We remain conscious that since
substantial risks still remain on our balance sheet, these factors will likely
affect our business for the remainder of the year or longer. However, the firm
has delivered underlying growth across most of our businesses, and with our
substantial capital base we can continue to invest for the future. In spite of
the environment, we are confident that we are building an increasingly strong
and profitable company."

In the discussion below of the business segments and JPMorgan Chase, information
is presented on a managed basis. Managed basis starts with GAAP results and
includes the following adjustments: for Card Services and the firm as a whole,
the impact of credit card securitizations is excluded, and for each line of
business and the firm as a whole, net revenue is shown on a tax-equivalent
basis. For more information about managed basis, as well as other non-GAAP
financial measures used by management to evaluate the performance of each line
of business, see Notes 1 and 2 (page 12).

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $394 million, a decrease from net income of $1.2 billion in the
prior year. The lower results reflected increased noninterest expense, a decline
in net revenue and a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by the
benefit of reduced deferred tax liabilities.

Net revenue was $5.5 billion, a decrease of $328 million, or 6%, from the prior
year. Investment banking fees were $1.7 billion (the second-highest quarter
ever), down 9% from the prior year. Advisory fees of $370 million were down 34%
from the prior year, reflecting reduced levels of activity. Debt underwriting
fees of $823 million were down 1%, driven by a decline in loan syndication fees
reflecting market conditions offset by higher bond underwriting fees. Equity
underwriting fees were $542 million, up 6% from the prior year. Fixed Income
Markets revenue was $2.3 billion, down $98 million, or 4%, from the prior year,
driven largely by net markdowns of $696 million on leveraged lending funded and
unfunded commitments, as well as mortgage-related net markdowns of $405 million.
These marks were partially offset by strong performance in rates, currencies,
emerging markets, and credit trading, as well as gains of $165 million from the
widening of the firm's credit spread on certain structured liabilities. Equity
Markets revenue was $1.1 billion, down $170 million, or 14% from the prior year,
driven by weak trading results offset partially by strong client revenue and a
gain of $149 million from the widening of the firm's credit spread on certain
structured liabilities. Credit Portfolio revenue was $309 million, up $105
million, or 51% from the prior year, reflecting increased net interest income on
higher loan balances.

The provision for credit losses was $398 million, compared with $164 million in
the prior year. The current-quarter provision reflects a weakening credit
environment. Net recoveries were $8 million, compared with net recoveries of $16
million in the prior year. The allowance for loan losses to total loans retained
was 3.19% for the current quarter, an increase from 1.76% in the prior year.

Average loans retained were $76.2 billion, an increase of $17.2 billion, or 29%,
from the prior year, largely driven by growth in acquisition finance activity,
including leveraged lending, and a facility extended to Bear Stearns. Average
fair value and held-for-sale loans were $20.4 billion, up $5.6 billion, or 38%,
from the prior year.

Noninterest expense was $4.7 billion, an increase of $880 million, or 23%, from
the prior year, largely driven by higher compensation expense and the Bear
Stearns acquisition.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $606 million, a decrease of $179 million, or 23%, from the prior
year, as a significant increase in the provision for credit losses in Regional
Banking was offset largely by revenue growth in all businesses.

Net revenue was $5.0 billion, an increase of $658 million, or 15%, from the
prior year. Net interest income was $3.0 billion, up $382 million, or 14%, due
to higher loan balances, wider deposit spreads and higher deposit balances.
Noninterest revenue was $2.0 billion, up $276 million, or 16%, driven by higher
net mortgage servicing revenue, higher mortgage production revenue and increased
deposit-related fees.

The provision for credit losses was $1.3 billion, as housing price declines have
continued to result in significant increases in estimated losses, particularly
for high loan-to-value home equity and mortgage loans. Home equity net
charge-offs were $511 million (2.16% net charge-off rate), compared with $98
million (0.44% net charge-off rate) in the prior year. Subprime mortgage net
charge-offs were $192 million (4.98% net charge-off rate), compared with $26
million (1.21% net charge-off rate) in the prior year. Prime mortgage net
charge-offs (including net charge-offs reflected in the Corporate segment) were
$104 million (0.91% net charge-off rate), compared with $4 million (0.05% net
charge-off rate) in the prior year. The current-quarter provision includes an
increase in the allowance for loan losses of $430 million due to increases in
estimated losses in the subprime and prime mortgage portfolios. An additional
provision for prime mortgage loans of $170 million has been reflected in the
Corporate segment.

Noninterest expense was $2.7 billion, an increase of $186 million, or 7%, from
the prior year, reflecting higher mortgage production and servicing expense, and
investment in the retail distribution network.

Regional Banking net income was $354 million, down $275 million, or 44%, from
the prior year. Net revenue was $3.6 billion, up $320 million, or 10%,
benefiting from higher loan balances, wider deposit spreads, higher
deposit-related fees and higher deposit balances. The provision for credit
losses was $1.2 billion, compared with $494 million in the prior year. The
provision reflected weakness in the home equity and mortgage portfolios (see
Retail Financial Services discussion of the provision for credit losses for
further detail). Noninterest expense was $1.8 billion, up $29 million, or 2%,
from the prior year, due to investment in the retail distribution network.

Key Metrics and Business Updates:

(All comparisons to the prior-year quarter except as noted)

    --  Checking accounts totaled 11.3 million, up 980,000, or 9%.

    --  Average total deposits grew to $213.9 billion, up $6.6 billion, or 3%.

    --  Average home equity loans were $95.1 billion, up $5.9 billion, or 7%.
        Home equity originations were $5.3 billion, down $9.3 billion, or 64%.

    --  Average business banking loans were $16.1 billion and originations were
        $1.7 billion.

    --  Number of branches grew to 3,157, up 68.

    --  Branch sales of credit cards increased 4%.

    --  Branch sales of investment products increased 2%.

    --  Overhead ratio (excluding amortization of core deposit intangibles)
        decreased to 47% from 50%.

Mortgage Banking net income was $169 million, an increase of $98 million, or
138% from the prior year. Net revenue was $922 million, up $289 million, or 46%.
Net revenue comprises production revenue and net mortgage servicing revenue.
Production revenue was $597 million, up $134 million, predominantly benefiting
from higher loan originations. Net mortgage servicing revenue, which includes
loan servicing revenue, MSR risk management results and other changes in fair
value, was $325 million, compared with $170 million in the prior year. Loan
servicing revenue of $678 million increased by $63 million on growth of 15% in
third-party loans serviced. MSR risk management results were positive $41
million compared with negative $62 million in the prior year. Other changes in
fair value of the MSR asset were negative $394 million compared with negative
$383 million in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $649 million, an
increase of $133 million, or 26%. The increase reflected higher mortgage
reinsurance losses, higher production expense due in part to growth in
origination volume, and higher servicing costs due to increased delinquencies
and defaults.

Key Metrics and Business Updates:

(All comparisons to the prior-year quarter except as noted)

    --  Mortgage loan originations were $56.1 billion, up 27% from the prior
        year and 19% from the prior quarter.

    --  Total third-party mortgage loans serviced were $659.1 billion, an
        increase of $86.7 billion, or 15%.

Auto Finance net income was $83 million, a decrease of $2 million, or 2%, from
the prior year. Net revenue was $498 million, up $48 million, or 11%, driven by
higher loan balances and increased automobile operating lease revenue. The
provision for credit losses was $117 million, up $25 million, reflecting higher
estimated losses. The net charge-off rate was 1.07%, compared with 0.61% in the
prior year. Noninterest expense of $243 million increased by $24 million, or
11%, driven by increased depreciation expense on owned automobiles subject to
operating leases.

Key Metrics and Business Updates:

(All comparisons to the prior-year quarter except as noted)

    --  Auto loan originations were $5.6 billion, up 6%.

    --  Average loans were $44.7 billion, up 11%.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $250 million, a decline of $509 million, or 67%, from the prior
year. The decrease was driven by a higher provision for credit losses.

End-of-period managed loans of $155.4 billion grew by $7.4 billion, or 5%, from
the prior year and $4.4 billion, or 3%, from the prior quarter. Average managed
loans of $152.8 billion increased $5.4 billion, or 4%, from the prior year and
were flat from the prior quarter, reflecting seasonal patterning. The increase
from the prior year in both end-of-period and average managed loans reflects
organic portfolio growth.

Managed net revenue was $3.8 billion, an increase of $58 million, or 2%, from
the prior year. Net interest income was $3.0 billion, up $56 million, or 2%,
from the prior year. The increase in net interest income was driven by higher
average managed loan balances, an increased level of fees and wider loan
spreads. These benefits were offset largely by the effect of higher revenue
reversals associated with higher charge-offs. Noninterest revenue of $764
million was flat compared with the prior year. Increased interchange income (the
result of charge volume growth of 6%), higher revenue from fee-based products,
and higher securitization income were offset by increased rewards expense and
higher volume-driven payments to partners (both of which are netted against
interchange income).

The managed provision for credit losses was $2.2 billion, an increase of $863
million, or 65%, from the prior year, due to a higher level of charge-offs and
an increase of $300 million in the allowance for loan losses. The managed net
charge-off rate for the quarter was 4.98%, up from 3.62% in the prior year and
4.37% in the prior quarter. The 30-day managed delinquency rate was 3.46%, up
from 3.00% in the prior year and down from 3.66% in the prior quarter,
reflecting seasonal patterning.

Noninterest expense of $1.2 billion was flat compared with the prior year.

Key Metrics and Business Updates:

(All comparisons to the prior-year quarter except as noted)

    --  Return on equity was 7%, down from 22%.

    --  Pretax income to average managed loans (ROO) was 1.04%, compared with
        3.26% in the prior year and 2.52% in the prior quarter.

    --  Net interest income as a percentage of average managed loans was 7.92%,
        down from 8.04% in the prior year and 8.34% in the prior quarter.

    --  Net accounts of 3.6 million were opened during the quarter.

    --  Charge volume was $93.6 billion, an increase of $5.6 billion, or 6%. The
        growth reflects an increase of 7% in sales volume and a 4% increase in
        balance transfers.

    --  Announced the termination of Chase Paymentech Solutions, a global
        payments and merchant acquiring joint venture between JPMorgan Chase and
        First Data Corporation. The dissolution is expected to be completed by
        year-end 2008 and JPMorgan Chase will retain approximately 51% of the
        business under the Chase Paymentech name.

    --  Merchant processing volume was $199.3 billion, an increase of $19.6
        billion, or 11%, and total transactions were 5.6 billion, an increase of
        812 million, or 17%.

*T

Discussion of Results:

Net income was a record $355 million, an increase of $71 million, or 25%, from
the prior year driven by record net revenue and lower noninterest expense.

Net revenue was a record $1.1 billion, an increase of $99 million, or 10%, from
the prior year. Net interest income was $723 million, up $28 million, or 4%. The
increase was driven by double-digit growth in liability and loan balances,
largely offset by spread compression in the liability and loan portfolios and a
continued shift to narrower-spread liability products. Noninterest revenue was
$383 million, an increase of $71 million, or 23%, from the prior year, largely
reflecting higher deposit-related fees as well as increases in other fee income.

Middle Market Banking revenue was $708 million, an increase of $55 million, or
8%, from the prior year. Mid-Corporate Banking revenue was $235 million, an
increase of $38 million, or 19%. Real Estate Banking revenue was $94 million, a
decline of $15 million, or 14%.

The provision for credit losses was $47 million, an increase of $2 million, or
4%, from the prior year. The current-quarter provision largely reflects growth
in loan balances. The allowance for loan losses to total loans retained was
2.61% for the current quarter, down from 2.63% in the prior year and 2.65% in
the prior quarter. Nonperforming loans were $486 million, up $351 million from
the prior year and up $40 million from the prior quarter, reflecting increases
in nonperforming loans in each business segment and the effect of a weakening
credit environment. Net charge-offs were $49 million (0.28% net charge-off
rate), compared with recoveries of $8 million (0.05% net recovery rate) in the
prior year and net charge-offs of $81 million (0.48% net charge-off rate) in the
prior quarter.

Noninterest expense was $476 million, a decrease of $20 million, or 4%, from the
prior year.

Key Metrics and Business Updates:

(All comparisons to the prior-year quarter except as noted)

    --  Overhead ratio was 43%, an improvement from 49%.

    --  Record gross investment banking revenue (which is shared with the
        Investment Bank) was $270 million, up by $34 million, or 14%.

    --  Average loan balances were $71.1 billion, up $11.2 billion, or 19%, from
        the prior year and up $3.0 billion, or 4%, from the prior quarter.

    --  Average liability balances were $99.4 billion, up $15.2 billion, or 18%,
        from the prior year and flat compared with the prior quarter.

*T

Discussion of Results:

Net income was a record $425 million, an increase of $73 million, or 21%, from
the prior year, driven by record net revenue, partially offset by higher
noninterest expense. Net income was up $22 million, or 5%, from the prior
quarter and the current quarter included increased revenue from seasonal
activity in securities lending and depositary receipts. These benefits were
partially offset by a normalization of spreads in securities lending, as
compared with the prior quarter.

Net revenue was a record $2.0 billion, an increase of $278 million, or 16%, from
the prior year. Worldwide Securities Services net revenue of $1.2 billion was a
record, up $146 million, or 14%, from the prior year. The growth was driven by
increased product usage by new and existing clients (largely in custody, funds
services and depositary receipts), wider spreads in securities lending and
higher levels of market volatility in foreign exchange driven by recent market
conditions. These benefits were offset partially by spread compression on
liability products. Treasury Services net revenue was a record $852 million, an
increase of $132 million, or 18%, from the prior year. This increase reflected
higher liability balances and wider market-driven spreads as well as growth in
electronic and trade loan volumes. TSS firmwide net revenue, which includes
Treasury Services net revenue recorded in other lines of business, grew to $2.7
billion, up $346 million, or 15%. Treasury Services firmwide net revenue grew to
$1.6 billion, up $200 million, or 15%.

Noninterest expense was $1.3 billion, an increase of $168 million, or 15%, from
the prior year, reflecting higher expense related to business and volume growth
as well as continued investment in new product platforms.

Key Metrics and Business Updates:

(All comparisons to the prior-year quarter except as noted)

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $395 million, a decline of $98 million, or 20%, from the prior
year driven largely by lower performance fees and higher expense offset
partially by increased net revenue from growth in deposit and loan balances.

Net revenue was $2.1 billion, a decrease of $73 million, or 3%, from the prior
year. Noninterest revenue was $1.7 billion, a decline of $141 million, or 8%,
due to lower performance fees and the effect of lower markets offset partially
by increased revenue from net asset inflows, higher placement fees and the
acquisition of Bear Stearns. Net interest income was $361 million, up $68
million, or 23%, from the prior year, predominantly due to higher deposit and
loan balances.

Private Bank revenue grew 18% to $765 million due to increased deposit and loan
balances, higher placement fees and higher assets under management, partially
offset by lower performance fees. Retail revenue declined 19% to $490 million
due to net equity outflows. Institutional revenue declined 24% to $472 million
due to lower performance fees, partially offset by growth in assets under
management. Private Client Services revenue grew 10% to $299 million due to
higher deposit and loan balances and growth in assets under management. Bear
Stearns Brokerage added $38 million to revenue.

Assets under supervision were $1.6 trillion, an increase of $139 billion, or 9%,
from the prior year. Assets under management were $1.2 trillion, up $76 billion,
or 7%, from the prior year. The increase was due largely to liquidity product
inflows across all segments and the Bear Stearns acquisition offset partially by
lower equity markets and equity product outflows. Custody, brokerage,
administration and deposit balances were $426 billion, up $63 billion, driven by
the acquisition of Bear Stearns Brokerage.

The provision for credit losses was $17 million, compared with a benefit of $11
million in the prior year, reflecting an increase in loan balances and a lower
level of recoveries.

Noninterest expense was $1.4 billion, up $45 million, or 3%, from the prior
year, largely driven by the Bear Stearns acquisition and increased headcount
offset partially by lower performance-based compensation.

Key Metrics and Business Updates:

(All comparisons to the prior-year quarter except as noted)

    --  Pretax margin(2) was 31%, down from 37%.

    --  Assets under management were $1.2 trillion, up $76 billion, or 7%,
        including growth of $11 billion, or 9%, in alternative assets and $15
        billion from the Bear Stearns acquisition.

    --  Assets under management net outflows were $3 billion for the second
        quarter of 2008. Net inflows were $110 billion for the past 12-month
        period.

    --  Assets under management that ranked in the top two quartiles for
        investment performance were 76% over five years, 70% over three years
        and 51% over one year.

    --  Customer assets in 4 and 5 Star rated funds were 40%.

    --  Average loans of $39.3 billion were up $10.6 billion, or 37%.

    --  Average deposits of $70.0 billion were up $14.0 billion, or 25%.

Discussion of Results:

Net loss for Corporate / Private Equity was $422 million, compared with net
income of $382 million in the prior year.

Net loss included the after-tax effects of Bear Stearns merger-related items
amounting to a net loss of $540 million. These items included losses of $423
million, which represent JPMorgan Chase's 49.4% ownership in Bear Stearns'
losses from April 8 to May 30, 2008, which were reflected in net revenue. In
addition, other merger-related items of $117 million ($188 million pretax) were
reflected almost entirely in noninterest expense.

Net income for Private Equity was $99 million, compared with $702 million in the
prior year. Net revenue was $197 million, a decrease of $1.1 billion, reflecting
Private Equity gains of $220 million, compared with gains of $1.3 billion in the
prior year. Noninterest expense was $44 million, a decline of $154 million from
the prior year, reflecting lower compensation expense.

Excluding the after-tax effect of Bear Stearns merger-related items of negative
$540 million, net income for Corporate was $19 million, compared with a net loss
of $320 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $452 million, compared with a
negative $231 million in the prior year, reflecting a higher level of securities
gains, predominantly related to a gain of $668 million from the sale of
MasterCard shares, and a wider net interest spread. These benefits were offset
partially by trading-related losses. The current-quarter provision for credit
losses includes an increase in the allowance for loan losses of $170 million for
prime mortgage (see Retail Financial Services' discussion of provision for loan
losses for further detail). Noninterest expense was $170 million, a decrease of
$135 million, or 44%, from the prior year. The decrease reflected reduced
litigation expense and the absence of prior-year merger expense related to the
Bank One merger.

Key Metrics and Business Updates:

(All comparisons to the prior-year quarter except as noted)

    --  Private Equity portfolio was $7.7 billion, up from $6.5 billion in the
        prior year and $6.6 billion in the prior quarter. The portfolio
        represented 8.9% of total stockholders' equity less goodwill, up from
        8.8% in the prior year and 8.3% in the prior quarter.

(a) Presented on a managed basis; see Note 1 (page 12) for further
 explanation of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis was
 $18,399 million, $16,890 million and $18,908 million for the second
 quarter of 2008, first quarter of 2008 and second quarter of 2007,
 respectively.
*T

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $2.0 billion, a decrease of $2.2 billion, or 53%, from the prior
year. The decline in earnings was driven by a higher provision for credit losses
and increased noninterest expense.

Managed net revenue was $19.7 billion, a decrease of $141 million, or 1%, from
the prior year. Noninterest revenue of $9.5 billion was down $2.6 billion, or
22%, due to lower principal transactions revenue, which reflected net markdowns
on leveraged lending funded and unfunded commitments and mortgage-related
markdowns, and lower levels of private equity gains. In addition, the firm's
share of Bear Stearns' losses from April 8 to May 30 2008, and lower investment
banking fees contributed to the decline in noninterest revenue. The decline was
offset partially by a gain on the sale of MasterCard shares. Net interest income
was $10.2 billion, up $2.5 billion, or 33%, due to higher trading-related net
interest income and higher loan and deposit balances.

The managed provision for credit losses was $4.3 billion, up $2.2 billion, or
102%, from the prior year. The total consumer-managed provision for credit
losses was $3.8 billion, compared with $1.9 billion in the prior year,
reflecting increases in the allowance for credit losses predominantly related to
subprime mortgage, prime mortgage and credit card loans, as well as higher net
charge-offs. Consumer-managed net charge-offs were $2.9 billion, compared with
$1.6 billion, resulting in a managed net charge-off rate of 3.08% and 1.90%,
respectively. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $505 million,
compared with $198 million in the prior year, due to an increase in the
allowance for credit losses reflecting the effect of a weakening credit
environment and loan growth. Wholesale net charge-offs were $41 million,
compared with net recoveries of $29 million, resulting in net charge-off rates
of 0.08% and a net recovery rate of 0.07%, respectively. The firm had total
nonperforming assets of $6.6 billion at June 30, 2008, up from the prior-year
level of $2.6 billion.

Noninterest expense was $12.2 billion, up $1.1 billion, or 10%, from the prior
year. The increase was driven by higher compensation expense, the acquisition of
Bear Stearns (including merger-related costs) and higher mortgage production and
servicing expense.

Key Metrics and Business Updates:

(All comparisons to the prior-year quarter except as noted)

    --  Tier 1 capital ratio was 9.1% at June 30, 2008 (estimated), 8.3% at
        March 31, 2008, and 8.4% at June 30, 2007.

    --  Closed the acquisition of The Bear Stearns Companies Inc. on May 30,
        2008. The agreement called for each share of Bear Stearns common stock
        to be exchanged for 0.21753 shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock.

    --  Headcount of 195,594 grew 15,930 since June 30, 2007, predominantly
        reflecting the Bear Stearns acquisition.

Notes:

1. In addition to analyzing the firm's results on a reported basis, management
analyzes the firm's and the lines of business' results on a managed basis, which
is a non-GAAP financial measure. The firm's definition of managed basis starts
with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes the following adjustments:
First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis excludes the impact of
credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for credit
losses, net charge-offs and loan receivables. The presentation of Card Services
results on a managed basis assumes that credit card loans that have been
securitized and sold in accordance with SFAS 140 still remain on the balance
sheet and that the earnings on the securitized loans are classified in the same
manner as the earnings on retained loans recorded on the balance sheet. JPMorgan
Chase uses the concept of managed basis to evaluate the credit performance and
overall financial performance of the entire managed credit card portfolio.
Operations are funded and decisions are made about allocating resources, such as
employees and capital, based upon managed financial information. In addition,
the same underwriting standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both
loans on the balance sheet and securitized loans. Although securitizations
result in the sale of credit card receivables to a trust, JPMorgan Chase retains
the ongoing customer relationships, as the customers may continue to use their
credit cards; accordingly, the customer's credit performance will affect both
the securitized loans and the loans retained on the balance sheet. JPMorgan
Chase believes managed basis information is useful to investors, enabling them
to understand both the credit risks associated with the loans reported on the
balance sheet and the firm's retained interests in securitized loans. Second,
managed revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the
segments and the firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly,
revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is
presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and
investments. This methodology allows management to assess the comparability of
revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding
income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense.
See page 6 of JPMorgan Chase's Earnings Release Financial Supplement (second
quarter of 2008) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase's income statement from
a reported to managed basis.

2. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total
net revenue, which is, in management's view, a comprehensive measure of pretax
performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into
consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate
the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of competitors.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, July 17 (Reuters) - European shares bounced by more
than 2 percent on Thursday after results from U.S. bank JPMorgan
(JPM.N) beat expectations, while Finnish mobile phone maker
Nokia (NOK1V.HE) met forecasts with its earnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By 1033 GMT the FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 of top
European shares was up 2.3 percent at its day high of 1,141.56
points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan reported earnings per share of $0.54, compared with
Reuters estimates for $0.44, helping push up U.S. stock index
futures DJU8 SPU8 NDU8 by 0.3 to 0.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan shares were up 5.7 percent in premarket electronic
trade in New York (JPM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Europe, banks were the strongest performers, with Royal
Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) up 8.2 percent, Banco Santander
(SAN.MC) up 2.6 percent and Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) up 5.5
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adding to the robust tone were Nokia's results, which came
in in line with expectations, reassuring investors somewhat
about consumer spending on discretionary items such as mobile
phones. Nokia shares were last up nearly 8 percent.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) today reported 2008
second-quarter net income of $2.0 billion, compared with net income of
$4.2 billion in the second quarter of 2007. Earnings per share of
$0.54 were down 55%, compared with earnings per share of $1.20 in the
second quarter of 2007. Current-quarter results include the effect of
merger-related items amounting to a net loss of $540 million
(after-tax) related to the acquisition of The Bear Stearns Companies
Inc., which closed on May 30, 2008. Excluding these items, net income
would have been $2.5 billion.

   Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on
the quarter: "Our earnings were down significantly due to the
unfavorable credit environment and market conditions. The Investment
Bank took additional markdowns on leveraged loans and mortgage-related
positions. Retail Financial Services experienced further deterioration
in its home lending portfolio, which resulted in higher charge-offs
and an increase in the allowance for credit losses. However, the firm
overall continued to maintain solid underlying business momentum. We
had market share gains in Investment Banking fees and key product
areas. Retail Financial Services posted organic revenue growth of 15%,
and all of our major businesses produced growth in accounts, balances
and volumes. Further positive results in the quarter included record
performance from both Commercial Banking and Treasury &amp; Securities
Services."

   Mr. Dimon added, "We also completed the highly complex Bear
Stearns acquisition as planned. Through the truly remarkable
partnership and efforts of our people in extremely difficult times, we
made great progress towards full integration, while also significantly
reducing our combined risk positions. We now have an expanded platform
to better serve our institutional clients - one which we fully expect
will make our franchise stronger over time."

   Mr. Dimon further remarked, "I am pleased with the strength of our
balance sheet and capital positions, particularly in the context of
the market challenges we have faced during the past year. During the
quarter, we added $1.3 billion to our allowance for credit losses
(which now totals $13.9 billion) and maintained strong capital
ratios."

   Discussing the firm's outlook, Dimon said, "Our expectation is for
the economic environment to continue to be weak - and to likely get
weaker - and for the capital markets to remain under stress. We remain
conscious that since substantial risks still remain on our balance
sheet, these factors will likely affect our business for the remainder
of the year or longer. However, the firm has delivered underlying
growth across most of our businesses, and with our substantial capital
base we can continue to invest for the future. In spite of the
environment, we are confident that we are building an increasingly
strong and profitable company."

   In the discussion below of the business segments and JPMorgan
Chase, information is presented on a managed basis. Managed basis
starts with GAAP results and includes the following adjustments: for
Card Services and the firm as a whole, the impact of credit card
securitizations is excluded, and for each line of business and the
firm as a whole, net revenue is shown on a tax-equivalent basis. For
more information about managed basis, as well as other non-GAAP
financial measures used by management to evaluate the performance of
each line of business, see Notes 1 and 2 (page 12).

   Discussion of Results:

   Net income was $394 million, a decrease from net income of $1.2
billion in the prior year. The lower results reflected increased
noninterest expense, a decline in net revenue and a higher provision
for credit losses, partially offset by the benefit of reduced deferred
tax liabilities.

   Net revenue was $5.5 billion, a decrease of $328 million, or 6%,
from the prior year. Investment banking fees were $1.7 billion (the
second-highest quarter ever), down 9% from the prior year. Advisory
fees of $370 million were down 34% from the prior year, reflecting
reduced levels of activity. Debt underwriting fees of $823 million
were down 1%, driven by a decline in loan syndication fees reflecting
market conditions offset by higher bond underwriting fees. Equity
underwriting fees were $542 million, up 6% from the prior year. Fixed
Income Markets revenue was $2.3 billion, down $98 million, or 4%, from
the prior year, driven largely by net markdowns of $696 million on
leveraged lending funded and unfunded commitments, as well as
mortgage-related net markdowns of $405 million. These marks were
partially offset by strong performance in rates, currencies, emerging
markets, and credit trading, as well as gains of $165 million from the
widening of the firm's credit spread on certain structured
liabilities. Equity Markets revenue was $1.1 billion, down $170
million, or 14% from the prior year, driven by weak trading results
offset partially by strong client revenue and a gain of $149 million
from the widening of the firm's credit spread on certain structured
liabilities. Credit Portfolio revenue was $309 million, up $105
million, or 51% from the prior year, reflecting increased net interest
income on higher loan balances.

   The provision for credit losses was $398 million, compared with
$164 million in the prior year. The current-quarter provision reflects
a weakening credit environment. Net recoveries were $8 million,
compared with net recoveries of $16 million in the prior year. The
allowance for loan losses to total loans retained was 3.19% for the
current quarter, an increase from 1.76% in the prior year.

   Average loans retained were $76.2 billion, an increase of $17.2
billion, or 29%, from the prior year, largely driven by growth in
acquisition finance activity, including leveraged lending, and a
facility extended to Bear Stearns. Average fair value and
held-for-sale loans were $20.4 billion, up $5.6 billion, or 38%, from
the prior year.

   Noninterest expense was $4.7 billion, an increase of $880 million,
or 23%, from the prior year, largely driven by higher compensation
expense and the Bear Stearns acquisition.

   Key Metrics and Business Updates:

   --  Ranked #1 in Global Debt, Equity and Equity-Related; #1 in

        of 2008, according to Dealogic.

   Discussion of Results:

   Net income was $606 million, a decrease of $179 million, or 23%,
from the prior year, as a significant increase in the provision for
credit losses in Regional Banking was offset largely by revenue growth
in all businesses.

   Net revenue was $5.0 billion, an increase of $658 million, or 15%,
from the prior year. Net interest income was $3.0 billion, up $382
million, or 14%, due to higher loan balances, wider deposit spreads
and higher deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was $2.0 billion, up
$276 million, or 16%, driven by higher net mortgage servicing revenue,
higher mortgage production revenue and increased deposit-related fees.

   The provision for credit losses was $1.3 billion, as housing price
declines have continued to result in significant increases in
estimated losses, particularly for high loan-to-value home equity and
mortgage loans. Home equity net charge-offs were $511 million (2.16%
net charge-off rate), compared with $98 million (0.44% net charge-off
rate) in the prior year. Subprime mortgage net charge-offs were $192
million (4.98% net charge-off rate), compared with $26 million (1.21%
net charge-off rate) in the prior year. Prime mortgage net charge-offs
(including net charge-offs reflected in the Corporate segment) were
$104 million (0.91% net charge-off rate), compared with $4 million
(0.05% net charge-off rate) in the prior year. The current-quarter
provision includes an increase in the allowance for loan losses of
$430 million due to increases in estimated losses in the subprime and
prime mortgage portfolios. An additional provision for prime mortgage
loans of $170 million has been reflected in the Corporate segment.

   Noninterest expense was $2.7 billion, an increase of $186 million,
or 7%, from the prior year, reflecting higher mortgage production and
servicing expense, and investment in the retail distribution network.

   Regional Banking net income was $354 million, down $275 million,
or 44%, from the prior year. Net revenue was $3.6 billion, up $320
million, or 10%, benefiting from higher loan balances, wider deposit
spreads, higher deposit-related fees and higher deposit balances. The
provision for credit losses was $1.2 billion, compared with $494
million in the prior year. The provision reflected weakness in the
home equity and mortgage portfolios (see Retail Financial Services
discussion of the provision for credit losses for further detail).
Noninterest expense was $1.8 billion, up $29 million, or 2%, from the
prior year, due to investment in the retail distribution network.

   Key Metrics and Business Updates:

   (All comparisons to the prior-year quarter except as noted)

   --  Checking accounts totaled 11.3 million, up 980,000, or 9%.

   --  Average total deposits grew to $213.9 billion, up $6.6
        billion, or 3%.

   --  Average home equity loans were $95.1 billion, up $5.9 billion,
        or 7%. Home equity originations were $5.3 billion, down $9.3
        billion, or 64%.

   --  Average business banking loans were $16.1 billion and
        originations were $1.7 billion.

   --  Number of branches grew to 3,157, up 68.

   --  Branch sales of credit cards increased 4%.

   --  Branch sales of investment products increased 2%.

   --  Overhead ratio (excluding amortization of core deposit
        intangibles) decreased to 47% from 50%.

   Mortgage Banking net income was $169 million, an increase of $98
million, or 138% from the prior year. Net revenue was $922 million, up
$289 million, or 46%. Net revenue comprises production revenue and net
mortgage servicing revenue. Production revenue was $597 million, up
$134 million, predominantly benefiting from higher loan originations.
Net mortgage servicing revenue, which includes loan servicing revenue,
MSR risk management results and other changes in fair value, was $325
million, compared with $170 million in the prior year. Loan servicing
revenue of $678 million increased by $63 million on growth of 15% in
third-party loans serviced. MSR risk management results were positive
$41 million compared with negative $62 million in the prior year.
Other changes in fair value of the MSR asset were negative $394
million compared with negative $383 million in the prior year.
Noninterest expense was $649 million, an increase of $133 million, or
26%. The increase reflected higher mortgage reinsurance losses, higher
production expense due in part to growth in origination volume, and
higher servicing costs due to increased delinquencies and defaults.

   Key Metrics and Business Updates:

   (All comparisons to the prior-year quarter except as noted)

   --  Mortgage loan originations were $56.1 billion, up 27% from the
        prior year and 19% from the prior quarter.

   --  Total third-party mortgage loans serviced were $659.1 billion,
        an increase of $86.7 billion, or 15%.

   Auto Finance net income was $83 million, a decrease of $2 million,
or 2%, from the prior year. Net revenue was $498 million, up $48
million, or 11%, driven by higher loan balances and increased
automobile operating lease revenue. The provision for credit losses
was $117 million, up $25 million, reflecting higher estimated losses.
The net charge-off rate was 1.07%, compared with 0.61% in the prior
year. Noninterest expense of $243 million increased by $24 million, or
11%, driven by increased depreciation expense on owned automobiles
subject to operating leases.

   Key Metrics and Business Updates:

   (All comparisons to the prior-year quarter except as noted)

   --  Auto loan originations were $5.6 billion, up 6%.

   Discussion of Results:

   Net income was $250 million, a decline of $509 million, or 67%,
from the prior year. The decrease was driven by a higher provision for
credit losses.

   End-of-period managed loans of $155.4 billion grew by $7.4
billion, or 5%, from the prior year and $4.4 billion, or 3%, from the
prior quarter. Average managed loans of $152.8 billion increased $5.4
billion, or 4%, from the prior year and were flat from the prior
quarter, reflecting seasonal patterning. The increase from the prior
year in both end-of-period and average managed loans reflects organic
portfolio growth.

   Managed net revenue was $3.8 billion, an increase of $58 million,
or 2%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $3.0 billion, up
$56 million, or 2%, from the prior year. The increase in net interest
income was driven by higher average managed loan balances, an
increased level of fees and wider loan spreads. These benefits were
offset largely by the effect of higher revenue reversals associated
with higher charge-offs. Noninterest revenue of $764 million was flat
compared with the prior year. Increased interchange income (the result
of charge volume growth of 6%), higher revenue from fee-based
products, and higher securitization income were offset by increased
rewards expense and higher volume-driven payments to partners (both of
which are netted against interchange income).

   The managed provision for credit losses was $2.2 billion, an
increase of $863 million, or 65%, from the prior year, due to a higher
level of charge-offs and an increase of $300 million in the allowance
for loan losses. The managed net charge-off rate for the quarter was
4.98%, up from 3.62% in the prior year and 4.37% in the prior quarter.
The 30-day managed delinquency rate was 3.46%, up from 3.00% in the
prior year and down from 3.66% in the prior quarter, reflecting
seasonal patterning.

   Noninterest expense of $1.2 billion was flat compared with the
prior year.

   Key Metrics and Business Updates:

   (All comparisons to the prior-year quarter except as noted)

   --  Return on equity was 7%, down from 22%.

   --  Pretax income to average managed loans (ROO) was 1.04%,
        compared with 3.26% in the prior year and 2.52% in the prior
        quarter.

   --  Net interest income as a percentage of average managed loans
        was 7.92%, down from 8.04% in the prior year and 8.34% in the
        prior quarter.

   --  Net accounts of 3.6 million were opened during the quarter.

   --  Charge volume was $93.6 billion, an increase of $5.6 billion,
        or 6%. The growth reflects an increase of 7% in sales volume
        and a 4% increase in balance transfers.

   --  Announced the termination of Chase Paymentech Solutions, a
        global payments and merchant acquiring joint venture between
        JPMorgan Chase and First Data Corporation. The dissolution is
        expected to be completed by year-end 2008 and JPMorgan Chase
        will retain approximately 51% of the business under the Chase
        Paymentech name.

   --  Merchant processing volume was $199.3 billion, an increase of
        $19.6 billion, or 11%, and total transactions were 5.6
        billion, an increase of 812 million, or 17%.

*T

   Discussion of Results:

   Net income was a record $355 million, an increase of $71 million,
or 25%, from the prior year driven by record net revenue and lower
noninterest expense.

   Net revenue was a record $1.1 billion, an increase of $99 million,
or 10%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $723 million, up
$28 million, or 4%. The increase was driven by double-digit growth in
liability and loan balances, largely offset by spread compression in
the liability and loan portfolios and a continued shift to
narrower-spread liability products. Noninterest revenue was $383
million, an increase of $71 million, or 23%, from the prior year,
largely reflecting higher deposit-related fees as well as increases in
other fee income.

   Middle Market Banking revenue was $708 million, an increase of $55
million, or 8%, from the prior year. Mid-Corporate Banking revenue was
$235 million, an increase of $38 million, or 19%. Real Estate Banking
revenue was $94 million, a decline of $15 million, or 14%.

   The provision for credit losses was $47 million, an increase of $2
million, or 4%, from the prior year. The current-quarter provision
largely reflects growth in loan balances. The allowance for loan
losses to total loans retained was 2.61% for the current quarter, down
from 2.63% in the prior year and 2.65% in the prior quarter.
Nonperforming loans were $486 million, up $351 million from the prior
year and up $40 million from the prior quarter, reflecting increases
in nonperforming loans in each business segment and the effect of a
weakening credit environment. Net charge-offs were $49 million (0.28%
net charge-off rate), compared with recoveries of $8 million (0.05%
net recovery rate) in the prior year and net charge-offs of $81
million (0.48% net charge-off rate) in the prior quarter.

   Noninterest expense was $476 million, a decrease of $20 million,
or 4%, from the prior year.

   Key Metrics and Business Updates:

   (All comparisons to the prior-year quarter except as noted)

   --  Overhead ratio was 43%, an improvement from 49%.

   --  Record gross investment banking revenue (which is shared with
        the Investment Bank) was $270 million, up by $34 million, or
        14%.

   --  Average loan balances were $71.1 billion, up $11.2 billion, or
        19%, from the prior year and up $3.0 billion, or 4%, from the
        prior quarter.

   --  Average liability balances were $99.4 billion, up $15.2
        billion, or 18%, from the prior year and flat compared with

*T

   Discussion of Results:

   Net income was a record $425 million, an increase of $73 million,
or 21%, from the prior year, driven by record net revenue, partially
offset by higher noninterest expense. Net income was up $22 million,
or 5%, from the prior quarter and the current quarter included
increased revenue from seasonal activity in securities lending and
depositary receipts. These benefits were partially offset by a
normalization of spreads in securities lending, as compared with the
prior quarter.

   Net revenue was a record $2.0 billion, an increase of $278
million, or 16%, from the prior year. Worldwide Securities Services
net revenue of $1.2 billion was a record, up $146 million, or 14%,
from the prior year. The growth was driven by increased product usage
by new and existing clients (largely in custody, funds services and
depositary receipts), wider spreads in securities lending and higher
levels of market volatility in foreign exchange driven by recent
market conditions. These benefits were offset partially by spread
compression on liability products. Treasury Services net revenue was a
record $852 million, an increase of $132 million, or 18%, from the
prior year. This increase reflected higher liability balances and
wider market-driven spreads as well as growth in electronic and trade
loan volumes. TSS firmwide net revenue, which includes Treasury
Services net revenue recorded in other lines of business, grew to $2.7
billion, up $346 million, or 15%. Treasury Services firmwide net
revenue grew to $1.6 billion, up $200 million, or 15%.

   Noninterest expense was $1.3 billion, an increase of $168 million,
or 15%, from the prior year, reflecting higher expense related to
business and volume growth as well as continued investment in new
product platforms.

   Key Metrics and Business Updates:

   (All comparisons to the prior-year quarter except as noted)

   --  TSS pretax margin(2) was 33%, down from 34% in the prior
        quarter and up from 32% in the prior year.

   Discussion of Results:

   Net income was $395 million, a decline of $98 million, or 20%,
from the prior year driven largely by lower performance fees and
higher expense offset partially by increased net revenue from growth
in deposit and loan balances.

   Net revenue was $2.1 billion, a decrease of $73 million, or 3%,
from the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $1.7 billion, a decline
of $141 million, or 8%, due to lower performance fees and the effect
of lower markets offset partially by increased revenue from net asset
inflows, higher placement fees and the acquisition of Bear Stearns.
Net interest income was $361 million, up $68 million, or 23%, from the
prior year, predominantly due to higher deposit and loan balances.

   Private Bank revenue grew 18% to $765 million due to increased
deposit and loan balances, higher placement fees and higher assets
under management, partially offset by lower performance fees. Retail
revenue declined 19% to $490 million due to net equity outflows.
Institutional revenue declined 24% to $472 million due to lower
performance fees, partially offset by growth in assets under
management. Private Client Services revenue grew 10% to $299 million
due to higher deposit and loan balances and growth in assets under
management. Bear Stearns Brokerage added $38 million to revenue.

   Assets under supervision were $1.6 trillion, an increase of $139
billion, or 9%, from the prior year. Assets under management were $1.2
trillion, up $76 billion, or 7%, from the prior year. The increase was
due largely to liquidity product inflows across all segments and the
Bear Stearns acquisition offset partially by lower equity markets and
equity product outflows. Custody, brokerage, administration and
deposit balances were $426 billion, up $63 billion, driven by the
acquisition of Bear Stearns Brokerage.

   The provision for credit losses was $17 million, compared with a
benefit of $11 million in the prior year, reflecting an increase in
loan balances and a lower level of recoveries.

   Noninterest expense was $1.4 billion, up $45 million, or 3%, from
the prior year, largely driven by the Bear Stearns acquisition and
increased headcount offset partially by lower performance-based
compensation.

   Key Metrics and Business Updates:

   (All comparisons to the prior-year quarter except as noted)

   --  Pretax margin(2) was 31%, down from 37%.

   Discussion of Results:

   Net loss for Corporate / Private Equity was $422 million, compared
with net income of $382 million in the prior year.

   Net loss included the after-tax effects of Bear Stearns
merger-related items amounting to a net loss of $540 million. These
items included losses of $423 million, which represent JPMorgan
Chase's 49.4% ownership in Bear Stearns' losses from April 8 to May
30, 2008, which were reflected in net revenue. In addition, other
merger-related items of $117 million ($188 million pretax) were
reflected almost entirely in noninterest expense.

   Net income for Private Equity was $99 million, compared with $702
million in the prior year. Net revenue was $197 million, a decrease of
$1.1 billion, reflecting Private Equity gains of $220 million,
compared with gains of $1.3 billion in the prior year. Noninterest
expense was $44 million, a decline of $154 million from the prior
year, reflecting lower compensation expense.

   Excluding the after-tax effect of Bear Stearns merger-related
items of negative $540 million, net income for Corporate was $19
million, compared with a net loss of $320 million in the prior year.
Net revenue was $452 million, compared with a negative $231 million in
the prior year, reflecting a higher level of securities gains,
predominantly related to a gain of $668 million from the sale of
MasterCard shares, and a wider net interest spread. These benefits
were offset partially by trading-related losses. The current-quarter
provision for credit losses includes an increase in the allowance for
loan losses of $170 million for prime mortgage (see Retail Financial
Services' discussion of provision for loan losses for further detail).
Noninterest expense was $170 million, a decrease of $135 million, or
44%, from the prior year. The decrease reflected reduced litigation
expense and the absence of prior-year merger expense related to the
Bank One merger.

   Key Metrics and Business Updates:

   (All comparisons to the prior-year quarter except as noted)

   --  Private Equity portfolio was $7.7 billion, up from $6.5
        billion in the prior year and $6.6 billion in the prior
        quarter. The portfolio represented 8.9% of total stockholders'
        equity less goodwill, up from 8.8% in the prior year and 8.3%
        in the prior quarter.

(a) Presented on a managed basis; see Note 1 (page 12) for further
 explanation of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis was
 $18,399 million, $16,890 million and $18,908 million for the second
 quarter of 2008, first quarter of 2008 and second quarter of 2007,
 respectively.
*T

   Discussion of Results:

   Net income was $2.0 billion, a decrease of $2.2 billion, or 53%,
from the prior year. The decline in earnings was driven by a higher
provision for credit losses and increased noninterest expense.

   Managed net revenue was $19.7 billion, a decrease of $141 million,
or 1%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue of $9.5 billion was
down $2.6 billion, or 22%, due to lower principal transactions
revenue, which reflected net markdowns on leveraged lending funded and
unfunded commitments and mortgage-related markdowns, and lower levels
of private equity gains. In addition, the firm's share of Bear
Stearns' losses from April 8 to May 30 2008, and lower investment
banking fees contributed to the decline in noninterest revenue. The
decline was offset partially by a gain on the sale of MasterCard
shares. Net interest income was $10.2 billion, up $2.5 billion, or
33%, due to higher trading-related net interest income and higher loan
and deposit balances.

   The managed provision for credit losses was $4.3 billion, up $2.2
billion, or 102%, from the prior year. The total consumer-managed
provision for credit losses was $3.8 billion, compared with $1.9
billion in the prior year, reflecting increases in the allowance for
credit losses predominantly related to subprime mortgage, prime
mortgage and credit card loans, as well as higher net charge-offs.
Consumer-managed net charge-offs were $2.9 billion, compared with $1.6
billion, resulting in a managed net charge-off rate of 3.08% and
1.90%, respectively. The wholesale provision for credit losses was
$505 million, compared with $198 million in the prior year, due to an
increase in the allowance for credit losses reflecting the effect of a
weakening credit environment and loan growth. Wholesale net
charge-offs were $41 million, compared with net recoveries of $29
million, resulting in net charge-off rates of 0.08% and a net recovery
rate of 0.07%, respectively. The firm had total nonperforming assets
of $6.6 billion at June 30, 2008, up from the prior-year level of $2.6
billion.

   Noninterest expense was $12.2 billion, up $1.1 billion, or 10%,
from the prior year. The increase was driven by higher compensation
expense, the acquisition of Bear Stearns (including merger-related
costs) and higher mortgage production and servicing expense.

   Key Metrics and Business Updates:

   (All comparisons to the prior-year quarter except as noted)

   --  Tier 1 capital ratio was 9.1% at June 30, 2008 (estimated),
        8.3% at March 31, 2008, and 8.4% at June 30, 2007.

   --  Closed the acquisition of The Bear Stearns Companies Inc. on
        May 30, 2008. The agreement called for each share of Bear
        Stearns common stock to be exchanged for 0.21753 shares of
        JPMorgan Chase common stock.

   --  Headcount of 195,594 grew 15,930 since June 30, 2007,
        predominantly reflecting the Bear Stearns acquisition.

   Notes:

   1. In addition to analyzing the firm's results on a reported
basis, management analyzes the firm's and the lines of business'
results on a managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The
firm's definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP
results and includes the following adjustments: First, for Card
Services and the firm, managed basis excludes the impact of credit
card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for credit
losses, net charge-offs and loan receivables. The presentation of Card
Services results on a managed basis assumes that credit card loans
that have been securitized and sold in accordance with SFAS 140 still
remain on the balance sheet and that the earnings on the securitized
loans are classified in the same manner as the earnings on retained
loans recorded on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase uses the concept
of managed basis to evaluate the credit performance and overall
financial performance of the entire managed credit card portfolio.
Operations are funded and decisions are made about allocating
resources, such as employees and capital, based upon managed financial
information. In addition, the same underwriting standards and ongoing
risk monitoring are used for both loans on the balance sheet and
securitized loans. Although securitizations result in the sale of
credit card receivables to a trust, JPMorgan Chase retains the ongoing
customer relationships, as the customers may continue to use their
credit cards; accordingly, the customer's credit performance will
affect both the securitized loans and the loans retained on the
balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase believes managed basis information is
useful to investors, enabling them to understand both the credit risks
associated with the loans reported on the balance sheet and the firm's
retained interests in securitized loans. Second, managed revenue
(noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the segments
and the firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly,
revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax
credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to
taxable securities and investments. This methodology allows management
to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and
tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to
these items is recorded within income tax expense. See page 6 of
JPMorgan Chase's Earnings Release Financial Supplement (second quarter
of 2008) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase's income statement
from a reported to managed basis.

   2. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense
divided by total net revenue, which is, in management's view, a
comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring
earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is,
therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the
performance of TSS and AM against the performance of competitors.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, July 17 (Reuters) - Chevron (CVX.N) has lifted a
force majeure on Escravos crude following repair work to a
pipeline damaged by sabotage in June in Nigeria, the U.S. oil
major said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Force majeure is lifted," Chevron spokeswoman Margaret
Cooper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this week, Chevron said the Escravos production had
been restored at its 120,000-barrel per day pipeline but it was
not clear it had lifted the force majeure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron declared the force majeure to free itself from
meeting all contract obligations in June after armed youths blew
up the pipeline operated by the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At normal rates production of light, sweet Escravos is about
300,000 bpd. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron did not specify current production levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Loading programmes show Escravos exports would average
215,000 bpd for July and August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Ikuko Kao)

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO, July 17 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
handled a Japanese government share sale this week for a record
low fee, underscoring intense competition among investment banks
fighting for a dwindling number of deals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Japanese government sold 103.53 billion yen ($989
million) worth of shares in Chuo Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc
(8309.T) on Monday to help the mid-sized bank repay public money
injected in a state bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman was paid 0.7 percent of the proceeds as fees, five
bankers involved in the sale said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. Daiwa Securities SMBC Co and Nikko Citigroup Ltd, also
underwriters, got 0.8 percent of the proceeds, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is the first time the government has paid different fees
to underwriters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investment banks are competing for a shrinking number of
deals as companies refrain from issuing equity with the stock
market mired in a slump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The market is bad and that is cutting the number of deals,"
said Hitoshi Yamamoto, chief executive officer at Fortis Asset
Management Japan Co. "It's natural fees are being cut amid
intensifying competition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Japanese companies have sold $8.2 billion worth of shares and
convertible bonds since the beginning of this year, roughly half
the $15.9 billion issued in the same period last year, according
to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Underwriters usually get about 3 percent of the proceeds as
fees when sellers of shares are private companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Goldman ranks as the No.4 underwriter so far this year,
lagging behind leader Nomura Holdings Inc (8604.T), Nikko
Citigroup and Daiwa SMBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Competion among investment banks has led to a gradual decline
in fees generated from state share sales. Banks enjoyed fees of 3
percent when the government sold stock in cigarette producer
Japan Tobacco (2914.T) in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Japan sold shares in Chuo Mitsui last year, the fee was
0.88 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UNDERWRITING RISK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fees for this week's sale of Chuo Mitsui stock were the
lowest since the government started selling state-owned shares in
companies and may be seen as not justifying the risk the
underwriters take for handling equity transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Chuo Mitsui, for example, were priced a day before
Japan's benchmark Nikkei average .N225 fell to a 3-   month
low, led down by bank shares on concerns over their exposure to
U.S. mortgage agencies Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac
FRE.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nikko Citigroup spent as much as 12.6 billion yen on
Wednesday to buy 20 million shares in Chuo Mitsui to prevent its
shares from falling below the sale price of 609 yen, according to
data provided by the Tokyo Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sale generated about 830 million yen in fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Officials at Goldman and Nikko Citigroup and Daiwa SMBC

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING, July 17 (Reuters) - Investment banks Goldman Sachs
and JPMorgan trimmed their 2008 growth forecasts for China and
ruled out any interest rate rises this year after the government
said that growth slowed to 10.1 percent in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Economists at both banks said they expected China to continue
increasing banks' required reserve ratio, strengthening the yuan
CNY=CFXS and controlling bank loans, though JPMorgan noted the
possibility of some relaxation of these tightening measures if
growth slows more sharply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rate rises, however, would be off the table this year, as
Beijing is loath to widen the yuan-dollar interest rate
differential and invite more of the capital inflows that have so
complicated China's monetary policy, both banks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs revised down its projections of gross domestic
product (GDP) growth to 10.1 percent for 2008 and 9.5 percent for
2009, which would mark the first time growth dropped below double
digits since 2002. Previously, Goldman had called for 10.5
percent growth this year and 10.0 percent next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman economists Hong Liang and Yu Song said lower
contributions from net exports and investment would serve as
drags, while consumption would remain strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They also changed their interest rate projections, dropping
an earlier forecast for two rate rises by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We no longer expect any hikes to benchmark interest rates
this year, and believe the pressures on interest rates will
mostly transpire into currency appreciation pressures given the
concerns on capital inflows," Liang and Song wrote in a note to
clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan nudged its growth forecast for 2008 down to 10.2
percent from 10.5 percent, saying the export outlook was a
concern but that a domestic fiscal boost, including
infrastructure investment and corporate subsidies, would pick up
the slack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The People's Bank of China (PBOC) will put off raising
interest rates until late in the first quarter of 2009 but will
then increase rates four times that year, taking its cue from the
U.S. Federal Reserve, JPMorgan economists forecast in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In the near term, the central bank is likely to keep its
focus on liquidity management, especially through open market
operations and issuance of PBoC bills," they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Annual gross domestic product growth slowed to 10.1 percent
in the second quarter from 10.6 percent in the first three months
of the year and 11.9 percent in all of 2007, the National Bureau
of Statistics said earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Simon Rabinovitch; Editing by Keiron Henderson)

updated to two decimal places and more on oil's biggest weekly

Friday and drove the Nasdaq down 1 percent on disappointing
earnings from Google (GOOG.O) and Microsoft(MSFT.O), while
Citigroup's smaller-than-expected loss pushed up the Dow and
helped keep the broader market near the unchanged mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nevertheless, the SP 500 and Nasdaq snapped a six-week
losing streak. The Dow snapped four weeks of losses as
financial stocks rallied after top U.S. government officials
outlined a plan to shore up mortgage finance companies Fannie
Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N and the SEC announced
rules to curb short selling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reassuring quarterly results from key banks also fed the
week's rally. Citigroup capped a series of closely watched
scorecards from Wells Fargo (WFC.N) and JPMorgan Chase  Co
(JPM.N) that beat analysts' estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On top of that, the biggest weekly drop ever in oil prices
also gave investors a renewed appetite for equities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite their weekly gain, tech stocks ended the week with
a thud. Google's stock fell almost 10 percent, its biggest
one-day percentage drop since it went public in 2004, and
Microsoft shares slid 6 percent, a day after the tech
bellwethers' quarterly results fell short of expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The government's plan to provide funding for Fannie and
Freddie and the SEC's short-selling rule put a floor, for now,
under financials. But you'll start to see investors
increasingly differentiate between 'the haves and have nots'
in financials," said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist
at RDM Financial, in Westport, Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 49.91 points,
or 0.44 percent, to 11,496.57. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index
.SPX was little changed, up just 0.36 of a point, or 0.03
percent, at 1,260.68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC, meanwhile, shed 29.52
points, or 1.28 percent, to close at 2,282.78.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  For the week, the Dow rose 3.57 percent, its best week in
three months. The SP 500 rose 1.71 percent, while the Nasdaq
finished the week up 1.95 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CITIGROUP SHINES, REGIONAL BANKS WILT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citi's results were a sharp contrast to a
larger-than-expected quarterly loss from Merrill Lynch
MER.N. For most of the session, Merrill's stock was lower,
but it eked out a gain in the last hour of trading. Merrill
ended up 0.6 percent at $30.91.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regional banks, many of which report earnings next week,
were among the top sector drags on the SP 500, suggesting
investor worry that the credit crisis has not run its course
for some of the less diversified, smaller banks. The SP
Regional Banks Index .GSPBNKS fell 0.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup jumped 7.7 percent to $19.35 after the Dow
component reported a smaller-than-expected $2.5 billion loss
and said it would keep cutting costs and getting rid of risky
or poorly performing assets. [ID:nN18431251]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GOOGLE AND MICROSOFT HIT, IBM UP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A wider-than-expected loss by chip maker Advanced Micro
Devices (AMD.N), whose shares fell 12.3 percent to $4.65,
added to concerns about the outlook for the U.S. technology
sector. Advanced Micro Devices' shares trade on the New York
Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google's stock slid 9.8 percent to $481.32 while Microsoft
shares shed 6 percent to $25.86, both in Nasdaq trading.
[ID:nN17350357].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dow component International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N)
bucked the glum technology earnings trend, also boosting the
Dow. IBM's shares rose 2.7 percent to $129.89 on the New York
Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  With earnings season now in full flow, analysts expect
second-quarter SP 500 earnings to drop 17.1 percent. If
second-quarter earnings end up being lower, it will be the
fourth consecutive quarter of negative growth for the SP 500,
the longest losing streak in six years, according to Thomson
Reuters proprietary research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BIGGEST WEEKLY DROP FOR OIL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil CLc1 prices tumbled  on Friday in their biggest
weekly drop -- in dollar terms -- since oil futures began
trading in New York in 1983. That helped support the stock
market. High fuel costs have been adding to concerns about
consumer spending and corporate profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. crude for August delivery settled below $129 a
barrel, after hitting an intraday low at $128.23 -- down
$19.04 from last week's record intraday high at $147.27 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In percentage
terms, the price of crude sank almost 13 percent from its
record high last Friday to this Friday's session low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trading was fairly active on the New York Stock Exchange,
with about 1.71 billion shares changing hands, below last
year's estimated daily average of roughly 1.90 billion, while
on Nasdaq, about 2.29 billion shares traded, above last year's
daily average of 2.17 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by
about 17 to 15, while decliners beat advancers on the Nasdaq
by a ratio of about 4 to 3.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Favorable results from No. 1 U.S. bank Citigroup and technology leader IBM drove the Dow higher on Friday, but the Nasdaq fell on disappointing results from tech icons Google and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil prices fell for a fourth straight day as tensions eased between Iran and the West and on growing concerns that a sluggish economy will slash demand pushed oil lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil slipped below $129 a barrel, extending a slide that has cut prices nearly 13 percent from last week's record peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dollar rose against major currencies after Citigroup's less-than-expected quarterly loss eased investors' grim outlook for the U.S. financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. and euro zone government debt prices fell as Citigroup's results caused investors to unwind their recent flight to safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup's less-than-expected $2.5 billion loss helped financial stocks rally for a third straight session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Google and Microsoft helped drag the Nasdaq down more than 1 percent. Google shares posted their the biggest one-day percentage drop since the Web search company went public in 2004, after Google posted a weaker-than-expected rise in its quarterly profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares declined the most in two years after the software maker's quarterly results fell short of expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a very split market today, right along the financials and technology lines," said Paul Nolte, director of investments at Hinsdale Associates, in Hinsdale Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Financials are actually moving higher, based on OK numbers from Citigroup, but you had some big disappointing numbers from tech, which is worrying," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI closed up 49.91 points, or 0.44 percent, at 11,496.57. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index .SPX added 0.34 points, or 0.03 percent, at 1,260.66. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC fell 29.52 points, or 1.28 percent, at 2,282.78.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The KBW Banks index .BKX rose almost 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Google Inc (GOOG.O) slid 9.8 percent to $481.32, and Microsoft Corp MSFT.O shares shed 6.0 percent to $25.86.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) bucked the glum earnings trend among technology shares after its quarterly earnings blew past Wall Street forecasts and it raised its outlook. IBM was the biggest contributor to the Dow, and its shares rose 2.7 percent to $129.89.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup (C.N) rose 7.7 percent to $19.35, adding more than $5 since touching $14.01 earlier in the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors have long sought signs that Citigroup, the largest U.S. bank by assets, may finally be ready to turn a corner. The New York bank has been one of the hardest hit in a global credit crisis that has festered since last summer,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Citigroup Chief Financial Officer Gary Crittenden on a conference call warned consumer credit costs might have a "meaningful" impact on results for the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Citi is exposed to every aspect of the economy," said Matt McCormick, an analyst at Bahl  Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati. "It's not like the movies where all of a sudden you say, 'And they all lived happily ever after.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CITIGROUP EXTENDS RALLY IN EUROPE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Europe, Citigroup spurred a rally in financial stocks. The FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU of top European shares closed 1.56 percent higher at 1,164.19 points, and gained about 3.2 percent for the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DJStoxx European banks index .SX7P was 4.8 percent higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS (UBSN.VX) jumped 7.6 percent and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) soared 9.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Citigroup created a huge amount of positive excitement for the very reason that they are not as bad as expected and the markets gave them the benefit of the doubt," said Howard Wheeldon, senior strategist at BGC Partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dollar's rise reversed a down-trend for several years. The latest downleg was sparked by concerns about the ability of large banks and other institutions to cope with defaults on imprudent home loans made during the housing bubble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Citi earnings have encouraged the market to take on more risk and given (the dollar) a lift," said Stephen Malyon, senior currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto. They were "consistent with other bank earnings seen earlier this week which has turned sentiment around on the dollar a little bit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 27/32 to yield at 4.10 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond fell 27/32 to yield 4.66 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dollar rose against major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY up 0.24 percent at 72.196. Against the yen, the dollar was up 0.62 percent at 106.91.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The euro fell 0.15 percent at $1.5838.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil's losses this week are the steepest in dollar terms since futures began trading in New York in 1983 and the steepest in percentage terms since December 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. crude settled down 41 cents at $128.88 a barrel, marking the fourth straight day of losses. London Brent crude fell 88 cents to settle at $130.19 barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold ended 1 percent lower as signs of financial market stability reduced bullion's safe-haven appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spot gold traded down at $955.45 by New York's last quote, having earlier slipped as low as $949.50 an ounce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The key reason why we have lower metals in the last couple of days is because of less flight-to-safety buying and a better atmosphere surrounding the financial system," said Bill O'Neill, managing partner of LOGIC Advisors in Upper Saddle River, New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asian stocks fell, hurt by resource-related shares stung by oil's decline this week and by Merrill Lynch's weak results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan's Nikkei share average .N225 slipped 0.7 percent for its sixth straight losing week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in the Asia-Pacific region outside of Japan fell 1.1 percent, according to an MSCI index .MSCIAPJ, and were within striking distance of Wednesday's 16-month low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Matthew Robinson, Ellis Mnyandu, Nick Olivari and Ellen Freilich in New York, and Patrizia Kokot, Santosh Menon, Ikuko Kao, Jan Harvey in London; Writing by Herbert Lash; Editing by Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Updates with Chertoff quotes, police killing) By Eder Lopez SALINA CRUZ, Mexico, July 18 (Reuters) - The Mexican military, working with information from U.S. intelligence services, found nearly six tonnes of cocaine in a makeshift submarine seized this week off the Pacific coast. The 32-foot (10-metre)-long, green fiberglass craft was designed to travel just beneath the water, leaving almost no wake. It was one of Mexico's largest maritime drug seizures and the first time the country has seen drug smugglers using a submarine, the navy said. On Friday the army laid out more than 200 packages of drugs, tightly wrapped in black plastic, on the dock where the vessel was hauled in. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, in Mexico to discuss an aid package of more than $400 million to fight drug gangs, said the United States had a minor role in the operation. We shared information with the Mexican navy, but the Mexican navy acted alone. It was actually their seizure, their marines, their helicopters and naval vessels that captured the submarine, Chertoff told reporters in Mexico City. Four Colombians aboard the submarine said they had navigated up the Pacific coast from Colombia, the navy said. Colombian officials told Reuters last month that diesel-powered drug submarines travel up to two weeks to reach Central America and Mexico. The drugs are then hauled overland into the United States. Mexican special forces raided the submarine on Wednesday after they spotted it from the air by helicopter. They detained the crew and brought them and the vessel back to the Pacific port of Salina Cruz in Oaxaca state. Chertoff said the troops swooped down onto the craft using ropes from a hovering helicopter before the crew had time to sink the ship. This is going to force us to increase surveillance, Vice Adm. Jose Maria Ortegon told reporters in Salina Cruz. The government has made several huge drug seizures by deploying thousands of troops to trafficking hot spots after President Felipe Calderon took office in December 2006. But drug trade specialists say troops and police are failing to tackle drug gangs' financial networks and go after money launderers, which they say would do more to weaken the cartels. Some 1,700 people have been killed in drug gang violence in Mexico so far this year, and Calderon's frontal assault has failed to stop attacks on police and soldiers. Drug hitmen shot and killed a policeman in his office in the northern border city of Ciudad Juarez on Friday, the first time gunmen have penetrated a police building to murder an official in the city, police said.

and Freddie Mac FRE.N and the SEC announced rules to curb
short selling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reassuring quarterly results from key banks also fed the
week's rally, with Citigroup capping a series of closely
watched scorecards from Wells Fargo (WFC.N) and JPMorgan Chase
 Co (JPM.N) that beat analysts' estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On top of that, the biggest weekly drop ever in oil prices
also gave investors a renewed appetite for equities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite their weekly gain, tech stocks ended the week with
a thud. Google's stock fell almost 10 percent, its biggest
one-day percentage drop since it went public in 2004, and
Microsoft shares slid 6 percent, a day after the tech
bellwethers' quarterly results fell short of expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The government's plan to provide funding for Fannie and
Freddie and the SEC's short-selling rule put a floor, for now,
under financials. But you'll start to see investors
increasingly differentiate between 'the haves and have nots'
in financials," said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist
at RDM Financial, in Westport, Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 49.91 points,
or 0.44 percent, to 11,496.57. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index
.SPX was little changed, up just 0.36 of a point, or 0.03
percent, at 1,260.68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC, meanwhile, shed 29.52
points, or 1.28 percent, to close at 2,282.78.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  For the week, the Dow rose 3.5 percent, its best week in
three months. The SP 500 rose 1.7 percent, while the Nasdaq
was up 1.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citi's results were a sharp contrast to a
larger-than-expected quarterly loss from Merrill Lynch
MER.N. For most of the session, Merrill's stock was lower,
but it eked out a gain in the last hour of trading. Merrill
ended up 0.6 percent at $30.91.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regional banks, many of which report earnings next week,
were among the top sector drags on the SP 500, suggesting
investor worry that the credit crisis has not run its course
for some of the less diversified, smaller banks. The SP
Regional Banks Index .GSPBNKS fell 0.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup jumped 7.7 percent to $19.35 after the Dow
component reported a smaller-than-expected $2.5 billion loss
and said it would keep cutting costs and getting rid of risky
or poorly performing assets. [ID:nN18431251]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A wider-than-expected loss by chip maker Advanced Micro
Devices (AMD.N), whose shares fell 12.3 percent to $4.65,
added to concerns about the outlook  for the U.S. technology
sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google's stock slid 9.8 percent to $481.32 while Microsoft
shares shed 6 percent to $25.86, both in Nasdaq trading.
[ID:nN17350357].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dow component International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N)
bucked the glum technology earnings trend, also boosting the
Dow. IBM's shares rose 2.7 percent to $129.89 on the New York
Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  With earnings season now in full flow, analysts expect
second-quarter SP 500 earnings to drop 17.1 percent. If
second-quarter earnings end up being lower, it will be the
fourth consecutive quarter of negative growth for the SP 500,
the longest losing streak in six years, according to Thomson
Reuters proprietary research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Oil CLc1 prices fell on Friday, helping to cushion the
market's decline. High fuel costs have been adding to concerns
about consumer spending and corporate profits. U.S. crude for
August delivery settled at $128.88 a barrel, down 41 cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trading was moderate on the New York Stock Exchange, with
about 1.71 billion shares changing hands, below last year's
estimated daily average of roughly 1.90 billion, while on
Nasdaq, about 2.28 billion shares traded, above last year's
daily average of 2.17 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by
about 17 to 15, while decliners beat advancers on the Nasdaq
by about 4 to 3.

&lt;p&gt;Monthly data published by audience research firm comScore Inc shows Google's share of the U.S. Web search market -- the source of half the company's revenue -- at 61.5 percent, down three-tenths of a percentage point from May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, number-two-ranked Yahoo gained 0.3 of a percentage point to 20.9 percent in June while the market share of Microsoft, the number-three U.S. Web search player, jumped 0.7 points to 9.2 percent, comScore said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IAC/InterActiveCorp's Ask.com and Time Warner Inc's AOL unit, the number four and number five in U.S. search services, also lost ground, comScore data showed.

 (Updates to late afternoon)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Kristina Cooke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, July 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Friday,
after disappointing results from Google Inc (GOOG.O) and
Microsoft Corp MSFT.O overshadowed a smaller-than-expected
loss from Citigroup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup, the largest U.S. bank, helped financial stocks
rally for a third straight session, limiting the Dow's loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Internet search company Google had its biggest one-day
percentage drop since it went public in 2004 and Microsoft
fell the most in two years, after the tech bellwethers'
quarterly results fell short of expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a very split market today, right along the
financials and technology lines. Financials are actually
moving higher, based on OK numbers from Citigroup, but you had
some big disappointing numbers from tech, which is worrying,"
said Paul Nolte, director of investments at Hinsdale
Associates, in Hinsdale Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 6.51 points,
or 0.06 percent, to 11,440.15. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index

Microsoft shares shed 6.8 percent to $25.65, also in Nasdaq
trading, after the software maker gave a forecast below Wall
Street's expectations. [ID:nN17350357].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dow component International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N)
bucked the glum technology earnings trend, also boosting the
Dow. IBM's shares rose 2.4 percent to $129.55 on the NYSE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow gained nearly 500 points Wednesday and Thursday as
stronger-than-expected earnings from Wells Fargo (WFC.N) and
JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) eased some fears about the health
of the U.S. banking system, on the heels of a government
takeover a week ago of California-based mortgage lender
IndyMac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But regional banks, many of which report earnings next
week, were among the top sector drags on the SP 500,
suggesting investor worry that the credit crisis has not run
its course for the smaller banks. The SP Regional Banks Index

component reported a smaller-than-expected $2.5 billion loss
and said it would keep cutting costs and getting rid of risky

Citigroup's stock climbed more than 10 percent to hit an
intraday high at $20.47.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The positive news from Citi was a sharp contrast to
disappointing news of a larger-than-expected quarterly loss
from Merrill Lynch MER.N, whose stock fell 3 percent to
$29.77.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With earnings season now in full flow, analysts expect

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, July 18 (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster
Televisa is in talks to produce shows for TV Record, Brazil's
second-largest television network, a move that would give it
access to more viewers in Latin America's biggest economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are in the process of finalizing an agreement with

Baston, Televisa's corporate vice-president of television, told
analysts on a conference call on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Televisa source told Reuters that the initial stage of
the deal calls for the giant Mexican media company to produce
one-hour shows in its evening prime-time slot, Monday to
Friday, aiming at young audiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agreement would become Televisa's (TV.N) (TLVACPO.MX)
latest foray in international markets, following deals to
produce programs for Chinese and French audiences in their own
languages earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa's first Chinese-language soap opera will go on air
in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa, the biggest producer of Spanish-language TV
content in the world, exports its sports and entertainment
shows to some 60 countries. The company is known around the
globe for its soap operas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Thursday Televisa posted an 8.6 percent decline in
second-quarter net majority profit, hurt by one-time expenses,
but revenue rose a healthy 17 percent, driven by its broadcast
and pay television businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its shares traded 0.31 percent lower at 48.25 pesos on
Friday while its New York stock slipped 0.92 percent to
$23.69.

&lt;p&gt;BERKELEY, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Richard K. Lyons, the chief learning officer of Goldman Sachs, New
York, was named the 14th dean of the University of California,
Berkeley's Haas School of Business, Chancellor Robert Birgeneau
announced today (July 18, 2008).

   Lyons holds a professorship at the Haas School and served as
acting dean of the school in 2004/05. He succeeds Tom Campbell, an
economist, a former Stanford Law School professor, and former
Congressman, who led the Haas School since 2002.

   As chief learning officer of Goldman Sachs, Lyons' main
responsibility was directing a part of Goldman Sachs called Pine
Street, the group charged with developing leadership among the firm's
managing directors and partners. Goldman Sachs is known for attracting
and developing leaders, many of whom have gone on to public service or
to run other firms.

   UC Berkeley's Haas School, the second oldest business school in
the United States and the oldest business school at a US public
university, provides top-ranked business and management programs. It
has 2,200 students in six degree programs and more than 35,000 alumni.

   As dean, Lyons will oversee the Haas School's efforts to expand
its faculty to its largest size ever; enhance student services;
continue curriculum improvements; build the endowment; and plan for a
new building.

   Among academic peers, Lyons is best known for his pioneering work
in international finance and foreign exchange. His book, The
Microstructure Approach to Exchange Rates, published by MIT Press in
2001, offered new insights on how puzzling exchange rate behavior can
be explained.

   Lyons has consulted with the International Monetary Fund, the
World Bank, the Federal Reserve Bank, and Citibank. He has served as a
director for Barclays Global Investors iShares and as chairman of the
board of Matthews Asian Funds. He has held visiting appointments at
the University of Toulouse, France; Stockholm University, Sweden;
London School of Economics, UK; Foundation for Advanced Information
and Research, Japan; and the University of Aix-Marseille, France.

   Lyons graduated with highest honors from the undergraduate
business program at UC Berkeley in 1982 and joined the Haas School
faculty in 1993. He earned his Ph.D. in economics at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 1987.

Sutherland Global Services, a leading multi-national Business Process

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jul 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that it would continue assisting ABM
Industries Incorporated (NYSE: ABM), one of the largest facility services
contractors listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with technology
integration services for finance and human capital management as well as
business process standardization.

    The companies signed a new services contract for $3.5M under their
existing 7 year master services agreement to assist with the ongoing
integration of One Source Building Services, agreement extending their
two-year relationship to include ABM's ongoing integration of OneSource
Building Services, which ABM acquired in Fall 2007. ABM is currently 15
months into a major transformation project with IBM to replace its
existing financial, payroll and benefits administration systems. Under
the agreement IBM Global Business Services will assist in the final
phases of the migration of OneSource's financial and payroll business
operations onto ABM's existing new technology platform.

    "The integration of the OneSource operations is on plan and performing
well," said Cathie Beadel, Vice President and Chief Information Officer
for ABM Industries. "IBM has been assisting in the integration at various
levels and this final phase is a natural extension of that work as IBM is
a great choice to partner with us in these last phases of the project
since they have had a significant role in the past two years building our
core technology platform for finance and human capital management."

    In this phase, IBM Global Business Services will use its human capital
management and technology expertise to standardize business processes and
integration with legacy systems. This initiative is in conjunction with
the ongoing IBM Global Business Services project to enhance ABM's
financial and payroll platforms as well as ABM's shared services
environment. The expanded scope took effect in June 2008. The original
master services agreement was signed in September 2006.

    "As ABM continues to grow, IBM has the unique capability to blend its
expertise in project management with its know-how in technology and
application management to help the company continue to expand," said Shawn
Permann, Partner, IBM Global Business Services. "IBM's scalable and
flexible tools and services support the current and planned growth."

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded UAL Corp UAUA.O, saying the shares have been unfairly punished and may potentially stand poised for a significant, near-term bounce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"United shares have fallen too fast and furiously, implying a higher risk of near-term bankruptcy than justified, in our view," analyst Jamie Baker wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of UAL Corp were trading up nearly 12 percent at $5.66 before the bell, after closing at $5.07 Thursday on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker, who upgraded UAL Corp to "overweight" from "neutral," said he would be both surprised and disappointed if United did not announce at least $1 billion of incremental borrowing, possibly as early as Tuesday. Last week, UAL Corp, the parent of United Airlines, said it planned to take $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion in charges against second-quarter earnings due to record-high fuel prices and the company's reduced market capitalization. It also plans up to 400 additional job cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although United entered the downturn with less liquidity and a margin deficit to its peers, it is already subject to a significant credit card holdback, suggesting diminished risk than others on that front, Baker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He expects UAL to make significant capital announcements at next week's conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyst is concerned that 2009 industry forecasts remain too lofty and that demand trends in the second half may spook investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bhaswati Mukhopadhyay in Bangalore; Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, changes source)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 18 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs removed Coca-Cola Co
(KO.N) from Americas conviction buy list on what it termed was
a "mixed" second-quarter earnings report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although the company reported better-than-expected
quarterly earnings, overall sales by volume rose only 3
percent, down from 5 to 6 percent growth in each of the last
four quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deteriorating U.S. economy is accelerating declines in
sales volume of its traditional soft drinks, which include
Coca-Cola, Sprite and Fanta, as well as bottled Dasani water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We now expect the drag from a weak US along with a
tempered international backdrop to hold performance back,"
analyst Judy Hong wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She expects the company to partly offset lighter volume
results with pricing, but added that the market will assign
less value to pricing-driven gains in the current inflationary
environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hong kept the "buy" rating on the stock, citing the
company's international exposure, commodity insulation and an
attractive valuation, but cut her price target by $11 to $57 on
the stock.     She also raised her 2008 forecast by 3 cents to
$3.11 a share, but trimmed her 2009 expectations by 1 cent to
$3.38 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit Suisse, however, raised its estimates for this year
and the next, but joined Goldman in cutting the price target. 
  Credit Suisse analyst Carlos Laboy expressed fear over a
continuing fall in volumes and revenue at the company, as
bottlers raise pricing to tackle commodity costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Laboy raised his estimates by 1 cent to $3.11 for 2008 and
by 4 cents to $3.39 a share for the coming year. He cut the
price target on the stock by $8 to $60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company closed at $50.34 Thursday on the New
York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Jul 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
As one era closed with the final All-Star Game at Yankee Stadium this
week, Major League Baseball (MLB) enters a new one, employing software
technologies from IBM (NYSE: IBM) to improve the way baseball is
officiated.

    Using IBM Portal software to exploit the next generation of the Internet,
Web 2.0, MLB can create entirely new ways of connecting players, umpires
and fans, to improve the game and make it among the most advanced sports
businesses in the world.

    From technology to fight counterfeit memorabilia to giving umpires and
security staff new insights on weather conditions and potential risk
factors, IBM software installed by the MLB IT Department and various
business partners is changing the way the Office of the Commissioner runs
its business, communicates with staff and manages relationships across its
30 ball clubs.

    "The IBM WebSphere Portal software architecture allows us to consolidate
information from a variety of sources. It enables collaboration within our
user community and provides a strong platform for future growth and
development," said Mike Morris, Vice President of Application Development
and Program Management for MLB.

    MLB is using IBM collaboration software to provide improved intelligence
and historical data directly to umpiring crews. With MLB's Umpire Desktop,
powered by IBM Portal software, officials gain advanced insight into
players' behavior, based on historical issues or likely tendencies. Within
the Umpire Desktop, you can also see Google Gadgets at work, mini-objects
that can be placed on an internal Web page to offer more dynamic,
real-time content. This way, umpires can get up-to-the-minute weather
views from Google Gadgets, along with statistics and other key
information.

    "The Umpire Desktop provides significant, real-time information to our
crews, and is a valuable resource with respect to the overall Major League
Umpiring effort. It is assisting not only in training and development, but
also every other aspect of what game officials do," said MLB's Vice
President of Umpiring, Mike Port.

    "Major League Baseball has vaulted into the Web 2.0 era with powerful
collaboration technology that puts the power of the World Wide Web and
technology specialists into the hands of the baseball experts," said Bob
Picciano, General Manager, IBM Lotus Software. "Deeper, clearer insights
help people make and communicate better decisions."

    MLB memorabilia is a multi-billion dollar industry in which everything
from home run balls, autographs, bases and name plates are purchased by
fans around the world. To sell, authenticate and license these products
from today's big game in a more timely and accurate way, MLB relies on IBM
WebSphere Portal software and Symbol handheld wireless devices to scan and
automatically upload information on a product. Previously, product
authentication was a manual process that was not accessible to fans, and
forgery was a legitimate concern.

    Here's how it works: When a fan catches a home run ball, a security guard
will link up with the fan and place a unique hologram on the ball. This
information will be wirelessly up-loaded to MLB's IBM DB2 9 data server.
This way, if the fan decides to sell the ball to a retailer, potential
buyers can verify its authenticity immediately online.

    Information regarding Major League Baseball is available via the Internet
at www.mlb.com.

IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced second-quarter 2008 diluted earnings of $1.98
per share from continuing operations, an increase of 28 percent as reported,
compared with diluted earnings of $1.55 per share, including a 5 cents per share

of 2007. Excluding the gain in the prior-year period, diluted earnings for the
second-quarter 2008 increased 32 percent year over year.

Second-quarter income from continuing operations was $2.8 billion, an increase
of 22 percent, compared with $2.3 billion, including the gain from the sale of

"IBM had an outstanding quarter and a strong first half for 2008. These results
demonstrate that IBM has the ability to thrive in both emerging and established
markets. Once again, IBMers performed very well around the world," said Samuel
J. Palmisano, IBM chairman, president and chief executive officer.

"We are continuing to see the benefits of IBM's transformation in recent years.
Today IBM is a company with a distinctive business model that gives us a
competitive edge in a global economy. We enjoy a steady base of recurring
revenue and profits; a truly global reach and scale; services and products that
deliver genuine value to clients wherever they do business; and a strong and
flexible financial foundation that generates powerful cash flow and fuels our
investment in growth opportunities.

"We feel good about our full-year outlook and our 2010 roadmap for $10 to $11 of
earnings per share."

From a geographic perspective, the Americas' second-quarter revenues were $10.9
billion, an increase of 8 percent as reported (6 percent, adjusting for

WebSphere, Information Management, Tivoli, Lotus and Rational products, were
$4.3 billion, up 17 percent versus the second quarter of 2007. Operating systems
revenues of $592 million increased 4 percent compared with the prior-year
quarter.

Total expense and other income increased 15 percent to $7.8 billion compared
with the prior-year period. SG expense increased 12 percent to $6.3 billion.
RD expense increased 8 percent compared with the year-ago period. Intellectual
property and custom development income increased to $285 million compared with
$246 million a year ago. Other (income) and expense was income of $24 million,
down $228 million as a result of hedging and the year-to-year impact of the gain
on the sale of PSD in the second quarter of 2007. Interest expense increased to
$145 million compared with $130 million, primarily due to the increase in debt
to finance the company's accelerated share repurchase agreements.

IBM's effective tax rate in the second-quarter 2008 was 27.5 percent compared
with 28.0 percent in the second quarter of 2007.

billion at year-end 2007. From a management segment view, Global Financing debt
increased $639 million from year-end 2007 to a total of $25.2 billion at June
30, 2008, resulting in a debt-to-equity ratio of 6.8 to 1. Non-global financing
debt, which reflects financial leverage associated with accelerated share
repurchase agreements, totaled $9.1 billion, a decrease of $1.7 billion since
year-end 2007, resulting in a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 26.9 percent from
30.0 percent at year-end 2007. The cash balance was $9.8 billion at the end of
the second quarter.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) posted a 
smaller-than-expected drop in earnings on resilient stock and 
bond underwriting revenue, sending its shares surging, but the 
company cautioned that the mortgage market and the economy are 
getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The bank's second-quarter profit fell more than 50 percent 
to $2 billion, hurt by $1.1 billion in write-downs at its 
investment bank and charges linked to the bank's acquisition of 
Bear Stearns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But even amid write-downs, the third-largest U.S. bank 
generated stronger than expected results, helped by 
underwriting and bond trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Things aren't as bad as the market has feared," said 
Thomas Russo, partner and portfolio manager at Gardner Russo  
Gardner in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase posted net income of 54 cents a share, 
compared with $4.23 billion, or $1.20 a share, in the same 
quarter last year. Total revenue rose to $18.399 billion. 
Analysts, on average, had expected earnings of 44 cents a 
share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results triggered a broad rally in financial stocks a 
day after Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N) reported surprisingly strong 
results that also lifted bank stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has managed to 
sidestep the worst of the credit crisis that has forced massive 
write-downs at Wall Street firms.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RIVALS' WEAKNESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The third-largest U.S. bank has been benefiting from 
rivals' weakness and is gaining market share in multiple 
businesses because of it, Chief Financial Officer Michael 
Cavanagh said in a conference call with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan is still open to buying a regional bank while the 
sector is depressed, Dimon said, adding that although 
accounting rules related to taking on a weak bank's balance 
sheet make a purchase more difficult, it is still possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon sounded some ominous notes in a conference call, 
saying the bank is prepared for losses on prime mortgages to 
triple and adding that unlike Wells Fargo, the bank has no 
plans to boost its dividend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're not going to increase the dividend until we see 
clear daylight," he said. The company currently pays 38 cents 
per share quarterly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan set aside an additional $1.3 billion during the 
second quarter as a buffer against further losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank will also not record a gain from its Bear Stearns 
purchase in May, which it had previously hoped would contribute 
$1 billion. JPMorgan had agreed in March to buy Bear Stearns 
after the fifth-largest U.S. securities firm faced a run on the 
bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The acquisition of Bear Stearns instead contributed $540 
million of losses and charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But there were glimmers of good news as well. CFO Cavanagh 
said the pace of deterioration in home equity -- a big drag for 
many banks -- is slowing. And other businesses are performing 
solidly -- investment banking fees of $1.7 billion are the 
second-highest ever at the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's shares rose $3.90 or 10.9 percent to $39.84.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HIGH COMPENSATION RATIO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan paid out 57 percent of its investment banking 
revenue as compensation, which is a relatively high level -- 
banks typically aim for a compensation ratio closer to 50 
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon said the bank's compensation ratio is likely to 
normalize, but jokingly added: "We don't want our people 
getting depressed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At Wednesday's close, JPMorgan's shares were down 15 
percent this year, compared with a 35 percent decline in the 
KBW Bank Index .BKX. But since Tuesday's close, the bank's 
shares have risen more than 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In response to the results, the cost to insure JPMorgan 
debt against a default with credit default swaps fell 5 basis 
points to 115 basis points, or $115,000 per year to insure $10 
million of debt for five years, according to Phoenix Partners 
Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of capital 
strength, rose to 9.1 percent from 8.4 percent in the same 
quarter last year -- though it would have been 8.1 percent 
without regulatory relief stemming from the Bear Stearns 
takeover, which was assisted by federal regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regulators consider a bank with a Tier 1 ratio above 6 
percent to be well capitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Brian Moss and Gerald E. McCormick)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DARWIN, July 18 (Reuters) - U.S. energy major ExxonMobil
Corp (XOM.N) has begun discussions with gas buyers for its
planned liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Papua New Guinea
(PNG), a company official said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Discussions with buyers began this month," Jeff Appleton,
vice president of marketing for the PNG LNG project told an oil
and gas conference in Darwin. He did not give further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buyers who have expressed interest in Exxon's PNG LNG
project include India's Petronet LNG (PLNG.BO), which said
early this year that it was looking to buy gas from the 6.3
million tonnes a year project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  ExxonMobil is leading the marketing efforts on behalf of
venture partners, which include Oil Search Ltd (OSH.AX) and
Santos Ltd (STO.AX).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil Search Executive General Manager Phil Bainbridge told
the conference that the $11 billion project was on track for a
final investment decision in late 2009, with first LNG
production scheduled between 2013-2014. Bainbridge said Oil
Search was also looking at "building new LNG trains" as an
option to commercialise its remaining gas resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have got capacity to produce an additional 3.2 million
tonnes a year of LNG," Bainbridge said.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, July 20 (Reuters) - China has warned Exxon Mobil
Corp (XOM.N) to pull out of an exploration deal with Vietnam,
describing the project as a breach of Chinese sovereignty, the
South China Morning Post reported on Sunday, citing unnamed
sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The article, which cited "sources close to the U.S. firm",
said Chinese diplomats in Washington had made repeated verbal
protests to Exxon Mobil executives in recent months, and warned
them its future business interests on the mainland could be at
risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The protests involve a preliminary co-operation agreement
between state oil firm PetroVietnam and Exxon Mobil covering
exploration in the South China Sea off Vietnam's south and
central coasts, the article said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It did not state when the co-operation agreement was
signed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report quoted the unnamed sources as saying Exxon Mobil
was confident of Vietnam's sovereign rights to the blocks it
was exploring, but it could not dismiss China's warnings out of
hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The newspaper said China's foreign ministry did not
immediately respond to queries about the situation and an Exxon
Mobil spokesman refused to discuss any approaches from China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it quoted Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesman Le Dung
as saying it needed to be "clearly asserted" that Hanoi's
dealings with foreign oil partners fell entirely within
Vietnam's legal rights and sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China and Vietnam have a number of festering disagreements
about territory. The two countries dispute sovereignty over the
Spratly Islands, a string of rocky outcrops in the South China
Sea suspected of containing large oil and gas deposits and also
claimed by Taiwan, Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China supported the Vietnamese Communists in their
decades-long war against South Vietnam and its U.S. sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Vietnam has traditionally been wary of its larger Asian
neighbour and in 1979 the two countries fought a brief border
war after Vietnam occupied Cambodia and overthrew the murderous
Khmer Rouge regime that favoured Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though Vietnam and China have agreed to cooperate in oil
and gas exploration in the Gulf of Tonkin in the north, last
year BP Plc (BP.L) halted plans to conduct exploration work off
the southern Vietnamese coast, citing the territorial tensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And in December China chided Vietnam after protests in
front of the Chinese Embassy in Hanoi proclaiming that the
Spratly and Paracel islands belonged to the Vietnamese.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Shares of top Chinese PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd (0992.HK) fell 5.02 percent after a broker downgrade and a sale of the company's shares by International Business Machines Corp's (IBM.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Lenovo were set to open at HK$5.3 on Tuesday, compared with its previous close of HK$5.58.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan downgraded Lenovo to neutral from overweight due to a near-term slowdown in revenue growth from weak China demand and a slower ramp-up of the U.S. consumer business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The downgrade came soon after U.S. computer giant International Business Machines Corp (IBM) (IBM.N) sold $77.3 million worth of Lenovo shares. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM sold 116.19 million shares, or a roughly 1.3 percent stake in Lenovo, at HK$5.19 each, the bottom of a range of HK$5.19 to HK$5.36 per share, a source close to the deal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Donny Kwok; Editing by Anne Marie Roantree)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc will appoint activist investor Carl Icahn and two of his nominees to its board, defusing a proxy battle showdown and making an immediate deal with Microsoft Corp less likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The settlement with Icahn, announced on Monday, came just 11 days before Yahoo's August 1 annual shareholders meeting. Icahn had originally sought to replace the entire board with his own nominees and oust Yahoo Chief Executive Jerry Yang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Icahn's campaign appeared to have failed to win backing from key shareholders such as Legg Mason fund manager Bill Miller, who said on Friday he would support Yahoo's board. Legg Mason owned 4.4 percent of Yahoo, according to recent filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn failed to convince many investors that if he had won control of Yahoo at the upcoming annual meeting, that he had any alternative for turning the business around, other than to sell it in part or in whole to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It may be possible it does generate some positive change. Perhaps Icahn can drive some more staff reductions, persuade it to divest its Asia investments," Jeffrey Lindsay, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said of the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall it seems much less likely that there will be a transaction with Microsoft. The market is already reading it that way," he added. "This looks like a compromise and in general most of these compromises, certainly with ones with Icahn in the past, have reinforced the status quo."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment on its next move, but the company will no doubt face questions about its Internet strategy at its annual analyst meeting on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo has said Microsoft's various deal proposals have undervalued its business and instead reached a search advertising partnership with arch rival Google Inc to boost its performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo shares fell 78 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $21.67, far below Microsoft's last offer price of $33 per share, which was withdrawn in May. Microsoft shares lost 22 cents to $25.64.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A REPRIEVE FOR MANAGEMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After six months of on-again, off-again talks with Microsoft that have undermined Yang and his management team's credibility with Wall Street, the settlement with Icahn could shore up Yahoo's position in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yahoo's current management is much better suited for Yahoo shareholders throughout this transition period.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc will appoint activist investor Carl Icahn and two of his nominees to its board, defusing a proxy battle showdown and making an immediate deal with Microsoft Corp less likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The settlement with Icahn, announced on Monday, came just 11 days before Yahoo's August 1 annual shareholders meeting. Icahn had originally sought to replace the entire board with his own nominees and oust Yahoo Chief Executive Jerry Yang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Icahn's campaign appeared to have failed to win backing from key shareholders such as Legg Mason fund manager Bill Miller, who said on Friday he would support Yahoo's board. Legg Mason owned 4.4 percent of Yahoo, according to recent filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn failed to convince many investors that if he had won control of Yahoo at the upcoming annual meeting, that he had any alternative for turning the business around, other than to sell it in part or in whole to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It may be possible it does generate some positive change. Perhaps Icahn can drive some more staff reductions, persuade it to divest its Asia investments," Jeffrey Lindsay, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said of the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall it seems much less likely that there will be a transaction with Microsoft. The market is already reading it that way," he added. "This looks like a compromise and in general most of these compromises, certainly with ones with Icahn in the past, have reinforced the status quo."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment on its next move, but the company will no doubt face questions about its Internet strategy at its annual analyst meeting on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo has said Microsoft's various deal proposals have undervalued its business and instead reached a search advertising partnership with arch rival Google Inc to boost its performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo shares fell 78 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $21.67, far below Microsoft's last offer price of $33 per share, which was withdrawn in May. Microsoft shares lost 22 cents to $25.64.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A REPRIEVE FOR MANAGEMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After six months of on-again, off-again talks with Microsoft that have undermined Yang and his management team's credibility with Wall Street, the settlement with Icahn could shore up Yahoo's position in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yahoo's current management is much better suited for Yahoo shareholders throughout this transition period. It's not like a vote of confidence, it's just they're the right people to get us through the disaster that we're in," said RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross Sandler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They've done a poor job, but unfortunately there isn't a whole lineup of really good Internet executives who are pounding down the door to take on this challenge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo reports quarterly results on Tuesday and some analysts said the Icahn settlement could help allay pressure over what is expected to be a weak second-quarter performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They may be able to find a few extra pennies this quarter via cost controls just to show the market that they are making improvements," Canaccord Adams analyst Colin Gillis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Gillis added it would be difficult for Yahoo to show momentum when it gives forecasts for the current quarter, given economic weakness and competitive pressures hurting online advertising, which could still come back to haunt its leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The key thing is, is Jerry inspiring people, and if he's not, then there's a good chance Carl Icahn will agitate him out of that position," Gillis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YAHOO TO EXPAND BOARD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn, who controls about 59 million shares of Yahoo, or 4.98 percent, called the settlement a "good outcome" and said he continues to believe a transaction to sell Yahoo or its search business should be given full consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo said it will expand its board to 11 members from nine, with eight of its existing directors standing for re-election.

lagging a 3 percent gain in Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index

&lt;p&gt; By Karen Brettell

 NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc's
(CCE.N) shares have priced in more weakness than its credit
default swaps over the past year and as the soda bottling
company grapples with high commodity costs and slowing consumer
demand, its debt may be likely to weaken also.

 The bottling company's debt may also be likely to
underperform that of Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) as Coca-Cola
Enterprises (CCE) is more vulnerable to commodities and will
likely also need to refinance some debt maturing later this
year.

 "Since April, signals from the equity market suggest that
CCEs' credit risk has risen," Robert Eckerstrom, analyst in the
credit strategy group at Moody's Investors Service said in a
report on Monday.

 As of Friday, CCE's credit default swaps were trading as
though the company were rated "Aa2," four ratings above its
actual "A3," rating, according to Moody's data. Its share
price, however, indicates higher perceived risk, trading one
notch below its ratings at "Baa1."

 "The current CDS-implied rating of Aa2 optimistically
suggests a lack of operational or financial stress," Eckerstrom
said. "We think investors should be cautious, as the current
challenges in CCE's operating environment may not be reflected
in the levels of its bonds or CDS spreads."

 The beverage bottler, which is 35 percent owned by
Coca-Cola, on Thursday lowered its full-year outlook and said
the state of the economy and spiking commodity costs forced it
to take a $5.3 billion impairment charge for the second
quarter.

 The company nonetheless reported better than expected
profits for the quarter. For details, see [ID:nN17256203]

 The cost to insure CCE's debt with credit default swaps was
little changed on the results, trading at 49.17 basis points on
Monday, compared with 49.74 basis points on Wednesday, before
its earnings, according to Markit Intraday.

 Coca-Cola's swaps are trading at around 43 basis points,
according to Markit.

 While the debt of Coca-Cola is also at risk of weakening,
CCE is likely to suffer more as it is responsible for nearly
all the commodity costs that go into producing the soft drink.

 Coca-Cola sells CCE concentrate, said Gimme Credit analyst
Craig Hutson. CCE is then responsible for the costs of adding
sweetener, energy from transporting the goods and costs
involved in packaging the product.

 "They're the ones that get hit with all the commodity costs
inflation," Hutson said. "That's the big difference between the
two companies."

 "We're now going to go into a period where the performance
of these companies could diverge a lot more meaningfully than
has occurred in the past," he said.

 "But they are intertwined enough that if CCE were to have
to issue debt at wider spreads or see more underperformance
from an operating perspective, that has to have some impact on
Coke as well," Hutson added.

 Hutson has an "underperform" rating on CCE's bonds.

 Analysts at JPMorgan, by contrast, are "overweight" the
company's debt, saying the bottler is keeping its credit
profile stable by paying down debt.

  CCE has $600 million in bonds maturing in November, and an
additional 350 million euros ($557 million) of bonds maturing
in December, according to JPMorgan.

 The company plans to use $550 million of free cash to pay
down the debt, and refinance the rest, JPMorgan analysts said
in a report.

 "Although the operating environment is very challenging, we
expect CCE's credit profile to remain stable," they said.

&lt;p&gt; By Michele Gershberg and Tiffany Wu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) will

analysts said the Icahn settlement could help allay pressure
over what is expected to be a weak second-quarter performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They may be able to find a few extra pennies this quarter
via cost controls just to show the market that they are making
improvements," Canaccord Adams analyst Colin Gillis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Gillis added it would be difficult for Yahoo to show
momentum when it gives forecasts for the current quarter, given
economic weakness and competitive pressures hurting online
advertising, which could still come back to haunt its leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The key thing is, is Jerry inspiring people, and if he's

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 21 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded U.S.
semiconductor production equipment (SPE) sector to "neutral"
from "cautious," saying it sees companies lowering their
capital expenditures and orders bottoming out in the second
half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dynamic random access memory (DRAM) industry has
essentially stopped ordering, and orders should find a bottom
in either the second or third quarter of calendar 2008, the
brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We would not expect meaningful incremental order declines
to extend into 2009," Goldman Sachs analyst James Covello wrote
in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Post the second-quarter earnings, SPE orders should be down
about 45 percent to 50 percent from peak 2006 levels, which
already account for most of the memory-related order weakness,
the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market has reset its expectations "meaningfully" by
cutting its 2008 estimates, and stocks finally have some
valuation support at current levels with many trading below
fair value, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Covello said he expects estimates to move even lower coming
out of the second quarter, but the magnitude of the current
downturn is largely understood by investors at this point and
should not have a significant impact on the stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst added Verigy Ltd VRGY.O to Goldman Sachs
conviction buy list as he expects the semiconductor testing
company to post solid second-quarter results and issue strong
outlook, driven by shipment of recent design wins at Nvidia
Corp (NVDA.O) and Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Verigy's stock was up 5 percent at $22.88 in afternoon
trade on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Shell Oil Co began flying workers from platforms in the western Gulf of Mexico on Sunday ahead of Tropical Storm Dolly, but said no production was shut, according to a statement issued by the company on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fellow energy giant Exxon Mobil said it was making preparations for heavy weather across its Gulf and South Texas operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Energy Information Administration said Dolly, which is forecast to become a hurricane by Tuesday night, would likely miss major offshore production areas but could affect the three Corpus Christi, Texas, refineries with power outages and flooding if it makes landfall as forecast on the Texas coast sometime on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other oil and natural gas companies said they were monitoring the storm's progress as it moved through the Gulf on Monday after crossing Mexico's Yucatan peninsula overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shell said it took 125 people off platforms on Sunday and planned to take another 60 from the Gulf on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company does not expect production to be affected as long as Dolly follows a forecast path across the southern Gulf toward landfall on the Texas coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 10 a.m. CDT forecast from the U.S. National Hurricane Center projected that Dolly will move northwest across the southern Gulf of Mexico to make landfall Wednesday night north of Brownsville, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Hurricane Center has issued a hurricane watch from the Mexican border to Port O'Connor, Texas. Included in that watch was the refining center of Corpus Christi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mexican government has issued a hurricane watch from Rio San Fernando, Texas, to the U.S. border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A watch means a hurricane is possible in those areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the 2006 and 2007 hurricane seasons had little impact on offshore production areas, the companies have prepared for a possible repeat of 2005 when hurricanes Katrina and Rita temporarily shut a quarter of U.S. oil and fuel production, sending prices to record highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Erwin Seba in Houston, Janet McGurty and Richard Valdmanis in New York; Editing by Christian Wiessner)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Corrects paragraph 11 to show Yahoo quarterly results are due
Tuesday, not Thursday)
 (Recasts, adds analyst comment, background, bylines)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Michele Gershberg and Tiffany Wu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) will
appoint activist investor Carl Icahn and two of his nominees to
its board, settling a proxy battle and making an immediate
transaction with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) less likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The settlement, announced on Monday, came just 11 days
before Yahoo's Aug. 1 annual shareholders meeting, at which
Icahn had originally sought to replace the entire board with
his own nominees and oust Yahoo Chief Executive Jerry Yang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Icahn did not appear to have the backing of prominent
Yahoo shareholders such as Legg Mason fund manager Bill Miller,
who said on Friday that he would support Yahoo's board. Legg
owned 4.4 percent of Yahoo according to a regulatory filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their concern had been that besides a sale to Microsoft --
which has indicated it was presently only interested in buying
Yahoo search and not the whole company -- Icahn has not shown
concrete plans to turn around the company, which has been
losing Web search market share to Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It may be possible it does generate some positive change.
Perhaps Icahn can drive some more staff reductions, persuade it
to divest its Asia investments," Jeffrey Lindsay, analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein, said of the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Overall it seems much less likely that there will be a
transaction with Microsoft. The market is already reading it
that way," he added. "This looks like a compromise and in
general most of these compromises, certainly with ones with
Icahn in the past, have reinforced the status quo."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo shares fell 20 cents, or nearly 1 percent, to $22.25
in pre-market trading. The stock is far below Microsoft's last
offer price of $33 per share, a bid that was withdrawn in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After six months of on-again, off-again talks with
Microsoft that have undermined Yang and his management team's
credibility with Wall Street, the settlement with Icahn could
shore up Yahoo's position in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Yahoo's current management is much better suited for Yahoo
shareholders throughout this transition period. It's not like a
vote of confidence, it's just they're the right people to get
us through the disaster that we're in," said RBC Capital
Markets analyst Ross Sandler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They've done a poor job but unfortunately there isn't a
whole lineup of really good Internet executives who are
pounding down the door to take on this challenge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo reports quarterly results on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn, who owned 4.98 percent of Yahoo, was quoted in a
Yahoo statement as saying the settlement was a "good outcome"
and that he continued to believe a transaction to sell Yahoo or
its search business should be given full consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I am happy that the board has agreed in the settlement
agreement that any meaningful transaction, including the
strategy in dealing with that transaction, will be fully
discussed with the entire board before any final decision is
made," Icahn said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo said it will expand its board to 11 members from
nine, with eight of its existing directors standing for
reelection. Icahn will be appointed and the remaining two board
seats will be chosen from a list that includes Icahn's original
slate of candidates and Jonathan Miller, former chairman and
CEO of Time Warner Inc's (TWX.N) AOL, Yahoo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo said Roy Bostock, Ronald Burkle, Eric Hippeau,
Vyomesh Joshi, Arthur Kern, Mary Agnes Wilderotter, Gary Wilson
and Jerry Yang would stand for reelection. Activision Blizzard
ATVID.O CEO Robert Kotick will not.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Senior Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) investment banker Kendrick Wilson will take a leave of absence to advise U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on the nation's banking crisis, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson is a vice chairman of investment banking and chairman of financial institutions business at Goldman, where Paulson was CEO until 2006. Wilson has played a key role advising banks on capital raising and reorganizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is expected to help address the crisis gripping banks, Wall Street firms and mortgage lenders, the sources said. He is expected to serve without pay through January, when President George W. Bush's second term ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman declined to comment on the matter. A Treasury spokeswoman also declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson, 61, joined Goldman in 1998 and was a leading dealmaker during the bank merger boom of the late 1990s. Previously he was a vice chairman and head of investment banking at Lazard, Freres  Co, which he left amid a period of management turmoil at the partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was president of Ranieri  Co from 1988 to 1989, a firm set up by famed mortgage securities banker Lewis Ranieri. He was a senior executive vice president for now-defunct brokerage E.F. Hutton in 1987.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dartmouth College and Harvard Business School graduate served in the Vietnam War as a U.S. Special Forces officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A slump in housing prices and crumbling mortgage markets have gutted banks worldwide over the past year, generating more than $400 billion in losses and write-downs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, the Treasury and the Federal Reserve have faced the growing threat of bank failures, depleted capital levels and a loss of confidence in such market pillars as mortgage finance giant Fannie Mae FNM.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bush made a personal call to Wilson in recent days, asking him to assist Paulson, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Treasury faces a void in its top ranks with the departure of Robert Steel this month to become chief executive at Wachovia Corp WB.N, one of the largest U.S. commercial banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago Paulson called on Steel -- another former Goldman Sachs executive -- to serve as undersecretary for domestic finance. Steel played a key role in formulating the Treasury's response to the nation's credit crisis last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treasury has nominated Anthony Ryan to take over Steel's job. Ryan, a former fund management executive, served under Steel as assistant secretary for financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by David Lawder in Washington; Dhanya Skariachan in Bangalore; Editing by Brian Moss and John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

challenging problems facing researchers and scientists. Power technology
is also available in compact blade form-factors.

    Traditional proteomics research involves lab experiments that require
extended time and investment to produce verified data from a limited range
of input. In the race to find answers, PredictProtein was developed to
accelerate the research process to cover more ground and predict the most
-- and least -- useful targets more accurately for more efficient
investments of time and money.

    As a comprehensive resource for protein sequence analysis, PredictProtein
incorporates cutting-edge tools for protein structure and function
prediction including algorithms providing prediction for:


--  Binding/active sites
--  Sub-cellular localization
--  Domain boundaries
--  Fold recognition
--  Inter-residue contacts
--  Regions lacking regular structure
--  Secondary structure
--  Solvent accessibility
--  Transmembrane, globular and coiled coil regions
--  Disulfide bonds
    

    
"Working with IBM provides our customers the unique opportunity to
combine a secure infrastructure and cutting-edge hardware needed to run
our highly resource-intensive algorithms," says Dr. Burkhard Rost of
Biosof.

&lt;p&gt;TMC University Adds Microsoft IP Telephony Course to INTERNET TELEPHONY Conference &amp; EXPO West 2008

    Leading Edge Course Explores Microsoft's Office Communications
             Server (OCS) &amp; Response Point (RP) Solutions
NORWALK, Conn.--(Business Wire)--
Technology Marketing Corporation (TMC) announced today that their
TMC University division will offer a Microsoft Office Communications
Server and Response Point training course at INTERNET TELEPHONY
Conference &amp; EXPO West 2008 in Los Angeles. The day-long course, which
includes a 30-minute certification exam, will be held Tuesday,
September 16th, day one of the three-day conference.

   Titled, 'Introduction to Microsoft Office Communication
Server/Response Point', this TMC University course offers an initial
training session teaching users how to integrate Microsoft's new
enterprise Office Communication Server and small business Response
Point platforms into their existing infrastructure.

   According to TMC President and conference chairman, Rich Tehrani,
TMC University is the only independent program of its kind. And this
new Office Communication Server/Response Point course is an overdue
addition to the series.

   "Since Bill Gates' unveiling of Microsoft Office Communication
Server, enterprises continue to determine the most effective way to
integrate its considerable advantages into their organizations. This
new course gives additional insight and background for enterprise
telecom and IT managers to make smart recommendations about what's
best for their companies," said TMC president Rich Tehrani.

   The program will be taught by Thomas Cross - CEO TECHtionary.com,
an innovative communications advisor with considerable expertise in
market planning and development, hardware/software design and
development, project management, intellectual property in
telecommunications, information technology, conferencing,
teletraining, telecommuting, groupware, networks, call centers,
internet, artificial intelligence and other fields.

   Cross commented, Microsoft Office Communication Server is the most
profound innovation in telephony since digital PBX systems. "It is
very likely Office Communication Server will be a 'must-have' for the
enterprise business customer and Response Point for the SMB or branch
office communications. By adding this training course to the Los
Angeles program, participants can attend a one-day class that prepares
them to make recommendations to their companies about a Microsoft
Office Communication Server or Response Point strategy," Cross added.

&lt;p&gt;Best-selling author Cokie Roberts on the change in women's
 leadership roles, U.S State Department's Director of Policy Planning
   Dr. David Gordon, and Arab-Israeli community activist Amal Elsana
  Alh'jooj address award-winning scholars from 22 countries at annual
                            week-long event
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The Goldman Sachs Foundation and the Institute for International
Education gathered 75 outstanding college students selected from five
continents for a remarkable week of high-level lectures, networking
and leadership workshops.

   Since its inception in 2000, the Goldman Sachs Global Leaders
Program was designed to identify and cultivate the next generation of
world leaders through its annual Global Leadership Institute (GLI).
The program provides life and leadership lessons from leading
political, philanthropic and business figures to the outstanding
sophomore students that the program gathers from across the globe. The
theme of this year's event was globalization.

   Stephanie Bell-Rose, Managing Director and President of the
Goldman Sachs Foundation said,"The Global Leaders Program is a vital
one, we are proud to support initiatives like this and are hopeful the
overall result will be nothing short of a more peaceful and prosperous
world."

   Dina Powell, Managing Director and Global Head of the Office of
Corporate Engagement at Goldman Sachs, and Dr. Allan Goodman,
President of the Institute of International Education, opened the
Institute on Monday, July 14, welcoming the 2008 global leaders who
hail from 22 countries.

   "It is our responsibility as a global community to foster these
young minds," said Dina Powell. "By investing in the leadership
potential of exceptional young people around the world, Goldman Sachs
also hopes to invest in the well-being of many people whose lives will
be touched by their vision, skills and compassion."

   Dr. Allan Goodman spoke of the remarkable journeys ahead of these
students and reminded them that, as global citizens, they can learn a
great deal from the global community and from the wide network of
Goldman Sachs Global Leaders alumni worldwide.

   The Ecuadorian Ambassador to the U.S., Luis Gallegos, was the
opening speaker of this year's event. A passionate advocate for Human
Rights, the Ambassador was instrumental in the formation of the UN
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Ambassador
Gallegos shared with the Institute how he has, over the course of his
diplomatic career, evolved from being an idealist into a realist. The
week progressed with remarks by journalist and author Cokie Roberts,
who shared insights about her career and the challenges women still
face in the workplace, and Jean-Marc Coicaud, Head of the United
Nations University, who spoke about education and leadership at the
United Nations.

   Goldman Sachs arranged an exclusive behind-the-scenes tour of the
United Nations during which the GLI honorees lunched alongside UN
Ambassadors and were addressed by Ann Veneman, Director of UNICEF, who
spoke on a range of topics including how the world must first
acknowledge its problems, like the AIDS crisis, in order to fully
address them. This was followed by a timely discussion on the state of
'New China' by the renowned author and Washington Post contributing
editor John Pomfret, who spoke about China's likely impact on the
future of every country represented by the Global Leaders.

   Several alumni of the program attended this year's event and
shared their personal stories of success. Their panel provoked dynamic
discussions about the program's long-running Social Entrepreneurship
Fund which gives participants the opportunity to collaborate and apply
for further funding from the Goldman Sachs Foundation. American Andrew
Cunningham (class of 2006), Delhi-born Anurag Gupta (2004) and South
African Kopano Matlwa (2005) all have established remarkable projects
which leveraged the Goldman Sachs investments to produce broad social
benefits for orphans of AIDs victims in Thailand, literacy programs in
Burma, and community medical clinics in South Africa. The session
proved to be an inspirational opportunity highlighting how social
entrepreneurship can use modest investments of capital to produce
global and local change, if administered with imagination and
perseverance.

   The director of Policy Planning for the U.S. State Department, Dr.
David Gordon discussed effects of a rapidly globalizing world and
reminded the students that "individuals have the power to shape
solutions to some of the world's most daunting challenges."

   This year's GLI was hailed as "a celebration of talent, a
celebration of hard work, and a celebration of what it means to lead"
by Stephanie Bell-Rose, who introduced the week's keynote, Amal Elsana
Alh'jooj.

   Ms. Elsana Alh'jooj is herself a remarkable example of the
leadership ideals that form the founding principles of the Goldman
Sachs Global Leaders Institute. She is one of the key shapers of
public opinion in the Arab community in Israel. She began her career
as a community organizer at age 14, and at the age of 17 established
the first Arab Bedouin woman's organization. She used the leadership
template that forms the framework of this initiative to speak on the
issues faced by minorities in Israel saying that in order to succeed
we need not to be the victims of circumstance and that the key to
moving forward was building the self-esteem of the community-at-large.
Speaking to the 22 nations represented at this year's Global Leaders
Institute, the Arab-Israeli encouraged those present to "believe in
themselves, be part of the solution, work hard to promote change and
always ask questions."

   About the Goldman Sachs Global Leaders Program

   Nine hundred students from around the world have been named as
Goldman Sachs Global Leaders since the program began in 2000. The
Global Leaders have built an extensive alumni network and, with modest
seed funding from the program's Social Entrepreneurship Fund, have
joined forces to launch innovative social ventures. Funded projects to
date have assisted with the creation of a community school in India,
stopping the spread of malaria in Africa, and providing scholarships
for children orphaned by AIDS in Thailand.

&lt;p&gt;mVision to Be Used for Bioprocess Optimization
RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
Metabolon, Inc., the leader in metabolomics-driven biomarker
discovery and analysis, announced today the implementation of its
metabolomics technology at Pfizer's Bioprocess R Group. This global
biochemical profiling technology, called mVision, will provide
analysis of samples from bioreactors. Using mVision, Pfizer will be
able to rapidly understand cellular metabolism in the
biopharmaceutical production process, which in turn will enable Pfizer
to optimize bioprocesses and to reduce manufacture costs.

   The use of metabolomics for bioprocess optimization is a novel
application for the latest of the "omics" technologies. The global
analysis of biochemicals provides a snapshot of the metabolic state of
cells as they grow in a bioreactor.

   These cells grow in a nutrient-rich media, using nutrients to
produce the protein of interest. In many cases, an essential nutrient
is depleted more rapidly than the others, causing the cells to stop
growing. By analyzing hundreds of nutrients over time, the
rate-limiting component can rapidly be identified. In addition to
producing the desired protein product, cells produce metabolites which
can be toxic to the cells. Given the large number of metabolites
produced in a cell, only a global analysis can identify the toxic
species.

   "Pfizer's commitment to our platform demonstrates the power of
metabolomics for understanding complex systems like bioreactors," said
John Ryals, president and chief executive of Metabolon. "By monitoring
a large number of biochemicals in a bioreactor process, customers can
quickly uncover areas for optimization. Traditionally, scientists have
monitored only a handful of parameters to optimize bioprocessing. With
our approach, they can monitor ten times the number of parameters."

   "The ultimate goal for Pfizer is to achieve molecular-level
knowledge of cellular metabolism in industrially relevant mammalian
cell lines," said Ellen McCormick, director of the Bioprocess Research
and Development organization in Pfizer's Global Research and
Development division. "We seek this information to enable rationale
design of process improvements and cell line selection, toward
improved quality, robustness and productivity of our biotherapeutic
manufacturing processes."

   About Metabolon

   Metabolon is a diagnostics and services company offering the
industry's leading biochemical profiling platform. Metabolon's
patented platform provides a global analysis of complex biological
samples for the discovery of markers and pathways associated with drug
action and disease. This metabolomics-driven approach enables the
identification of biomarkers useful for the development of a wide
range of diagnostics and provides insight into complex biochemical
processes such as drug action, toxicology and bioprocess optimization.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Senior Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) investment banker Kendrick Wilson will take a leave of absence to advise U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on the nation's banking crisis, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson, a vice chairman of investment banking and chairman of Goldman's financial institutions business, has played a key role advising banks on capital raising and reorganizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is expected to help address the crisis gripping banks, Wall Street firms and mortgage lenders, the sources said. He is expected to serve without pay through January, when President George W. Bush's second term ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman declined to comment on the matter. Treasury officials were not immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson, 61, joined Goldman in 1998 and was a leading dealmaker during the bank merger boom of the late 1990s. Previously he was a vice chairman and head of investment banking at Lazard, Freres  Co, which he left amid a period of management turmoil at the partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was president of Ranieri  Co from 1988 to 1989, a firm set up by famed mortgage securities banker Lewis Ranieri. He was a senior executive vice president for now-defunct brokerage E.F. Hutton in 1987.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dartmouth College graduate served in the Vietnam War as a U.S. Special Forces officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A slump in housing prices and crumbling mortgage markets have gutted banks worldwide over the past year, generating more than $400 billion in losses and write-downs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, the Treasury and the Federal Reserve have faced the growing threat of bank failures, depleted capital levels and a loss of confidence in such market pillars as mortgage finance giant Fannie Mae FNM.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bush made a personal call to Wilson in recent days, asking him to assist Paulson, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Dhanya Skariachan in Bangalore; Editing by Tomasz Janowski and John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Company Earns a Microsoft Competency in Independent Software
                       Vendor/Software Solutions
COLUMBUS, Ohio--(Business Wire)--
Astute Solutions (www.astutesolutions.com) today announced it has
attained Gold Certified Partner status in the Microsoft Partner
Program with a competency in Independent Software Vendor
(ISV)/Software Solutions, recognizing Astute Solutions' expertise and
impact in the technology marketplace. As a Gold Certified Partner,
Astute Solutions has demonstrated expertise with Microsoft
technologies and a proven ability to meet customers' needs.

   Astute Solutions develops CRM, knowledge management and customer

   The ISV/Software Solutions Competency recognizes the skill and

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN, Ireland--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/fe2260/goldman_sachs_grou)
has announced the addition of the "Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. - IT
Sales Opportunities - 2008" report to their offering.

   Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Goldman Sachs) is a global investment
banking, securities and investment management firm that provides a
range of services worldwide to a client base that includes
corporations, financial institutions, governments and high-net-worth
individuals. Founded in 1869, it is one of the oldest and largest
investment banking firms. Its activities are divided into three
segments: Investment Banking, Trading and Principal Investments, and
Asset Management and Securities Services. The firm is headquartered in
New York and maintains offices in London, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Hong Kong
and other major financial centers around the world.

   Industry trends and drivers have a direct or indirect affect on IT
spending of all companies operating within an industry. For example -
increased threat perception and incidence of fraud would result in
increase in demand for security software and hardware. Thus, we can
conclude that industry spending on any particular IT product or
service is an important indicator of the criticality of that product
or service for the industry. Based on the IT spend information
available in 'TechNavio', we have computed a 'criticality score' for
various IT products and services, for Goldman Sachs.

   Through an in-depth analysis of industry trends and drivers and
company level developments and events, we have made the 'IT Selling
Opportunities Map' for hardware, software and IT services for Goldman
Sachs. These maps have been divided into four zones representing Level
I, Level II and Level III opportunity areas. Level I opportunity areas
have the highest scores and hence, there is a high probability that
Goldman Sachs will buy these products and services. Level II
opportunity areas have lower scores and hence, lower probability to
sell to Goldman Sachs. Level III opportunities have the lowest scores
and hence, unlikely to sell to Goldman Sachs.

   The report is meant for IT vendors and intends to help them
identify selling opportunities within the company. Furthermore, the
identified sales drivers can be used to penetrate these accounts or
increase current share of the customer's wallet. Also, the report
lists key IT spending decision makers, which enables the salesperson
to directly contact the key executives within the company.

   TechNavio Insights is a set of reports based on TechNavio - a
market intelligence platform for the IT industry. It builds on the
intelligence available within TechNavio, and leverages on the custom
research experience of the Technology Navigators. TechNavio is built
on years of experience of the authors in deep dive custom research and
consulting for over 30 Fortune 500 companies and numerous large and
mid-sized companies.

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's migration service said it would not give a visa to TNK-BP TNBPI.RTS Chief Executive Robert Dudley without a valid contract, a move that may help the Russian-connected co-owners oust the BP-backed executive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move is the latest in a long-running battle at TNK-BP, a 50-50 joint venture between BP (BP.L) and four oligarchs, over the firm's management and strategy. TNK-BP is Russia's second- biggest foreign investment and investors are following the fight closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We cannot grant a visa to Mr. Dudley before he presents a valid contract. The previous contract expired and we have no proof that it has been prolonged," Konstantin Poltoranin, a spokesman at the Federal Migration Service (FMS) told Reuters on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dudley's contract expired last year but BP says it is still valid under Russia's Labor Code because it has never been officially terminated and therefore rolls over automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four Russian billionaires, who want to sack Dudley as part of their dispute with BP, say the contract has never been officially renewed and is therefore no longer valid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source close to TNK-BP dismissed as "nonsense" the idea that Dudley did not have a valid contract, saying a board resolution tabled by the Russian oligarchs to sack Dudley earlier this year in itself proved that they recognized his contact was valid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dudley has a valid Russian work permit but needs to present a valid work contract to get his visa renewed. His visa expired on July 19, but the migration service agreed to give him a transit visa, which is valid until July 27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He (Dudley) has been given 10 days to present a contract. We may extend his visa one more time, but without a valid contract, he cannot work in Russia," the FMS's Poltoranin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dudley is also facing penalties from a judge after a labor inspector found some minor violations, the TNK-BP source said. These could include suspending him from his post for a period of up to three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously the pressure is mounting," the source said. "The likelihood is that somehow they will try to engineer Dudley's suspension this week so that the Migration Service can then say they don't need to consider his visa request and he has to leave."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's ridiculous but this is the reality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Katya Golubkova and Michael Stott; Writing by Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Erica Billingham)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - U.S. computer giant IBM (IBM.N) shed more of its stake in top Chinese PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd (0992.HK), offloading up to $80 million worth of stock at a 3.9 percent to 7 percent discount to its closing price on Monday, according to a document sent to investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  (Adds Chalco's statement on output cuts)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, July 21 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs cut its rating
on Aluminium Corp of China (Chaloc) (2600.HK), the country's
largest producer of the metal, to neutral from buy on Monday on
expectations of another power tariff hike by Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China raised on-grid power tariffs by an average of 4.5
percent this month, piling pressure on electricity-hungry
aluminium smelters such as Chalco (601600.SS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage house also cut its target price on Chalco to
HK$11 from HK$17. Shares in the company, which have slid 46
percent so far this year, were up 1.3 percent on Monday at
HK$8.73, lagging a 3 percent gain on the benchmark index .HSI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Power shortages in China are also affecting Chalco's
production and a looming crisis threatens smelters' planned
capacity expansion this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chalco confirmed two joint ventures in Shanxi province had
shut some capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said in a statement its 60-percent owned Shanxi Huaze
Aluminium and 51-percent owned Shanxi Hua Sheng Aluminium had
closed some production pots since June 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As of July 18, Huaze's closed pots would reduce the smelter's
monthly output by 25 percent, Chalco said in the statement posted
on its website (www.chalco.com.cn). It has capacity of 280,000
tonnes of primary aluminium production a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hua Sheng's closed pots would cut the smelter's monthly
output by 22 percent. It has capacity of 220,000 tonnes a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chalco did not say when the plants would resume full
production but expected the two smelters would lose output by a
total of 30,000 tonnes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In early June, aluminium smelters said they had expected
power fees to rise in the second half, which has supported global
aluminium prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chalco, which issued a profit warning for the first half of
the year in June, also joined China's top aluminium smelters in
cutting production by 5-10 percent with an aim to push up prices
of the commodity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock has come under severe selling pressure in recent
weeks, with mounting input costs and falling prices of its main
product alumina, seen eroding the company's bottomline.

Secretary Henry Paulson on how to resolve the country's banking

He said on Sunday that his last appearance on the program would be on August 17 and that he intended to co-host another film review show that "honors the standards established by Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert more than 30 years ago."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Steve Gorman and Eric Beech)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, July 22 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) should
take on debt to repurchase stock as a way to revive its
flagging share price, a financial analyst said in a new report
issued on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Friedman, Billings, Ramsey  Co analyst David Hilal called
on the company to take advantage of its predictable cash flow
and rock solid balance sheet to execute a leveraged buyback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hilal argues that by taking on debt to repurchase shares,
Microsoft will have the flexibility to put in place a large
share buyback without compromising the ability to be
acquisitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The financial impact of a leveraged buyback should improve
Microsoft's valuation and affirm management's faith in the
company's prospects and change the perception that management
does not care about its stock price," wrote Hilal in a note to
clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's stock has fallen 28 percent in 2008. The shares
are trading at 12 times estimated fiscal 2009 earnings compared
with a price-to-earnings ratio of 20 for the software sector.
The stock closed up 16 cents at $25.80 in Nasdaq trading on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, Chris Liddell, Microsoft's chief financial
officer, said the company was "disappointed" its strong
financial results were not reflected in its share price. The
normally reserved CFO said a buyback was "incredibly
attractive" at these price levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The comments were a departure from the company's standard
line that, if Microsoft takes care of earnings, the share price
will take care of itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company will address Wall Street analysts on Thursday
at its annual financial analysts' meeting at its Redmond,
Washington headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has been aggressive in buying back shares. It has
$3 billion left to spend as part of a $36.2 billion five-year
share repurchase program it started in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has said it will go back to its board of
directors once the current amount has been spent to decide on a
next share repurchase program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given the pace of its share buybacks, we expect Microsoft
to exhaust its current repurchase program in the current
quarter," Hilal wrote in the note entitled, "Come on Steve, How
About a Leveraged Buyback?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hilal, referring to Microsoft Chief Executive Steve
Ballmer, rates the stock an "Outperform" with a $40 price
target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has never issued debt in its history, but
Liddell said in February it would likely to do so if its
pursuit of Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) was successful. A deal between
the two companies has not panned out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While it has not raised the possibility of debt issuance in
recent months, analysts note Microsoft's strong balance sheet
would allow the company to get debt at a low price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to Hilal's research, a $20 billion leveraged
buyback would boost its calendar 2009 earnings per share by 7
cents. A $35 billion repurchase would add 13 cents and a $50
billion buyback would be accretive by 20 cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company, whose fiscal year does not follow the calendar
year, has forecast earnings per share in a range of $2.12 to
$2.18 in its fiscal year ending in June 2009. It does not offer
a forecast for the calendar year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft generates about $5 billion a quarter in cash from
operations and it had about $23.6 billion in cash and cash
equivalents at the end of June.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp will turn to users of its Xbox 360 to create new video games and broaden the types of games available on its console, taking a page out of the strategy books of Facebook and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker said on Tuesday that it will start selling "user-generated" games later this year on its online Xbox Live service and share up to 70 percent of revenue with the game developer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft began offering game production tools in 2006 to amateurs and hobbyists under an initiative called "XNA," which allowed developers to create a game that could run on the Xbox, a Windows-based computer or its Zune media player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;User-created content is the backbone of many advertising-supported Web sites such as Facebook and YouTube, but the video game industry has relied mostly on deep-pocketed developers to create sequels or games based on licensed properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook and YouTube provide a forum for new software applications and videos for free, but they do not share advertising fees with users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, however, requires the prospective video game developer to buy a $99-a-year premium membership to the XNA Creators Club, but offers a slice of the revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The games will be sold on the Xbox Live Marketplace at three different prices -- the equivalent of $2.50, $5 or $10 -- using Microsoft points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to get the game into the Xbox Live store, the games must pass a peer-review system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not only are we democratizing game development with Xbox Live Community Games later this year, but we're creating an opportunity for aspiring developers," Chris Satchell, chief technology officer at Microsoft's Interactive Entertainment Business group, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft expects the games created by users will double the number of games available for the Xbox 360 when the Community Games section of its Xbox Live online store comes out of "beta," or test, mode in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi; Editing by Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhanced functionality helps HR departments manage PERM process
                   for employment-based green cards
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
VISANOW, the industry leading immigration solution provider, today
announced the introduction of enhanced technology designed to simplify
the Process Electronic Review Management (PERM) labor certification
process required for employment-based permanent residency
applications, commonly referred to as green cards.

   "Companies rely on international talent to remain competitive in
the global environment, and hiring foreign nationals has become a
critical internal process," commented Robert Meltzer, VISANOW CEO.
"VISANOW's PERM management interface was designed to make it as easy
as possible for employers to manage what can be a challenging task. By
providing employers with transparency and direct access to
information, our technology removes administrative complications and
delivers a higher level of clarity for the application process."

   PERM is an electronic filing process designed by the U.S.
Department of Labor and is the first step towards obtaining
employment-based permanent residence. The typical employment-based
green card process can be broken down into the following three filing
stages:

   1. The Program Electronic Review Management (PERM) Labor
Certification and submission of FORM ETA 9089;

   2. Form I-140 - an employment-based immigration petition; and

   3. Form I-485 - the adjustment of status application for permanent
residency (which ultimately results in the issuance of a green card).

   The VISANOW web-based solution was designed to operate in
conjunction with these stages and ease the transition for employers
and foreign nationals applying for residency. The VISANOW case
management interface visually outlines and organizes the PERM process
for both corporate HR professionals and the applicants filing for
permanent residency. The design of the interface separates each step
of the process into easily identifiable stages. Each stage includes
specific requirements that are tracked and updated in real-time
through the online solution as criteria are fulfilled. The interface
also features timelines that clearly mark recruitment and filing
periods to ensure a timely and successful application is filed.

   "Green cards play a crucial role in helping organizations secure
the global talent they need," said Meltzer. "Employers can create a
recruiting advantage through their green card application process. A
strategic approach to immigration helps employers keep their process
moving forward and serves as a recruiting tool to provide a
much-needed edge when attracting future employees."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 22 (Reuters) - Investors should buy bonds of
General Motors Corp (GM.N) because the largest U.S. automaker
has sufficient access to capital and its bonds have value
relative to its peers, J.P. Morgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) said in a
report on Tuesday,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; GM's 7.2 percent notes due in 2011 have fallen $22 since
February, and its 8.375 percent notes due in 2033 have fallen
$26. Meanwhile, costs to insure its bonds against default with
credit default swaps have widened by 1,160 basis points, the
report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We now believe the bonds and CDS represent relative value
versus the market and its peers," analysts Eric Selle and Atiba
Edwards co-wrote in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan's distressed analysis estimates the value of
the bonds in a distressed liquidation at 34 percent, the report
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GM will be able to boost its capital position with asset
sales, capital market transactions, equity injections and
internal cost-cutting, J.P. Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Successful efforts by GM to bolster its liquidity and
reduce its annual cash burn may mean an average of 32 percent
total return over the next 12 months for GM bonds, the report
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A GM bankruptcy, however, would mean an annual total return
of negative 39 percent.

&lt;p&gt;  WASHINGTON, DC, Jul 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
James R. Mault, MD, a key figure behind Microsoft's innovative
"HealthVault" online personal health platform and an accomplished
physician, researcher and inventor, will speak at a September Summit in
Florida about how personal health records (PHR) can aid the fight against
chronic disease in the workplace.

    Dr. Mault, director of new products and business development for the
Health Solutions Group at Microsoft Corp., will be a featured speaker at
the Sept. 8 to 10 Integrated Care Summit, hosted by the National
Association of Manufacturers and DMAA: The Care Continuum Alliance at the
Westin Diplomat Resort and Spa, in Hollywood, Fla.

    Microsoft HealthVault is designed to put individuals in control of their
health information. A free HealthVault account helps users collect, store
and share information with other trusted individuals -- family members,
for example -- and offers numerous applications and devices to help manage
fitness, diet and health.

    Dr. Mault came to Microsoft with more than 25 years' experience as a
senior executive in the medical device and pharmaceutical industry, as
well as clinical medicine. He founded five medical device and health
monitoring services companies, led them to develop novel technologies,
secured FDA approvals and established strategic partnerships with dozens
of Fortune 500 companies. He is board-certified in both general surgery
and cardiothoracic surgery, having specialty practices in heart and lung
transplantation, thoracic oncology and critical care.

    Dr. Mault has conducted academic medical research under numerous grant
awards from National Institutes of Health, American Cancer Society Inc.
and other organizations; is the author of more than 100 published
scientific articles, chapters and books; and the named inventor of dozens
of issued and pending patents for a variety of medical devices and health
monitoring systems and informatics. Dr. Mault maintains a clinical
faculty position at the University of Colorado at Denver and Health
Sciences Center.

    Recent estimates place the cost of chronic disease at $1.3 trillion
annually and, of that, $1.1 trillion represents the cost of lost
productivity. The Integrated Care Summit, now in its second year,
demonstrates to employers and other health care purchasers how prevention,
wellness and disease management programs can improve employee health and
productivity -- and lower health care costs -- for U.S. manufacturers and
other businesses. Learn more at www.IntegratedCareSummit.org.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) Ken Wilson will temporarily leave the firm to advise Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on how to resolve the country's banking crisis, the Wall Street Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comverse Partners with IBM to Deliver Value-Added Services and Billing Solutions for Telecommunications Providers Worldwide

WAKEFIELD, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Comverse, the leading supplier of software and systems enabling
network-based, multimedia enhanced communication and billing services,
is partnering with IBM (NYSE: IBM) to help telecommunications service
providers worldwide reduce operational costs, increase efficiencies
and drive growth.

   Through a recently-signed technology and services agreement,
Comverse and IBM will offer customers solutions based on IBM's
software products and service delivery platform solutions, together
with Comverse's value-added services and billing and active customer
management solutions.

   "Telecommunications service providers are looking to grow and
generate revenue in new ways," said Mike Hill, General Manager,
Telecommunications Industry, IBM. "At the same time, they are under
competitive pressures to improve the consumer experience and
differentiate themselves in the marketplace. We are excited about
working together with Comverse to offer value-added services such as
the Converged Messaging solutions that keep pace with our clients'
'always on' world."

   "We look forward to working more closely with IBM," said Andre
Dahan, President and CEO, Comverse. "Our wide range of software-based
solutions in value-added services, customer care, self-service and
billing complements the professional services, outsourcing and
technology strengths of IBM. The deeper collaboration of our two
companies should open up many new opportunities to better serve
telecom providers worldwide."

   As part of this expanded relationship, Comverse will include IBM
WebSphere Presence Server and WebSphere XML Document Management Server
(XDMS) as core components of the Comverse Instant SMS product. Instant
SMS helps service providers to enhance existing mobile messaging
services (SMS, MMS) with the richness and real-time user experience of
Instant Messaging. IBM's WebSphere Telecom Web Services Server
software has been combined with Comverse value-added messaging
products to help extend their value to telecommunications service
providers and their subscribers.

   A key example of this is Comverse Messaging Gateway and
SMSC/MMSC's for value-added messaging solutions which provide support
of various types of messaging-based applications such as TV show
'voting.' In addition, when combined with Comverse Converged
Messaging, the WebSphere Telecom Web Services Server can provide a
unified messaging experience and enhanced processing for all types of
messaging. This suite of products and technologies is also included as
part of the IBM service delivery platform solution to provide fast and
efficient development and deployment of applications based on
operators' messaging infrastructure.

   Comverse will also utilize IBM BladeCenter technology for its
value-added services offerings and IBM Power Systems technology
running the AIX 5.3 operating system for its new flagship Comverse(R)
ONE(TM) Billing and Active Customer Management(TM) solution.

&lt;p&gt;  (Adds Exxon Mobil statement, background, paragraphs 7-8, 11-12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Lindsay Beck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BEIJING, July 22 (Reuters) - China said on Tuesday it had
told Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) to pull out of an oil exploration
deal with Vietnam that it sees as a breach of Chinese
sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported the deal on
Sunday, describing it as a preliminary cooperation agreement
between Exxon Mobil and state oil firm PetroVietnam that covers
exploration in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "China's position on the South China Sea is clear and
consistent. On the specific case, we have stated our position to
relevant parties," Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao told a
regular news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "China opposes any activities that infringe on our
sovereignty and territorial integrity in the South China Sea."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China and Vietnam have a number of festering disagreements
over territory, including disputed sovereignty in the Spratly
Islands, a string of rocky outcrops in the South China Sea that
could contain oil and gas deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The islands are also claimed by Taiwan, Brunei, Malaysia and
the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil said in a statement it had not signed any
exploration contracts in Vietnamese waters but that it was
looking at offshore projects with PetroVietnam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "ExxonMobil and PetroVietnam have been working together for
several years to identify potential projects of mutual interest
and are currently conducting preliminary joint technical and
commercial evaluations of several offshore prospects," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The South China Morning Post cited Vietnamese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Le Dung as saying that Hanoi's dealings fell
entirely within the country's legal rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The newspaper also quoted sources as saying Exxon Mobil was
confident of Vietnam's sovereign rights to the blocks in
question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Vietnam and China, neighbours which fought a brief border war
in 1979, have said they are committed to finding a peaceful
solution to the Spratly Islands dispute and have agreed to
cooperate in oil and gas exploration in the Gulf of Tonkin in the
north.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But BP Plc (BP.L) halted plans to conduct exploration work
off the southern Vietnamese coast last year, citing the
territorial tensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  (Reporting by Lindsay Beck; Editing by Nick Macfie)

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Wednesday that Kevin Johnson, who as president of Microsoft's largest business division spearheaded the company's pursuit of Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), is leaving the software maker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will undergo a reorganization, splitting the division that Johnson runs -- platforms and services -- into two groups, one focusing on the Windows operating system and the other on search and other online services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson's departure is the latest hurdle to a possible transaction between Yahoo and Microsoft, a few days after the Web company and investor Carl Icahn settled a looming proxy fight to force Yahoo to strike a deal with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source briefed on the matter said Johnson will leave to become the chief executive at Juniper Networks Inc JNPR.O, which makes equipment for communications networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The departure of Johnson, who worked closely with Ballmer during its on-again, off-again negotiations with Yahoo, is another setback for Microsoft's online business, where the company is trailing Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three executives working in the Windows division will report directly to Ballmer, while the company said it will conduct an internal and external search to find a new head for its online services business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The head of Microsoft's online advertising group and Web search operations will remain in place. The new structure will allow the online business to be more agile and more focused, Ballmer said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last few months were hectic for Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, Microsoft offered more than $40 billion to buy all of Yahoo. When the Web pioneer rejected that initial offer, Microsoft countered with a proposal to buy only Yahoo's search business but that offer was also turned down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson, known as "KJ" within the company, was in the inner circle of Microsoft executives who tried desperately to clinch a deal with Yahoo in order to build up its search market share and strengthen its online advertising business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft even sided with billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who was seeking to replace Yahoo's board. However, earlier this week, Yahoo and Icahn settled their dispute, granting the investor three board seats to defuse a proxy battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo investors took that as a sign that there would be no imminent deal with Microsoft and Yahoo's shares fell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson joined Microsoft in 1992 and worked his way up to being the head of worldwide sales. He was then put in charge of the Windows business and tasked with incorporating the online services business with its traditional software groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's platform and services division accounted for about a third of Microsoft's revenues and included its most profitable business, Windows, and its weakest link, online services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source close to Microsoft said that Johnson has been searching for an opportunity to run his own company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson's departure is another sign of a changing of the guard within Microsoft's top ranks. Bill Gates, Microsoft's non-executive chairman, stepped down from day-to-day duties at the company at the end of June to focus on philanthropy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeff Raikes, who had led Microsoft's Office business, announced earlier this year that he also planned to leave the company. He later accepted the CEO job at Gates' charitable organization, the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did not announce when Johnson would leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juniper declined to comment.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details about Yahoo negotiations, byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Daisuke Wakabayashi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, July 23 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said
on Wednesday that Kevin Johnson, who as president of
Microsoft's largest business division spearheaded the company's
pursuit of Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), is leaving the software maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft will undergo a reorganization, splitting the
division that Johnson runs -- platforms and services -- into
two groups, one focusing on the Windows operating system and
the other on search and other online services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Johnson's departure is the latest hurdle to a possible
transaction between Yahoo and Microsoft, a few days after the
Web company and investor Carl Icahn settled a looming proxy
fight to force Yahoo to strike a deal with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A source briefed on the matter said Johnson will leave to
become the chief executive at Juniper Networks Inc JNPR.O,
which makes equipment for communications networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The departure of Johnson, who worked closely with Ballmer
during its on-again, off-again negotiations with Yahoo, is
another setback for Microsoft's online business, where the
company is trailing Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three executives working in the Windows division will
report directly to Ballmer, while the company said it will
conduct an internal and external search to find a new head for
its online services business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The head of Microsoft's online advertising group and Web
search operations will remain in place. The new structure will
allow the online business to be more agile and more focused,
Ballmer said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The last few months were hectic for Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In February, Microsoft offered more than $40 billion to buy
all of Yahoo. When the Web pioneer rejected that initial offer,
Microsoft countered with a proposal to buy only Yahoo's search
business but that offer was also turned down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Johnson, known as "KJ" within the company, was in the inner
circle of Microsoft executives who tried desperately to clinch
a deal with Yahoo in order to build up its search market share
and strengthen its online advertising business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft even sided with billionaire investor Carl Icahn,
who was seeking to replace Yahoo's board. However, earlier this
week, Yahoo and Icahn settled their dispute, granting the
investor three board seats to defuse a proxy battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo investors took that as a sign that there would be no
imminent deal with Microsoft and Yahoo's shares fell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Johnson joined Microsoft in 1992 and worked his way up to
being the head of worldwide sales. He was then put in charge of
the Windows business and tasked with incorporating the online
services business with its traditional software groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's platform and services division accounted for
about a third of Microsoft's revenues and included its most
profitable business, Windows, and its weakest link, online
services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A source close to Microsoft said that Johnson has been
searching for an opportunity to run his own company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Johnson's departure is another sign of a changing of the
guard within Microsoft's top ranks. Bill Gates, Microsoft's
non-executive chairman, stepped down from day-to-day duties at
the company at the end of June to focus on philanthropy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jeff Raikes, who had led Microsoft's Office business,
announced earlier this year that he also planned to leave the
company. He later accepted the CEO job at Gates' charitable
organization, the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft did not announce when Johnson would leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Juniper declined to comment. The company, which has been
searching for a chief operating officer, is reporting quarterly
earnings on Thursday.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 23 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) has
raised $10 billion to create a fund that will invest in loans
used to back leveraged buy outs and take advantage of a gap in
the markets caused by the credit crisis, according to a
Financial Times report on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman will use the fund to buy senior loans, or those
that are paid off before other debts. The investment bank
already has a $20 billion fund that invests in mezzanine debts,
paid after the senior debt, the paper reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FT wrote that between the two funds, Goldman can commit
to financing large deals on its own without having to recruit
outside investors for the debt. The paper said the Goldman
funds were much larger that those of other equity firms and
investment banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's new fund, will operate under Goldman's private
equity arm, with money from the firm's clients, and its bank
and partners, according to the FT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The article said that while the fundraising is not yet
officially complete, its head, Tom Connolly is already looking
at deals. Citing people familiar with the transaction, the FT
said one such deal would provide the senior debt for the sale
of a $2 billion manufacturing company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A representative from Goldman Sachs was not immediately
available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Phil Wahba)

&lt;p&gt;TORONTO, July 23 (Reuters) - Visa Canada on Wednesday said
it was investigating possible fraud tied to air travel, with
news reports specifying that there may be problems at
self-service check-in kiosks at Toronto's Pearson International
airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Visa Canada is currently investigating isolated reports of
fraud that have a correlation with air travel, in particular at
a Canadian airport," the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are working with airport officials and the airlines to
investigate the situation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scott Armstrong, a spokesman for the Greater Toronto
Airports Authority, which runs Pearson International Airport,
said that none of the airport's kiosks are being taken out of
service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But WestJet (WJA.TO), the country's second-largest airline,
said it had decided to disable the credit-card check-in feature
on the kiosks that it uses at airports across Canada as a
temporary measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is an investigation being conducted by Visa together
with the GTAA with respect to potential credit card fraud,"
said Richard Bartrem, a vice president at WestJet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We've decided to take the proactive measure of temporarily
disabling the credit card portion of that check-in process
while this investigation is ongoing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peter Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for Air Canada owner ACE
Aviation ACEa.TO, said that the largest airline had no plans
to take similar action to West Jet's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most airline customers use other methods of identification
when they use the kiosks, such as a passport, reservation
number, or online check-in, rather than their credit card, both
Fitzpatrick and Bartrem said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Globe and Mail newspaper said on Wednesday that an
investigation of suspected credit-card fraud at the airport,
Canada's busiest, was focusing on the security of its 150
self-service check-in kiosks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Greater Toronto Airports Authority owns the kiosk
hardware, while the software connects to the airlines,
spokesman Armstrong noted, adding that the airport operator is
cooperating with the credit card issuer's investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said they
were not involved in the probe.

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Chemical's Santoprene TPV 85TL Bonds with Metal to Simplify Automotive Weatherseal Fabrication

HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Chemical's Santoprene(TM) thermoplastic vulcanizate
(TPV) 8291-85TL bonds directly to metal to simplify weatherseal
fabrication. This grade is suitable for virtually any automotive
weatherseal application where metal and TPV surfaces can be joined in
a co-extrusion process.

   Santoprene TPV 8291-85TL is used as a tie layer between a TPV and
the metal portions of a weatherseal. Because of a strong cohesive
chemical bond with the metal, it eliminates solvent-based primer and
adhesive systems as well as the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) they
generate.

   Elastomer-to-metal weatherseal applications typically have relied
on a combination of thermoset rubber and commercial adhesives to
create a bond. Adhesive systems can be complex to apply, generally
requiring mechanical cleaning or sand blasting, chemical vapor
degreasing, solvent wiping, and masking to prevent excess primer or
adhesive, both of which can affect sealing functionality and
aesthetics.

   "This specialty grade can significantly cut labor costs by
reducing the number of steps involved compared with an adhesive
bonding system," said Lisa Dimitrijevs, market manager, automotive
weatherseals, ExxonMobil Chemical. "We expect it will create many
TPV-to-metal application opportunities."

   Santoprene TPV 8291-85TL creates a consistent bond enabling the
manufacture of high quality parts with complex designs. Bonding
successfully to cold rolled steel, galvanized steel, stainless steel,
aluminum, copper and more, Santoprene TPV 8291-85TL can be used in
automotive weatherseal applications including metal supported belt
line seals or division bars, lower sash seals and door trim. Other
non-automotive applications include sealing devices, grips and sound
dampening panels.

   The adhesion strength of Santoprene TPV 8291-85TL to stainless
steel and aluminum is comparable to using a commercial adhesive
system. In tests on finished coextruded profiles, peel strengths of 30
to 55 pounds per linear inch were obtained.

   Automotive weatherseal applications benefit from Santoprene TPV
because it offers reduced weight, lower system costs, design
flexibility and recyclability with the equivalent long-term sealing
performance and weatherability of thermoset rubber.

   ExxonMobil Chemical is a technology leader in TPV bonding grades
and weatherseal systems. It has a broad portfolio of Santoprene TPVs
that bond to rubber, plastics and metal, providing innovative
multi-functional sealing system solutions.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission will propose forcing U.S. diplomats to get visas to travel to the European Union from January 2009 unless Washington moves toward granting citizens of all EU states visa-free entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"No tangible progress has been made regarding the United States despite all efforts of the Commission and individual member states," the EU executive said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Citizens of 12 EU member states continue to require a visa when traveling to the United States," a statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Therefore, the Commission will propose retaliatory measures e.g. temporary restoration of the visa requirement for U.S. nationals holding diplomatic and service/official passports as from January 1, 2009 if no progress is achieved."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most older EU states belong to the U.S. visa waiver program, which allows their citizens to travel without visas. But this does not apply to 11 of the 12 mostly ex-communist countries that joined the 27-member bloc in 2004 and 2007, or to older member Greece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visas are a sensitive issue in EU-U.S. relations, and it is not the first time the EU has threatened to slap visa requirements on U.S. diplomats in retaliation for not extending a visa waiver scheme to all EU states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. official said U.S. law does not allow Washington to extend a blanket visa waiver to all EU members, saying each country must meet set conditions on taking back deported nationals, promptly reporting lost and stolen passports and sharing information on "known or suspected terrorists."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While acknowledging no countries have been added to the U.S. visa waiver program since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the official said Washington was working "aggressively" to expand the program and he expected progress by January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe that those efforts will come to fruition in the next six months and ... we don't expect that the European Union will be unhappy with the progress that's been made," Stewart Baker, assistant secretary for policy at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was unclear what effect the EU retaliation, if carried out, would have. A State Department spokesman said that some EU members already require U.S. diplomats making short visits to obtain a visa, while others do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. refusal to extend its visa waiver systematically to all EU newcomers causes resentment in countries that are among the most loyal U.S. allies -- some with troops fighting under American command in Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bush administration's decision earlier this year to sign separate visa deals with several ex-communist central European countries -- instead of with the EU as a whole -- created tension within the bloc and across the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States has said it plans to allow some new EU states to join its visa-free program this year. The EU executive says its threat is meant to put pressure on the United States to carry out its plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is unacceptable that nationals from some third countries can benefit from visa-free travel to the EU while some of our fellow EU citizens can't travel visa-free to those countries," EU Justice and Security Commissioner Jacques Barrot said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission said on Wednesday it is also in dispute with Singapore and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Commission said on Wednesday that sanctions should be considered against Singapore if it did not grant three-month visa-free stays "within a reasonable time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission also said Japan should allow visa-free travel to all EU citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said significant progress had been achieved with Canada, which has lifted the visa requirement for six EU states over the last 10 months, while Israel, Malaysia and Paraguay lifted visa requirements for all EU countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Arshad Mohammed in Washington; Editing by Tim Pearce and David Wiessler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings removes from Rating Watch Negative and downgrades 7
classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp.,
pass-through certificates, Series 2007-FL1, as follows:

   --$11.9 million class RS-1 to 'BB+ from 'AA-';

   --$12.8 million class RS-2 to 'BB' from 'A+';

   --$15.6 million class RS-3 to 'BB-' from 'A';

   --$11.1 million class RS-4 to 'B+' from 'A-';

   --$15.4 million class RS-5 to 'B' from 'BBB+';

   --$13.2 million class RS-6 to 'B-' from 'BBB';

   --$7.6 million class RS-7 to 'B-' from 'BBB-';

   In addition, Fitch affirms the following classes:

   --$873.6 million class A-1 at 'AAA';

   --$243.1 million class A-2 at 'AAA'

   --Interest-only class X-1 at 'AAA';

   --Interest-only class X-2 at 'AAA';

   --$53.7 million class B at 'AA+';

   --$38.4 million class C at 'AA';

   --$36.4 million class D at 'AA-'

   --$44.1 million class E at 'A+',

   --$30.7 million class F at 'A';

   --$30.7 million class G at 'A-;

   --$42.2 million class H at 'BBB+';

   --$38.4 million class J at 'BBB';

   --$34.5 million class K at 'BBB-';

   --$38.4 million class L at 'BBB-';

   The downgrade of the Resorts International rake classes is as a
result of Fitch's review of updated financial information, in addition
to an analysis of the overall Atlantic City gaming market fundamentals
and performance.

   As of year-end (YE) 2007, the Resorts International portfolio's
net cash flow declined approximately 32% from Fitch's stressed net
cash flow at issuance. The decrease in cash flow is attributed to
multiple factors: increased competition, a smoking ban introduced
throughout the entire Atlantic City gaming market, and the overall
negative performance of the gaming industry due to general
macro-economic conditions throughout the U.S. For the first three
months ended March 31, 2008, the Atlantic City gaming market recorded
a 17.7% decrease in gross operating profit from the same period in
2007. Fitch does not expect the cash flow to reach the same levels as
at issuance.

   Resorts International, the fourth largest loan, consists of a
$120.2 million senior trust component and $87.7 million in subordinate
rake (RS) classes. The loan is secured by one casino/hotel property
located in Atlantic City, NJ and two casino/hotel properties located
in Tunica, MS. The total debt on the portfolio, including the trust
portion, totals $506.3 million. In September 2007, the Resorts East
Chicago property was released from the portfolio, paying down the
senior trust component by approximately 47%. The loan matures on
November 9, 2008 and has three one-year extension options.

   The affirmations are due to expected performance and continued
stabilization of the remaining loans since issuance. As of the July
2008 remittance report, the transaction has paid down by approximately
12.3% (including the subordinate rake classes). All of the original 22
loans remain in the trust. In addition to the Resorts International
loan, the PHOV Portfolio (11.3%) has exercised a partial release, and
as a result has paid down by 17.6%. There are no specially serviced
loans, and all loans are current. All of the senior pooled notes that
remain in the transaction maintain investment grade shadow ratings.

   The transaction consists of loans collateralized by hotel
properties (72.1%), retail (19.6%), office (5.6%) multifamily (1.6%)
and industrial/warehouse (1.1%).

   The largest loan is secured by the Walden Galleria (15.4% of the
senior trust components), a mall located in Buffalo, NY. The property
completed the addition of the 300,000 sf ThEATery in the fall of 2007,
adding national retailers such as Barnes &amp; Noble, Urban Outfitters and
the Cheesecake Factory. As of YE 2007, the mall was approximately 97%
occupied. The sponsor is Pyramid. The loan matures on May 9, 2009 and
has three one-year extension options.

   The second largest loan is secured by the Marriott Waikiki
(12.9%), a full service hotel located along Kalakaua Avenue, across
from Waikiki Beach in Honolulu, HI. The property began a $28 million
renovation in January 2008 that is expected to be completed in the
fall of 2008. The sponsor, Whitehall, has provided a renovation
guaranty. As of April 2008, the trailing twelve month occupancy,
average daily rate (ADR) and revenue per available room (RevPAR) were
83.6%, $193 and $161, respectively. The loan matures in May 9, 2009,
and has three one-year extension options.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO &amp; NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
This week, Fitch published reports on two of the largest issuers
of debt in the Media and Entertainment sector: Time Warner Inc. and
The Walt Disney Company.

   In the case of Time Warner, Fitch analyzed post-TWC transaction
business risk and credit considerations within the company's
indentures and organizational debt structure. Fitch believes that
while there may be further corporate actions contemplated by
management, the company has the flexibility and commitment to maintain
mid 'BBB' ratings.

   In Disney's case, Fitch addressed market concerns regarding the
cyclicality of the business and highlighted several other factors that
differentiate Disney's credit profile from that of its peers. Fitch
believes Disney can comfortably withstand both a cyclical downturn and
secular shifts taking place in the broader media space.

   Each report includes a discussion of the key credit risks and
opportunities for the companies going forward. The reports also
include a capital structure diagram, a portfolio summary, and a
summary of key credit facility and indenture provisions.

   The reports, 'Time Warner, Inc. - Smaller But Stable; A Look at
Post Transaction TWX' and 'The Walt Disney Company - Credit Stability
Amid a Weakening Economy' are available on the Fitch Ratings web site

&lt;p&gt;.NET Interoperability Extends Beyond PHP and Java to Include Ruby,
                            Spring and Perl
PORTLAND, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
WSO2, the open source SOA company, will demonstrate extended
service-oriented architecture (SOA) interoperability with the
Microsoft .NET Framework at the OSCON 2008 Open Source Convention
being held at the Oregon Convention Center in Portland, OR. Featured
will be a StockTrader 2.0 composite application that highlights new
.NET interoperability with Ruby, Spring and Perl in addition to the
interoperability with PHP and Java that was highlighted at Microsoft
Tech Tech-Ed North America 2008 IT Professionals conference last
month. The demonstrations will take place at a co-branded booth for
Microsoft and WSO2 in the OSCON Expo Hall, July 23-24, 2008.

   StockTrader 2.0 is the result of a mutual effort between WSO2 and
Microsoft to provide a reference application for software architects
and developers implementing today's heterogeneous SOAs. It
demonstrates the several ways in which they can create composite Web
services by bridging Microsoft .NET-based applications to other
environments using WSO2's integrated, heterogeneous SOA platform.

   StockTrader 2.0 Demo Combines .NET, Java, PHP, Ruby, Spring and
Perl

   Where: Microsoft-WSO2 Booth at OSCON 2008 Expo

   When: Wednesday, July 23, 10 a.m.-4:30 p.m. and 6:00-7:30 p.m.
(reception). Thursday, July 24, 10 a.m.-5:00 p.m.

   Demo: The StockTrader 2.0 demo composite application is based on
distributed Microsoft .NET and Apache/WSO2 middleware components. It
illustrates how interoperable implementations of Web service protocols
allow a seamless mix-and-match of the application's components at
runtime, which can be dynamically virtualized against physical
resources on-premises and across the cloud. Components included in the
demo are:

   --  Choice of User interface: .NET smart client, PHP and Ruby Web
        applications

   --  Choice of business processing service: .NET, Java, PHP, Spring
        and Perl

   --  Choice of order processing service: .NET, Java, PHP, Ruby,
        Spring and Perl

   WSO2 provides enterprise-class protection of service interactions
with support for the full WS-Security stacks in the WSO2 Web Services
Application Server and Web Services Framework for Spring, both based
on Apache Axis2/Java, and in the WSO2 Web Services Frameworks for PHP,
Ruby and Perl, which are based on Apache Axis2/C.

   A download of the StockTrader 2.0 demo is available on the WSO2
Oxygen Tank developer portal for SOA at
http://wso2.org/interop/stocktrader. The demo currently features .NET
interoperability with PHP and Java. The expanded version, which adds
interoperability with Ruby, Spring and Perl, will be available for
download shortly.

services and of members of the Apache Software Foundation Web services
community. The company delivers the only tightly integrated, entirely
open source middleware stack that is optimized for SOA. The WSO2 SOA
products address the core components of SOAs: service creation,
connection, composition and governance. The company is backed by Intel

&lt;p&gt;Datawatch Expands Strategic Partner Program - Welcomes Four New IBM Content Manager OnDemand Partners

    New Additions Extend the Reach of Monarch RMS to IBM CMOD Users
CHELMSFORD, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Datawatch Corporation (NASDAQ-CM: DWCH), a leader in Enterprise
Information Management (EIM), today announced that it has expanded its
Strategic Partner Program for Monarch RMS. Joining recently announced
Silicon Plains Technologies and Lighthouse Computer Services are four
new IBM Content Manager OnDemand Partners which include The Dayhuff
Group, enChoice Technologies, Genus Technologies LLC and MSI Systems
Integrators.

   Datawatch's partner program is comprised of industry leading
systems integrators that bring strategic value to IBM Content Manager
OnDemand (CMOD) customers in the areas of consulting, vertical
expertise, technology integration, and implementation services. In
addition to bolstering Datawatch's partner network, these new
strategic partnerships will provide the benefits of Monarch RMS to
more end user organizations, and will dramatically extend the value of
their existing reports to solve real business problems without
programming.

   Monarch RMS, Datawatch's web-based report mining and Business
Intelligence (BI) solution, transforms static reports and other
business documents stored in a customer's IBM DB2(R) CMOD system into
real, actionable data--such as Excel spreadsheets--with the click of a
mouse. Now companies have the power to leverage the value of their
business documents as a trusted and low cost source of decision
support information and BI, without the need for custom programming or
report writing, or the need to build and support a data mart or data
warehouse.

   "An increasing number of the top IBM Content Manager OnDemand
Partners recognize the significant value that report-based BI offers
their customers. We're very pleased that these partners turn to
Datawatch solutions to help their customers increase the value of
their archives by transforming them into valuable sources of BI," said
John Kitchen, senior vice president and CMO for Datawatch. "Like
Datawatch, these partners understand that a complete EIM solution; one
that provides the benefits of both BI and Enterprise Content
Management--without the need to change their business processes--can
dramatically improve the way IBM CMOD customers solve critical
business issues. With these new partnerships we continue to execute
strategic initiatives that squarely address these issues," added
Kitchen.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jul 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Romero Group, Peru's largest private business group,
today announced they have signed a five-year IT infrastructure
outsourcing agreement.

    To keep up with growing SAP resource demands, Romero Group started to
assess -- in late 2007 -- the outsourcing of their technology platform as
well as different services options available in the market. They sought a
technology partner who would be capable of meeting the highest SAP
outsourcing quality standards at competitive costs.

    To meet these needs, IBM proposed a solution that leveraged its external
storage and UNIX processing technologies, which met all the technical
requirements and could provide the expected benefits. The service scope
also included the application of outsourcing best practices, which IBM has
leveraged with over 50 customers in Peru and on hundreds of technology
campuses worldwide.

    In addition, Romero Group has decided to expand the solutions scope to
other IT components, adding new services for Intel and Power Systems
platforms, as well as in-store equipment maintenance services.

    "Romero Group's confidence in IBM further demonstrates our ability to
deliver quality services as well as the continued need to develop our
outsourcing services through investments in existing technology campuses
and in the human capital for our organization," said Eduardo Sarmiento,
Services Manager for Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, Paraguay and Uruguay.

    The agreement was signed in April of 2008.

&lt;p&gt;RIA Thought Leader, Web Spiders, Identifies Key Industry Developments Following Microsoft Partner Conference in Houston


   --  Company CEO Lends Insight On Exploding Rich-Internet and
        Rich-Mobile Apps

   --  Validity of company Strategies for Silverlight and Enterprise
        Content Management Reinforced by Microsoft Leaders
SUCCASUNNA, N.J.--(Business Wire)--
Web Spiders, Inc. (www.webspiders.com), the premier global Web 2.0
rich Internet and rich mobile application (RIA) product development
company for entrepreneurs and independent software vendors (ISVs),
today offered perspective on trends and the future of RIA and
applications development following this month's Microsoft Partner
Conference. Web Spiders showcased its enterprise-scale RIA offerings
at the conference, and solidified its leadership as among the first to
launch a full-fledged Silverlight practice.

   "Even as Microsoft was introducing its groundbreaking Silverlight
application platform, Web Spiders was at the fore with a complete,
up-and-running practice in Silverlight and SharePoint," said Siddharth
"Sid" Jhunjhunwala, Web Spiders CEO. "We are pleased that the
conference validated our vision in specialized Windows mobile and rich
Internet services, and look forward to the opportunity to share our
view of the industry in light Microsoft's groundbreaking services
system."

   Among the trends and topics Web Spiders identified that will
explored and expanding by the center, the following were central:

   --  The soundness of the Microsoft strategy is solidly reinforced.
        For example, the NBC Beijing Olympics site is perhaps the most
        prominent model of Silverlight implementation.

   --  Silverlight and WPF (for rich client desktops) ultimately will
        become the front end for all MS Web apps and client apps.
        Microsoft's own CEO, Steve Ballmer, even noted during the
        conference that SharePoint was fastest of the company's
        offerings to reach $1 billion in sales. Moreover, the demand
        for SharePoint services now far outstrips availability of
        system integrators.

   --  Among the benefits to become central in the roll out of
        Silverlight will be the ability to "Say No to Refresh." A
        perhaps surprising driver for Silverlight will be the
        obsolescence of the refresh command while on a Web site
        seeking to get immediately updated information.

   --  Web Spiders is today assured of the validity of both its RIA /
        Silverlight strategy and its enterprise content management
        strategy, reinforced as they have been by Microsoft's top
        executives.

   A seasoned spokesperson on all things Web 2.0, Jhunjhunwala is a
serial entrepreneur with more than ten years of chief executive
experience in systems and software.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) on Wednesday said quarterly earnings more than doubled on higher sales of its prescription drugs and lower expenses, but its Chantix quit-smoking drug lost more than a third of its U.S. sales amid safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company, whose shares rose 2.7 percent, earned $2.78 billion, or 41 cents per share, in the second quarter. That compared with $1.27 billion, or 18 cents per share, a year earlier, when Pfizer took large charges for restructuring and merger-related costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 55 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 54 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company revenue rose 9 percent to $12.13 billion, but would have increased only 2 percent if not for the weak dollar, which boosts the value of overseas sales when converted back into U.S. currency. Reuters Estimates had expected revenue of $11.47 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest drugmaker reaffirmed it expects earnings this year to grow as much as 11 percent, due largely to a cost-cutting program that has cut 25,000 jobs, or 23 percent of the company's work force, since late 2004. It said the company is on track to reduce costs by the end of the year at least $1.5 billion to $2 billion, compared with 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer beat on the bottom line obviously and beat on the top line" during the quarter, said Deutsche Bank analyst Barbara Ryan. "Their guidance clearly is being reiterated so everything is on track," she said, attributing the good quarterly results largely to benefits of its cost-cutting program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has vowed to protect its industry-topping dividend, whose $8 billion-a-year cost to Pfizer is roughly equivalent to the company's annual net income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the generous dividend keeps many investors faithful to Pfizer, company shares have lost more than a fourth of their value in the past year, compared with about a 13 percent decline for the American Stock Exchange Pharmaceutical Index .DRG of large U.S. and European drugmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's shares are now trading at 11-year lows, sapped by the company's failure to come up with enough big new medicines to replace those facing generic competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's U.S. sales fell 2 percent in the quarter, hurt by waning demand for Chantix, a medicine approved in mid-2006 that Pfizer had been counting on to help drive earnings growth in coming years. But the company in January said the drug would begin carrying a warning that it may cause agitation, depression and suicidal behavior, raising doubts about its future growth prospects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global sales of Chantix, sold as Champix overseas, rose 3 percent to $207 million, but plunged 35 percent to $109 million in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second-quarter results were also hurt by U.S. loss of patent protection on allergy drug Zyrtec, which Pfizer no longer sells, and generic competition for cancer drug Camptosar, whose global sales fell 43 percent to $137 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many of Pfizer's biggest drugs fared well, helped by price increases earlier in the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global sales of cholesterol fighter Lipitor, the world's top-selling medicine, jumped 9 percent to $2.98 billion, given a boost by growing concerns about the value of Vytorin, a more potent rival drug sold by Merck  Co (MRK.N) and Schering-Plough Corp SGP.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyrica, used to treat nerve pain and recently also approved to treat fibromyalgia, soared 52 percent to $614 million. Sales of arthritis drug Celebrex rose 23 percent to $589 million, in a continuing rebound for the medicine following earlier sales declines linked to safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of anti-impotence treatment Viagra rose 21 percent to $463 million despite strong competition from Eli Lilly and Co's (LLY.N) longer-acting Cialis brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Pfizer rose to $18.85 in premarket trading, from their close of $18.35 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Bill Berkrot)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  MEXICO CITY, Jul 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. (BMV: KOFL) (NYSE: KOF) ("Coca-Cola
FEMSA" or the "Company"), the largest Coca-Cola bottler in Latin America
and the second-largest Coca-Cola bottler in the world in terms of sales
volume, announces results for the second quarter of
2008.


--  Total revenues reached Ps. 18,544 million in the second quarter of
    2008, an increase of 6.7% compared to the second quarter of 2007; excluding
    the positive effect of one month of Refrigerantes Minas Gerais ("Remil"),
    total revenues would have increased 4.6% compared to the second quarter of
    2007.
--  Driven by double digit operating income growth from our Latincentro
    and Mercosur divisions, combined with a cost and expense control across our
    territories, consolidated operating income increased 8.9% to Ps. 3,169
    million for the second quarter of 2008. Without giving effect to the
    acquisition of Remil, operating income would have increased 7.9% to Ps.

    quarter of 2008.
--  Consolidated majority net income increased 3.9% to Ps. 1,844 million
    in the second quarter of 2008, resulting in earnings per share of Ps. 1.00
    in the second quarter of 2008. Excluding non-recurring expenses recorded in
    our Mexico division during the quarter, consolidated majority net income
    grew 10.8%.
    

    
"Supported by our execution across our territories and our ability to
keep costs under control, we were able to increase operating income for
the second quarter, despite one-time events such as unusually bad weather
in Mexico in June and operating disruptions in Venezuela. Also, during the
second quarter of 2008, we have closed the acquisition of The Coca-Cola
Company's Refrigerantes Minas Gerais Ltda. ("Remil") franchise territory.
This transaction will enable us to increase the number of clients and
customers that we serve in Brazil through a complete and balanced
portfolio of high-quality beverages. Through our joint venture, with The
Coca-Cola Company, we continued to distribute Jugos del Valle beverages
in Mexico as planned, and also began to distribute these products in
Costa Rica," said Carlos Salazar Lomelin, Chief Executive Officer of the
company.

&lt;p&gt;StoredIQ Announces Support for Microsoft(R) Exchange(R) 2007 and Microsoft(R) SharePoint(R) 2007 as Recognized Data Sources

       Enhancement Adds to Comprehensive Reactive and Proactive
                         eDiscovery Solutions
AUSTIN, Texas--(Business Wire)--
StoredIQ, a leading provider of enterprise-class Intelligent
Information Management solutions, today announced support of Microsoft
Exchange 2007 and Microsoft SharePoint 2007. With this enhancement,
StoredIQ provides the industry's most comprehensive solutions for
litigation, governance, compliance and risk management across the
broadest set of disparate systems.

   "Microsoft Exchange 2007 and Microsoft SharePoint Server 2007 are
expected to see significant adoption in 2008," said Vivian Tero,
Program Manager, Compliance Infrastructure for IDC. "Solutions like
StoredIQ that index, enable topology mapping, search, and retrieve
information across multiple versions of MS Exchange and MS SharePoint,
as well as move or copy content to and from MS SharePoint are well
suited for corporations that increasingly face the challenge of
managing information in multi-version application environments."

   In addition to StoredIQ's existing ability to search and retrieve
email messages managed within prior versions of Microsoft Exchange,
StoredIQ now provides the same support for Microsoft Exchange 2007.
Unlike competing solutions, StoredIQ can manage all mail items stored
within Exchange 2007 including calendar items, notes, tasks and
contacts. StoredIQ is able to index both private and public mailboxes
and can do so on a per mailbox or per server level.

   With StoredIQ, companies can index, search, move or copy content
to and from SharePoint 2007 servers. From a records management
perspective, StoredIQ can discover electronically stored information
(ESI) located on servers, storage systems or personal workstations,
classify unmanaged ESI and insert those items as records into
SharePoint 2007. StoredIQ can also collect and preserve important
metadata attributes from ESI residing within SharePoint 2007, adding
value to search queries and eDiscovery efforts.

   StoredIQ provides a comprehensive eDiscovery solution for
companies that need to immediately react to or proactively prepare for
litigation or government investigations. Companies can quickly and
easily deploy the appliance in-house to crawl and collect active data
on their network servers, storage systems and personal computers
without disrupting end users. Using StoredIQ technology for topology
mapping, classification and search, companies can rapidly target,
collect, preserve and process potentially relevant documents, reducing
legal risk while saving collection, preservation and processing
expense. In addition, StoredIQ's legally defensible auditing system
ensures policies and processes have been followed, and they can be
easily searched and exported for outside legal review.

   About StoredIQ

   StoredIQ is a leading provider of enterprise-class Intelligent
Information Management solutions, enabling organizations to gain
visibility and control over business-critical information to help meet
their compliance, governance and legal discovery requirements. The

&lt;p&gt;New Image Cash Letter Processing Centers Bring Total JPMorgan Centers Outside
   U.S. to 14; Allows Financial Institution Clients to Clear U.S. Dollar Cash
                    Letters, Lower Check Transportation Costs
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


JPMorgan, a full-service provider of cash management, trade finance, and
treasury solutions, today announced the opening of two new International Image
Deposit Centers in Taipei and Bangkok, bringing the total number of image
centers to 14. The new centers will extend JPMorgan's ability to allow its
financial institution clients to clear their U.S. dollar cash letters and lower
check transportation costs, all without changing their cash letter operations.

The Taipei and Bangkok International Image Deposit Centers join 12 other
JPMorgan Centers outside the United States that allow financial institutions to
initiate their cash letter processing. JPMorgan unveiled its inaugural
International Image Deposit Center in Frankfurt, Germany, in October 2005. The
firm has continued to establish imaging centers to make the processing of image
cash letters easier and more efficient for clients. Two more centers are
scheduled to open later this year in Pakistan and Jakarta. The firm continues to
explore other markets to establish image deposit centers as part of its goal to
grow its global offerings to clients.

JPMorgan was the first global treasury management services provider to establish
image deposit centers in local markets around the world. The Taipei and Bangkok
locations join centers located in Bournemouth, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Madrid,
Milan, Mumbai, Paris, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Tokyo and Zurich.

"With the opening of these two new image deposit centers, JPMorgan is extending
the delivery of our clearing services to more local markets, making it easier
and more convenient for clients doing business around the world to clear their
U.S. dollar check items," explained Linda McLaughlin-Moore, regional product
manager, JPMorgan Treasury Services. "As a leader in image processing solutions,
JPMorgan continues to make good on its commitment to bring the products and
services that help our clients succeed in today's increasingly competitive
global marketplace."

The Taipei and Bangkok centers will further extend the ability for financial
institutions in Asia to streamline their check clearing processes, alleviating
worries over weather delays or loss due to customs inspections.

In addition to the International Image Deposit Centers, JPMorgan offers a suite
of cash letter and check collection products to process international payments:

    --  International Cash Letter clears and settles U.S. dollar check deposits,
        providing tracking features and SWIFT messaging regarding funds
        availability

    --  Secure Collections Service offers package tracking and fraud review
        processes for secure check collections, crediting clients' accounts on
        the scheduled settlement date; guarantees against fraud on the front of
        checks

    --  Multi-Currency Cash Letter clears and settles checks drawn on
        international banks, posting within 24 hours of the receipt of payment
        and providing notification via SWIFT, fax or email

&lt;p&gt; (Changes source, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 23 (Reuters) - JP Morgan said it downgraded
construction and mining equipment company Caterpillar Inc
(CAT.N) to "neutral" from "overweight" and removed its $94
price target on the stock, due to mounting risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said while recent pricing actions represent a
tailwind in 2009, it believes volumes may slow further in North
America and Europe, making the risk/reward less compelling at
this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock has held up well in the current environment but
its rationale for an "overweight" rating based on lower
interest rates and a North America recovery in the first half
of 2009 is now less compelling, JP Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caterpillar shares closed at $74.98 Tuesday on New York
Stock Exchange.

"underweight" from "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Jonathan Chappell added Nordic American Tanker
Shipping to his U.S. Analyst Focus List with a January 2009
price target of $45, as he expects the company's heavy
spot-market exposure and large dividend increases to serve as
positive catalysts for the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frontline's high operating leverage and its full-payout
dividend policy should drive earnings and dividend momentum for
the rest of the year, Chappell said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI, July 23 (Reuters) - India's main Hindu-nationalist opposition said on Wednesday it would stage street protests against an immoral victory of the ruling coalition in a confidence vote marred by charges of bribery. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said it has also expelled eight lawmakers who voted for the government or abstained during the key vote. I must admit it has saddened me and outraged the party, said Lal Krishna Advani, the BJP chief, referring to the eight lawmakers. While four lawmakers cross-voted in parliament, the rest were absent without any definite reason during the confidence vote. We will see that they are also disqualified in parliament, Advani told a news conference. Tuesday's vote of confidence which the Indian government won was tainted by a bribery scandal, after opposition lawmakers interrupted a debate to wave wads of cash to protest against what they said were bribes offered by the government to abstain. The whole thing is so scandalous, it reeks of muck, Advani said. From Thursday, hundreds of BJP workers will organise rallies and demonstrate in the streets to protest what they called was a cash-for-vote scandal. Cadres of the BJP would also undertake tours around the country to mobilise public opinion against the government, Advani added.

profitability are sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We think the market is unjustly punishing AK Steel... on
concerns of a global slowdown and bursting of record-high
commodity prices," the brokerage said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AK Steel would benefit from multiple expansion as the
market digests the sustainability of steel prices and
profitability, or as mergers and acquisitions, especially from
foreign buyers, forces a re-rating, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan said the company's electrical business,
restructuring efforts, increasing spot business and variable
pricing will help it largely offset rising material costs in
its carbon steel business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage raised its 2008 earnings estimates on the

&lt;p&gt;  IRVINE, CA, Jul 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Vision Solutions, the leading high availability and disaster recovery
solutions provider for IBM Power Systems markets, today announced an
important milestone in its global market roll-out of EchoCluster for AIX
by passing compatibility testing with IBM's BladeCenter JS21 Express and
SAN hardware. The validation benchmark was conducted on hardware at IBM's
Shenzhen Power Systems testing facility in China by team members from
both IBM and Vision's AIX development laboratory near Boston.

    "We're pleased to see Vision continually supporting the rapidly growing
mid-market of IBM Power Systems with this latest certification on JS21
Blade Servers," says Liu Hong Bin, manager of Systems &amp; Technology Group
channel enablement, IBM China. "Given the demand, this new combination is
likely to do very well."

    Vision Solutions' EchoCluster keeps AIX applications up and running
through continuous server monitoring and immediate, automated failover to
a secondary server, ensuring IBM customers keep critical applications
highly available on local or remote servers. In support of Vision's goal
to offer affordable and innovative disaster recovery solutions for the
SMB marketplace, EchoCluster can be used in conjunction with EchoStream
for data replication with any-point-in-time Continuous Data Protection
(CDP). This combination is an excellent choice for heterogeneous storage
environments resulting from mergers and acquisitions, offering full ROI
on all current hardware.

    "We continue to build upon our excellent working relationship with IBM's
Shenzhen test-center team. This recent milestone validates our EchoCluster
and EchoStream solutions are compatible with IBM's BladeCenter and DS3400
storage environments," says Henry Martinez, senior vice president of
engineering for Vision. "Our collaboration allows us to reduce time to
market while increasing product quality, which fills an emerging market
need of solid performance, low-complexity and price-point compatibility on
IBM's Power blades."

    With affordable pricing, ease-of-use functionality and an installation
typically measured in days, EchoCluster and EchoStream provide workable
solutions for companies of all sizes.

    "Enjoying the safety of nonstop, automated protection of the bank's data
in a highly sensitive production environment saves time, money and labor
and creates ever more trust and confidence for our customers," says
Deputy IT Director for the Russia's Raiffeisenbank and current client,
Alexander Makarov.

    Passing the prestigious benchmark further extends Vision Solutions' value
proposition for mid-market customers by supporting EchoCluster and
EchoStream on new IBM platforms such as the BladeCenter, including options
for consolidating and sharing data on compatible platforms such as the IBM
DS3400.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 23 (Reuters) - JP Morgan downgraded digital media
software company Sonic Solutions Inc SNIC.O to "neutral" from
"overweight", citing slowing consumer spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said retail check suggests sales of Roxio
products, under which the company sells photo, video, music,
and digital-media management applications, could fall short of
prior expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage believes a recovery in OEM revenue is likely
to be muted by cyclical tradedowns and head-on competition from
Adobe Systems Inc (ADBE.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer), when used to
describe software, is a version of the software bundled with
other hardware or software rather than the same software
package sold on its own as a retail package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Sonic closed at $6.84 Tuesday on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) on Wednesday said quarterly earnings more than doubled on higher sales of its prescription drugs and lower expenses, but its Chantix quit-smoking drug lost more than a third of its U.S. sales amid safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company earned $2.78 billion, or 41 cents per share, in the second quarter. That compared with $1.27 billion, or 18 cents per share, a year earlier, when Pfizer took large charges for restructuring and merger-related costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 55 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 54 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company revenue rose 9 percent to $12.13 billion, but would have increased only 2 percent if not for the weak dollar, which boosts the value of overseas sales when converted back into U.S. currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's U.S. sales fell 2 percent, hurt by waning demand for Chantix, a new medicine that Pfizer has been counting on to drive earnings growth in coming years, and loss of patent protection on allergy drug Zyrtec and cancer drug Camptosar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest drugmaker reaffirmed it expects earnings this year to grow as much as 11 percent, due largely to a cost-cutting program that has cut 25,000 jobs, or 23 percent of the company's work force, since late 2004. It said the company is on track to reduce costs by the end of the year at least $1.5 billion to $2 billion, compared with 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  SAN DIEGO, CA, Jul 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Verimatrix, setting the standard in content security technologies that

one Verimatrix Video Content Authority System (VCAS(TM)) technology core.

    All of the company's Series B investors, Crescendo Investments, Cipio

enable competitive service offerings in a multi-screen world."

addition of four new and enhanced products, doubling its customer base to
more than 150 IPTV customers in 32 countries and by surpassing the 5
million screens secured mark. Central to its 3-Dimensional Content
Security vision, Verimatrix's technology roadmap extends beyond encryption
technologies to the opportunities and applications that new pay-TV
networks must offer. Its suite of VCAS solutions offers a layered content
security system that enables transparent delivery of content to multiple

    "We have certainly succeeded in securing two-way, IP-based networks with

partners, we need to extend our security envelope to include more
traditional pay-TV markets," said Tom Munro, CEO, Verimatrix. "The
excellent support of our investors enables us to accelerate the
development of next generation content security solutions built on our
VCAS technology foundation.

    Munro added, "With the completion of this Series C investment, our
business plan is fully funded, and we are able to quickly scale our
operations. As the majority of our business comes through our industry
leading channel partners, OEMs and integrators, we will make ongoing
investments in interoperability, testing, and monitoring platforms to
support their rapid growth and increasingly complex system architectures."

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission will propose forcing U.S. diplomats to apply for visas to travel to the European Union from January 1, 2009 unless Washington moves towards granting citizens of all EU states visa-free entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"No tangible progress has been made regarding the United States despite all efforts of the Commission and individual member states," the EU executive said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Citizens of 12 EU member states continue to require a visa when traveling to the United States," a statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Therefore, the Commission will propose retaliatory measures e.g. temporary restoration of the visa requirement for U.S. nationals holding diplomatic and service/official passports as from January 1, 2009 if no progress is achieved."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most older EU states belong to the U.S. visa waiver program, which allows their citizens to travel without visas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this does not apply to 11 of the 12 mostly ex-communist countries that joined the 27-member bloc in 2004 and 2007, or older member Greece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visas are a sensitive issue in EU-U.S. relations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington's refusal to extend its visa waiver systematically to all EU newcomers causes resentment in countries that are among the most loyal U.S. allies -- some with troops fighting under American command in Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decision by the Bush administration earlier this year to sign separate visa deals with several ex-communist central European countries -- instead of with the EU as a whole -- sparked tensions within the bloc and across the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States has said it plans to allow some new EU states in its visa free program this year. The EU executive says its January 1 threat is meant to put pressure on the United States to deliver on this announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is unacceptable that nationals from some third countries can benefit from visa free travel to the EU whilst some of our fellow EU citizens can't travel visa-free to those countries," EU Justice and Security Commissioner Jacques Barrot said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington says it can only allow countries in its visa-free program according to specific security and migration requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ingrid Melander; Editing by Paul Taylor)&lt;/p&gt;

Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) today reported financial results for the second-quarter
2008. The Company recorded revenues of $12.1 billion, an increase of 9% compared
with $11.1 billion in the year-ago quarter. In the U.S., revenues were $4.8
billion, a decrease of 2%, while international revenues were $7.4 billion, an
increase of 18%. Revenues reflect the positive impact of foreign exchange, which
increased revenues by approximately $800 million or 7%, as well as the solid
performance of many key products. These factors more than offset the revenue
declines due to the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Zyrtec, which Pfizer ceased
selling in late January 2008, and for Camptosar in February 2008. Zyrtec and
Camptosar second-quarter 2008 revenues decreased by $377 million and $104
million, respectively, compared with the year-ago quarter.

For the second-quarter 2008, Pfizer posted reported net income of $2.8 billion,
an increase of 119% compared with $1.3 billion in the prior-year quarter, and
reported diluted EPS of $0.41, an increase of 128% compared with $0.18 in the
prior-year quarter. These increases were primarily attributable to lower
restructuring charges from cost-reduction initiatives, as well as savings
generated by those initiatives, the positive impact of foreign exchange and
favorable income tax adjustments; these positive factors were partially offset
by increased in-process research and development expenses associated with the
acquisitions of Serenex, Inc. and Encysive Pharmaceuticals Inc., which closed in
the second-quarter 2008.

For the first-half 2008, Pfizer recorded revenues of $24.0 billion, an increase
of 2% compared with $23.6 billion in the same period in 2007, despite the loss
of U.S. exclusivity of Norvasc (March 2007), Zyrtec (January 2008) and Camptosar
(February 2008), which collectively decreased revenues by $1.4 billion during
the first-half 2008. The 2% increase reflects the favorable impact of foreign
exchange, which increased revenues by approximately $1.4 billion or 6%, in
addition to the solid performance of many key products. In the U.S., revenues
were $10.3 billion, a decrease of 12%, while international revenues were $13.7
billion, an increase of 15%.

For the first-half 2008, the Company posted reported net income of $5.6 billion,
an increase of 19% compared with $4.7 billion in the prior-year period, and
reported diluted EPS of $0.82, an increase of 24% compared with $0.66 in the
prior-year period. These increases were primarily attributable to the favorable
impact of foreign exchange and lower restructuring charges associated with
cost-reduction initiatives, mainly employee-related costs, as well as the
savings generated by those initiatives.

Adjusted Income(1) and Adjusted Diluted EPS(1) Results

For the second-quarter 2008, Pfizer posted adjusted income(1) of $3.7 billion,
an increase of 26% compared with $2.9 billion in the year-ago quarter, and
adjusted diluted EPS(1) of $0.55, an increase of 31% compared with $0.42 in the
year-ago quarter. For the first-half 2008, Pfizer posted adjusted income(1) of
$7.8 billion, an increase of 1% compared with $7.7 billion in the first-half
2007, and adjusted diluted EPS(1) of $1.15, an increase of 5% compared with
$1.10 in the first-half 2007. In both periods, adjusted income(1) and adjusted
diluted EPS(1) reflect the positive impact of foreign exchange, the
non-recurrence of the one-time 2007 payment to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company in
connection with our collaboration to develop and commercialize apixaban,
favorable income tax adjustments as well as the savings associated with
cost-reduction initiatives.

Reported and adjusted diluted EPS(1) were also positively impacted by the full
benefit of Pfizer's purchase of $10.0 billion of the Company's common stock in
2007.

Executive Commentary

"We are pleased with the financial results we delivered this quarter, which were
driven in part by the solid performance in our Pharmaceutical and Animal Health
businesses," stated Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Kindler. "Many of
our key products continued to perform well both in the U.S. and international
markets, including Lyrica, Celebrex, Viagra and Geodon, as well as Lipitor in
the face of a highly competitive statin market. The benefit of our broad-based
portfolio of products, our geographic reach and our diverse strategies for
growth was evident in this quarter's financial results, which clearly
demonstrate our ability to continue to deliver solid performance in an
increasingly challenging environment."

"During the quarter, we entered into an important agreement with Ranbaxy
Laboratories Ltd. that provided substantial certainty to patients and our
shareholders regarding the availability of a generic version of Lipitor in the
U.S. after November 30, 2011. We are pleased with the resolution of this issue
with Ranbaxy, as it reaffirms the value and importance of intellectual property
for Pfizer and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole," continued Kindler.

Frank D'Amelio, Chief Financial Officer, commented, "Based on our year-to-date
performance and outlook for the remainder of 2008, we are reaffirming our
full-year 2008 revenue and adjusted diluted EPS(1) guidance as well as our plan
to reduce absolute adjusted total costs(2) by at least $1.5 to $2.0 billion at
the end of 2008 compared with 2006 on a constant currency basis(3). We expect
the remainder of this reduction to gain momentum throughout the second half of
the year, with much of the remaining savings to be realized in the fourth
quarter."

"Given the continued strength of our balance sheet and significant operating
cash flow, we remain confident that we have the financial wherewithal to
successfully execute our strategies and continue to meet our financial
objectives," D'Amelio continued. "During the second quarter, we repurchased
approximately $500 million, or 26.4 million shares, of our common stock."

Pharmaceutical

Pharmaceutical revenues for the second-quarter 2008 were $11.1 billion, an
increase of 9% compared with the prior-year quarter, including the favorable
impact of foreign exchange, which increased revenues by approximately $730
million or 7%. Second-quarter 2008 revenues from in-line and new products(6)
increased 16% compared with the year-ago quarter; this excludes the impact of
the loss of U.S. exclusivity of Norvasc, Zyrtec and Camptosar, which
collectively resulted in a revenue decline of $496 million or 39% compared with
the year-ago quarter.

Lipitor revenues in the second-quarter 2008 were $3.0 billion, an increase of 9%
compared with the prior-year quarter, reflecting the favorable impact of foreign
exchange, which increased revenues by approximately $170 million or 6%. In the
U.S., Lipitor revenues increased 1% compared with the prior-year quarter, while
revenues from international markets rose 18%, due to the favorable impact of
foreign exchange of 13% and operational growth of 5%. The global statin market
continues to be highly competitive, with both branded and generic competition in
an increasingly cost-sensitive environment. Pfizer continues to respond to these
market dynamics with an integrated, multi-channel effort, emphasizing Lipitor's
strong clinical profile demonstrated in over 400 completed or ongoing clinical
trials including more than 80,000 patients and in more than 151 million patient
years of experience over 15 years.

Lyrica revenues in the second-quarter 2008 were $614 million, an increase of 52%
compared with the prior-year quarter, driven by strong efficacy and high patient
and physician satisfaction in managing nerve pain associated with diabetes and
nerve pain after shingles, the June 2007 U.S. approval for the management of
fibromyalgia, a branded and unbranded advertising strategy focused on increasing
both Lyrica and fibromyalgia awareness as well as the favorable impact of
foreign exchange. In the U.S., Lyrica revenues rose to $335 million, an increase
of 55% compared to the prior-year quarter, while international revenues grew to
$279 million, an increase of 48%.

Celebrex revenues in the second-quarter 2008 were $589 million, an increase of
23% compared with the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by the continued
educational and promotional efforts supporting the risk-benefit proposition of
this medicine, as well as the favorable impact of foreign exchange. In the U.S.,
Celebrex revenues rose to $416 million, an increase of 22% compared with the
prior-year quarter, while international revenues grew to $173 million, an
increase of 27%.

Sutent revenues in the second-quarter 2008 continued to demonstrate strong
performance and market leadership in its approved indications, advanced renal
cell carcinoma (RCC) and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), with revenues of
$211 million, an increase of 45% compared with the year-ago quarter. In the
U.S., Sutent revenues were $60 million, a decrease of 2% compared with the
prior-year quarter, while international revenues grew to $151 million, an
increase of 80%. To date, Sutent has launched in 61 countries, with four in the
second-quarter 2008 including Japan, China and Russia, and six planned in the
next 12 months. As part of Pfizer's robust life cycle plan, clinical trials
continue for potential additional indications where Sutent shows promise and
where there is a need for additional treatments, most notably breast, colorectal
and lung cancers.

Chantix (known as Champix outside the U.S.) revenues in the second-quarter 2008
were $207 million, an increase of 3% compared with the second-quarter 2007. In
the U.S., Chantix revenues declined to $109 million, a decrease of 35% compared
with the prior-year quarter, while international revenues grew to $98 million,
an increase of 197%. U.S. results were negatively impacted by the recent updates
to the Chantix U.S. label to include additional safety information, as well as
certain external events relating to Chantix. Pfizer continues its educational
and promotional efforts focused on the Chantix risk-benefit proposition, the
significant health consequences of smoking and the importance of the
physician-patient dialogue to help patients effectively use Chantix to reach
their health goal of becoming smoke free. Since its approval in the U.S. in May
2006, Chantix/Champix has been approved in 76 countries and has been used by
more than six million patients, an increasing number of whom are covered by
third-party payers. In the second-quarter 2008, Champix launched in Japan, which
has more than 30 million smokers, as well as Malaysia and Singapore, with nine
launches planned in the next 12 months, including Russia, Turkey and China.

Animal Health

Animal Health revenues for the second-quarter 2008 were $715 million, an
increase of 13% compared with $632 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase
was driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange, which increased revenues
by approximately $50 million or 8%, in addition to strong global livestock and
companion animal product performance.

Costs and Expenses

In the second-quarter 2008, adjusted cost of sales(1) as a percentage of
revenues was 16.9% compared with 17.0% in the second-quarter 2007. This reflects
the impact of foreign exchange on cost of sales in addition to unfavorable
changes in geographic mix, which were slightly more than offset by the favorable
effect of our cost-reduction initiatives.

Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI) expenses(1) were $3.7
billion in the second-quarter 2008, a decrease of 1% compared with the
prior-year quarter. The favorable impact of our cost-reduction initiatives was
partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on expenses
compared with the year-ago period.

Adjusted research and development (R) expenses(1) were $1.9 billion in the
second-quarter 2008, a decrease of 8% compared with the year-ago quarter, due
primarily to the non-recurrence of the one-time 2007 payment to Bristol-Myers
Squibb Company in connection with our collaboration to develop and commercialize
apixaban in addition to the realization of savings associated with our
cost-reduction initiatives.

Overall, foreign exchange increased adjusted total costs(2) by approximately
$440 million or 6% in the second-quarter 2008 compared with the prior-year
period. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, our adjusted total costs(2)
decreased by $475 million or 6% compared with the year-ago quarter. The
operational improvement was driven primarily by the reduction in overall
workforce level to 84,500 at the end of second-quarter 2008, a reduction of
13,500 over the past 18 months. Manufacturing and research and development site
exits have also contributed to the operational improvement.

Pfizer continues to make progress on its target to reduce absolute adjusted
total costs(2) by at least $1.5 to $2.0 billion at the end of 2008 compared with
2006 on a constant currency basis(3). These initiatives span essentially all
divisions, functions, markets and sites. As of the end of second-quarter 2008,
Pfizer had achieved $1.2 billion of the target. The Company expects to achieve
much of the remaining reduction in the fourth-quarter 2008, which will favorably
impact fourth-quarter earnings.

Financial Guidance

For the full-year 2008, Pfizer's financial guidance, at current exchange
rates(9) is summarized below. The guidance on adjusted cost of sales(1) as a
percentage of revenue has been tightened to 15.0% - 15.5% from 14.5% - 15.5%.
Additionally, guidance on the range for the effective tax rate on adjusted
income(1) has been reduced to 21.5% - 22.0% from 22.0% - 22.5%.

For additional details, please see the attached financial schedules, product
revenue tables, supplemental information and disclosure notice.

(1) "Adjusted income" and its components and "adjusted diluted earnings per
share (EPS)" are defined as reported net income and its components and reported
diluted EPS excluding purchase-accounting adjustments, acquisition-related
costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items. Adjusted Cost of
Sales, Adjusted SI expenses and Adjusted R expenses are income statement
line items prepared on the same basis, and therefore, components of the overall
Adjusted Income measure. As described under Adjusted Income in the Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section
of Pfizer's Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2008, management
uses adjusted income, among other factors, to set performance goals and to
measure the performance of the overall company. We believe that investors'
understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure.
Reconciliations of second-quarter 2008 and 2007, first-half 2008 and 2007, and
full-year 2007 adjusted income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS to
reported net income and its components and reported diluted EPS, as well as
reconciliations of full-year 2008 adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS
guidance to full-year 2008 reported net income and reported diluted EPS
guidance, are provided in the materials accompanying this report. The adjusted
income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS measures are not, and should
not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and diluted EPS.

(2) Represents primarily the total of Adjusted Cost of Sales(1), Adjusted SI
expenses(1) and Adjusted R expenses(1).

(3) Constant currency basis means that the applicable projected financial
measure is based upon the actual foreign exchange rates in effect during 2006.

(4) Represents worldwide revenues for all pharmaceutical products, excluding
revenues included in notes (5) and (7).

(5) Represents worldwide revenues for pharmaceutical products launched since
2006: Chantix/Champix, Eraxis, Selzentry/Celsentri, Sutent and Thelin.

(6) Total worldwide pharmaceutical revenues excluding the revenues of major
products that have lost exclusivity in the U.S. in 2007 and 2008 as described in
note (7). See the table accompanying this report.

(7) Represents worldwide revenues for pharmaceutical products that lost
exclusivity in the U.S. in 2007 and 2008: Camptosar, Norvasc and Zyrtec.

(8) Includes Consumer Healthcare business transition activity, Capsugel and
Pfizer Centersource.

(9) Current exchange rates approximate rates at the time of the second-quarter
earnings press release (July 2008).

(10) Excludes the charges associated with business development transactions not
completed as of June 29, 2008.

 (1) Total in-line and new products Pharmaceutical revenues, which
  exclude the revenues of major products that have lost exclusivity in
  the U.S. since the beginning of 2007, is an alternative view of our
  Pharmaceutical revenues, and we believe that investors'
  understanding of Pharmaceutical revenues is enhanced by disclosing
  this performance measure. Norvasc lost its U.S. exclusivity in March
  2007 and Camptosar lost its U.S. exclusivity in February 2008, and
  as is typical in the pharmaceutical industry, this has resulted in a
  dramatic decline in revenues due to generic competition.
  Zyrtec/Zyrtec D lost its U.S. exclusivity in January 2008 and we
  ceased marketing the product in late January 2008. We believe that
  excluding the impact of these products assists the reader in
  understanding the underlying strength of the balance of our diverse
  Pharmaceutical product portfolio in 2008. Because of its non-
  standardized definition, this total in-line and new products
  Pharmaceutical revenues measure has limitations as it may not be
  comparable with the calculation of similar measures of other
  companies. This additional revenue measure is not, and should not be
  viewed as, a substitute for the U.S. GAAP comparison of
  Pharmaceutical revenues.

 (2) Total in-line and new products Pharmaceutical international
  revenues reflect a favorable impact in the second quarter and first
  six months of 2008 due primarily to changes in foreign exchange

                        SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
*T

1) Impact of Foreign Exchange on Revenues

The weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, primarily the
euro, Japanese yen and Canadian dollar, favorably impacted our revenues by
approximately $800 million, or 7%, in second-quarter 2008, compared to the same
period in 2007, and by approximately $1.4 billion, or 6%, in the first six
months of 2008, compared to the same period in 2007.

2) Change in Cost of Sales

Reported cost of sales increased 9% in second-quarter 2008, compared to the same
period in 2007. The increase primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of
foreign exchange and higher implementation costs associated with our
cost-reduction initiatives, partially offset by the savings impact of our
cost-reduction initiatives.

Reported cost of sales included implementation charges related to our
cost-reduction initiatives of $210 million for the second quarter of 2008, $348
million for the six months ended June 29, 2008, $170 million for the second
quarter of 2007, and $264 million for the six months ended July 1, 2007.

Reported cost of sales also included $45 million for the second quarter of 2008,
$93 million for the six months ended June 29, 2008, $45 million for the second
quarter of 2007, and $80 million for the six months ended July 1, 2007, related
to business-transition activities associated with the sale of our Consumer
Healthcare business, completed in December 2006. This continuing activity is
transitional in nature and generally results from agreements that seek to
facilitate the orderly transfer of operations of our former Consumer Healthcare
business to the new owner.

Reported cost of sales as a percentage of revenues of 18.9% in second-quarter
2008 was comparable to second-quarter 2007, reflecting the favorable impact of
our cost-reduction initiatives, offset by higher 2008 implementation costs
associated with our cost-reduction initiatives and the impact of foreign
exchange.

3) Change in Selling, Informational &amp; Administrative (SI) Expenses and
Research &amp; Development (R) Expenses

Reported SI expenses in second-quarter 2008 increased 1%, and in the six
months ended June 29, 2008, increased 2%, compared to the same periods in 2007,
reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, as well as the impact of
higher 2008 implementation costs associated with our cost-reduction initiatives,
partially offset by savings associated with our cost-reduction initiatives.

Reported SI expenses included implementation charges related to our
cost-reduction initiatives of $100 million for second-quarter 2008, $175 million
for the six months ended June 29, 2008, $79 million for second-quarter 2007, and
$128 million for the six months ended July 1, 2007.

Reported R expenses, excluding acquisition-related in-process research and
development charges (IPR), decreased 9% in second-quarter 2008, and decreased
2% in the six months ended June 29, 2008, compared to the same periods in 2007.
The decreases are primarily due to the non-recurrence of the one-time 2007
payment to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company in connection with our collaboration to
develop and commercialize apixaban, in addition to the realization of savings
associated with our cost-reduction initiatives, partially offset by higher R
spending related to our new collaboration agreements, as well as the unfavorable
impact of foreign exchange.

Reported R expenses included implementation charges related to our
cost-reduction initiatives of $94 million for second-quarter 2008, $240 million
for the six months ended June 29, 2008, $131 million for second-quarter 2007,
and $162 million for the six months ended July 1, 2007.

IPR charges in second-quarter 2008 of $156 million primarily related to our
acquisitions of Serenex, Inc. and Encysive Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and in
first-quarter 2008, $398 million primarily related to the acquisitions of CovX,
Coley Pharmaceutical Group, Inc. and two smaller acquisitions related to Animal
Health. IPR charges in the first quarter 2007 of $283 million primarily
related to our acquisitions of BioRexis Pharmaceutical Corp. and Embrex, Inc.

*Certain prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the current period
presentation.

(a) The decrease in net interest income in second-quarter and first six months
of 2008, compared to the same periods in 2007, was due primarily to lower net
financial assets and lower interest rates.

5) Effective Tax Rate

The effective tax rate on reported Income from continuing operations before
provision for taxes on income and minority interests for second-quarter 2008 was
0.9% compared to 16.8% in second-quarter 2007, and in the first six months of
2008 was 12.4% compared to 16.9% in the first six months of 2007, reflecting tax
benefits in the second quarter of 2008 of $305 million related to favorable tax
settlements for multiple tax years and $426 million related to the sale of one
of our biopharmaceutical companies (Esperion Therapeutic Inc.).

The effective tax rate on adjusted income(1) was 20.0% in second-quarter 2008,
21.0% in the first six months of 2008, 22.2% in second-quarter 2007, and 21.9%
in the first six months of 2007. The lower rates on adjusted income(1) in 2008
reflect the $305 million in tax benefits related to the resolution of tax issues
noted above.

*T

(a) Guidance in the table above excludes the effects of business development
transactions not completed as of June 29, 2008.

While certain components of our 2008 reported guidance for net income and
diluted EPS have been revised, the reported net income and diluted EPS
expectation of $11.7 billion - $12.8 billion and $1.73 - $1.88 remains
unchanged.

Our guidance excludes the impact of pending or prospective business development
activity. During the second quarter of 2008, the net income and diluted EPS
impact associated with 2008 completed business development transactions
increased from $0.3 billion and $0.05 to $0.5 billion and $0.08, due to the
recognition of IPR associated with our acquisitions of Serenex, Inc. and
Encysive Pharmaceuticals Inc. in the second quarter of 2008. During the second
quarter of 2008, the net income and diluted EPS effects of our cost-reduction
initiatives have been revised from $1.4 billion - $1.7 billion and $0.21 - $0.26
to $1.6 billion - $1.9 billion and $0.24 - $0.29. The increase is principally
driven by costs associated with site closures that were previously forecast to
be recorded in 2009 that are now forecast to be incurred in 2008. These items
are offset by tax benefits related to the sale of Esperion in the second quarter
of 2008, which favorably impact net income and diluted EPS by $0.4 billion and
$0.06.

(1) "Adjusted income" and "adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS)" are
defined as reported net income and reported diluted EPS excluding
purchase-accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, discontinued
operations and certain significant items. As described under Adjusted Income in
the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations section of Pfizer's Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March
30, 2008, management uses adjusted income, among other factors, to set
performance goals and to measure the performance of the overall company. We
believe that investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by
disclosing this measure. The adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS measures
are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and
diluted EPS.

DISCLOSURE NOTICE: The information contained in this earnings release and the
attachments is as of July 23, 2008. The Company assumes no obligation to update
any forward-looking statements contained in this earnings release or the

   Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) today reported financial results for the
second-quarter 2008. The Company recorded revenues of $12.1 billion,
an increase of 9% compared with $11.1 billion in the year-ago quarter.
In the U.S., revenues were $4.8 billion, a decrease of 2%, while
international revenues were $7.4 billion, an increase of 18%. Revenues
reflect the positive impact of foreign exchange, which increased
revenues by approximately $800 million or 7%, as well as the solid
performance of many key products. These factors more than offset the
revenue declines due to the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Zyrtec, which
Pfizer ceased selling in late January 2008, and for Camptosar in
February 2008. Zyrtec and Camptosar second-quarter 2008 revenues
decreased by $377 million and $104 million, respectively, compared
with the year-ago quarter.

   For the second-quarter 2008, Pfizer posted reported net income of
$2.8 billion, an increase of 119% compared with $1.3 billion in the
prior-year quarter, and reported diluted EPS of $0.41, an increase of
128% compared with $0.18 in the prior-year quarter. These increases
were primarily attributable to lower restructuring charges from
cost-reduction initiatives, as well as savings generated by those
initiatives, the positive impact of foreign exchange and favorable
income tax adjustments; these positive factors were partially offset
by increased in-process research and development expenses associated
with the acquisitions of Serenex, Inc. and Encysive Pharmaceuticals
Inc., which closed in the second-quarter 2008.

   For the first-half 2008, Pfizer recorded revenues of $24.0
billion, an increase of 2% compared with $23.6 billion in the same
period in 2007, despite the loss of U.S. exclusivity of Norvasc (March
2007), Zyrtec (January 2008) and Camptosar (February 2008), which
collectively decreased revenues by $1.4 billion during the first-half
2008. The 2% increase reflects the favorable impact of foreign
exchange, which increased revenues by approximately $1.4 billion or
6%, in addition to the solid performance of many key products. In the
U.S., revenues were $10.3 billion, a decrease of 12%, while
international revenues were $13.7 billion, an increase of 15%.

   For the first-half 2008, the Company posted reported net income of
$5.6 billion, an increase of 19% compared with $4.7 billion in the
prior-year period, and reported diluted EPS of $0.82, an increase of
24% compared with $0.66 in the prior-year period. These increases were
primarily attributable to the favorable impact of foreign exchange and
lower restructuring charges associated with cost-reduction
initiatives, mainly employee-related costs, as well as the savings
generated by those initiatives.

   Adjusted Income(1) and Adjusted Diluted EPS(1) Results

   For the second-quarter 2008, Pfizer posted adjusted income(1) of
$3.7 billion, an increase of 26% compared with $2.9 billion in the
year-ago quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS(1) of $0.55, an increase of
31% compared with $0.42 in the year-ago quarter. For the first-half
2008, Pfizer posted adjusted income(1) of $7.8 billion, an increase of
1% compared with $7.7 billion in the first-half 2007, and adjusted
diluted EPS(1) of $1.15, an increase of 5% compared with $1.10 in the
first-half 2007. In both periods, adjusted income(1) and adjusted
diluted EPS(1) reflect the positive impact of foreign exchange, the
non-recurrence of the one-time 2007 payment to Bristol-Myers Squibb
Company in connection with our collaboration to develop and
commercialize apixaban, favorable income tax adjustments as well as
the savings associated with cost-reduction initiatives.

   Reported and adjusted diluted EPS(1) were also positively impacted
by the full benefit of Pfizer's purchase of $10.0 billion of the
Company's common stock in 2007.

   Executive Commentary

   "We are pleased with the financial results we delivered this
quarter, which were driven in part by the solid performance in our
Pharmaceutical and Animal Health businesses," stated Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Jeff Kindler. "Many of our key products
continued to perform well both in the U.S. and international markets,
including Lyrica, Celebrex, Viagra and Geodon, as well as Lipitor in
the face of a highly competitive statin market. The benefit of our
broad-based portfolio of products, our geographic reach and our
diverse strategies for growth was evident in this quarter's financial
results, which clearly demonstrate our ability to continue to deliver
solid performance in an increasingly challenging environment."

   "During the quarter, we entered into an important agreement with
Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. that provided substantial certainty to
patients and our shareholders regarding the availability of a generic
version of Lipitor in the U.S. after November 30, 2011. We are pleased
with the resolution of this issue with Ranbaxy, as it reaffirms the
value and importance of intellectual property for Pfizer and the
pharmaceutical industry as a whole," continued Kindler.

   Frank D'Amelio, Chief Financial Officer, commented, "Based on our
year-to-date performance and outlook for the remainder of 2008, we are
reaffirming our full-year 2008 revenue and adjusted diluted EPS(1)
guidance as well as our plan to reduce absolute adjusted total
costs(2) by at least $1.5 to $2.0 billion at the end of 2008 compared
with 2006 on a constant currency basis(3). We expect the remainder of
this reduction to gain momentum throughout the second half of the
year, with much of the remaining savings to be realized in the fourth
quarter."

   "Given the continued strength of our balance sheet and significant
operating cash flow, we remain confident that we have the financial
wherewithal to successfully execute our strategies and continue to
meet our financial objectives," D'Amelio continued. "During the second
quarter, we repurchased approximately $500 million, or 26.4 million
shares, of our common stock."

   Pharmaceutical

   Pharmaceutical revenues for the second-quarter 2008 were $11.1
billion, an increase of 9% compared with the prior-year quarter,
including the favorable impact of foreign exchange, which increased
revenues by approximately $730 million or 7%. Second-quarter 2008
revenues from in-line and new products(6) increased 16% compared with
the year-ago quarter; this excludes the impact of the loss of U.S.
exclusivity of Norvasc, Zyrtec and Camptosar, which collectively
resulted in a revenue decline of $496 million or 39% compared with the
year-ago quarter.

   Lipitor revenues in the second-quarter 2008 were $3.0 billion, an
increase of 9% compared with the prior-year quarter, reflecting the
favorable impact of foreign exchange, which increased revenues by
approximately $170 million or 6%. In the U.S., Lipitor revenues
increased 1% compared with the prior-year quarter, while revenues from
international markets rose 18%, due to the favorable impact of foreign
exchange of 13% and operational growth of 5%. The global statin market
continues to be highly competitive, with both branded and generic
competition in an increasingly cost-sensitive environment. Pfizer
continues to respond to these market dynamics with an integrated,
multi-channel effort, emphasizing Lipitor's strong clinical profile
demonstrated in over 400 completed or ongoing clinical trials
including more than 80,000 patients and in more than 151 million
patient years of experience over 15 years.

   Lyrica revenues in the second-quarter 2008 were $614 million, an
increase of 52% compared with the prior-year quarter, driven by strong
efficacy and high patient and physician satisfaction in managing nerve
pain associated with diabetes and nerve pain after shingles, the June
2007 U.S. approval for the management of fibromyalgia, a branded and
unbranded advertising strategy focused on increasing both Lyrica and
fibromyalgia awareness as well as the favorable impact of foreign
exchange. In the U.S., Lyrica revenues rose to $335 million, an
increase of 55% compared to the prior-year quarter, while
international revenues grew to $279 million, an increase of 48%.

   Celebrex revenues in the second-quarter 2008 were $589 million, an
increase of 23% compared with the year-ago quarter, primarily driven
by the continued educational and promotional efforts supporting the
risk-benefit proposition of this medicine, as well as the favorable
impact of foreign exchange. In the U.S., Celebrex revenues rose to
$416 million, an increase of 22% compared with the prior-year quarter,
while international revenues grew to $173 million, an increase of 27%.

   Sutent revenues in the second-quarter 2008 continued to
demonstrate strong performance and market leadership in its approved
indications, advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and gastrointestinal
stromal tumor (GIST), with revenues of $211 million, an increase of
45% compared with the year-ago quarter. In the U.S., Sutent revenues
were $60 million, a decrease of 2% compared with the prior-year
quarter, while international revenues grew to $151 million, an
increase of 80%. To date, Sutent has launched in 61 countries, with
four in the second-quarter 2008 including Japan, China and Russia, and
six planned in the next 12 months. As part of Pfizer's robust life
cycle plan, clinical trials continue for potential additional
indications where Sutent shows promise and where there is a need for
additional treatments, most notably breast, colorectal and lung
cancers.

   Chantix (known as Champix outside the U.S.) revenues in the
second-quarter 2008 were $207 million, an increase of 3% compared with
the second-quarter 2007. In the U.S., Chantix revenues declined to
$109 million, a decrease of 35% compared with the prior-year quarter,
while international revenues grew to $98 million, an increase of 197%.
U.S. results were negatively impacted by the recent updates to the
Chantix U.S. label to include additional safety information, as well
as certain external events relating to Chantix. Pfizer continues its
educational and promotional efforts focused on the Chantix
risk-benefit proposition, the significant health consequences of
smoking and the importance of the physician-patient dialogue to help
patients effectively use Chantix to reach their health goal of
becoming smoke free. Since its approval in the U.S. in May 2006,
Chantix/Champix has been approved in 76 countries and has been used by
more than six million patients, an increasing number of whom are
covered by third-party payers. In the second-quarter 2008, Champix
launched in Japan, which has more than 30 million smokers, as well as
Malaysia and Singapore, with nine launches planned in the next 12
months, including Russia, Turkey and China.

   Animal Health

   Animal Health revenues for the second-quarter 2008 were $715
million, an increase of 13% compared with $632 million in the year-ago
quarter. The increase was driven by the favorable impact of foreign
exchange, which increased revenues by approximately $50 million or 8%,
in addition to strong global livestock and companion animal product
performance.

   Costs and Expenses

   In the second-quarter 2008, adjusted cost of sales(1) as a
percentage of revenues was 16.9% compared with 17.0% in the
second-quarter 2007. This reflects the impact of foreign exchange on
cost of sales in addition to unfavorable changes in geographic mix,
which were slightly more than offset by the favorable effect of our
cost-reduction initiatives.

   Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI)
expenses(1) were $3.7 billion in the second-quarter 2008, a decrease
of 1% compared with the prior-year quarter. The favorable impact of
our cost-reduction initiatives was partially offset by the unfavorable
impact of foreign exchange on expenses compared with the year-ago
period.

   Adjusted research and development (R) expenses(1) were $1.9
billion in the second-quarter 2008, a decrease of 8% compared with the
year-ago quarter, due primarily to the non-recurrence of the one-time
2007 payment to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company in connection with our
collaboration to develop and commercialize apixaban in addition to the
realization of savings associated with our cost-reduction initiatives.

   Overall, foreign exchange increased adjusted total costs(2) by
approximately $440 million or 6% in the second-quarter 2008 compared
with the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange,
our adjusted total costs(2) decreased by $475 million or 6% compared
with the year-ago quarter. The operational improvement was driven
primarily by the reduction in overall workforce level to 84,500 at the
end of second-quarter 2008, a reduction of 13,500 over the past 18
months. Manufacturing and research and development site exits have
also contributed to the operational improvement.

   Pfizer continues to make progress on its target to reduce absolute
adjusted total costs(2) by at least $1.5 to $2.0 billion at the end of
2008 compared with 2006 on a constant currency basis(3). These
initiatives span essentially all divisions, functions, markets and
sites. As of the end of second-quarter 2008, Pfizer had achieved $1.2
billion of the target. The Company expects to achieve much of the
remaining reduction in the fourth-quarter 2008, which will favorably
impact fourth-quarter earnings.

   Financial Guidance

   For the full-year 2008, Pfizer's financial guidance, at current
exchange rates(9) is summarized below. The guidance on adjusted cost
of sales(1) as a percentage of revenue has been tightened to 15.0% -
15.5% from 14.5% - 15.5%. Additionally, guidance on the range for the
effective tax rate on adjusted income(1) has been reduced to 21.5% -
22.0% from 22.0% - 22.5%.

   (1) "Adjusted income" and its components and "adjusted diluted
earnings per share (EPS)" are defined as reported net income and its
components and reported diluted EPS excluding purchase-accounting
adjustments, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and
certain significant items. Adjusted Cost of Sales, Adjusted SI
expenses and Adjusted R expenses are income statement line items
prepared on the same basis, and therefore, components of the overall
Adjusted Income measure. As described under Adjusted Income in the
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations section of Pfizer's Form 10-Q for the fiscal
quarter ended March 30, 2008, management uses adjusted income, among
other factors, to set performance goals and to measure the performance
of the overall company. We believe that investors' understanding of
our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure.
Reconciliations of second-quarter 2008 and 2007, first-half 2008 and
2007, and full-year 2007 adjusted income and its components and
adjusted diluted EPS to reported net income and its components and
reported diluted EPS, as well as reconciliations of full-year 2008
adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS guidance to full-year 2008
reported net income and reported diluted EPS guidance, are provided in
the materials accompanying this report. The adjusted income and its
components and adjusted diluted EPS measures are not, and should not
be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and diluted EPS.

1. The above financial statements present the three-month and six-
    month periods ended June 29, 2008 and July 1, 2007. Subsidiaries
    operating outside the United States are included for the three-
    month and six-month periods ended May 25, 2008 and May 27, 2007.
2. The financial results for the three-month and six-month periods
    ended June 29, 2008 are not necessarily indicative of the results
    which ultimately might be achieved for the current year.
3. As required, the estimated value of Acquisition-related in-process
    research and development charges (IPR) is expensed at
    acquisition date. In the second quarter of 2008, we expensed $156
    million of IPR, primarily related to our acquisitions of
    Serenex, Inc. and Encysive Pharmaceuticals Inc. In the first
    quarter of 2008, we expensed $398 million of IPR, primarily
    related to our acquisitions of CovX, Coley Pharmaceutical Group,
    Inc. and two smaller acquisitions related to Animal Health. In the
    first quarter of 2007, we expensed $283 million of IPR,
    primarily related to our acquisitions of BioRexis Pharmaceutical
    Corp. and Embrex, Inc.
4. Amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets that
    contribute to our ability to sell, manufacture, research, market
    and distribute our products are included in Amortization of
    intangible assets as they benefit multiple business functions.
    Amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets that
    are associated with a single function are included in Cost of
    sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses or
    Research and development expenses, as appropriate.
5. Provision for taxes on income includes tax benefits in the second
    quarter of 2008 of approximately $305 million related to favorable
    tax settlements and of approximately $426 million related to the
    sale of one of our biopharmaceutical companies (Esperion
    Therapeutics Inc.).

 (1) Total in-line and new products Pharmaceutical revenues, which
  exclude the revenues of major products that have lost exclusivity in
  the U.S. since the beginning of 2007, is an alternative view of our
  Pharmaceutical revenues, and we believe that investors'
  understanding of Pharmaceutical revenues is enhanced by disclosing
  this performance measure. Norvasc lost its U.S. exclusivity in March
  2007 and Camptosar lost its U.S. exclusivity in February 2008, and
  as is typical in the pharmaceutical industry, this has resulted in a
  dramatic decline in revenues due to generic competition.
  Zyrtec/Zyrtec D lost its U.S. exclusivity in January 2008 and we
  ceased marketing the product in late January 2008. We believe that
  excluding the impact of these products assists the reader in
  understanding the underlying strength of the balance of our diverse
  Pharmaceutical product portfolio in 2008. Because of its non-

                        SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
*T

   1) Impact of Foreign Exchange on Revenues

   The weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies,
primarily the euro, Japanese yen and Canadian dollar, favorably
impacted our revenues by approximately $800 million, or 7%, in
second-quarter 2008, compared to the same period in 2007, and by
approximately $1.4 billion, or 6%, in the first six months of 2008,
compared to the same period in 2007.

   2) Change in Cost of Sales

   Reported cost of sales increased 9% in second-quarter 2008,
compared to the same period in 2007. The increase primarily reflects
the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and higher implementation
costs associated with our cost-reduction initiatives, partially offset
by the savings impact of our cost-reduction initiatives.

   Reported cost of sales included implementation charges related to
our cost-reduction initiatives of $210 million for the second quarter
of 2008, $348 million for the six months ended June 29, 2008, $170
million for the second quarter of 2007, and $264 million for the six
months ended July 1, 2007.

   Reported cost of sales also included $45 million for the second
quarter of 2008, $93 million for the six months ended June 29, 2008,
$45 million for the second quarter of 2007, and $80 million for the
six months ended July 1, 2007, related to business-transition
activities associated with the sale of our Consumer Healthcare
business, completed in December 2006. This continuing activity is
transitional in nature and generally results from agreements that seek
to facilitate the orderly transfer of operations of our former
Consumer Healthcare business to the new owner.

   Reported cost of sales as a percentage of revenues of 18.9% in
second-quarter 2008 was comparable to second-quarter 2007, reflecting
the favorable impact of our cost-reduction initiatives, offset by
higher 2008 implementation costs associated with our cost-reduction
initiatives and the impact of foreign exchange.

   3) Change in Selling, Informational &amp; Administrative (SI)
Expenses and Research &amp; Development (R) Expenses

   Reported SI expenses in second-quarter 2008 increased 1%, and in
the six months ended June 29, 2008, increased 2%, compared to the same
periods in 2007, reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign
exchange, as well as the impact of higher 2008 implementation costs
associated with our cost-reduction initiatives, partially offset by
savings associated with our cost-reduction initiatives.

   Reported SI expenses included implementation charges related to
our cost-reduction initiatives of $100 million for second-quarter
2008, $175 million for the six months ended June 29, 2008, $79 million
for second-quarter 2007, and $128 million for the six months ended
July 1, 2007.

   Reported R expenses, excluding acquisition-related in-process
research and development charges (IPR), decreased 9% in
second-quarter 2008, and decreased 2% in the six months ended June 29,
2008, compared to the same periods in 2007. The decreases are
primarily due to the non-recurrence of the one-time 2007 payment to
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company in connection with our collaboration to
develop and commercialize apixaban, in addition to the realization of
savings associated with our cost-reduction initiatives, partially
offset by higher R spending related to our new collaboration
agreements, as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.

   Reported R expenses included implementation charges related to
our cost-reduction initiatives of $94 million for second-quarter 2008,
$240 million for the six months ended June 29, 2008, $131 million for
second-quarter 2007, and $162 million for the six months ended July 1,
2007.

   IPR charges in second-quarter 2008 of $156 million primarily
related to our acquisitions of Serenex, Inc. and Encysive
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and in first-quarter 2008, $398 million
primarily related to the acquisitions of CovX, Coley Pharmaceutical
Group, Inc. and two smaller acquisitions related to Animal Health.
IPR charges in the first quarter 2007 of $283 million primarily
related to our acquisitions of BioRexis Pharmaceutical Corp. and
Embrex, Inc.

current period presentation.

   (a) The decrease in net interest income in second-quarter and
first six months of 2008, compared to the same periods in 2007, was
due primarily to lower net financial assets and lower interest rates.

   5) Effective Tax Rate

   The effective tax rate on reported Income from continuing
operations before provision for taxes on income and minority interests
for second-quarter 2008 was 0.9% compared to 16.8% in second-quarter
2007, and in the first six months of 2008 was 12.4% compared to 16.9%
in the first six months of 2007, reflecting tax benefits in the second
quarter of 2008 of $305 million related to favorable tax settlements
for multiple tax years and $426 million related to the sale of one of
our biopharmaceutical companies (Esperion Therapeutic Inc.).

   The effective tax rate on adjusted income(1) was 20.0% in
second-quarter 2008, 21.0% in the first six months of 2008, 22.2% in
second-quarter 2007, and 21.9% in the first six months of 2007. The
lower rates on adjusted income(1) in 2008 reflect the $305 million in
tax benefits related to the resolution of tax issues noted above.

*T

   (a) Guidance in the table above excludes the effects of business
development transactions not completed as of June 29, 2008.

   While certain components of our 2008 reported guidance for net
income and diluted EPS have been revised, the reported net income and
diluted EPS expectation of $11.7 billion - $12.8 billion and $1.73 -
$1.88 remains unchanged.

   Our guidance excludes the impact of pending or prospective
business development activity. During the second quarter of 2008, the
net income and diluted EPS impact associated with 2008 completed
business development transactions increased from $0.3 billion and
$0.05 to $0.5 billion and $0.08, due to the recognition of IPR
associated with our acquisitions of Serenex, Inc. and Encysive
Pharmaceuticals Inc. in the second quarter of 2008. During the second
quarter of 2008, the net income and diluted EPS effects of our
cost-reduction initiatives have been revised from $1.4 billion - $1.7
billion and $0.21 - $0.26 to $1.6 billion - $1.9 billion and $0.24 -
$0.29. The increase is principally driven by costs associated with
site closures that were previously forecast to be recorded in 2009
that are now forecast to be incurred in 2008. These items are offset
by tax benefits related to the sale of Esperion in the second quarter
of 2008, which favorably impact net income and diluted EPS by $0.4
billion and $0.06.

   (1) "Adjusted income" and "adjusted diluted earnings per share
(EPS)" are defined as reported net income and reported diluted EPS
excluding purchase-accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs,
discontinued operations and certain significant items. As described
under Adjusted Income in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of Pfizer's Form
10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 30, 2008, management uses
adjusted income, among other factors, to set performance goals and to
measure the performance of the overall company. We believe that
investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing
this measure. The adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS measures
are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net
income and diluted EPS.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds CFO comment, details on spending)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Daisuke Wakabayashi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REDMOND, Wash., July 24 (Reuters) - Chief Executive Steve
Ballmer on Thursday defended Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) need to
make heavy investments in its Internet businesses but said the
company was "done," for now, with pursuing Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's nothing under discussion between the two of us,"
Ballmer told investors of how six months of various talks had
reached an impasse earlier in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We had a set of principles, we talked about them, it
didn't work out," he said. "Fine, we're done. We can move on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The message for Microsoft's annual meeting with Wall Street
analysts, an all-day affair at its headquarters in Redmond,
Washington, was that it had a post-Yahoo plan to turn around
its online services division and a strategy to take advantage
of future opportunities, even as its Internet chief departs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is this huge, huge, huge new opportunity around the
Internet and online and we have to embrace that opportunity and
invest in that opportunity," Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Microsoft have fallen 8 percent over the last
week since the company forecast an outlook below Wall Street
estimates and revealed an additional $500 million investment
into its online unit, even as it chalked up further losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Charles Di Bona, a software research analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein, said Ballmer's comments did not give enough details
about how that additional investment will be spent and how the
company arrived at that decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's spending $500 million dollars and then it says we'll
tell you later how we'll spend it," said Di Bona, who has an
"outperform" rating on Microsoft. "The market's concern is not
about how it is running its core business. It's about decisions
about larger chunks of money that people can't track."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer said Microsoft is willing to endure online division
operating losses that amount to between 5 percent to 10 percent
of the company's total operating income, which reached $22.5
billion in fiscal year 2008, until the search and advertising
business reaches "scale."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He did not specify on how long this period of losses would
last, but said the risk was worth the potential return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's online division has posted eight straight
quarters of losses. It lost $1.23 billion in the past fiscal
year, twice as much as it had lost in fiscal 2007 and about 5.5
percent of Microsoft's total operating income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer said its online businesses could eventually account
for most of the economic value created by the world's largest
software maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Microsoft CEO was left to describe Internet strategy
after Microsoft announced one day before the analyst meeting
that the head of that business, Kevin Johnson, was leaving. He
will become chief executive of Juniper Networks Inc JNPR.O. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We thought it was important whoever was going to get up
and talk about the big investment online was going to be here
in three weeks and so you're stuck with me on this topic
today," Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BIG PLANS WITHOUT YAHOO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seeking to show momentum in its existing Internet business,
Microsoft announced that it had expanded its existing pact with
Facebook, the world's largest social networking site, to
provide Web search and search advertising in addition to its
existing deal to run graphical display ads on Facebook pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Satya Nadella, Microsoft's senior vice president in its
search and advertising group, said the expanded Facebook deal
would be implemented in the next few months and "carry both our
Web results, as well as our page search advertising."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said the new search advertising deal will be
limited to Facebook's U.S. pages. The pact builds on a deal in
which Microsoft invested $240 million last October in Facebook
for a 1.6 percent stake, valuing the company at $15 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer said its pursuit of Yahoo reflected the importance
of Web search as the starting point for consumers to locate a
growing range of digital media and e-commerce services from
online video to shopping, which he estimated represented a $1
trillion business opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer described Yahoo, the world's second-largest
provider of Web search and related advertising, as a quick way
for Microsoft, a distant No. 3 player, to gain scale in order
to compete more effectively with leader Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A lot of our discussion around Yahoo centers as much on
this issue as any other issue," he said, adding later: "This is
a two-horse race. It is about Microsoft and Google."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nonetheless, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Chris
Liddell all but ruled out a full acquisition of Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The chances of us buying Yahoo on a full acquisition basis
are so small that they are essentially negligible," said
Liddell, adding that he never says never.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft walked away from a full acquisition, according to
Liddell, because it saw Yahoo as a "declining asset" and its
value continued to sink while it dragged its feet about
accepting the offer from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Liddell also said he is worried that by the time Yahoo
comes around to accepting Microsoft's most recent proposal -- a
bid to buy just Yahoo's search business that Yahoo rejected
last month -- Microsoft will already be so far along in a
strategy without Yahoo that it will no longer be interested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Microsoft fell 3.75 percent to close at $25.44 on
Thursday following the departure of Johnson, announced late on
Wednesday.

It's about decisions about larger chunks of money that people can't track."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's online division has posted eight straight quarters of losses. It lost $1.23 billion in the past fiscal year, twice as much as it had lost in fiscal 2007. Ballmer said given the opportunity, the losses represent an investment for a potential windfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said its online businesses could eventually account for most of the economic value created by the world's largest software maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft CEO was left to describe Internet strategy after Microsoft announced one day before the analyst meeting that the head of that business, Kevin Johnson, was leaving. He will become chief executive of Juniper Networks Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We thought it was important whoever was going to get up and talk about the big investment online was going to be here in three weeks and so you're stuck with me on this topic today," Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIG PLANS WITHOUT YAHOO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeking to show momentum in its existing Internet business, Microsoft announced that it had expanded its existing pact with Facebook, the world's largest social networking site, to provide Web search and search advertising in addition to its existing deal to run graphical display ads on Facebook pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Satya Nadella, Microsoft's senior vice president in its search and advertising group, said the expanded Facebook deal would be implemented in the next few months and "carry both our Web results, as well as our page search advertising."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said the new search advertising deal will be limited to Facebook's U.S. pages. The pact builds on a deal in which Microsoft invested $240 million last October in Facebook for a 1.6 percent stake, valuing the company at $15 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said its pursuit of Yahoo reflected the importance of Web search as the starting point for consumers to locate a growing range of digital media and e-commerce services from online video to shopping, which he estimated represented a $1 trillion business opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer described Yahoo, the world's second-largest provider of Web search and related advertising, as a quick way for Microsoft, a distant No. 3 player, to gain scale in order to compete more effectively with leader Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of our discussion around Yahoo centers as much on this issue as any other issue," he said, adding later: "This is a two-horse race. It is about Microsoft and Google."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yahoo-Microsoft combination made sense because of cost savings to be gained from merging research and development and data center investment, Ballmer said, but added that the deal fell apart over price and possible regulatory approval delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the wrong price and if it had to stretch out over two administrations of review ... it was not a good tactic," said Ballmer. "Does that mean nobody will ever talk to anybody again? I suspect the answer is also no," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft believed it had to seal a Yahoo deal by early May in order to win approval for it from U.S. regulators before a new administration takes over in Washington. Yahoo rejected a $47.5 billion bid by Microsoft at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft fell 3.75 percent to close at $25.44 on Thursday following the departure of Johnson, announced late on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Eric Auchard in San Francisco; Editing by Phil Berlowitz and Braden Reddall, Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comment)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Daisuke Wakabayashi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REDMOND, Wash., July 24 (Reuters) - Chief Executive Steve
Ballmer on Thursday defended Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) need to
make heavy investments in its Internet businesses but said the
company was "done," for now, with pursuing Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's nothing under discussion between the two of us,"
Ballmer told investors of how six months of various talks had
reached an impasse earlier in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We had a set of principles, we talked about them, it
didn't work out," he said. "Fine, we're done. We can move on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The message for Microsoft's annual meeting with Wall Street
analysts, an all-day affair at its headquarters in Redmond,
Washington, was that it had a post-Yahoo plan to turn around
its online services division and a strategy to take advantage
of future opportunities, even as its Internet chief departs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is this huge, huge, huge new opportunity around the
Internet and online and we have to embrace that opportunity and
invest in that opportunity," Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Microsoft have fallen 8 percent over the last
week since the company forecast an outlook below Wall Street
estimates and revealed an additional $500 million investment
into its online unit, even as it chalked up further losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Charles Di Bona, a software research analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein, said Ballmer's comments did not give enough details
about how that additional investment will be spent and how the
company arrived at that decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's spending $500 million dollars and then it says we'll
tell you later how we'll spend it," said Di Bona, who has an
"outperform" rating on Microsoft. "The market's concern is not
about how it is running its core business. It's about decisions
about larger chunks of money that people can't track."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's online division has posted eight straight
quarters of losses. It lost $1.23 billion in the past fiscal
year, twice as much as it had lost in fiscal 2007. Ballmer said
given the opportunity, the losses represent an investment for a
potential windfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer said its online businesses could eventually account
for most of the economic value created by the world's largest
software maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Microsoft CEO was left to describe Internet strategy
after Microsoft announced one day before the analyst meeting
that the head of that business, Kevin Johnson, was leaving. He
will become chief executive of Juniper Networks Inc JNPR.O. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We thought it was important whoever was going to get up
and talk about the big investment online was going to be here
in three weeks and so you're stuck with me on this topic
today," Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BIG PLANS WITHOUT YAHOO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seeking to show momentum in its existing Internet business,
Microsoft announced that it had expanded its existing pact with
Facebook, the world's largest social networking site, to
provide Web search and search advertising in addition to its
existing deal to run graphical display ads on Facebook pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Satya Nadella, Microsoft's senior vice president in its
search and advertising group, said the expanded Facebook deal
would be implemented in the next few months and "carry both our
Web results, as well as our page search advertising."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said the new search advertising deal will be
limited to Facebook's U.S. pages. The pact builds on a deal in
which Microsoft invested $240 million last October in Facebook
for a 1.6 percent stake, valuing the company at $15 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer said its pursuit of Yahoo reflected the importance
of Web search as the starting point for consumers to locate a
growing range of digital media and e-commerce services from
online video to shopping, which he estimated represented a $1
trillion business opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer described Yahoo, the world's second-largest
provider of Web search and related advertising, as a quick way
for Microsoft, a distant No. 3 player, to gain scale in order
to compete more effectively with leader Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A lot of our discussion around Yahoo centers as much on
this issue as any other issue," he said, adding later: "This is
a two-horse race. It is about Microsoft and Google."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Yahoo-Microsoft combination made sense because of cost
savings to be gained from merging research and development and
data center investment, Ballmer said, but added that the deal
fell apart over price and possible regulatory approval delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At the wrong price and if it had to stretch out over two

Thursday following the departure of Johnson, announced late on
Wednesday.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Jul 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Riverbed Technology (NASDAQ: RVBD), the technology and market leader in
wide-area data services (WDS), today announced that Riverbed(R) has been
accepted in the Microsoft Protocol Optimization Licensing Program (POLP).
Through this protocol implementation agreement, Microsoft gives Riverbed
access to its intellectual property and technology so that Riverbed can
build on its expertise and success accelerating and optimizing Microsoft
Windows-based applications over the wide-area network (WAN).

    With the recent release of version 5.0 of the Riverbed Optimization System
(RiOS(R)), Riverbed is now able to provide application-level protocol
optimization for Microsoft Exchange 2000, 2003 and 2007.

    Over the past four years, Riverbed has led the industry in accelerating
applications over the wide-area network to enhance remote and mobile
worker productivity, as well as driving IT efficiency through enabling
successful IT consolidation without application performance compromise
for over 4,500 customers worldwide.

    "We continue to deepen our knowledge of Windows and other Microsoft
applications, like SharePoint, Systems Center Configuration Manager
Server, Data Protection Manager and CRM, so that our customers can offer
'wind in your hair' access and performance of Microsoft applications to
its remote and mobile workers," said John Martin, VP of Product
Management for Riverbed. "Working closely with Microsoft and its
commitment to interoperability, we are obtaining access to application
protocols to further enhance our customers' experience and IT
efficiencies of Microsoft applications over the WAN. Joining the POLP
program is the next step in our previously announced vision to enable
customers to incorporate Windows Server-based services on the Riverbed
Services Platform."

    A vast majority of Riverbed customers leverage Riverbed Steelhead(R)
appliances to accelerate Microsoft Office, Windows Server and Microsoft
Exchange through optimization of underlying CIFS and MAPI protocols, as
well as other Microsoft products such as Microsoft Office SharePoint
Server, Microsoft-SQL Server, System Center Configuration Manager, System
Center Data Protection Manager (DPM) and Microsoft Dynamics CRM.

    "At Golder Associates, we have 140 engineering offices worldwide, and are
running a centralized SharePoint server as our main Intranet," said Joe
Potegal, senior network engineer, Golder Associates. "We were already
running Microsoft SharePoint with Steelhead appliances and saw a 2.5x
increase in performance for our staff collaborating on projects. With RiOS
5.0, SharePoint runs even faster. Documents that used to take 30 seconds
to access without Riverbed now take 2 to 3 seconds, and our staff can
collaborate from wherever they're working. We also have plans to migrate
from Exchange 2003 to 2007, and the new Riverbed Exchange 2007
acceleration feature has given us the ability to do that with no concerns
about performance, functionality or our consolidated architecture."

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan has awarded PFGBEST.com its "2007 Elite Quality
Recognition Award." PFGBEST.com effected greater than 20 percent
efficiency improvements in multi-currency clearing in 2007 and
continues to increase its volumes of multi-currency wire and payment
transactions requiring the use of the Bank's system. This award is
given annually to a JPMorgan client which has a volume greater than
10,000 payments and improvement greater than 20 percent, meaning a
larger number of wires had accurate payment instructions and were
successfully transmitted with no human intervention.

   Handling PFGBEST.com customer wiring instructions electronically
through the JPMorgan web-based system has streamlined the process and
speeds the effort to convert from one currency to another and have the
wire sent the same day to the customer - an important benefit for
PFGBEST.com futures clients, forex clients, and currency delivery
customers. "It makes us more competitive, and improves our customer
retention," said PFGBEST.com President Russ Wasendorf, Jr.

&lt;p&gt;JOHANNESBURG, July 24 (Reuters) - South African food and

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. communications equipment maker Juniper Networks Inc JNPR.O named senior Microsoft veteran Kevin Johnson as its new chief executive, saying he will start work in September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnson, 47, replaces Scott Kriens, who had led the company for 12 years and will continue as chairman of Juniper's board, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known as "KJ," Johnson was president of Microsoft's Platforms and Services Division, its largest business unit, and had spearheaded the software maker's failed pursuit of Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft announced Johnson's departure on Wednesday, alongside a reorganization that split the division into two: one focused on the dominant Windows operating system and the other focused on its lagging online business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juniper said Johnson was chosen while the company was searching for a chief operating officer, after Stephen Elop left in January to head Microsoft's business division. The decision by Juniper's board, including Kriens, to appoint Johnson as CEO was unanimous, said spokeswoman Sarah Sorensen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also said it would be up to Johnson to determine the still-vacant COO position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juniper makes most of its revenue from selling high-performance routers to communications service providers. Earlier this year, it expanded into the market for ethernet switches, which direct traffic on corporate data networks, moving into more direct competition with bigger rival Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorensen said Kriens, 50, would remain active in Juniper and oversee leadership development programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having been CEO for 12 years, he's at a point where he'd like to find a balance in his personal life," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reshuffle surprised some analysts, who were focused on the succession plan for Cisco, where CEO John Chambers eight years older than Kriens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson joined Microsoft in 1992 and worked his way up to being the head of worldwide sales. He was put in charge of Windows and charged with incorporating Microsoft's online services business with its traditional software groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was in the inner circle of Microsoft executives who advocated a takeover of Yahoo. His departure is seen as a setback to the software maker's online business, which trails that of Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Juniper fell 5.3 percent to $21.68. Microsoft shares fell 2.8 percent to $25.69.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juniper is due to report quarterly results later on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Tiffany Wu in New York and Daisuke Wakabayashi in Seattle, editing by Dave Zimmerman and Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  CULVER CITY, CA, Jul 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Venice Consulting Group (VCG), a leading software development and
consulting firm, today announced the release of Business Intelligence
Studio (BIS) software for Microsoft Office PerformancePoint Server 2007.
The new software solution provides numerous features that help companies
maximize their investment in PerformancePoint Server through
user-friendly interfaces, creating financial applications that are easier
to use and richer in information. BIS was developed by Orange Peel Inc.,
a joint venture of VCG and Solver Inc.

    Since its release in 2007, Microsoft PerformancePoint Server (PPS) has
grown in popularity through its host of Business Performance Management
capabilities and its integration with Microsoft Office. PPS 2007 focuses
on delivering three primary missions of planning, monitoring and
analytics. BIS enables full utilization of all PPS 2007 features. It is a
solution that accelerates the implementation of PPS, enables end user
productivity and provides valuable budgeting/planning functionality to
facilitate better Business Performance Management.

    Real-World Benefits

    BIS lets users combine data from several cubes; for example, employee
salary per year in the user model with the salary increase percentage from
the assumption model. This ensures an easy to use end-user environment
without having to juggle with multiple workbooks.

    BIS also gives users the option to add members on the fly directly through
the Microsoft Excel budget model versus having to go to the PPS console,
for example if a department manager needs to add a new employee.

    For Line Item detail, (such as detailed travel expenses below the GL
account level) users do not have to first add each line item as a
dimension member in the data warehouse. Instead BIS will handle this
automatically within Excel, enabling dynamic input forms.

    "Companies are placing great importance on using data to gain competitive
advantages, whether through internal process improvements or changes which
affect the bottom line," says Per Solli, chief executive officer for
Orange Peel. "Yet the issue isn't a lack of data. The dilemma is how to
process and interpret the data to make meaningful decisions. Business
Intelligence Studio is the perfect complement to any company using
Microsoft PerformancePoint Server to take business intelligence to the
next level."

    Innovative Features

    Samples of the new features in BIS include:

    Multi-Model Forms: Custom template-based controls can be assigned multiple
times to one form and can be controlled from the slicer. It can submit to
multiple models and scenarios without having to change from one Excel form
to the other; multiple cubes can be linked to the same slicers.

    Line Item Detail: Update/create/ remove records from the transaction
table, reference multiple measures within one model, read multiple models
within a line item.

    Custom Form Controls: Drop down boxes, check boxes, short and long text
boxes, and linked drop downs enable data entry with checks and controls,
to ensure better data quality, smoother budgeting and forecasting
processes which provide better business performance management in your
organization.

    Simplified Dimension Maintenance (Memberset Editor control): Create new
members at runtime with the use of the Memberset Editor Control. New
members can automatically be added to existing membersets without having
to redeploy the cube. Editor allows for editing and deleting of existing
members as well.

    "The product was built from the ground up with the end user in mind," says
Niels Hansen, chief technology officer for Orange Peel. "The manager who
has to analyze and report on a regular basis will appreciate how each
feature of BIS makes their lives easier. Companies spending resources on
integrating Performance Point Server into their corporate environment will
find their investment in BIS quickly paid back through efficiency gains."

&lt;p&gt;SAN CLEMENTE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Ault Glazer &amp; Co, Inc. (Pink Sheets:AULT) ("AGC") announces one of
its wholly owned subsidiary Portfolio Companies, Global Authentication
Inc. (GAI), has launched a new service specifically targeting
collectors of Disney memorabilia. The service division of GAI is to be
known as Disneyana Grading and Authentication. Global Authentication
is currently one of three recognized authenticators for the online
marketplace EBAY. "Collectors of pins, event passes, programs and
related memorabilia have a real passion for Disneyana collectibles.
Whether it's the first pin issue of Mickey Mouse, Tinker Bell or the
first pass printed for Anaheim Disney, collectors want the best
quality and an assurance of its authenticity," commented Mike Baker,
Director of Authentication and Grading at Global Authentication.

   Bill Dully, recently appointed to the Group President position at
parent Ault Glazer &amp; Co, Inc., (see July 8, 2008 press release) serves
also as CEO of Global Authentication, and commented, "Our Company has
worked very hard and we are excited to be the first to launch this
service to the collectible marketplace. This new service demonstrates
our primary focus on leveraging the experience and innovation we pride
ourselves on as a company. The current economic environment has been
challenging for a lot of companies; I'm confident our innovations will
lead us and our clients to new and exciting places like Disneyana
Collectibles."

   "All collectors share one thing in common, passion, and the amount
of passion I have seen for these collectibles is amazing. We have
assembled some great resources within the industry, to rapidly
escalate the visibility of this new authentication service. Our
clients will have access to population, pricing and critical
information on what to look for with counterfeit or scrap items. The
structure we are establishing to assist collectors transacting
throughout the marketplace will bring a greater stability and help
keep that passion resonating," stated Steve Rocchi, President of
Global Disneyana.

   Global Authentication is one of the world's leading third party
authenticators in the collectibles industry. They have assembled a
management, grading and authentication team with over 100 years of
authenticating experience. Global's team of unbiased experts examines,
authenticates and grades any Disneyana collectible and ensures it is
carefully preserved in a tamper evident holder. The item is then
registered in a database, where its authenticity and grade can be
permanently verified.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jul 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
When it comes to supercomputing energy efficiency, IBM (NYSE: IBM) cannot
be beaten -- that's according to the findings of the latest
Supercomputing 'Green 500 List' announced by The Green500.org.
http://www.green500.org/lists/2008/06/green500.php

    No fewer than the top 15 positions in the ranking of energy efficiency are
held by supercomputers built on IBM high performance computing technology.

    The list includes supercomputers from across the globe being used for a
variety of applications such as astronomy, climate prediction and
pharmaceutical research.

    Ranking the recently announced world's fastest Los Alamos National
Laboratories petaflop supercomputer at number three for energy performance
-- the list is topped by IBM's own Boeblingen Lab supercomputer which is
used for development of IBM blade computing systems.

    "Energy efficiency has become just as important as simple raw performance
for the modern supercomputer. As applications for supercomputers increase,
so does the attention on this aspect of their use," said Dave Turek, VP
Deep Computing.

    "Leveraging our $6 billion annual R investment, IBM has a rich history
of innovation that has significantly increased microprocessor energy
efficiency. We have also driven advances that include our Cool Blue
technology portfolio and added to our Project Big Green solutions that are
designed to simultaneously reduce data center costs and energy use," he
added.

    The third annual Green 500 list is published by The Green500.org. It
provides a ranking of the most energy-efficient supercomputers in the
world and serves as a complementary view to the TOP500 announced in
Dresden last month.

    In the ranking:


--  IBM holds all top ten places with a number of IBM BladeCenter QS22 and
    LS21 Clusters and Blue Gene/P Solutions.
--  Out of the first 40 ranked systems, 39 are IBM-based.
--  Out of the top 100 systems, 76 systems are IBM-based.
--  The top three supercomputers -- all IBM -- surpass the 400 MFLOPS/watt
    milestone for the first time -- with the leading system delivering almost
    half a GFLOP per watt.
    

    
In addition to the energy efficient technology solutions, IBM is
focused on numerous areas related to energy and the environment,
including sustainable supply chains, solar technology, carbon management
consulting, advanced water management, intelligent utility networks and
intelligent transportation systems.

JSC Bank of Georgia (LSE: BGEO GSE: GEB), the leading Georgian universal bank,

International. The decision to upgrade UBDP from Associated to Principal member
was made by the Board of Directors of Visa International on 26 June 2008.

The new Principal Member status allows UBDP to start direct settlement with Visa
International, sponsor other banks and obtain license for merchant acquiring.
The Principal Member status will also enable UBDP to migrate its card processing
to the Georgian Card, Georgia's leading card processing platform majority-owned
by Bank of Georgia. In cooperation with Georgian Card, UBDP plans to build a new
card platform, offer its clients additional services, expand the range of card
products and issue co-branded debit and credit cards.

UBPD issued its first Visa card in 2003 as an Associated Member of Visa
International and as of the end of June serviced approximately 74,000 Visa cards
outstanding. All Visa cards issued by UBDP are chip enabled, equipped with
secure data processing system and software in line with international card
payment system standards.

"Visa Principal Membership status is the recognition of UBDP's development and
successful operation of its card business. The new membership status with Visa
International will help UBDP strengthen its position on the Ukrainian plastic
cards market and highlights our intention to continue the development of our
plastic cards business in Ukraine," commented Nicholas Enukidze, Chairman of the
Supervisory Board of Bank of Georgia.

strategic CRS focus areas, including:

        our manufacturing, fleet, sales and marketing equipment, and
        facilities.

   --  Achieving the company's target of a three percent improvement
        in water use ratio over previous year, using 1.77 liters of
        water to produce one liter of product

   --  Launching Coca-Cola Recycling with a mission of recovering or
        recycling the equivalent of 100 percent of the packaging
        materials used by the Coca-Cola system in North America

   --  Installing more than 20,000 energy-saving devices in sales and
        marketing equipment, reducing CO2 by 28,000 metric tons

&lt;p&gt;While Interest in International Travel Remains Strong, Americans
Traveling Abroad Are Staying Closer to Home
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
The dollar's decline hasn't dampened enthusiasm for travel abroad
among large numbers of Americans - but it has shortened the distance
they are willing to travel, according to a new survey from Visa.

   The survey, which polled only U.S. payment cardholders who had
traveled outside the U.S. in the past three years, found that two out
of three respondents (63 percent) are equally or more willing to
travel compared with one year ago. And half said they are likely to
take a trip abroad in the next 12 months. For those travelers, Canada
and Mexico are their most likely destinations outside the 50 states.

   Americans remain enamored with travel: 74 percent of respondents
who said they are not traveling internationally in the next year are
interested in traveling overseas in the future.

   "Americans love to travel; it's hard to keep them at home," said
Vicente Echeveste, Global Travel and Tourism Lead at Visa Inc. "Even
though Americans aren't going as far this year, the fact that they
continue to exhibit a strong willingness to travel overseas reinforces
international tourism as a strong driver of global economic growth."

   Those who are not likely to travel internationally this year cited
cost of travel (54 percent) and the current state of the economy (49
percent) as deterrents. However, Americans are not confining
themselves to backyard barbecues and block parties - they are planning
trips within the 50 states to satisfy their wanderlust. In fact, one
of the top three reasons respondents gave for not traveling overseas
was that they were planning to travel in the U.S. this year (49
percent).

   Top Destinations for International Travel

   Distance appears to rule travel decisions for Americans this year,
with Western Europe and the Caribbean rounding out the list of the
most popular foreign destinations for American travelers in 2008,
according to the survey.

   Top anticipated trip destinations among cardholders who traveled
internationally in the past three years and are likely to travel
internationally in 2008 include:

   1. Canada (46 percent)

   2. Mexico (45 percent)

   3. United Kingdom (28 percent)

   4. Italy (27 percent)

   5. France (24 percent)

   6. Bahamas (24 percent)

   A review of tourism spending on Visa-branded payment cards
reinforces the continued appeal of Western Europe and North America
for American travelers. Between January 1 and December 31, 2007, the
top destinations based on tourist spending on U.S.-issued Visa-branded
payment cards were:

-0-
*T
 1.Canada              $2.9 billion
 2.Mexico              $1.8 billion
 3.United Kingdom      $1.3 billion
 4.Italy               $1.1 billion
 5.France              $975 million
 6.Germany             $837 million
 7.Puerto Rico         $741 million
 8.Australia           $435 million
 9.Spain               $431 million
10.China               $414 million
*T

   Where will American tourists be spending their money overseas?
According to the survey, respondents plan to spend the most money on
accommodations (60 percent), followed by food (12 percent) and
entertainment (12 percent).

   "Understanding where and how visitors are spending their money is
of significant value to governments and the global tourism industry.
Visa is committed to providing tourism data to help drive sustainable
global tourism and a safe, reliable and global payment acceptance
network for Visa cardholders," Echeveste added.

   Travelers Prefer Electronic Payment While Overseas

   The majority of respondents cited credit and debit cards as their
preferred payment method when making purchases overseas (73 percent),
ahead of cash (18 percent) and travelers checks (7 percent). Travelers
are opting for electronic payment based on its convenience (94
percent), ease of accessing funds (87 percent) and security (78
percent).

   About the 2008 U.S. International Travel Outlook

   The 2008 U.S. International Travel Outlook is based on phone
interviews with 1,000 adult Americans who hold a credit card or a
debit card and have traveled outside the U.S. in the past three years.
From May 12-22, 2008, 1,000 respondents were interviewed by Western
Wats. Survey results have a margin of error due to sampling of no more
than plus-or-minus three percentage points at the 95 percent
confidence level.

   Visa cardholder spending data cited is based upon a review of
tourism spending on U.S.-issued Visa-branded payment cards
internationally and in the U.S. territories of Guam, Puerto Rico and
the U.S. Virgin Islands, during the calendar year 2007 (January 1 -
December 31, 2007) and during the first quarter of 2008 (January 1 -
March 31, 2008). These findings are based upon VisaVue(R) Travel data.
Visa introduced the VisaVue(R) Travel tourism reports to a pilot group
of U.S. tourism organizations in early 2008 and plans to roll out the
product to a broader audience of state and convention visitor bureau
destination marketing entities later this year.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 24 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded ATT
Inc (T.N) to "neutral" from "overweight," and said it expects
further deterioration in the wireline fundamentals of the U.S.
phone company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company on Wednesday posted a higher quarterly profit,
as stronger-than-expected growth in wireless subscribers
compensated for a shrinking landline business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To stem the decline in wireline customers, the company had
invested heavily in high-speed Internet service, but the
results showed high-speed Internet users rose by only 46,000
during the quarter to 14.7 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Second-quarter results reflect the strong effect the
economy and competition are having on ATT's wireline business
as demonstrated by rapidly rising access line losses and anemic
broadband subscriber adds," JP Morgan analyst Mike McCormack
wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst said he expected wireline performance to remain
depressed, with no signs of an economic turnaround.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McCormack, who removed his $42 price target on the stock,
said margin acceleration post Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPhone will
be a longer-than-anticipated process, weighing on earnings
growth of ATT -- the phone's exclusive U.S. carrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ATT shares closed at $33.06 Wednesday on the New York
Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) has raised $10 billion to create a fund that will invest in loans used to back leveraged buyouts and take advantage of a gap in the markets caused by the credit crisis, according to a Financial Times report on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman will use the fund to buy senior loans, or those that are paid off before other debts. The investment bank already has a $20 billion fund that invests in mezzanine debts, paid after the senior debt, the newspaper reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Financial Times wrote that by using the two funds, Goldman can commit to financing large deals on its own without having to recruit outside investors for the debt. The paper said the Goldman funds were much larger that those of other equity firms and investment banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's new fund will operate under Goldman's private equity arm, with money from the firm's clients, bank and partners, according to the newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the fund-raising is not yet officially complete, its head, Tom Connolly is already looking at deals, the Financial Times reported. Citing people familiar with the transaction, the FT said one such deal would provide the senior debt for the sale of a $2 billion manufacturing company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A representative from Goldman Sachs was not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Phil Wahba; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARIS, July 24 (Reuters) - Euro Disney (EDLP.PA) on Thursday
posted a 3 percent rise in third-quarter sales to 331.9 million
euros ($522.2 million) from 321.7 million, citing a rise in the
number of visitors and in average spending per guest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The theme park operator said theme park revenues gained 5
percent to 182 million euros as visitors from France, Italy and
the Netherlands boosted attendance, despite the shift of the
Easter Holiday in some of the group's key markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hotels and Disney Village revenues rose 2 percent to 135.4
million euros following in daily room rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The group said revenues for the nine months ended June 30
rose 12 percent to 937 million euros from 834.3 million euros in
the prior-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Euro Disney made no comment on its guidance.

which will host some Olympic events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Foreigners coming to Shanghai on important business before

&lt;p&gt;LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank JP Morgan
(JPM.N) has held talks with potential partners about forming a
consortium to break up British mortgage lender HBOS HBOS.L,
The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; National Australia Bank (NAB.AX), named by the Telegraph as
a potentially interested party, played down the report, while a
UK industry source said HBOS had not received an approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're not sure this is a clever time to make
acquisitions," NAB Chief Executive John Stewart told reporters
on Friday, shortly after NAB announced a further A$830 million
($798 million) in losses from its exposure to U.S. mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Without naming a source, the Telegraph said JP Morgan had
also approached private equity firms and may talk to Spain's
Banco Santander (SAN.MC) about a deal that would resemble the
break up of ABN AMRO by a group of three banks last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NAB could be a buyer of HBOS's Australian arm, Bankwest,
and may also be interested in its corporate banking unit, the
report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HBOS, JP Morgan, and Santander all declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts have suggested that HBOS, Britain's biggest home
lender, could make disposals to help absorb a potential rise in
bad debts as the UK property market weakens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank earlier this month raised 4 billion pounds ($7.94
billion) through a rights issue aimed at shoring up its balance
sheet, depleted by asset write downs and rising funding costs
in the wake of the credit crunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank's shareholders bought just 8.3 percent of the
issue after HBOS' shares fell below the offer price of 275
pence, forcing underwriters to pick up the remainder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't think anybody thinks HBOS is going to get bought.
I think it's more likely that they would potentially sell
bits," said Fox-Pitt, Kelton analyst Leigh Goodwin, who
believes the cost of funding HBOS' core UK mortgage operation
would deter potential acquirers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts reckon HBOS disposals could include Bankwest,
asset management unit Insight, and insurance arm Clerical 
Medical, as well as its 60 percent stake in UK life insurer St
James's Place (SJP.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HBOS shares were down 3.8 percent at 290.5 pence by 1008
GMT on Friday, while the FTSE 100 share index was 0.73 percent
lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Telegraph report said no consortium has been formed and
talks could still fall through, while a break-up bid may meet
opposition from UK regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A combination of HBOS's mortgage business and Santander's
UK operations including Alliance  Leicester ALLL.L -- the
British lender which last week accepted a 1.3 billion pound
offer from the Spanish bank -- would control about 32 percent
of the British home loans market, exceeding the competition
authorities' 25 percent limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Paul Day in Madrid, Douwe Miedema

&lt;p&gt;Announcement Follows $1 Billion Funding of Nearby Kipper Gas Field
IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) announced today the Gippsland
Basin Joint Venture, which includes its subsidiary, Esso Australia,
will invest $1.1 billion to develop more than 270 million
oil-equivalent barrels from the Turrum field in the Bass Strait,
offshore southeast Australia.

   The development follows the recent announcement of $1 billion in
funding to develop natural gas from the Kipper field, also in the Bass
Strait.

   Esso Australia is the Turrum field operator and holds 50 percent
interest with BHP Billiton. Esso Australia operates 21 offshore oil
and gas production facilities in Bass Strait and also operates and
holds 32.5 percent interest in the Kipper Unit Joint Venture with BHP
Billiton and Santos Limited.

   "ExxonMobil continues to be an industry leader in bringing new
energy supplies to the market and the Turrum Field development is the
latest example," said Rich Kruger, president of ExxonMobil Production
Company.

   "Bass Strait has a long history and a bright future," Kruger said.
"There are significant oil and gas resources remaining to be produced
in the basin."

   Esso Australia has produced oil and gas from the Bass Strait
offshore fields for nearly 40 years.

   The Turrum and Kipper projects are among 119 in ExxonMobil's
industry-leading portfolio to support development of more than 24
billion oil-equivalent barrels of energy.

   Turrum Project

   The Turrum field holds approximately one trillion cubic feet of
gas and 110 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids. The
development concept for the project is based upon the construction of
a new platform bridge-linked to the existing Marlin A platform in Bass
Strait. The platform will process additional oil production and gas
cycling which will be piped back to existing processing facilities at
Longford. Construction is anticipated to begin in 2009. Oil production
is expected in 2011, and first gas sales are estimated to take place
in 2015.

   Kipper Project

   The Kipper resource holds approximately 620 billion cubic feet of
recoverable gas and 30 million barrels of condensate/liquified
petroleum gas. The Kipper field will be developed by the installation
of a number of subsea wells, piped back to existing infrastructure at
Longford. Construction will begin in the second half of 2008 and first
gas is expected in 2011.

   More information about these projects is available in the online
newsroom of ExxonMobil in Australia at this link:
http://www.exxonmobil.com/Australia-English/PA/Newsroom.

   CAUTIONARY STATEMENT: Estimates, expectations, and business plans
in this release are forward-looking statements. Actual future results,
including resource recoveries and project plans, schedules and
investments could differ materially due to changes in market
conditions affecting the oil and gas industry or long-term oil and gas
price levels; political or regulatory developments; reservoir
performance; timely completion of development projects; technical or
operating factors; and other factors discussed under the heading
"Factors Affecting Future Results" in the Investors section of our

10-K. References to oil-equivalent barrels, oil, natural gas, natural

&lt;p&gt;  ATLANTA, GA, Jul 25 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
According to experts from Marshal's TRACE team, emails with exploitive
headlines mentioning George Bush, Microsoft and Al Qaeda in their subject
lines are part of a coordinated malicious spam campaign from criminals
controlling the Rustock botnet.

    The recent, large-scale campaign is designed to infect computers with
malware and convert them into part of the Rustock botnet -- and it is
succeeding, says Marshal. Over the last month, Rustock has grown to claim
second place among the largest spam producing botnets behind the Srizbi
botnet in first place. Rustock has increased its share of global spam
volumes from 10 percent in mid-June to 21.5 percent last week, according
to Marshal's TRACE statistics.

    Malicious spam, which is designed to infect computers with malware rather
than promoting a product, rose to an all-time high of almost 19 percent of
spam last week. In June 2008, malware spam surged to its previous highest
level of 10 percent, up from 3 percent where it had been steady since
February 2008.

    "This newest malicious spam campaign from Rustock stands out for two
reasons," said Phil Hay, lead threat analyst for Marshal's TRACE Team.
"First, it is a particularly good example of an arrangement of social
engineering methods designed to get you to lower your guard and infect
yourself -- it is easy to be taken in by it. Second, the scale of the
campaign is significant. In terms of volume, this is one of the biggest
malicious spam campaigns we have ever seen."

    Rustock's latest campaign exhibits a broader trend where spammers hack
into legitimate websites to host their malware. Numerous small businesses
and private websites have been targeted in this campaign, including a
badminton club in China and a hypnotherapist's site in the United States.
Hijacking legitimate websites and using them to host malware makes the
spammers harder to track and shut down with less evidence linking the
spammers to the malware.

    There is a range of messages being sent as part of the campaign, each with
a different news headline. Examples include:


--  "Bush Down to 8 Friends on Myspace"
--  "Yahoo sold to Microsoft, record price"
--  "Al Qaeda Reports Declining Revenues in Fiscal '08"
--  "Martian Soil Fantastic for Growing Weed Says Nasa"
--  "Obama Is Anorexic Over-Exerciser"
    

    
"Some of the headlines are hard to take seriously and some of them are
believably enticing," said Hay. "The Rustock spammers appear to be
experimenting to see which types of headlines solicit the most hits from
recipients. A common theme seems to be sensationalizing recent prominent
events such as Microsoft's bid to acquire Yahoo. Celebrities like Pamela
Anderson and Paris Hilton also feature as subjects."

    The body of the messages contains more sensational headlines -- usually on
a topic unrelated to the subject line -- and a URL link. The links
typically end with '/viewmovie.html', '/stream.html' or '/r.html'. If a
recipient clicks on one of these links, a webpage opens showing a fake web
video attempting to load and a popup window appears prompting the user to
install a file called 'codecinst.exe'. The file is malware. If it is
downloaded and installed it fetches a fake Windows XP anti-virus program
as well as the Rustock spambot itself. In addition to this threat, the
webpage opened by the link also contains JavaScript components designed
to exploit vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and download the malware
automatically.

    "The spammers appear to realize that recipients are wary of the dangers of
executable files in spam messages," said Hay. "They are trying to disguise
the installation of the executable under a believable pretext. It is quite
common today for people to receive news forwarded to them as links in
email. It is also quite common for those links to be related to hosted web
videos and for video players to require codec updates before they will
work. Even for security conscious users it is easy to fall for this one
and it appears that many have."

    Rustock is not a name many people are familiar with, but it is well known
within the security industry. Today it is one of the most established
spambots. It has been operating in various forms for more than two years,
is estimated to comprise over 150,000 infected PCs, and distributes close
to 30 billion spam messages daily.

    "Based on the way the volume of spam from Rustock has grown over the past
month, it is reasonable to conclude that the criminals behind it have had
great success infecting more PCs with this latest campaign," said Hay.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank JP Morgan (JPM.N) has held talks with potential partners about forming a consortium to break up British mortgage lender HBOS HBOS.L, The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National Australia Bank (NAB.AX), named by the Telegraph as a potentially interested party, played down the report, while a UK industry source said HBOS had not received an approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not sure this is a clever time to make acquisitions," NAB Chief Executive John Stewart told reporters on Friday, shortly after NAB announced a further A$830 million ($798 million) in losses from its exposure to U.S. mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without naming a source, the Telegraph said JP Morgan had also approached private equity firms and may talk to Spain's Banco Santander (SAN.MC) about a deal that would resemble the break up of ABN AMRO by a group of three banks last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAB could be a buyer of HBOS's Australian arm, Bankwest, and may also be interested in its corporate banking unit, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HBOS, JP Morgan, and Santander all declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have suggested that HBOS, Britain's biggest home lender, could make disposals to help absorb a potential rise in bad debts as the UK property market weakens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank earlier this month raised 4 billion pounds ($7.94 billion) through a rights issue aimed at shoring up its balance sheet, depleted by asset write downs and rising funding costs in the wake of the credit crunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's shareholders bought just 8.3 percent of the issue after HBOS' shares fell below the offer price of 275 pence, forcing underwriters to pick up the remainder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think anybody thinks HBOS is going to get bought. I think it's more likely that they would potentially sell bits," said Fox-Pitt, Kelton analyst Leigh Goodwin, who believes the cost of funding HBOS' core UK mortgage operation would deter potential acquirers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts reckon HBOS disposals could include Bankwest, asset management unit Insight, and insurance arm Clerical  Medical, as well as its 60 percent stake in UK life insurer St James's Place (SJP.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HBOS shares were down 3.8 percent at 290.5 pence by 1008 GMT on Friday, while the FTSE 100 share index was 0.73 percent lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Telegraph report said no consortium has been formed and talks could still fall through, while a break-up bid may meet opposition from UK regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A combination of HBOS's mortgage business and Santander's UK operations including Alliance  Leicester ALLL.L -- the British lender which last week accepted a 1.3 billion pound offer from the Spanish bank -- would control about 32 percent of the British home loans market, exceeding the competition authorities' 25 percent limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Paul Day in Madrid, Douwe Miedema and Clara Ferreira-Marques in London; editing by Sue Thomas)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jul 25 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced a unique analytical financial
transformation tool to help companies more effectively analyze and manage
the performance of a company's finance function. Developed by IBM
Research in conjunction with IBM Global Business Services, the Finance
Transformation Workbench tool (patent pending) uses advanced IBM patented
software and service methodologies to help Chief Financial Officers and
other senior finance executives identify underperforming finance
functions within their company and identify new opportunities to
transform and improve the finance function.

    Analysis has shown that traditional methods that companies employ to
improve their finance functions are often lacking in their ability to
effectively and accurately identify exactly where pain points and
redundancies occur within the finance organization. Finance functions need
to have access to key metrics and benchmarks in order for companies to
gain optimal financial performance. CFOs and other senior finance
executives need to have simple and standardized finance processes to make
fact-based decisions reduce finance costs and effectively partner with
business units to enhance growth opportunities through integrated
reporting and analytical capabilities.

    According to the recent 2008 IBM Global CFO Study, one-third of CFOs and
senior finance executives stated they are ineffective at measuring and
monitoring business performance. The study of 1,200 CFOs suggests that
current financial management models lack the effectiveness and flexibility
to accommodate the needs of global enterprises. The Financial
Transformation Workbench tool has been designed to address the CFO agenda
and help improve effectiveness of the finance function.

    "CFOs need quick access to the truth, they need process and data
commonality through enterprise standards to achieve higher levels of
efficacy," said William Fuessler, Global Financial Management Leader, IBM
Global Business Services. "The delay in understanding the true state of
the business can mean the difference between profitability and lost growth
potential. The Finance Transformation Workbench tool is yet another
example of IBM's high-value services proposition which automates
labor-based process and uses our Intellectual Property (IP) to create
repeatable software-like assets."

    IBM's Financial Management practice part of IBM Global Business Services,
developed the Finance Transformation Workbench tool to help company's
address key challenges in financial processes and data collection. By
using this tool, companies can diagnose and develop specific
opportunities to improve an organization's finance function and
ultimately the performance of the overall company. CFOs can examine which
finance functions and components are underperforming in comparison to
industry benchmark measures and the reasons why they are not performing
effectively.

    Specifically, the Finance Workbench tool can:


--  Analyze business performance
--  Identify underperforming finance functions and components
--  Identify transformation opportunities
--  Assess the business value of finance function transformation
    initiatives
--  Visualize linkages to various enterprise models
--  Pre-populate finance function benchmark data and process taxonomies
--  Leverage Finance Function best practices and methodologies
--  Focus on increasing revenues and reducing costs
    

    
From an organizational and financial systems perspective, by
investigating the organizational responsibilities and IT application
portfolio in relation to business components, shortfalls such as
duplications, over-extensions, gaps and deficiencies can be identified.
Using this tool, specific solutions can be discovered to address the
identified shortfalls. Financial benefits of implementing specific
solutions can be analyzed further by conducting a business case analysis.
The Finance Workbench dramatically improves the ability, accuracy and
speed with which an organization can do this.

    The Finance Transformation Workbench tool provides an integrated and
seamless view of various business models and financial data. These models
which are all linked together include: Finance Function component business
models, business process Taxonomies, (such as the American Productivity
and Quality Council Process Classification Framework) and organization
structure maps. The tool embodies a method for conducting this functional
analysis using a structured framework and approach to generate valuable
and actionable insights to finance executives. The tool is scalable and
customizable to an organizations needs.

    This Finance Transformation Workbench tool underscores the future of IBM's
services business. The services model of the future includes analytical
software coupled with high-value consulting services and world-class
research underpinning it. The future of services is about providing high
value services through the application of Intellectual Property assets in
an efficient, consistent and repeatable fashion. Software plays an
increasingly important role in the provision of consulting services, and
this tool supports IBM's strategy to provide high value Financial
Management Consulting services for our clients in an efficient and
consistently effective manner.

&lt;p&gt;PERTH/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - U.S. energy giant ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N) and partner BHP Billiton Ltd (BHP.AX) on Friday approved their A$1.4 billion ($1.35 billion) Turrum oil and gas project off Australia's southeast coast to meet rising domestic demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Turrum development holds reserves of about 1 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas and about 110 million barrels of oil and condensate, ExxonMobil, the world's largest oil company, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First oil and condensate production from Turrum was expected to begin in 2011 at about 20,000 barrels per day (bpd), while total gas sales would commence in 2015 at about approximately 200 million cubic feet (mcf) per day, Exxon said. The Turrum project, located in the Bass Strait off the southern coast of Australia, is the second oil and gas project committed to by the Exxon-BHP partnership in the past seven months, following the decision last December to proceed with the A$1.4 billion Kipper gas project also in Bass Strait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today's announcement means that we, with our joint venture partner, have collectively invested over A$3 billion in new oil and gas projects in Bass Strait in the last seven months," ExxonMobil's Australian Chairman Mark Nolan told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Development of Kipper and Turrum have, until recently, been held back because of low domestic prices. But rising gas prices in Australia's east coast and a projected gas demand growth of 3.8 percent a year through 2030 have improved the economics of these gas projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nolan said studies conducted by ExxonMobil have identified an additional 1 tcf of gas in and around its existing fields in the Bass Strait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Bass Strait has a strong long term future. We estimate that there is still about 7 tcf of gas still to be produced, and we are confident that means we have over 30 years of gas remaining," Nolan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Turrum project is part of the Gippsland Basin joint venture in which BHP and ExxonMobil's subsidiary, Esso Australia Resources Pty Ltd, each have a 50 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The venture currently produces about 130,000 barrels of oil and condensate a day, Exxon's Nolan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BHP said in a separate statement that it has approved an expenditure of $625 million for its share of development for Turrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BHP's share of capital costs for Turrum will bring its total current approved capital expenditure for its oil and gas business, which includes eight projects expected to come onstream between now and 2012, to $6.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in BHP were down 1.5 percent at A$37 by 9:52 p.m. EDT, compared with a 0.27 percent decline in the broader SP/ASX 200 Energy index .AXEJ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by James Grubel in Canberra; Editing by Michael Urquhart)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REDMOND, Washington (Reuters) - Chief Executive Steve Ballmer on Thursday defended Microsoft Corp's need to make heavy investments in its Internet businesses but said the company was "done," for now, with pursuing Yahoo Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There's nothing under discussion between the two of us," Ballmer told investors of how six months of various talks had reached an impasse earlier in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We had a set of principles, we talked about them, it didn't work out," he said. "Fine, we're done. We can move on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message for Microsoft's annual meeting with Wall Street analysts, an all-day affair at its headquarters in Redmond, Washington, was that it had a post-Yahoo plan to turn around its online services division and a strategy to take advantage of future opportunities, even as its Internet chief departs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is this huge, huge, huge new opportunity around the Internet and online and we have to embrace that opportunity and invest in that opportunity," Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft have fallen 8 percent over the last week since the company forecast an outlook below Wall Street estimates and revealed an additional $500 million investment into its online unit, even as it chalked up further losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charles Di Bona, a software research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said Ballmer's comments did not give enough details about how that additional investment will be spent and how the company arrived at that decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's spending $500 million dollars and then it says we'll tell you later how we'll spend it," said Di Bona, who has an "outperform" rating on Microsoft. "The market's concern is not about how it is running its core business. It's about decisions about larger chunks of money that people can't track."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said Microsoft is willing to endure online division operating losses that amount to between 5 percent to 10 percent of the company's total operating income, which reached $22.5 billion in fiscal year 2008, until the search and advertising business reaches "scale."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not specify on how long this period of losses would last, but said the risk was worth the potential return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's online division has posted eight straight quarters of losses. It lost $1.23 billion in the past fiscal year, twice as much as it had lost in fiscal 2007 and about 5.5 percent of Microsoft's total operating income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said its online businesses could eventually account for most of the economic value created by the world's largest software maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft CEO was left to describe Internet strategy after Microsoft announced one day before the analyst meeting that the head of that business, Kevin Johnson, was leaving. He will become chief executive of Juniper Networks Inc. "We thought it was important whoever was going to get up and talk about the big investment online was going to be here in three weeks and so you're stuck with me on this topic today," Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIG PLANS WITHOUT YAHOO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeking to show momentum in its existing Internet business, Microsoft announced that it had expanded its existing pact with Facebook, the world's largest social networking site, to provide Web search and search advertising in addition to its existing deal to run graphical display ads on Facebook pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Satya Nadella, Microsoft's senior vice president in its search and advertising group, said the expanded Facebook deal would be implemented in the next few months and "carry both our Web results, as well as our page search advertising."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said the new search advertising deal will be limited to Facebook's U.S. pages. The pact builds on a deal in which Microsoft invested $240 million last October in Facebook for a 1.6 percent stake, valuing the company at $15 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said its pursuit of Yahoo reflected the importance of Web search as the starting point for consumers to locate a growing range of digital media and e-commerce services from online video to shopping, which he estimated represented a $1 trillion business opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer described Yahoo, the world's second-largest provider of Web search and related advertising, as a quick way for Microsoft, a distant No. 3 player, to gain scale in order to compete more effectively with leader Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of our discussion around Yahoo centers as much on this issue as any other issue," he said, adding later: "This is a two-horse race. It is about Microsoft and Google."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell all but ruled out a full acquisition of Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The chances of us buying Yahoo on a full acquisition basis are so small that they are essentially negligible," said Liddell, adding that he never says never.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft walked away from a full acquisition, according to Liddell, because it saw Yahoo as a "declining asset" and its value continued to sink while it dragged its feet about accepting the offer from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liddell also said he is worried that by the time Yahoo comes around to accepting Microsoft's most recent proposal -- a bid to buy just Yahoo's search business that Yahoo rejected last month -- Microsoft will already be so far along in a strategy without Yahoo that it will no longer be interested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft fell 3.75 percent to close at $25.44 on Thursday following the departure of Johnson, announced late on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Eric Auchard in San Francisco; Editing by Phil Berlowitz and Braden Reddall, Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GENEVA (Reuters) - The United States, responding to a key demand of developing countries, said on Saturday it would discuss giving more temporary access to foreign professionals, injecting renewed optimism into world trade talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. offer -- its second this week in make-or-break talks to secure a breakthrough in long-running trade negotiations -- had ministers and businessmen talking optimistically about improved prospects for a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When it comes to temporary entry of business professionals we signaled that we are ready to have that conversation in the context of the Doha round," U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But obviously it has to be in conjunction with our consultations with Congress," she said after a session on services at the World Trade Organisation (WTO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue of granting temporary business visas to skilled foreign workers is controversial as many politicians consider it an immigration issue that should not be included in trade pacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Indian Commerce Minister Kamal Nath, who earlier in the week was blamed by many ministers for blocking the talks, welcomed the U.S. move and showed understanding for the needs of U.S. negotiators to coordinate with the U.S. Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONSTRUCTIVE SIGNS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are constructive signs," Nath told reporters. "There is good movement by the United States and by the EU."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Services such as banking, shipping and telecoms account for upwards of 75 percent of rich economies and a majority and growing share of many developing country GDPs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they still account for less than 20 percent of world trade. So rich nations with their sophisticated financial sectors and developing countries with their youthful educated populations believe the biggest gains from a trade deal could come in services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Saturday's meeting in which around 30 WTO players made broad offers on opening up their service sectors will color the negotiations on the core issues of this week's talks -- farming and industrial goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The signals that were sent were magnificent," said Mexico's ambassador to the WTO, Fernando de Mateo y Venturini, who chairs the services talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think in services things are moving fast. This is a very nice indication that things might move as well in the other sectors," he told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwab said she would have liked to have seen more on the table on financial services, a U.S. priority, but said the meeting was a "good step".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the main U.S. services lobby, which had been complaining for years about the neglect of services in the WTO talks, said Saturday's meeting had injected a "whole new dynamic".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a milestone," Bob Vastine, president of the Coalition of Service Industries, told Reuters. "We've never seen as much progress in services."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upbeat outcome of the services talks followed a sudden turnaround on Friday in the WTO talks, when predictions of their imminent collapse evaporated after seven key players drafted a compromise on the main industry and farming issues dividing rich and poor countries and importers and exporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Saturday Europe's trade negotiators won backing from most EU countries to press on with the Doha negotiations, but France, Italy and some others expressed concern about how the talks were shaping up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Doha negotiations for a global trade deal were launched in 2001 to boost the world economy and help fight poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are still potential potholes in the road ... But we are closer to a deal than we have been at any point in the last seven years," European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson told reporters on the sixth day of intensive talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without a breakthrough now, the talks risk being frozen for a further year or two while the United States and the European Commission change administrations and India holds elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tough negotiations on questions such as special treatment for developing country farmers and limits on the ability of poor countries to shield entire industrial sectors from opening lie ahead before a deal can be closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even if the core issues in agriculture and industry are resolved, festering disputes about cotton subsidies, the protection of place names linked with products, and bananas still threaten to derail the talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Doug Palmer; Editing by Giles Elgood)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, July 28 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded
shares in China COSCO (1919.HK), the country's largest shipping
firm, to a sell rating from neutral on Monday, citing an
oversupply of freight capacity in coming years and weaker
expectations for 2009 and 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in China COSCO lost 1.7 percent after the report,
underperforming a 0.6 percent gain on the index for Chinese
shares listed in Hong Kong .HSCE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. investment bank, which also downgraded STX Pan Ocean
(028670.KS) Malysian Bulk Carriers (MBCB.KL) and U-Ming Marine
(2606.TW) on Monday to sell from neutral, said freight rates will
decline with the global Capesize fleet set to double by 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We advise investors to sell bulker stocks now, well ahead of
the correction in the freight market and decline in earnings that
we anticipate from 2009 onwards," the bank said in a research
report on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman cut Pacific Basin (2343.HK) to neutral from buy and
sent the stock down 2.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Strong demand for energy and raw materials mainly from China
have sent freight rates to record highs in the past two years and
fuelled strong orders for new ships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sector's order book stands at a record and the Capesize
fleet, large bulk cargo ships that mostly carry iron ore and
coal, is set to double by 2011, which implies very significant
downside risk to the freight market, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect the BDI (Baltic Dry Index) to decline 40 percent
year on year in 2009 and a further 47 percent in 2010," it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But there are bright spots among listed Asian bulkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman upgraded China Shipping Development's (600026.SS)
(1138.HK) yuan denominated A shares to buy from neutral as it is
more defensive with 60 percent of its revenue from domestic
shipping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also upgraded Precious Shipping (PSL.BK) to buy from
neutral because of its more attractive valuation relative to
peers and on expectation of greater forward fleet coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China Shipping edged up 0.83 percent in Hong Kong at 0316 GMT
and Precious Shipping also rose 1.6 percent.

&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Stan Lee, the former 
Marvel Comics mastermind, and the Walt Disney Company are 
looking to a time machine to take them to the future of comic 
books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Together they're launching "Time Jumper," a franchise 
featuring a cell phone that makes it possible to go back in 
history, as a digital comic book that will play out on multiple 
platforms. Lee's POW! Entertainment will also see an extension 
to the first-look deal it signed with Disney in June 2007, 
covering all media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I am honored to be in association with Disney, not only 
through the extension of our original deal, but also in 
breaking ground by creating a new superhero," said Lee, who on 
Friday will tout "Jumper" at Comic-Con, the annual 
comics-related event in San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The franchise will be brought to life through collaboration 
by several Disney divisions, including home entertainment, 
online and publishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Jumper" is the latest high-profile example of the trend in 
digital comics, which activate the traditionally static 
panel-based art with moving graphics. Warner Bros. recently 
released "Mad Love," an online companion to the film "The Dark 
Knight"; in August, MTV Networks will unveil "Invincible," an 
adaptation of the Image Comics title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - China's financial hub, Shanghai, is
restricting the issue of business visas, underlining the
lengths to which authorities are going to keep out unwanted
foreigners ahead of the Beijing Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Business groups have already complained about tightened
visa policies ahead of the August Games, which have included a
ban on citizens of 33 countries applying for Chinese visas in
Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Shanghai Foreign Economic Relations and Trade
Commission said it will postpone approval of notification
letters needed for business visas till mid September for all
but essential travel, ruling out visits to carry out
inspections, market research and training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The South China Morning Post on Thursday cited unnamed
sources as saying that authorities in Beijing also have similar
curbs, as have Qingdao, Shenyang and Qinhuangdao -- all of
which will host some Olympic events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Foreigners coming to Shanghai on important business before
then need to get the Chinese organisation that is inviting them
to give detailed supporting documentation, the city commission
said in a notice posted on its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At the same time, (they) should try their best to limit
the number of people coming and the amount of time they spend
in Shanghai," the commission said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said the curbs were being introduced on orders from
above and were meant to "ensure the smooth hosting of the
Olympics and safeguard the city's social stability during the
Olympics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beijing has defended itself against criticism over its
tighter visa policies, saying they are necessary to ensure
security during the Games and keep "hostile forces" out of the
country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But business consultants say the restrictions are starting
to hurt exporters, which in some cases are unable to finalise
contracts because their clients' inspectors are unable to get
into the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jason Subler; Editing by Alan Wheatley)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (For more stories visit our multimedia website "Road to

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Cazenove said on Monday that 
former Barclays Plc (BARC.L) finance director Naguib Kheraj 
will take over as its new chief executive in October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The investment bank said on Monday he will take up the 
position on October 6, filling the gap left at the helm of one 
of Britain's best-known corporate advisors since its last chief 
executive stepped down in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said Kheraj was well respected at Barclays and his 
resignation in October 2006 was a surprise but was partly 
blamed on the increasing regulatory burden on a finance 
director and limited chance to move up to chief executive in 
the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the time analysts said the well-connected Kheraj was 
likely to return to investment banking or private equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Cazenove was set up in 2005 by British brokerage 
Cazenove and U.S. investment bank JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cazenove is financial adviser to Barclays so Kheraj had 
links with JPMorgan Cazenove during the decade he spent at 
Britain's third biggest bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aged 44, he was Barclays finance director for three years 
and before that held senior positions at investment bank 
Barclays Capital and its wealth management and fund management 
arms. He was previously chief financial officer in Europe for 
Salomon Brothers (C.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Both we and our clients are very fortunate that he 
(Kheraj) will now be leading this firm as it consolidates its 
position as the UK's foremost investment bank and builds on its 
international franchise," JPMorgan Cazenove's chairman, David 
Mayhew, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mayhew, a Cazenove veteran who acted as the venture's chief 
executive while a successor was sought, added on a conference 
call with journalists that JPMorgan Cazenove had no job-cutting 
program in place and would continue to hire selectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many global banks have been reducing headcount since the 
credit crunch took hold last August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Cazenove declined to comment on Kheraj's salary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was paid over 5 million pounds ($9.9 million) by 
Barclays in 2007, mainly due to 4.9 million pounds for advisory 
work from May to December related to the failed attempt to buy 
Dutch bank ABN Amro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As finance director from January 2007 to March 2007 he 
earned 657,000 pounds in salary and bonus. He was paid 2.6 
million pounds in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also advises Britain's Financial Services Authority on 
supervision of banks. He has been in that part-time role since 
April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by David Holmes, Greg Mahlich)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS, Jul 28 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Dutch airline Martinair has chosen Getronics and IBM (NYSE: IBM) to
manage part of Martinair's IT organization. In terms of the five-year
agreement, Getronics and IBM will manage part of Martinair's front and
back office applications. From its Aviation Competence Center in
Amsterdam, IBM will also help the airline to develop new services that
will benefit its cargo and passenger customers. The joint contract is
worth 23 million euro, of which IBM will receive 6 million euro.

    "With Getronics and IBM, Martinair chose two 'best in class' parties,"
according to Martinair's Vice President Information Services, Rene Bos.
"Getronics' outstanding operational qualities in environment management
convinced us to choose them. IBM's innovative solutions and its knowledge
of the aviation industry played a large role. We have chosen the two
parties who scored highest for the criteria that are most important for
us: cost effectiveness, flexibility and aviation expertise."

    By outsourcing its IT infrastructure and application management, Martinair
will be able to focus on its core competences. As of October 1, Getronics
will take over the help desk function, via the Getronics Service Desk in
Beek as well as on-site at Martinair. IBM will take over Martinair's
application portfolio and will assist the airline with the development of
new services including RFID-based baggage handling and mobile e-business
solutions.

    Jos Schoemaker, Chief Operating Officer of Getronics: "We are looking
forward to the arrival of Martinair's ICT employees; they will bring an
enormous treasure trove of experience in and knowledge of the aviation
sector. In taking this step, Getronics confirms its ambition of expanding
its position within the aviation industry. In this sector, where
outsourcing is increasingly playing a more important role, Getronics is a
player to be reckoned with."

    Hans Deijkers, director of Travel and Transport Industry for IBM Global
Business Services, said, "Martinair will be able to leverage the knowledge
at the IBM Aviation Competence Center in the Netherlands, as well as our
global expertise. In addition, Martinair will benefit from the innovations
IBM has realized worldwide within the aviation sector."

    The agreement was signed in July 2008, and approximately 35 Martinair
employees will transfer to Getronics and IBM on October 1.

    About Martinair

    Martinair operates across the globe to more than 50 locations, having
international establishments from Hong Kong and Florida, and employing a

&lt;p&gt;MILAN (Reuters) - An Italian unit of the Greek bottler of Coca-Cola drinks, Coca-Cola Hellenic HLB.AT, is in talks to buy Italy's second-biggest bottler of Coca-Cola, Fanta and Sprite drinks, sources in both companies said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Italian Federation of Wholesale Beverage Distributors, Italgrob, said in a statement on Monday that Coca-Cola HBC, controlled by Coca-Cola Hellenic, is set to buy 100 percent of Socib SpA whose bottled Coke is sold in the south of Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We confirm that there are talks under way," the source at Coca-Cola Hellenic said declining to give more details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source at Socib also confirmed the talks were under way but "no decision has been made."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family-run Socib, the second-biggest Coke bottler in Italy with four plants and its own distribution network, had revenues of 260 million euros ($409.4 million) in 2003, according to its Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal, if it goes ahead, would weaken competition in the Italian beverage sector where Coca-Cola HBC has its own distribution network in the north of the country, said Italgrob Chairman Giuseppe Cuzziol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are talking about a new step in the policy of monopolization of the Italian market by the (Coca-Cola) company which acts either on the products' front or in distribution," Cuzziol said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Svetlana Kovalyova)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jul 28 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced it has opened three centers of excellence
in China, Mexico and India to provide clients with access to the latest
technologies and processes in banking, retail and service management
arenas.

    IBM's focus on emerging markets -- or countries with high economic growth
potential -- has accelerated. These countries represented 18 percent of
IBM's geographic revenue in the second quarter of 2008, and together grew
21 percent as reported. In addition, the Brazil, Russia, India and China
subset grew 31 percent in the second quarter and were led by explosive
growth in India.

    "These results demonstrate that IBM has the ability to thrive in emerging
markets," said Bruno Di Leo, IBM general manager, Growth Markets. "Our
continued investments give IBM a competitive edge; global reach and scale;
and services and products that deliver genuine value to clients wherever
they do business."

    Worldwide Banking Center of Excellence in China

    IBM today announced that it will establish a branch of its Worldwide
Banking Center of Excellence in Shanghai to support China's banking
clients and to address their issues in core banking systems and payments.
The Banking Center will bring together world-class business and technology
experts to design and implement next generation payment and core banking
systems for China's leading banks.

    The Banking Center of Excellence in China will be staffed with a worldwide
team of banking experts and leverage assets, infrastructures and deep
skills from across IBM to develop local banking value-add offerings, form
strategy for payment and core system renovation, and improve performance
and scalability of existing architecture. The center will offer high-end,
banking industry related expertise to tackle critical customer needs and
to bring global reach to the local banking clients. IBM's Worldwide
Banking Center of Excellence has already been working with many of the
leading banks in China to help modernize their back-office operations.

    With the IBM Worldwide Banking Center of Excellence in China and other
existing IBM resources such as the China System Center, the local banks
will benefit from IBM's ability to quickly assemble a targeted set of
skills, capabilities and business frameworks to meet the clients' exact
requirements -- from end-to-end services and technologies, industry
expertise, to Independent Software Vendors (ISV) collaboration. Banks will
work with experts from IBM and its ISV partners to leverage industry
standards including International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
messaging formats, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), IBM's world-class
middleware, and the discipline and models of Information Framework (IFW)
to support specific renovation solutions.

    The new Banking Center of Excellence in China will join an existing global
network of IBM banking centers that were established in 2007. The network
includes centers at IBM's Silicon Valley Lab in California, operated by
the IBM High Performance On Demand Solutions (HiPODS) Lab; the IBM
Poughkeepsie Lab in New York; the IBM Software Solutions Lab in Seoul,
Korea, Hanoi, Vietnam and Johannesburg, South Africa. Together, the
centers represent a multi-million dollar investment by IBM as a
commitment to help worldwide banking clients become successful.

    Guadalajara Retail Innovation Center

    IBM today announced the opening of its first retail innovation center in
Latin America, a cross-industry facility designed to help companies
enhance the shopping experience for consumers. The center provides
clients a place to learn about, create and test in-store retail solutions
that can help them build advocacy and loyalty for their brands. At the
new retail center, IBM will showcase some of its most advanced,
industry-leading, point-of-sale and self-checkout technologies in stores,
as well as in the mobile and e-commerce space.

    The Guadalajara Retail Innovation Center is equipped with a consolidated
and experienced team of consultants and professionals specializing in
meeting and evaluating client needs to achieve the best solution that
allows them to create demand generation and customer strategies. The GRIC
has a solutions center with demos, trend maps and solution briefings
through IT updates and proofs of concept, designed to provide live demos
of software, hardware and services solutions using last generation
technology.

    IBM Service Management Center of Excellence in India

    IBM previously announced the opening of the IBM Service Management Center
of Excellence in India which will act as the regional hub for IBM Tivoli
service management software and strategy. The Center has been designed to
develop specialized focus and skills in high value areas such as telecom,
security, automation and asset management. This first-of-its-kind center
has been established in Pune.

    The Center will be staffed by IBM Service Management experts from around
the world and will provide infrastructure and resources for enablement and
education; client engagement support to sales team and business partners;
and facilities for proof of concept, demos and workshops. It also will
offer certification and joint education programs with local universities,
access to industry models, best practices and proven methodologies based
on IBM's worldwide service management experience.

    IBM's approach to service management is based on delivering integration of
software and services to provide organizations better visibility into IT
assets and applications across an entire business, while also enabling
better security, compliance management and automation. Service management
addresses the uncertainty faced by organizations as they manage faster,
broader and more uncertain change. Built on an open, service oriented
architecture (SOA), IBM's approach to service management helps
organizations improve IT services and align them with business goals while
keeping costs low.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - China's capital city and Olympic host Beijing is not taking new measures to restrict business visas ahead of the Games, state media said on Monday, even though financial hub Shanghai is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business groups have already complained about tightened visa policies ahead of the August Games, which have included a ban on citizens of 33 countries applying for Chinese visas in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Commission said it would postpone approval of notification letters needed for business visas until mid-September for all but essential travel, ruling out visits for market research, training or to carry out inspections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The curbs were being introduced on orders from above and were meant to "ensure the smooth hosting of the Olympics and safeguard the city's social stability during the Olympics", the city commission said in a notice posted on its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Beijing has no such curbs, Xinhua quoted Zhao Hui, an official with the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, as saying. Hong Kong's South China Morning Post had said Beijing had introduced controls similar to Shanghai's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some foreign media reported that we had stopped issuing official invitation letters, known as notification letters, needed for business visas, but the fact is we never did so," Zhao said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We handled about 150 applications every day this month, up 52 percent as against the same period of last year," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the government has been restricting visas across the board as it seeks to ensure security over the Olympic period, saying the measures are normal ahead of such a big event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business consultants say the restrictions are starting to hurt exporters, which in some cases are unable to finalize contracts because their clients' inspectors are unable to get into the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Valerie Lee)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY and FREMONT, CA, Jul 28 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Rackable Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: RACK) today entered
into an agreement allowing Rackable Systems to offer IBM's
high-performance BladeCenter servers inside its ICE Cube(TM) modular data
centers. The ICE Cube will be outfitted with IBM's most rugged, high
performance BladeCenter systems for harsh environments and demanding
conditions.

    As part of this agreement, IBM BladeCenter will be the only blade server
platform available for custom ICE Cube implementations globally. IBM
BladeCenter integrates servers, networks, storage, and business
applications in a single, highly efficient system and is thus ideal for
packing large amounts of computing power into portable data center
environments.

    The ICE Cube modular data center solution will be outfitted with IBM
BladeCenter T or HT systems, which meet Network Equipment-Building System
(NEBS) Level 3/ European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)
requirements, so are ideal for use in telecommunications environments and
carrier facilities (1). The blades are designed to withstand extreme
environments where modular data centers are often deployed, such as remote
construction sites or oil fields.

    "Rackable Systems sees this strategic relationship as a further
opportunity to provide our customers with unique, built-to-order
solutions," said Mark J. Barrenechea, president and CEO of Rackable
Systems. "Including IBM BladeCenter in ICE Cube enables Rackable to
expand its market reach to new customers, new fault tolerant workloads
and new markets seeking products that meet NEBS requirements."

    Rackable is also joining Blade.org, the industry consortium driving open
innovation in blade-based solutions, and plans to contribute to
development and innovation around IBM's BladeCenter platform. IBM and
Intel took a unique approach in the blade server industry in 2004 by
opening the architecture and specifications of the IBM BladeCenter
system. This move enabled a growing community of over 500 technology
companies like Rackable to download the specifications for free, develop
products for the BladeCenter ecosystem and shape the direction of the
blade server platform.

    "IBM continues to forge agreements to expand the marketplace for IBM
BladeCenter. Today's announcement with Rackable Systems creates yet
another opportunity for customers to select BladeCenter and highlights
the industry leading density and energy efficiency BladeCenter provides,"
said Alex Yost, vice president of IBM BladeCenter. "Rackable Systems'
selection of IBM BladeCenter is further evidence of the primacy of
BladeCenter's design, strong customer demand for the product and IBM's
commitment to foster an open ecosystem around it."

    Rackable Systems' new ICE Cube with BladeCenter solution will enable users
to realize the benefits associated with ICE Cube in conjunction with those
offered by IBM's BladeCenter product line. The ICE Cube is available in
20- or 40-foot container sizes. BladeCenter-specific configurations of
ICE Cube will allow Rackable Systems' enterprise customers to reach
densities up to 1,344 dual socket, Quad core Intel(R) Xeon(R) blades, or
672 quad socket, dual core AMD Opteron blades.

    ICE Cube with IBM BladeCenter T and HT is available immediately and
offered worldwide by Rackable Systems and its channel partners. For more

&lt;p&gt;Multi-Lingual Information Kiosks Set-up around Beijing Capital
International Airport and Olympic Games Venues
BEIJING--(Business Wire)--
Visa, a worldwide partner of the Olympic Games, has launched 55
striking blue and white porcelain tourist information kiosks
throughout Beijing to provide multilingual information services to
cardholders and international visitors traveling to China for the
Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. The Visa kiosks - found at the Beijing
Capital International Airport (BCIA), Olympic venues and key tourist
and shopping areas - are created with the same blue and white brush
stroke and traditional signature seal designs found on dozens of
Olympic-themed Visa ATMs, making them easy for Visa cardholders to
recognize.

   Upon arrival at BCIA's newly-constructed Terminal 3, a Visa kiosk
will greet international visitors with information related to Olympic
events and venues, tourist attractions and Beijing's public
transportation facilities during the Games. In addition to the kiosk
found at Terminal 3, Visa has installed kiosks throughout BCIA
offering information about on-site emergency services should they lose
their Visa card or need medical assistance.

   Richard Chang, Executive Vice President and General Manager of
Greater China and the Philippines for Visa said, "This may be the
first visit to China for many of the visitors arriving for the Games,
and we recognize that with so many events happening in the 17-day
Games period, the public will need accurate information quickly and in
a language they know and understand. We worked with BOCOG to design
these eye-catching kiosks to ensure that visitors to the Games would
be able to easily identify these resources."

   Visa is a trusted travel resource for cardholders traveling
domestically or abroad, offering exclusive, travel-related benefits
such as Emergency Cash Disbursement and Travel &amp; Emergency Assistance
Services. To enhance cardholders' overall Olympic experience, Visa has
created the Visa Olympic Games Passport, an easy-reference travel
guide. The passport includes tips and recommendations to help
cardholders get the most out of their journey to Beijing. The Visa
Olympic Games Passport may be downloaded at :
http://sponsorships.visa.com/download/visa-olympic-games-passport.pdf

   Visa has been an official worldwide sponsor and the only card
accepted at all venues of the Olympic Games since 1986.

&lt;p&gt;July 28 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded Rowan
Co (RDC.N), a provider of contract drilling services, to
"neutral" from "underweight" on valuation and said it expects
potential positive catalysts for it over the next three months,
including potential success on the deep shelf Blackbeard well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although it does not expect the sale of LeTourneau, the
company's wholly owned manufacturing unit to create significant
economic value, the brokerage said a near-term announcement
would likely be viewed favorably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While J.P. Morgan expects potential success in several of
Rowan's niche assets, it estimates Rowan to generate very
little free cash over the next three years given higher capital
expenses devoted to jackup construction in a market that the
brokerage expects to decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the Houston, Texas-based company closed at $41.31

&lt;p&gt;Pivotal CRM 6.0 Offers Task-Based Navigation, Embedded Microsoft
 SharePoint and Office Applications, Easy Customization, Smart Client
  User Interface, High User Adoption and Low Total Cost of Ownership
HONG KONG &amp; ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
CDC Software, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CDC Corporation and a
provider of industry-specific enterprise software and services, today
announced the general availability of Pivotal CRM 6.0, a
newly-designed customer relationship management (CRM) platform based
on Microsoft.NET technology that provides task-based navigation,
embedded Microsoft SharePoint and Office applications, easy
customization, a smart client user interface, high user adoption and a
low total cost of ownership.

   Pivotal CRM 6.0 is a significantly redesigned platform that
provides users with out-of-the box, task-based navigation, forms and
portals that have the look and feel of Microsoft applications and
which have the ability to model complex workflow. Pivotal 6.0 is
highly-integrated with Microsoft Outlook (including calendaring, task
and email capabilities) within the platform, allowing users to
complete much of their daily work without having to leave their CRM
system. The new features of Pivotal 6.0 provide easier customization,
enhanced searching and reporting capabilities, the flexibility to
conform to an organization's way of doing business and ease of use,
all of which potentially results in increased user adoption and
overall higher worker productivity.

   A customer for more than six years, CareerBuilder.com, the
nation's largest online recruitment and career advancement source for
employers, recruiters and job seekers, is implementing Pivotal 6.0.
According to Mark Williams, CRM architect and team leader at
CareerBuilder.com, "I am amazed at how well Pivotal 6.0 integrates
with Microsoft Office, particularly with Outlook. I was able to
configure the new 'Links' feature to see my Pivotal contacts in
Outlook and easily got 'Activities' to show up in both places with
bi-directional synching. I think our users will love this
integration as it streamlines the processes on how the users interact
with the system and the Microsoft technologies they are already
familiar with using."

   Williams also noted, "The Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 integration
provides a flexible development platform for our technical team to
easily customize and extend Pivotal 6.0 quickly to the changing needs
of the organization. Pivotal 6.0's tight integration with Visual
Studio and the form designer are outstanding improvements over the
prior user interface versions. With this new toolkit, we can implement
user forms that are much more attractive and easier to use, which
should improve user adoption with our technically savvy sales reps.
Additionally, from a technological resource perspective, I believe it
will be easier to find professionals who know Microsoft.NET technology
and have a desire to work on a state-of-the-art enterprise development
platform."

   "Pivotal 6.0 illustrates our unwavering commitment to develop
innovative products that help protect customers' investments in CDC
Software technology, while directly addressing their industry-specific
business requirements," said James McDevitt, chief operating officer
of CDC Software. "Pivotal 6.0 offers customers a compelling CRM
solution that combines Microsoft's powerful .NET technology and
Pivotal CRM's superior performance, usability, flexibility,
interoperability, and industry-specific functionality."

   Pivotal 6.0 also embeds SharePoint, which enables companies to
easily deploy SharePoint Server 2007 with SharePoint Designer 2007 and
to implement a new feature in Pivotal 6.0 called SmartPortal, a
Pivotal portal which allows IT professionals to set-up pre-defined
portals by functional area. For example, a portal can be designed for
sales people, customer support representative and others specific to
groups within an organization. End users, including mobile users, can
then personalize their own home page by adding new web parts (which
can be defined by the customizer or imported from third parties,
including Microsoft) and modifying existing web parts, allowing users
to assemble their own, highly-personalized, relevant and visually
enhanced portal. With Pivotal 6.0's advanced web parts-based portal
options, enterprises can build role-based user interfaces and
functional tool groupings that enable different users to navigate its
repository of data more quickly and easily, minimize clicks and
maximize the amount of valuable data available on each screen. The
time and labor savings potentially can be significant since these
features should allow enterprises to only build a page one time, while
having it work for many different user groups and purposes.

   Pivotal CRM 6.0 is available now. CDC Software offers a migration
kit that automates much of the conversion and migration process from
earlier versions of Pivotal to help ensure customers can move to
Pivotal 6.0 as smoothly and cost-effectively as possible. The Customer
Management System and Pivotal for Financial Services applications are
available now on Pivotal 6.0 with other vertical-specific applications
to be rolled out over time.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters Life!) - Hong Kong Disneyland, which has struggled since opening in 2005, was all smiles on Wednesday after the government made it the sole beneficiary of an easy-visa scheme that could bring millions of tourists from mainland China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new initiative, which immediately drew accusations of administrative interference, will bring people from the neighboring city of Shenzhen who are not normally qualified to visit Hong Kong straight to the theme park and straight back again, Hong Kong media reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Under the pilot scheme, migrants living and working in Shenzhen will be able to join group tours to Disneyland without having to return to their home provinces to obtain travel permits," the South China Morning Post said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of Shenzhen's 16 million residents are migrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's second Magic Kingdom in Asia after Tokyo has missed attendance targets, prompting the Hong Kong government, a major stakeholder in the park, to brand its performance "unsatisfactory".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong government owns 57 percent of the park and Walt Disney Co. owns the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We see a lot of up side," said B.C. Lo, vice president for public affairs at Hong Kong Disneyland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan would boost attendance at first by about two to three tours a day, each including 40 to 100 people, he said. That number was not huge, but Disneyland saw the scheme as a foot in the door to other parts of Guangdong province, a magnet for laborers from other areas in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The goal is to expand," Lo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The park does not release daily attendance figures, but Lo said Hong Kong Disneyland could accommodate a maximum of 34,000 people at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charles Li Kui-wai, associate professor of economics and finance at City University, said there were many ways for Disneyland to promote itself to mainland visitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This interference by the government is not good," he was quoted in the Post as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Nick Macfie and John Ruwitch, editing by Miral Fahmy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings assigns an 'A+' rating to city of Fresno Joint
Powers Financing Authority (JPFA), California's approximately $21.3
million lease revenue bonds (master lease projects) series 2008E and
$3.5 million lease revenue bonds series 2008F (federally taxable). The
bonds will be sold through negotiation on or about August 6th.
Proceeds from the new issues will fund improvements to the Selland
Arena and other improvements in Fresno's (the city) convention center
facilities as well as a replacement chiller for City Hall.

   The Rating Outlook is Stable.

   Fitch also affirms the following ratings:

   --$139.4 million in Fresno Joint Powers Financing Authority, CA
outstanding lease revenue bonds series 2004A, B and C, 2006A and B;
2008A, B, C and D at 'A+'.

   --City of Fresno implied general obligation at 'AA-'

   --$159.8 million sewer system revenue bonds, 2008 series A at
'A+', and

   -- $100 million senior lien sewer system revenue bonds (closed
lien) 'AA-'.

   The Rating Outlook is Stable.

   The 'A+' rating reflects Fresno's consistently strong financial
results characterized by prudent management practices, above-average
reserves and sound lease structure balanced by economic concerns
regarding the severity and duration of the substantial housing market
declines and its economic impact. Fitch believes the city's strong
reserves and conservative spending patterns will aid in retaining a
sound financial position as rising mortgage delinquencies and home
foreclosures result in weak tax revenue performance. Fresno's economy
has diversified into health care, education and other service sectors,
but its role as an agricultural center still dominates.

   Fresno's economy is experiencing weakness after several years of
very strong gains, largely the result of severe distress in the
housing sector. Mortgage delinquencies (60 days or more) and home
foreclosures are rising rapidly, and construction employment fell
nearly 10% in 2007. The construction sector remains vulnerable to
further decline given the sector's still high level of employment (7%
of all jobs county-wide in 2007). The financial activities sector also
had a small employment decline. The city's unemployment rate has risen
dramatically in recent months, reaching 9.0% in May 2008, well above
the May 2007 rate of 7.5%. Meanwhile, the city's assessed valuation
(AV) for fiscal 2009 increased just 1.5% compared to the five year
average growth rate of 11.1%. This slowdown in the property tax base
reflects the slowdown in new construction as well as reductions in AV
due to market value reductions. Appeals may result in additional
adjustments to the city's tax base and related revenues.

   As the state's sixth largest city and an agricultural center, the
recent growth has added diversity to the city's economy, largely in
health care and other services. The county's job base rose 11% from
2001-2007, with only a slowdown during the nationally weak 2003.
Despite job losses in construction and financial activities in 2007,
total employment rose 1.2%. Through May 2008, growth in education and
leisure, retail and government employment offset losses in financial
activities and construction. The city's unemployment rate is typically
high, resulting from the large number of seasonal agricultural jobs,
but declined to 7.5% in 2006 from a 10-year high of 12.8% in 1998.
According to recent data, the unemployment rate is on the rise. The
city's downtown area has undergone significant development through
both public and private projects, including market-rate housing, a
regional medical center, federal courthouse, and multi-purpose
stadium.

   Fresno's financial operations are well managed, with conservative
revenue forecasting and cost control measures contributing to strong
year-end results. The city's general fund has run break-even or
operating surpluses in each of the last nine fiscal years, bringing
the 2007 fund balance to $59.6 million, a very high 24.1% of
expenditures and transfers out. The unreserved fund balance also is
high at $33.4 million, 13.2% of spending. Fitch views these levels as
prudent given the area's economic volatility and the fiscal strain
foreseen in the next few years. The unreserved balance includes a
designation for emergencies, which can only be used during times of
extreme financial distress or natural disasters. The city plans to add
to this amount in fiscals 2008 and 2009 despite budget pressures, and
keep the fund in excess of the council-adopted 5% policy.

   As a result of a 1994 pension obligation bond issue and moderate
benefits, the city's two pension systems are over-funded, which has
enabled the city's annual contribution to be paid from the actuarial
surplus until this year. The surplus also has funded a supplemental
benefits fund, which covered the retirees' health insurance costs. The
city's liability for other post employment benefits (OPEB) is valued
at $82.9 million, resulting from the implicit subsidy of retiree
premiums. The actuarial required contribution is $9.9 million, a
moderate rise from the $5.9 million spent on OPEB in fiscal 2007.
However, since the benefit is funded from a designated amount of the
actuarial surplus, the total cost is limited to available funds. Fitch
believes that the ability to eliminate this funding if no resources
are available may require trade-offs with labor groups.

   This transaction's legal provisions are sound and benefit from a
master lease structure that includes four series sold in March and
April, 2008. The leased assets consist of parts of a large city park
and five other essential city facilities, all of which have been in
use for several years. The leased assets have a combined market value
that equals the combined bond par.

   The city's economic growth has kept the debt burden to moderate
levels despite recent issuances. Overall debt now is $2,845 per capita
and 4.5% of taxable market value. Future debt needs appear manageable,
with the city working to identify revenue sources to be used to pay
some or all of the future debt service.

are available on the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jul 29 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced it will significantly increase product
lifecycle management (PLM) resources by offering clients access to nearly
3,000 PLM practitioners across its software, services, research and
development divisions.

    Companies continue to aggressively invest in areas such as new product
development. To help clients speed up new product introductions, IBM has
intensified its PLM resources to include:


--  Ten Global PLM Centers of Excellence.
--  A Dassault Systemes and IBM focused International Competency Center.
--  A team of more than 2,000 PLM service consultants and technology
    experts.
--  A group of 60 PLM industry experts as part of IBM's research and
    development organization.
    

    
IBM is also deepening its commitment to sell and support Dassault
Systemes (NASDAQ: DASTY) (Euronext Paris: #13065, DSY.PA) PLM software
offerings with the new V6 platform, which will help address a company's
PLM business process challenges of global product development and
manufacturing as
follows:


--  Global Collaborative Innovation - ENOVIA provides an integrated
    platform for the management of a product lifecycle and its related business
    processes.  PLM business processes include among many compliance and
    governance, global sourcing, and management of a product's intellectual
    property.  The V6 platform also incorporates 3DLive, a 3-D environment to
    search, communicate and collaborate on product and manufacturing data over
    the Internet.

--  Virtual Product Design - CATIA is a product definition and simulation
    offering that includes elements of a product's system architecture.  This
    architecture outlines the structure and behavior of a product including
    physical concepts, detailed mechanical shapes, and product behavior
    components.  Using advanced simulation techniques, these components are
    tested to help predict product behavior and optimize product design.

--  Digital Manufacturing and Production - DELMIA provides a process
    development and simulation environment to help maximize manufacturing
    production systems.  From 3D processes and resource planning solutions to
    virtual programs to help better assign manufacturing resources using
    virtual design tools, DELMIA helps companies deliver customized, lean
    manufacturing systems.

--  3D Virtual Product Documentation - 3DVIA includes web-enabled
    offerings such as 3Dvia Composer, for use in the definition of 3D annotated
    content for technical publications, manuals and work instructions.  This
    content can be delivered as part of web-based applications or traditional,
    document-centric applications.
    

    
"As a company that develops products across multiple geographical
regions, we seek to combine our collaborative development process, bill
of materials requirements and digitally designed models into one platform
that is easy to use and access," said Rick Sturgeon, executive director,
Global Engineering Operations, for the Automotive Experience business of
Johnson Controls, Inc.

    "In evaluating the Dassault Systemes' V6 portfolio, we see the promise of
a platform based on a much improved user interface and ease-of-use," added
Sturgeon.

     "Clients can bet on IBM's expertise to help them integrate PLM
applications into existing technology investments while ensuring that
products will be delivered on time," said Albert Bunshaft, vice president,
IBM Product Lifecycle Management.

    The Future of PLM

    IBM predicts the PLM segment will expand beyond the focus on engineering
software to a multi-disciplinary enterprise practice integrating the
following technology components:

    A Common Platform: A traditional PLM environment typically includes
anywhere from twenty to forty applications from authoring and simulation
to business applications such as enterprise resource planning tools.
Today's product development process requires careful orchestration of
mechanical, software and electrical components into an integrated system
often referred to as mechatronics. This orchestration takes place across
a supply chain of hundreds of partners and suppliers who require a
service oriented architecture (SOA) or common platform to make
information sharing easy.

    With Websphere Process Server, companies can build a SOA foundation to
help integrate PLM applications with legacy and enterprise business
systems.

    Dassault Systemes V6 applications are built on a SOA-compliant platform to
ensure open access and effective integration to enterprise applications.

    Tagging customer preferences in the Web 2.0 and virtual world:

    Social networking and business intelligence tools will become an integral
part of the PLM process. As companies aim to study market and customer
needs, designers can use web-based tools, such as web logs and wikis, to
collect user preferences.

    By providing IBM Lotus Sametime instant messaging capabilities such as
part of the Dassault Systemes V6 user interface, engineering teams can
instantly review and collaborate on product changes before resources are
expended on manufacturing.

    Second Life is emerging as an experimental design platform for industries
with short design cycles such as fashion retail. A retail designer can
use Second Life to test new concepts with consumers directly by quickly
producing virtual samples and sharing them with targeted communities. The
instant sharing of virtual samples will accelerate product feedback and
reduce the number of turned down, physical samples that often end up as
textile waste.

    IBM's PLM Centers of Excellence
(http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/22624.wss) comprise the
largest global network of PLM experts. In these Centers, companies can
safely test new PLM concepts and develop a PLM business strategy using
industry benchmarking studies to identify a company's current PLM
performance levels against competitors or partners.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Investors say it's a matter of time 
until deepening U.S. economic doldrums steal into the Magic 
Kingdom, but they expect Walt Disney Co to have mostly escaped 
their effects for the first half of calendar 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; As Disney reports its quarterly results this week, 
investors and analysts already are focused on the year's back 
half for signs that the company's astonishing profitability 
during the year-long economic downturn is faltering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street expects low-single-digit rises in profit and 
revenue for Disney's fiscal third quarter ended in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts, on average, expect Disney to post net earnings of 
60 cents per share and revenue of $9.14 billion, only slightly 
ahead of last year's quarterly EPS of 58 cents and revenue of 
$9.05 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said the true impact of souring consumer sentiment 
and falling disposable income on Disney may be masked by a 
number of factors that may narrow profits and depress revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The issues include a revenue deferral at ESPN, tough 
comparisons for the theme parks and movie businesses, and 
possibly higher costs at the consumer products division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Studios is expected to drag on overall company 
results, mainly because "The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince 
Caspian" failed to measure up to last year's blockbuster 
"Pirates of the Caribbean" sequel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The parks business, considered a consumer bellwether, is 
expected to post growth but will be compared against a 2007 
quarter that included an Easter holiday and record attendance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The parks have managed "stellar" results for two years, and 
the effects of high gasoline prices and a cut in airline 
capacity to Disney World resort in Florida may be unclear for a 
quarter or two, Caris  Co analyst David Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While global retail sales of Disney Consumer Products grew 
by 10 percent in fiscal 2008, profits may be squeezed by video 
game development costs and charges from retail stores Disney 
took over in May from Children's Place Retail Stores Inc, 
Standard  Poors Equity Research analyst Tuna Amobi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sports networks ESPN enjoyed strong ratings in the quarter 
from the National Basketball Association finals, Sunday 
baseball and racing's Triple Crown, but robust ad sales may be 
dampened by $120 million in revenue deferred to the fourth 
quarter, Amobi said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 'BODY LANGUAGE'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RBC Capital Markets analyst David Bank expects the stock 
price to follow the tone set by Disney executives on the 
post-earnings conference call on Wednesday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "For the quarter, I'm pretty confident," Bank said. "It's 
really what comes out of that call that's going to be 
interesting, the body language."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A positive word from Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs on 
Wednesday about advance hotel bookings and advertising sales 
could go far to re-energize shares that have dropped 11 percent 
from a quarterly high of $35, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The parks are really going to set the tone for the rest of 
the company. If the company reports the trends holding up in 
the parks, I think you could see the stock get a lift," said 
Amobi, who has a "strong buy" rating on Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The underlying trend of the parks is still healthy ... but 
the economic slowdown could potentially become more of a factor 
in the back half of the year," Amobi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts also are listening for weakness at ESPN, a main 
driver of its media networks business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If the advertising tone at ESPN changes dramatically, that 
would be something that we would be looking for," Bank said. 
"That would be a big negative."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's ABC broadcast networks also are expected to show a 
healthy increase in spot or "scatter" ad rates despite lower 
ratings, due to tight inventory in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "To our knowledge, scatter in the quarter was generally 
selling at a 10 percent premium to upfront because ABC was top 
rated," said Miller, who rates Disney "above average."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock has largely escaped a punishing of U.S. media 
stocks with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 12.4. Rival 
CBS Corp has dropped to 8.6 times estimated 2009 earnings, News 
Corp to 10.6 and Viacom Inc to 10.9. Only Time Warner Inc has 
bested Disney, with a multiple of 12.9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Gina Keating, editing by Gerald E. McCormick)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - China's financial hub, Shanghai, is
restricting the issue of business visas, underlining the
lengths to which authorities are going to keep out unwanted
foreigners ahead of the Beijing Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Business groups have already complained about tightened
visa policies ahead of the August Games, which have included a
ban on citizens of 33 countries applying for Chinese visas in
Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Shanghai Foreign Economic Relations and Trade
Commission said it will postpone approval of notification
letters needed for business visas till mid September for all
but essential travel, ruling out visits to carry out
inspections, market research and training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The South China Morning Post on Thursday cited unnamed
sources as saying that authorities in Beijing also have similar
curbs, as have Qingdao, Shenyang and Qinhuangdao -- all of
which will host some Olympic events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Foreigners coming to Shanghai on important business before
then need to get the Chinese organisation that is inviting them
to give detailed supporting documentation, the city commission
said in a notice posted on its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At the same time, (they) should try their best to limit
the number of people coming and the amount of time they spend
in Shanghai," the commission said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said the curbs were being introduced on orders from
above and were meant to "ensure the smooth hosting of the
Olympics and safeguard the city's social stability during the
Olympics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beijing has defended itself against criticism over its
tighter visa policies, saying they are necessary to ensure
security during the Games and keep "hostile forces" out of the
country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But business consultants say the restrictions are starting
to hurt exporters, which in some cases are unable to finalise
contracts because their clients' inspectors are unable to get
into the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jason Subler; Editing by Alan Wheatley)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (For more stories visit our multimedia website "Road to

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, Jul 29 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Bug-ridden, poor quality software costs businesses billions of dollars
annually* and the cost of identifying and repairing a software defect in
a product that is already being used by consumers can cost upwards of
$16,000** for each defect. Recognizing these challenges, IBM (NYSE: IBM)
is introducing new software that intelligently catches bugs and other
defects while software code is being written -- rather than after a
product that is powered by software has already been shipped to customers.

    Currently, most software developers test applications for defects right
before the application goes into production -- when 90 percent of the
software code is already written. The new IBM software -- IBM Rational
Software Analyzer -- scans software code for quality and defects before
the application is built, thereby reducing the amount of defects hitting
the marketplace by 15 to 20 percent.

    "The world is increasingly dependent on software, and in turn business
processes and new products represent the majority of new requirements
levied on development teams," said Daniel Sabbah, general manager, IBM
Rational Software. "Software project failures impact the bottom line and
as levels of complexity in software continue to rise, software developers
need to create more stable software in less time. This is the business
reality of software and systems delivery."

    Demand for on time and under budget IT projects is not a new phenomenon,
nor is the challenge of creating high caliber software code. IBM Rational
Software Analyzer will help companies produce higher quality software that
contains fewer bugs. The new software will also reduce the time
development teams spend on time consuming and error-prone manual testing
processes, allowing them to devote more time to building software
programs. For example, the new software has functions similar to a
grammar checker commonly found in word processing programs that can help
developers find code and style errors rather than grammar mistakes. The
new IBM software also provides suggestions on how to fix bugs.

    Built as a plug-in for the latest version of Eclipse, Eclipse version
3.3, IBM Rational Software Analyzer finds software errors, flags them and
makes suggestions, reducing time spent reviewing software code prior to a
software build. Similar to how an author follows rules and proofreads a
story to ensure it is understandable and cohesive, IBM Rational Software
Analyzer can automatically scan each line of code up to 700 times,
"grammar checking" the code before it goes into production. Just as in
book publishing, where there is a great need to catch mistakes before a
book appears in bookstores, the cost of identifying and fixing errors in
software code rises exponentially the further along a programmer is in the
development process.

    To be competitive in today's fast-paced business environment requires
increased visibility and automation of governance and compliance measures.
Software developers can use the new IBM software to provide insight to
their management team through detailed reporting on software code status
and to offer direction into governance and compliance of corporate coding
guidelines and requirements. IBM partners and customers can build an
adaptor to use the code scanning technology in IBM Rational Software
Analyzer to improve the code quality and development of their custom-built
offerings.

    IBM Rational Software Analyzer is currently available. Pricing for the
Developer Edition is US$3,500 per user while pricing for the Enterprise
Edition is US$50,000 per server with unlimited users.

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Plans for a long-discussed Disneyland park in Shanghai could include a major media agreement between Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and the Shanghai government that could give the company unrivaled access to the market, documents obtained by Reuters show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The joint venture agreement would give Disney a huge advantage over U.S. media rivals by allowing it to bypass foreign film import quotas and summer and holiday blackout periods, as well as television censorship, both imposed by the central government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While its rivals vie for the 20 slots allotted by the Chinese government each year to foreign films, Disney would be tasked with creating movies, TV and web fare to promote its brand, stories and characters to grow attendance at the Disney and Shanghai government-owned park, the documents show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has engaged in on-again, off-again talks for more than a decade with the Chinese government over plans to build a large theme park and hotel complex in the southern outskirts of Shanghai's Pudong district, where Fortune 500 companies like General Motors Corp (GM.N) have regional headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those talks were stalled by a Shanghai government scandal in 2006 and Disney's need to focus on Hong Kong Disneyland, which opened in 2005 to a string of operational problems and lackluster attendance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan documents came from a presentation given by Shanghai city government officials at a meeting in April with local entrepreneurs and scholars who were then asked how to improve the plan, a source familiar with the meeting said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two people familiar with the documents, who declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the situation, said that a legally binding final agreement would not be reached until some time after the Beijing Olympics in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One source also said that current talks are focusing on other issues, such as potential funding and profit sharing, rather than the media and marketing proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JOINT VENTURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Chinese know Mickey Mouse and the Disney brand through the limited number of movies and TV shows allowed into the country each year and through Disney retail stores, they are less familiar with the fairy tales and characters that populate the parks, Disney officials have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The documents call for Disney to receive a large stake in a joint venture that would manage the park. Under the joint venture, Disney would handle marketing and promotions in exchange for providing capital and technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai government-led local consortium, including some of the city's major developers, would provide land near the Pudong International Airport in exchange for its share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The joint venture would be controlled by the city government, which would have the right to appoint the general manager and other senior positions, according to the same sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement would give the joint venture the right to publish and distribute a Disney-branded magazine, and to produce animated films and television shows for local broadcast and cable TV that showcase both the Disney brand and the new park, the documents show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The content of the magazine, movies and TV shows, and breadth of distribution would have to be approved on a case-by-case basis by the central government and relevant ministries and regulators under Chinese rules, the documents showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney also would get help from the joint venture in opening the Chinese market to its films and other programming, and in return would help distribute Chinese-made fare in the United States and other countries, the documents show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement also calls for the joint venture to authorize local manufacturers to produce Disney-branded toys in China and sell them internationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final talks for a Disneyland park in Shanghai could be accelerated after the Olympics, as central government leaders in Beijing prefer keeping the global focus on China's booming economy and improving standard of living in major cities, one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has been in talks since 1994 over the Shanghai park and was close to a deal about two years ago, when the project was stalled by a corruption scandal that sidelined several top Shanghai government officials involved in the negotiations, two sources close to the deal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's U.S. entertainment rivals, including NBC Universal and Time Warner Inc's (TWX.N) Warner Bros, have held talks with the Shanghai city government in the past decade but could not iron out differences over concerns such as management control and copyright protection. NBC Universal is 80 percent owned by General Electric Co (GE.N) and 20 percent by Vivendi (VIV.PA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Chinese media reports that a deal is imminent, Disney parks spokeswoman Leslie Goodman said there has been "no agreement and no deal" to proceed with plans for a park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said in December of 2006 that the Shanghai park was "something that I think we'd like to see happen down the road" but that the "course ... (and) speed of that conversation" had been "impossible to predict."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, the company has made no official statement about the progress of talks except to shoot down talk of a deal, emanating mainly from the Chinese press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, Shanghai Mayor Han Zheng made a surprise announcement that the city had applied to the National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic planner, which directly reports to the cabinet, for approval to build a Disney theme park in China's financial hub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Disney allows several years to build its international theme parks, the company was planning to set up a "special mini park" first at the World Expo in Shanghai in 2010 to promote a formal Disney theme park to tens of millions of tourists expected to attend the event, according to one of the sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gina Keating and George Chen, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts with details from prosecutors about arrest, charges)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Martha Graybow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - A former JPMorgan Chase  Co
(JPM.N) private banking executive has been arrested in
Argentina on charges of embezzling about $5.4 million from bank
clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hernan Arbizu was charged in 15-count indictment unsealed
in U.S. District Court in New York. He was arrested on Monday
in Buenos Aires and is being held by Argentine authorities,
pending extradition, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The indictment contends Arbizu, 41, engaged in a scheme to
withdraw funds from bank customers without their knowledge
through the use of unauthorized wire transfers. The U.S.
government is also seeking the forfeiture of the roughly $5.4
million it contends was embezzled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The name of Arbizu's attorney was not immediately
available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said in a statement it "appreciates the
cooperation and the prompt joint action of the Argentine and
American authorities." It said it could not comment further
because of a pending court case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, the investment bank's JP Morgan Securities unit
sued Arbizu, accusing him of sharing sensitive information with
other firms. The court papers in that case said Arbizu had
lived in Connecticut while employed by JPMorgan as a vice
president in the private banking division, but fled to
Argentina before being fired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Arbizu had been responsible for handling business involving
high-net-worth individuals in Argentina and Chile, the lawsuit
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to the criminal indictment, Arbizu initiated or
helped initiate 12 unauthorized wire transfers from private
banking clients at JPMorgan and UBS AG (UBSN.VX) between March
2007 and April 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was charged with 12 counts of wire fraud, one count of
embezzlement by a bank employee, one count of bank fraud and
one count of identity theft. He could face as much as 30 years
in prison if convicted.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, July 29 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L)
and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) have dropped plans to sell British
biofuel additives producer Infineum, the companies said on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobile Chemical and Shell Chemicals announced in March
that they were reviewing strategic options for the Infineum
additives business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The companies confirm that this (strategic review) has been
completed and the conclusion from this study is for the
shareholders to retain the business," the companies said in a
statement on Tuesday.
 The two companies were expecting bids in June through
sell-side adviser JP Morgan but bids failed to meet expectations
and the bidders failed to secure firm financing, banking sources
said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The deal is dead. Shell pulled the sale when the price was
nowhere near expectations around two to three weeks ago," a head
of loan syndicate said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The failure of the sale is further evidence of the
difficulties experienced recently in financing leveraged buyouts
in Europe's troubled leveraged loan market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) dropped the sale of its French
private clinics operator Vitalia when bids failed to meet
expectations, 3i Group Plc (III.L) pulled the sale of its Nordic
healthcare company Ambea in June for the same reason and
numerous other sales including that of Italian fashion house
Roberto Cavalli have been cancelled or delayed by adverse loan
market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shell and Exxon were looking for a bids of around 2 billion
pounds for Infineum, their 50-50 performance fuel joint venture,
with a debt financing of around one billion euros (800 million
pounds), bankers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "One billion euros of debt was too big for the loan market
in the cyclical sector that Infineum operates in," a senior
banker close to the deal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Bankers said private equity firms interested in bidding,
which included  Apollo Management, Carlyle Group [CYL.UL],
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts [KKR.UL], Cinven [CINV.UL] and Vestar,
had approached many banks to counter tough loan market
conditions, but lenders became nervous and the situation
unravelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "None of the bids came in with committed financing -- they
didn't get a firm bid effectively -- the banks all got cold
feet," a second syndicate head said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oxfordshire-based Infineum employs 1,600 people globally. It
is among the world's largest manufacturers and marketers of
petroleum additives for the fuels and lubricants industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by David Holmes)

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former JPMorgan Chase  Co private banking executive has been indicted on charges of embezzling about $5.4 million, according to federal court papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The indictment, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, accuses former executive Hernan Arbizu of 15 criminal counts. Arbizu was arrested on Monday in Argentina, according to a person close to the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indictment contends Arbizu engaged in a scheme to withdraw funds from bank customers without their knowledge through the use of unauthorized wire transfers. The U.S. government is also seeking the forfeiture of the roughly $5.4 million it contends was embezzled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of Arbizu's attorney was not immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said in a statement that it "appreciates the cooperation and the prompt joint action of the Argentine and American authorities. However, the firm is unable to comment further due to pending litigation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, the investment bank's JP Morgan Securities unit sued Arbizu, accusing him of sharing sensitive information with other firms. The court papers in that case said Arbizu had lived in Connecticut while employed by JPMorgan, but fled to Argentina before being fired in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arbizu had been responsible for handling business involving high-net-worth individuals in Argentina and Chile for JPMorgan, the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Martha Graybow, editing by Gerald E.

excited about the trip," Short said.

   "We're pleased to be able to participate in the Visa promotions.
It's a win-win situation for everyone involved; our members, our
credit union and our employees," said Thomas Alter, USA Credit Union
executive vice president. "It's a great opportunity to re-educate
employees on our credit card product offering so they can assist our
members more efficiently. These programs also offer our employees an
opportunity to win a trip of a lifetime that they may otherwise never
experience."

   "Visa has been a proud sponsor of the Olympic Games for more than
two decades, and this promotion brings our partnership to life for our
cardholders," said Antonio Lucio, chief marketing officer of Visa Inc.
"A cornerstone of our Olympic sponsorship is the opportunity we give

&lt;p&gt;Industry-Leading Project is Fifth Major Startup of 2008
IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) announced that its affiliate
has commenced operations of a $1.3 billion project in Nigeria to
produce and sell natural gas liquids, providing a new source of energy
and economic benefits while reducing environmental impacts. Operated
by Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited, an ExxonMobil affiliate, the
East Area Natural Gas Liquids II project involves the recovery of 275
million barrels of natural gas liquids from associated gas produced in
East Area reservoirs from Blocks OML 67, 68 and 70.

   Major components of the project include an offshore natural gas
liquids extraction complex, more than 125 miles (200 kilometers) of
new natural gas and natural gas liquids pipelines and expansion of the
existing onshore Bonny River Terminal for fractionation of the liquids
into commercial products and offloading. The natural gas liquids
project is part of an integrated approach to significantly reduce
flaring in conjunction with the existing East Area Additional Oil
Recovery project. The projects will significantly reduce flaring and
improve oil recovery through reservoir pressure maintenance. In
addition, the East Area NGL II project will produce at its peak about
50,000 barrels of natural gas liquids per day. It is designed to
ultimately recover 275 million barrels of natural gas liquids and
utilize 950 million standard cubic feet of gas daily.

   "The East Area NGL II project was completed ahead of schedule with
outstanding safety performance and demonstrates ExxonMobil's ongoing
commitment to helping meet the world's growing need for energy. In
addition, this project represents the first time a major oil and gas
joint venture in Nigeria has completed a financing package exclusively
through Nigerian financial institutions," said Mark Albers, senior
vice president of Exxon Mobil Corporation.

   "Working together with the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation, we were also able to integrate innovative technical
solutions into the project execution plan to significantly reduce
flaring and maximize the value of the resource for our shareholders
and the country of Nigeria."

   The East Area NGL II development continues Mobil Producing
Nigeria's tradition of strengthening and expanding the capabilities of
Nigerian companies, which provided in-country fabrication, logistics
support and other services, as well as training and development of
employees and contractors. These companies were involved in
construction of the Bonny River Terminal expansion, installation of
pipelines and fabrication of components for the offshore complex.

   A key part of NGL II development's national content strategy
included the use of funding from Nigerian banks. Approximately $220M
of the total project financing was completely arranged through
Nigerian banks.

   The natural gas liquids project follows the successful start-up of
the East Area Additional Oil Recovery project in June 2006. Together,
the two developments provide for recovery and commercialization of
associated gas streams in the field and gas injection into existing
reservoirs for recovery and production of additional oil volumes.
These projects significantly reduce routine flaring, which helps meet
the environmental stewardship goals of ExxonMobil and Nigeria.

   The project is located approximately 17 miles (28 kilometers)
offshore Nigeria and on Bonny Island, Nigeria. Mobil Producing Nigeria
(51 percent interest) is operator of the project with co-venture
partner Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (49 percent).

   The startup of the NGL II project brings the total of ExxonMobil
worldwide startups to five this year, including Kizomba C Mondo
(Angola), Volve (Norway), Starling (U.K.) and ACG Phase 3
(Azerbaijan).

   CAUTIONARY STATEMENT: Estimates, expectations, and business plans
in this release are forward-looking statements. Actual future results,
including resource recoveries, production rates, and project plans and
schedules, could differ materially due to changes in market conditions
affecting the oil and gas industry or long-term oil and gas price
levels; political or regulatory developments; reservoir performance;
timely completion of development projects; technical or operating
factors; the outcome of commercial negotiations; and other factors
discussed under the heading "Factors Affecting Future Results" in the
Investor Information section of our website (www.exxonmobil.com) and
in Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K. References to quantities of
gas and natural gas liquids include volumes that are not yet
classified as proved reserves but that we believe will be produced in
the future.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY and PISCATAWAY, NJ, Jul 29 (MARKET WIRE) --

Researchers at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New
Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School have selected a high
performance IBM (NYSE: IBM) computer to perform research they hope will
one day lead to more effective treatment of medical conditions like
infertility and thyroid problems.

    According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than two
million married couples in the U.S. are infertile; and many millions of
Americans are affected by problems associated with the thyroid gland --
including weight gain, weight loss, depression, and fatigue -- though many
may be unaware of the cause.

    The UMDNJ researchers are using the IBM system to create models of
proteins and study the behavior of certain types of sensory molecules,
called receptors, which regulate fertility and thyroid function. These
receptors are related to a family of proteins that perform diverse
functions ranging from detecting light and odors, to controlling blood
pressure and regulating heart function.

    While the types of receptors being studied make up a large number of the
molecules found in the human genome, and are common targets for drug
treatments, very little is known about how they work at the molecular
level. By learning more about this, the researchers at UMDNJ hope to
discover how different types of drugs might be used to treat certain
medical conditions more effectively.

    Using the high performance IBM system, which has a peak speed of one
teraflops (one trillion floating point operations per second), the UMDNJ
researchers are able to dramatically accelerate the pace of their work.
Calculations that would have normally taken them a year to complete on a
single workstation can now be done in just four days.

    Currently, the only way to view the makeup of a protein is through a
50-year-old process called X-ray crystallography, which involves
crystallizing the protein and using a beam of X-rays to get an image --
called a crystal structure -- of the positions of the atoms within it.
However, the receptors being studied at UMDNJ are membrane proteins and,
due to the difficulty of crystallizing this type of protein, crystal
structures exist for only two molecules of this entire family of related
proteins. Furthermore, because crystal structures provide only a snapshot
in time, it has been difficult for researchers to understand how these
types of receptors work.

    To get around this problem, the UMDNJ researchers are using the IBM
computer, an e1350 Linux cluster composed of System x3550 servers and 96
processors, to run a program called Amber that was designed by researchers
at the University of California. Amber works by moving the simulated atoms
of a receptor hundreds of thousands of times per second, many times over,
until the researchers get a better idea of how the receptor is likely to
react to other molecules. This process requires computational capabilities
far exceeding those of traditional computers.

    "The type of research we're performing is very unique, and it requires
some pretty mind-boggling calculations that could have never been done on
our older systems," said Les Michelson, PhD, assistant director for
special projects at UMDNJ.

    Also involved in the project is John Kerrigan, PhD, associate director of
bioinformatics at The Cancer Institute of New Jersey, which is a Center of
Excellence of UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. He says, "With the
power of our IBM system, we're gaining new insights into how these complex
molecular switches known as receptors function. The computer models help
guide experimental design in the lab as well as generate new hypotheses."

    "With its significant price/performance advantages and simplified
management capabilities, the e1350 Linux cluster is the ideal high
performance computing platform for the ambitious and important work being
done by the researchers at UMDNJ," said Dave Turek, vice president of deep
computing at IBM.

    The researchers have chosen to focus first on receptors that affect
fertility and thyroid function because of the amount of biological
information that already exists, and because of the prevalence of those
problems.

    Additionally, because the receptors that control reproduction and thyroid
function have features that are common to other receptors, the UMDNJ
scientists hope their research will also provide insights into the
functions of this large receptor family. This could help uncover better
drug treatments for medical conditions unrelated to thyroid function or
infertility.

&lt;p&gt; (Refiles to remove extraneous word in sixth paragraph)
 (Recasts; adds details)

 July 29 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs began coverage of the
U.S. specialty apparel sector, which includes Gap (GPS.N),
Aeropostale (ARO.N) and Ann Taylor Stores (ANN.N), with a
cautious view as it believes the sector faces a major execution
risk and weak consumer spending amid challenging macroeconomic
conditions.

 "Significantly less diversified assortments, coupled with a
highly fragmented competitive landscape, make apparel retailers
much more vulnerable to fashion misses," analyst Michelle Tan
wrote in a note to clients.

 Tan believes this execution risk is not fully reflected in
the stocks and several retailers were seeking to "become
something they're not" in response to strong competitors and
continued macroeconomic pressure.

 "Things are already pretty bad, but they can get worse,"
the analyst said.

 Tan, who started Ann Taylor Stores with a "sell" rating,
said she fears efforts to modernize the Ann Taylor division
with more relaxed wear-to-work assortments will stray too far
from the division's heritage.

 But she gave Aeropostale a "buy" rating as she believes
current estimates and shares do not fully reflect the company's
unique opportunity to capitalize on the current environment.

 The following table lists the rating and price target
assigned by Goldman to the companies:

&lt;p&gt;NTRglobal On-Demand Delivery Models Featured in Microsoft-Sponsored Report on the Current and Future State of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)

   SaaS is "Thriving" and Companies Like NTRglobal That Provide Both
    On-Demand Remote Support/Administration behind the Firewall and
 Self-Hosted Are Best Positioned to Serve Global Market Needs, Report
                               Concludes
DALLAS &amp; BARCELONA, Spain--(Business Wire)--
Today there is an 'on-demand' component to "just about every
software product, and the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) delivery model
is gaining traction among midsize and large enterprises," Bob Tarzey,
research director at analyst firm Quocirca, said in a new report
entitled, On Premise and On Demand.

   "The companies best positioned to serve both the large enterprise
and small and midsize business (SMB) marketplaces offer both SaaS and
premise-based or self-hosted software and services," he added in the
comprehensive report sponsored by Microsoft.

   Among those innovative companies, NTRglobal, market leader of
enterprise-grade SaaS with NTRsupport(TM) end-to-end support services
and NTRadmin(TM) remote administration and IT task management
solution, was featured as offering both models to its more than 14,000
global customers.

   Large and Midsize Enterprises Turning To SaaS or Hybrid Models

   "Large and midsize companies want the ability to choose on-demand
capabilities that offer the utmost security, scalability and control
to meet compliance regulations," said Lluis Font, CEO of NTRglobal.
"Our mission is to help our customers 'manage the seemingly
unmanageable' with NTRsupport and NTRadmin to enhance productivity
while reducing operational complexity and costs. We are finding that
customers that initially sought on-premise are increasingly turning to
a SaaS or a hybrid approach."

   Quocirca, a primary research and analysis company specializing in
the business impact of information technology and communications,
interviewed industry leading SaaS and on-demand providers, independent
software vendors (ISVs), IT vendors and managed service providers
(MSPs) to report the following trends:

   --  SaaS has matured to such an extent that there is now an
        on-demand component to most software applications, whether it
        is online help, automated updates or the main application
        engine. But many vendors believe that to provide a
        satisfactory end-user experience, a desktop component is often
        needed.

   --  The need to link with self-hosted components "extends beyond
        the desktop to legacy software maintained internally and as
        business processes that span organizations."

   --  On-demand delivery is attractive to businesses because it
        helps them manage costs and provides high availability and
        flexible access. "Paying monthly fees out of operational
        expenditure for on-demand applications with high availability
        guaranteed gives businesses of all sizes the confidence and
        flexibility to embed them in critical business processes," the
        report says.

   --  Many new independent software vendors (ISVs) are building in
        on-demand components from the start.

   --  Existing ISVs are making the move to on-demand too, but they
        face additional challenges in adopting new business models and
        coping with the changes in cash flow and expectations of
        stakeholders that this entails.

   "Customers are telling us that the return on investment is so
significant that they wish they had moved to NTRsupport sooner," said
Eduardo Cervantes, NTRglobal CMO. "In the enterprise, customers
appreciate the security, reliability, redundancy and scalability we
deliver. However, flexibility is key, and for the organizations that
want a self-hosted model, we offer that option as well," Cervantes
added.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jul 29 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today released results from its X-Force 2008 Midyear
Trend Statistics report that indicates cyber-criminals are adopting new
automation techniques and strategies that allow them to exploit
vulnerabilities much faster than ever before. The new tools are being
implemented on the Internet by organized criminal elements, and at the
same time public exploit code published by researchers are putting more
systems, databases and ultimately, people at risk of compromise.

    According to the X-Force report, 94 percent of all browser-related online
exploits occurred within 24 hours of official vulnerability disclosure.
These attacks, known-as "zero-day" exploits, are on the Internet before
people even know they have a vulnerability that needs to be patched in
their systems.

    This phenomenon is being driven by sophisticated cyber-criminals' adoption
and evolution of automated tools for creating and delivering exploit
tools, as well as the lack of a set protocol for disclosing
vulnerabilities in the research industry. The practice of disclosing
exploit code along with a security advisory has been the accepted
practice for many security researchers. However, according to the X-Force
report, vulnerabilities disclosed by independent researchers are twice as
likely to have zero-day exploit code published, calling into question how
researchers practice vulnerability disclosure and signifying the need for
a new standard in the industry.

     "The two major themes in the first half of 2008 were acceleration and
proliferation," said X-Force Operations Manager Kris Lamb. "We see a
considerable acceleration in the time a vulnerability is disclosed to when
it is exploited, with an accompanying proliferation of vulnerabilities
overall. Without a unified process for disclosing vulnerabilities, the
research industry runs the risk of actually fueling online criminal
activity. There's a reason why X-Force doesn't publish exploit code for
the vulnerabilities we have found, and perhaps it is time for others in
our field to reconsider this practice."

    Key findings from the X-Force report include:


--  Browser plug-ins are the newest target-of-choice. The threat landscape
    has evolved from the operating system to the Web browser to browser plug-
    ins. In the first six months of 2008, roughly 78 percent of web browser
    exploits targeted browser plug-ins.

--  One-off manual attacks are growing into massive automated attacks.
    More than half of all vulnerability disclosures were related to web server
    applications. Structured Query Language (SQL) injection vulnerabilities, in
    particular, jumped from 25 percent in 2007 to 41 percent of all web server
    application vulnerabilities in the first half of 2008, and corresponded
    with a rash of automated attacks that compromised servers in an effort to
    compromise more endpoint systems.

--  Spammers go back to basics. The complex spam of 2007 (image-based
    spam, file attachment spam, etc.) has almost disappeared and now spammers
    are using simple URL spam. This spam generally consists of a few simple
    words and a URL, making it difficult for spam filters to detect.
    Approximately 90 percent of spam is now URL spam.

--  Russia continues to be origin of most spam. Russia is responsible for
    11 percent of the world's spam followed by Turkey with 8 percent and then
    the United States with 7.1 percent.

--  Online gamers are targets. As online games and virtual communities
    continue to gain popularity, they are becoming an enticing target for cyber-
    criminals. The X-Force report indicates that the top four password-stealing
    Trojans were all aimed at gamers. The goal is to steal gamers' virtual
    assets selling them for real money in online market places.

--  Financial institutions remain key targets for phishers. All but two of
    the top 20 phishing targets were financial institutions.

--  Secure virtualization grows in importance. Virtualization-related
    vulnerability disclosures have tripled since 2006 and are likely to
    increase as virtualized environments become more widespread.

&lt;p&gt;  HOUSTON, TX, Jul 29 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Idera, a leading provider of management and administration solutions for
Microsoft Windows, today announced the beta release of its Point admin
toolset, 10 tools that simplify the management and administration of
Microsoft SharePoint. The tools lessen the administrative overhead and
knowledge needed to ensure the effective operation of SharePoint, the
fastest growing content management system. The Point admin toolset is the
only suite of tools that brings together SharePoint performance and
availability management, site management, server management and security
management in a single, unified toolset.

    "Systems administrators are continually being asked to manage more
applications in their already complex environments and SharePoint is being
adopted at record rates," said Rick Pleczko, President and CEO of Idera.
"The Point admin toolset takes 10 essential management and administration
tasks, and automates them. This frees up time and reduces the amount of
knowledge needed to manage SharePoint, so administrators can truly take
advantage of all SharePoint has to offer."

    Microsoft SharePoint has quickly become the most used collaboration and
content management environment and is critical to many organizations. The
Point admin toolset reduces the time spent on administrative duties from
hours to minutes while enhancing the operational efficiency of the
SharePoint environment.

    "Many of our clients are deploying SharePoint, but because it is used by
many people in the organization and requires extensive know-how to
operate, it requires careful management," said Alan Hopp, general manager
of ePartners, a leading business and technology consultancy and a
Microsoft Gold Partner. "Idera's Point admin toolset is based on
real-world customer needs and provides our clients with the tools
necessary to manage SharePoint so they can focus on how it can help their
business."

&lt;p&gt;An Affordable, Collaborative Communications Solution for SMBs
RALEIGH, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
BizCom Web Services, Inc., a leading provider of enterprise-class
Internet hosting solutions, today introduced its Hosted Microsoft(R)
Office Communications Server (OCS) 2007 service. Offered as an add-on
to BizCom's Hosted Exchange Service, this winning combination of
advanced communications functionality and outsourced management gives
small- to medium-sized businesses the ability to implement a fully
unified, enterprise-class communications platform for minimal cost.

   "In today's extended workplace, productivity and efficiency depend
on fast, reliable, and secure communications," said Don Rodger, Vice
President of BizCom Web Services. "With OCS, mobile workforces can
instantly connect and collaborate with local and remote team members,
confer with customers and partners, and contact suppliers-without
putting sensitive business information at risk."

   Microsoft's OCS enables real-time communications, including
enterprise-class secure instant messaging, software-powered Voice over
IP (VoIP), and audio and video web conferencing. It also powers
presence, a key benefit that unites all the contact information stored
in Microsoft(R) Exchange to enable real-time employee monitoring and
communication. This, coupled with BizCom's Hosted Archiving Solutions,
is truly a breakthrough in state-of-the-art communications systems.
However, SMBs are typically discouraged by issues of price, complex
software &amp; back-end requirements, and administrative learning curves.

functionality of this versatile collaboration tool for a fraction of
the cost and without all the headaches that come with in-house
ownership and management. Key benefits include:

   --  Instant remote communication with other organizations and
        users - Use an Internet connection to send secure instant
        messages from outside the corporate firewall-eliminating the
        hassles of a Virtual Private Network (VPN).

   --  Secure collaboration - Safely share applications from work or
        home with encrypted instant messaging; maintain tight control
        over intellectual property and sensitive information with
        server-based audit logs.

   --  Total visibility - Determine users' online availability with a
        single mouse click.

   --  Robust, flexible development platform - Create and customize
        innovative real-time applications that can be easily adapted
        to changing business needs.

   "By integrating OCS with BizCom's Hosted Microsoft Exchange 2007
service, businesses can capitalize on all the technology advances that
fuel the efficiency, productivity, and revenue growth of today's
leading corporations," said Mark Wiener, President of BizCom. "In
addition, BizCom's Hosted Exchange servers are hosted in a fully
redundant infrastructure that is reliable, scalable, and secure and
comes with a 99.99% uptime guarantee."

   Price and Availability

   Hosted OCS 2007 plans are currently available for as little as
$7.95 per user/per month, as an add-on to users of BizCom's Microsoft
Hosted Exchange service. For the latest information on pricing and

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jul 29 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
To help people remember key facts, today IBM (NYSE: IBM) unveiled a
software technology created in its Research Labs that uses the images,
sounds, and text recorded on everyday mobile devices to help people
recall names, faces, conversations and other important information.

    Watch the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVdsvMzV1E

    The technology, nicknamed "PENSIEVE" by the IBM team, uses associative
recall to make connections between pieces of related data acquired by a
person. The advantage of the new technology is its ability to understand
the context in which data is captured, then connect various data, and then
use this knowledge to help bring the correct information to a person when
it is needed.

    "This is like having a personal assistant for your memory," said Dr.
Yaakov Navon, the lead researcher and image processing expert from IBM's
Haifa Research Lab. "Our daily routines are overflowing with situations
where we gain new information through meetings, advertisements,
conferences, events, surfing the web, or even window shopping. Instead of
going home and using a general web search to find that information,
PENSIEVE helps the brain recall those everyday things you might normally
forget."

    Today's mobile devices have an endless number of functions that can record
data in real time. IBM's new software blends techniques from image
processing, GPS information, smart clustering, optical character
recognition, speech recognition, and information retrieval to index and
tag the information.

    Researchers at IBM's Haifa Research Lab in Israel are pairing advanced
mobile technologies with memory cues to develop a system that can analyze
acquired data, create hooks to related experiences, and use them to
populate a person's information management applications. Once the address
books and calendars are updated, the technology enables memory recall
triggered by time, location or the introduction of related information.

    For example, if you meet someone at a conference and use your phone to
take a picture of him or her and another picture of that person's
business card, the new technology will associate the two pieces of data
because they were taken at the same time and location. It then creates a
virtual briefcase of data that includes the person's image, the name of
the conference where you met, the date and time, and any other relevant
data.

    The knowledge base is unique in its ability to integrate contextual
information with image, time, and location data. Prior to a future meeting
with the same person, you can be prompted by your calendar to review your
notes about that person, along with other facts you may have recorded or
items the system associated for you.

    This year, for the first time ever, more people in the world will have a
mobile phone than a land-line. Mobile phones already double as music
players, video players, game devices, and calendars. And while using
mobile phones to take photographs and record sound or video bites is
common practice, much of this data tends to get stored away on the device
with little information attached to it, rendering it of little value for
future use. To address this, IBM recently launched a new initiative to
bring even more features and functions to the mobile phone.

    Many people encounter situations where you have been introduced to someone
but you can't quite recall how you know them. By simply typing the
person's name into PENSIEVE, you can recall when and where you met them,
and any related information garnered at that time. You could even browse
forwards or backwards in time to find out what events transpired before
or after the initial meeting.

    Another use of this technology is in reconstructing and sharing an
experience or memory. If enough media-rich data was collected about a
particular event, it can be used to build a more complex visual
associative representation of the experience.

    "This is where the real power of collaboration kicks in," said Eran
Belinsky, research team leader and a specialist in collaboration. "You can
recall the name of the person you met right before you entered a meeting
by traversing a timeline of your experiences, or share a business trip
with colleagues by creating a mashup that shows a map with an animation
of your trail and the pictures you took in every location."

    This technology builds on IBM Research's expertise in image processing,
speech recognition, information discovery and retrieval, collaboration,
and much more.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jul 29 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
To help people remember key facts, today IBM (NYSE: IBM) unveiled a
software technology created in its Research Labs that uses the images,
sounds, and text recorded on everyday mobile devices to help people
recall names, faces, conversations and other important information.

    Watch the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOVdsvMzV1E

    The technology, nicknamed "PENSIEVE" by the IBM team, uses associative
recall to make connections between pieces of related data acquired by a
person. The advantage of the new technology is its ability to understand
the context in which data is captured, then connect various data, and then
use this knowledge to help bring the correct information to a person when
it is needed.

    "This is like having a personal assistant for your memory," said Dr.
Yaakov Navon, the lead researcher and image processing expert from IBM's
Haifa Research Lab. "Our daily routines are overflowing with situations
where we gain new information through meetings, advertisements,
conferences, events, surfing the web, or even window shopping. Instead of
going home and using a general web search to find that information,
PENSIEVE helps the brain recall those everyday things you might normally
forget."

    Today's mobile devices have an endless number of functions that can record
data in real time. IBM's new software blends techniques from image
processing, GPS information, smart clustering, optical character
recognition, speech recognition, and information retrieval to index and
tag the information.

    Researchers at IBM's Haifa Research Lab in Israel are pairing advanced
mobile technologies with memory cues to develop a system that can analyze
acquired data, create hooks to related experiences, and use them to
populate a person's information management applications. Once the address
books and calendars are updated, the technology enables memory recall
triggered by time, location or the introduction of related information.

    For example, if you meet someone at a conference and use your phone to
take a picture of him or her and another picture of that person's
business card, the new technology will associate the two pieces of data
because they were taken at the same time and location. It then creates a
virtual briefcase of data that includes the person's image, the name of
the conference where you met, the date and time, and any other relevant
data.

    The knowledge base is unique in its ability to integrate contextual
information with image, time, and location data. Prior to a future meeting
with the same person, you can be prompted by your calendar to review your
notes about that person, along with other facts you may have recorded or
items the system associated for you.

    This year, for the first time ever, more people in the world will have a
mobile phone than a land-line. Mobile phones already double as music
players, video players, game devices, and calendars. And while using
mobile phones to take photographs and record sound or video bites is
common practice, much of this data tends to get stored away on the device
with little information attached to it, rendering it of little value for
future use. To address this, IBM recently launched a new initiative to
bring even more features and functions to the mobile phone.

    Many people encounter situations where you have been introduced to someone
but you can't quite recall how you know them. By simply typing the
person's name into PENSIEVE, you can recall when and where you met them,
and any related information garnered at that time. You could even browse
forwards or backwards in time to find out what events transpired before
or after the initial meeting.

    Another use of this technology is in reconstructing and sharing an
experience or memory. If enough media-rich data was collected about a
particular event, it can be used to build a more complex visual
associative representation of the experience.

    "This is where the real power of collaboration kicks in," said Eran
Belinsky, research team leader and a specialist in collaboration. "You can
recall the name of the person you met right before you entered a meeting
by traversing a timeline of your experiences, or share a business trip
with colleagues by creating a mashup that shows a map with an animation
of your trail and the pictures you took in every location."

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, July 30 (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co (DIS.N)
has offered to refinance more than $300 million in commercial
loans due on Sept. 30 for its Hong Kong Disneyland joint
venture, but has met with resistance from its partner, the Hong
Kong government, a Disney spokesman said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In a financial filing on Wednesday, Disney disclosed that
it has been in talks with the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region over financing arrangements to allow its newest park to
pay off the commercial loans of about $329 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In talks with the Hong Kong government, Disney "has
expressed its willingness to replace the facilities with loans
from the company" and "to provide additional investment" in the
park, which has been criticized as too small to draw long-term
stays and repeat business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Disney has not reached an agreement with the joint
venture to resolve the loan, raising the possibility that the
joint venture would turn instead to a tight commercial credit
market for potentially onerous terms and saddling the company
with potentially unfavorable financial disclosures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company was "disappointed that both shareholders in the
joint venture hadn't yet been able to reach an agreement,"
Disney spokesman Jonathan Friedland said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney believed its loan offer would give the joint venture
"financial breathing room" needed to maintain the Hong Kong
park's recent operational gains and set it on a firm financial
footing, Friedland said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are totally confident and committed to the continued
growth of Hong Kong Disneyland as a premiere tourist
destination in the region, demonstrated by the company's offer
to assume the loan," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year, the joint venture was forced to amend its loan
agreements after the Hong Kong park failed to meet semi-annual
performance targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The amended agreement removed the performance targets and
decreased the amount of a revolving credit facility but also
shortened the loan due date to Sept. 30, 2008, from Oct. 15,
2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As part of that amendment, Disney waived management fees
and deferred royalties for fiscal 2008 and 2009 to support the
park, whose attendance has lagged expectations since its 2005
opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 310-acre (126-hectare) park is expandable to a total of
457 acres (185 hectares) to accommodate future phases,
according to Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Hong Kong government, which owns 57 percent of the
park, has taken political heat for the park's missed attendance
target and has branded its performance as "unsatisfactory."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The park became the sole beneficiary this week of an
easy-visa arrangement that could bring millions of visitors
from mainland China who are not normally qualified to visit
Hong Kong.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) said park bookings were flat and it had detected weakness in advertising sales in the current quarter, sparking fears that U.S. economic woes will hit its results and sending its shares down 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entertainment conglomerate had earlier on Wednesday reported a fiscal third-quarter net profit that beat analysts' estimates by a hair, rising 8.5 percent on one-time gains and strength at its media networks, including sports channel ESPN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caris  Company analyst David Miller said the company "overall did very well", adding that investors may have been spooked by the ad sales slowdown at ESPN and wondering "when is this economic slowdown going to hit the parks, if at all?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter net income rose to $1.28 billion, or 66 cents per share, from $1.18 billion, or 57 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 2 percent to $9.24 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earnings, excluding a 4 cent gain from the acquisition of the Disney Stores in North America, the sale of Movies.com and a favorable resolution of prior-year tax matters, beat Wall Street's average estimate of 61 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Robert Iger said on a conference call with analysts that the company continued "to be pleased with the level of business activity we have seen ... and especially with our long-term market position."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney shares ended the June quarter down 11 percent from quarterly highs of about $35, as investors worried about the effects of high fuel costs and economic pressures on consumers and the company's theme parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think the forward-looking comments they made were discouraging, everything put together," Standard  Poors Equity Research analyst Tuna Amobi said. "I don't share the sentiment that things are going awfully wrong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOLIDAY CHEER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theme parks posted a 5 percent rise in revenue and 3 percent gain in operating profit, driven by strong performances at Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Resort Paris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attendance dropped 1 percent at domestic parks, offset by a rise in average guest spending. Hotel occupancy at U.S. resorts dropped to 92 percent from 93 percent a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said hotel bookings at U.S. parks were flat in the current quarter, but "modestly ahead" of last year in the holiday quarter ending in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said pricing for booked rooms "at this point are at or above the prior year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger said diminished airline capacity to Orlando, Florida, had not affected Disney World attendance at all, "nor do we envision, in the near term anyway, that it will be a factor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media networks had 8 percent revenue growth and a 9 percent rise in profit last quarter. Contractual rate increases from pay-TV operators and subscriber growth at ESPN and the worldwide Disney Channel accounted for most of the 12 percent revenue increase at the cable networks, while programming and other costs rose 9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2 percent revenue increase in broadcasting revenues, due to higher international sales of TV shows and higher online and other revenue mainly at Club Penguin, offset lower ad revenue at Disney-owned TV stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staggs said the pace of ad sales "has slowed somewhat in recent weeks" at ESPN and, to a lesser extent, its broadcast network due to softness in the auto, financial services and consumer electronics segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staggs said, however, that spot or "scatter" ad sales were pacing "well ahead" of advance sales in the current quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studio entertainment, whose disappointing "The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian" promised to drag on company results, saw quarter revenue drop 19 percent and operating profit fall 49 percent because of tough comparisons with last year's blockbuster "Pirates of the Caribbean" sequel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from consumer products rose 20 percent, mainly due to the acquisition in May of the Disney Stores in North America, but lower sales of self-published video games led to a 4 percent decline in operating profit in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video game business also suffered from difficult comparisons between sales of "Prince Caspian" and last year's "Pirates of the Caribbean" games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staggs said the company expects to see a "modest" reduction in profits for the rest of this year as a result of its reacquisition of Disney Stores in North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney shares fell 2.5 percent to $30.86 in extended trade from a $31.67 close, reversing its regular-session gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N), the world's largest credit card network, said on Wednesday that quarterly earnings rose 41 percent, beating estimates, as credit and debit card processing volume jumped globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results were better than the average forecast of analysts, according to Reuters Estimates, and the company's shares edged higher in after-hours trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors are watching credit card processors closely for evidence that slowing economic growth is weighing on results. Visa makes money from processing transactions and does not lend, making it immune to credit concerns, but exposed to overall spending volume, whose growth could slow if the economy weakens enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offsetting the potential for spending volume to slow is the fact that more consumers globally, particularly in the developing world, are embracing credit and debit cards for everyday spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Visa continues to ... benefit from the global migration to electronic payments," Joe Saunders, Visa's chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa said payments volume grew 19 percent for the quarter ended March 31. Volume in that quarter translates to revenue in the quarter ended June 30. Growth came from the U.S., but also Asia and Latin America, among other places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that growth, Visa boosted its forecast for operating margins for the year to the mid-to-high 40-percent region, compared with its prior estimates of the low 40 percent area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa said net income for the fiscal third quarter ended June 30 was $422 million, or 51 cents per class A share, compared with pro forma results of $299 million in the same quarter a year earlier, when the company was privately held.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding litigation, restructuring and other expenses and items, the company earned 59 cents per class A share, compared with analysts' average forecast of 50 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total operating revenue rose to $1.61 billion from $1.37 billion in the same quarter a year earlier. International transaction fee revenue rose 44 percent to $449 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa shares rose 1.6 percent to $79.70 in after-hours trade. The company's shares trade at about 30 times expected fiscal 2009 earnings, a significantly higher multiple than the broader market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa went public in March at $44 a share in the biggest U.S. initial public offering ever, and has since risen about 78 percent while the Standard  Poor's 500 index .SPX is essentially unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Dan Wilchins; Editing by Ted Kerr, Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - China's financial hub, Shanghai, is
restricting the issue of business visas, underlining the
lengths to which authorities are going to keep out unwanted
foreigners ahead of the Beijing Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Business groups have already complained about tightened
visa policies ahead of the August Games, which have included a
ban on citizens of 33 countries applying for Chinese visas in
Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Shanghai Foreign Economic Relations and Trade
Commission said it will postpone approval of notification
letters needed for business visas till mid September for all
but essential travel, ruling out visits to carry out
inspections, market research and training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The South China Morning Post on Thursday cited unnamed
sources as saying that authorities in Beijing also have similar
curbs, as have Qingdao, Shenyang and Qinhuangdao -- all of
which will host some Olympic events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Foreigners coming to Shanghai on important business before
then need to get the Chinese organisation that is inviting them
to give detailed supporting documentation, the city commission
said in a notice posted on its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At the same time, (they) should try their best to limit
the number of people coming and the amount of time they spend
in Shanghai," the commission said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said the curbs were being introduced on orders from
above and were meant to "ensure the smooth hosting of the
Olympics and safeguard the city's social stability during the
Olympics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beijing has defended itself against criticism over its
tighter visa policies, saying they are necessary to ensure
security during the Games and keep "hostile forces" out of the
country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But business consultants say the restrictions are starting
to hurt exporters, which in some cases are unable to finalise
contracts because their clients' inspectors are unable to get
into the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jason Subler; Editing by Alan Wheatley)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (For more stories visit our multimedia website "Road to

&lt;p&gt;Asia Pacific Leading in Deployment of Funds Transfer Between
Cardholders
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa today announced the extension of the Visa Money Transfer
service to millions of cardholders. With the launch of Visa Money
Transfer in Indonesia and the expansion of a program in Singapore,
Visa is making it easier and more secure for people in 13 countries in
Europe, the Middle East and Asia to send and receive funds.

   Visa Money Transfer, a card-based service enabling a Visa
cardholder to send funds conveniently and securely to another Visa
cardholder, debuted in Ukraine in 2003. Since then, the service has
been extended to tens of millions of people who no longer need to wait
at a money transfer agent's office, but instead can use the
convenience and security of their 16-digit Visa account number to send
and receive money. Depending on their issuing bank, they can execute
the transfer at a bank branch, using the internet, via an ATM or
self-service kiosk.

   "Visa's growth has been the result of an unwavering commitment to
finding innovative ways to use our network and products to make
payments more secure and more convenient," said Elizabeth Buse, Visa's
global head of product. "Our approach to person-to-person payments and
remittances is to use our global technology to create tailored
solutions for various countries and apply what we've learned to expand
the service worldwide."

   The demand for money transfer includes domestic remittances,
person-to-person payments and remittances by expatriate workers who
continue to have commitments in their home countries. The World Bank
has reported that workers' remittances around the world were US$240
billion in 2007.(1) In addition to cardholder convenience, money
transfer programs enable financial institutions to better meet the
needs of their existing customers.

   Asia Pacific Expansion of Visa Money Transfer

   Bank Mandiri, Indonesia's largest bank, made Visa Money Transfer
available to approximately eight million Mandiri Visa Debit
cardholders in June. The service allows Mandiri Visa Debit cardholders
to send money through any of the bank's 3,000 ATMs to any other Visa
cardholder in Indonesia. Recipients are able to use the money to make
purchases, pay bills or withdraw cash from any Visa or PLUS ATM
anywhere Visa is accepted in the world.

   Singapore Post Limited, (SingPost), became the first post office
in the world to offer a Visa Money Transfer service when it rolled out
a program to all of its 51 branches earlier this year. Today, just
four months after introduction, SingPost is expanding the service to
enable customers to remit funds through more than 60 SingPost
automated machines, making it possible for customers to send money 24
hours a day, seven days a week. The SingPost service facilitates money
transfer from customers in Singapore to Visa cardholders in nine
countries around the world - Australia, China, India, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and the United Kingdom.

   In India, the largest remittance recipient country in the
world(2), Visa Money Transfer has gained critical mass since its
introduction there in 2004. Fourteen banks offer domestic Visa Money
Transfer programs to more than 60 million Visa cardholders across more
than 150 cities and towns in India.

   Visa Money Transfer Momentum

   Since 2003, a total of 46 Visa Money Transfer programs have been
rolled out in the following 13 countries - France, Georgia, Greece,
India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Russia, Singapore, Sweden,
Switzerland, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates. While the Asia Pacific
region is leading the deployment of new Visa Money Transfer programs,
significant momentum has been gained in Central Europe and the Middle
East.

   Examples of other innovative Visa remittance programs include:

   --  United Arab Emirates: Since 2006, Visa has worked with a
        National Bank of Abu Dhabi to fully manage a Web-based,
        domestic and cross-border Visa Money Transfer program,
        providing ease of deployment and faster time to market for the
        bank.

   --  Russia: In 2008 alone, ten new Visa Money Transfer programs
        have launched in Russia. Beginning in 2006, banks in Russia
        offered the first Visa Money Transfer programs providing
        services at ATMs. Today 16 banks offer domestic money transfer
        and card account repayment services at over 5,000 ATMs,
        enabling consumers to send money to any of the Visa card
        accounts in Russia.

   --  Ukraine: In 2003, Privatbank launched the first Visa Money
        Transfer service as a pilot program where the money transfer
        was offered at bank branches. They continue to be a pioneer by
        offering web-based, cross-border Visa Money Transfer service,
        using Verified by Visa to authenticate senders.

   --  Kazakhstan: In April 2007, four banks launched the first 24/7
        cross-border Visa Money Transfer service at ATMs with Halyk
        Bank leading the way. The transfer funds are sent to Visa
        cards all over the world with the most favorite destinations
        being Russia, China, United Kingdom, Israel, Germany and South
        Africa. Halyk's service is now being extended to a mobile
        channel where senders can initiate transfers from their mobile
        phone via text message.

   Global Expansion of Visa Money Transfer

   Visa's goal is to utilize its global processing platform and
payments network to make money transfer between the 1.6 billion Visa
cards around the world safe, convenient and reliable. To this end,
Visa is continually enhancing existing programs and developing new
services. Work underway includes technology infrastructure
improvements to support global processing of card-based remittances,
and to open new channels through which remittances can be sent and
received, including through financial institution branches, the
internet, mobile devices and Visa's global ATM network.

   As a global company, operating the world's largest electronic
payments network, Visa Inc. is uniquely positioned to deliver flexible
services that meet the demand for money transfer services and to
support the introduction of Visa Money Transfer service to new
geographies in key domestic and cross-border money transfer corridors.

&lt;p&gt;Tribal Leaders Say Oil Giant Disrespects "Rule of Law," Plan Trip
                  to Washington to Meet with Congress
QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
Leaders from Ecuador's rainforest, suing Chevron over the "Amazon
Chernobyl", are accusing the oil giant of misleading the Bush
Administration and Congress to escape a potential $16 billion
liability in an environmental lawsuit.

   The indigenous leaders - from the Cofan, Secoya, and Siona tribes
- are planning a trip to Washington, DC in September to talk directly
with Members of Congress and the office of the U.S. Trade
Representative.

   "We are coming to tell the truth about Chevron's desperate attempt
to quash the legal claims of thousands of vulnerable people in the
Amazon rainforest who are struggling to survive due to oil
contamination," said Pablo Fajardo, the lead Ecuadorian lawyer for the
plaintiffs.

   "These people deserve their day in court without interference from
Chevron," he added. "Chevron must respect the rule of law."

   In March of this year, a court-appointed special master in the
lawsuit found that environmental damage and other damages in the case
amounted to between $7.2 billion and $16.3 billion. As the sole
defendant and the party found by the special master to be responsible
for the contamination, Chevron would have to pay 100% of the damages
if the judge accepts the report.

   A final decision in the case, which could lead to the largest ever
damages award in an environmental lawsuit, is expected next year.
Chevron already had agreed to submit to jurisdiction in Ecuador and be
bound by the court's decision when years ago it requested the case be
transferred out of U.S. federal court.

   The damages report prompted Chevron to disclose the liability to
its shareholders for the first time, and to hire a slew of Washington
lobbyists who have dedicated themselves to trying to block the
extension of U.S. trade preferences for Ecuador. Luis Gallegos,
Ecuador's U.S. ambassador, has said a failure to extend the trade
preferences by the end of the year would cost the country 350,000 jobs
and force 1.2 million people into poverty.

   Among the lobbyists hired by Chevron are former Senators John
Breaux and Trent Lott, and Mac McLarty, former White House Chief of
Staff in the Clinton Administration. Their work has been focused on
Ambassador Susan Schwab, the United States Trade Representative; key
Members of Congress; and John Negroponte, Deputy Secretary of State.

   Fajardo said the aim of Chevron's lobbyists is to use the threat
of canceling trade preferences to intimidate Ecuador's government into
extinguishing the legal rights of its citizens to save the country's
economy.

   The lawsuit accuses Texaco (purchased by Chevron in 2001) of
dumping 18.5 billion gallons of toxic waste into Amazon waterways from
1964 to 1990, thereby decimating the ability of the indigenous groups
to live off the rainforest. Texaco also built roughly 1000 unlined
open-air waste pits that have been leeching toxins into the soil and
groundwater for decades.

   Thus far, Chevron has submitted to the court more than 50,000
chemical sampling results and 150,000 pages of evidence yet the
company has tried to discredit the trial process to prepare for an
expected appeal. In February of this year, Chevron informed the USTR
that it expected a "near-term unfavorable ruling" in Ecuador resulting
in "enormous... financial liability".

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings downgrades two classes of J.P. Morgan Commercial
Mortgage Finance Corp.'s mortgage pass-through certificates, series
1999-C8 as follows:

   --$20.1 million class H to 'B' from 'BB';

   --$14.8 million class J to 'C/DR5' from 'CC/DR4'.

   In addition, Fitch affirms the following classes:

   --$221.6 million class A-2 at 'AAA';

   --Interest-only class X at 'AAA';

   --$36.6 million class B at 'AAA';

   --$32.9 million class C at 'AAA';

   --$14.6 million class D at 'AAA';

   --$25.6 million class E at 'AAA';

   --$11.0 million class F at 'AAA';

   --$16.5 million class G at 'A-'.

   Classes K and NR have been reduced to zero due to realized losses.
Class A-1 has paid in full.

   The downgrades are due to an increase in specially serviced loans
(4.5%) and expected losses since Fitch's last rating action. The
specially serviced assets represent 10.0% of the pool. The losses are
based on declining occupancy and deteriorating market conditions that
are likely to negatively impact value on these assets.

   The affirmations are due to sufficient credit enhancement as the
result of scheduled amortization, loan repayment, and defeasance since
the last Fitch rating action (9.4%). Since issuance, 28 loans (41.7%)
have defeased, including five of the top 10 loans (24.2%). As of the
July 2008 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance
has been reduced 46.2% to $393.6 million, from $731.5 million at
issuance.

   Four loans are currently in special servicing (10.0%). The largest
specially serviced loan (5.5%) is a 692-unit multifamily property
located in Rolling Meadows, IL, a suburb of Chicago. The loan is
current; however, default interest and late charges remain
outstanding. The property is currently listed for sale. At this time,
Fitch does not expect losses to the trust.

   The second largest specially serviced loan (1.7%) is a 121,639
square foot (sf) office property located in Kansas City, MO. The loan
was transferred June 2, 2008 due to imminent default. As of April 30,
2008, the property was 58% occupied, and the servicer-reported debt
service coverage ratio (DSCR) was 0.72 times (x) as of year-end 2007.
Losses are possible.

   The two smallest specially serviced loans (2.7%) are office
properties located in St. Louis, MO, each of which transferred to the
special servicer Feb. 29, 2008 upon imminent default. Though the
larger of the two assets (1.5%) was fully occupied as of Sept. 30,
2007, the property was not producing sufficient cash flow to service
the debt, with an annualized servicer-reported DSCR of 0.87x. The
smaller of the two St. Louis properties (1.2%) was 57% occupied as of
Sept. 30, 2007. At that time, the property was generating sufficient
cash flow to service the debt, with an annualized DSCR of 1.17x. Phase
II environmental reports have been ordered on both properties due to
their former use as a railroad station. Appraisals have additionally
been ordered. Losses are possible.

   Fitch has identified 13 loans (18.5%) as Fitch Loans of Concern.
These include specially serviced loans, loans with DSCRs below 1.0x,
and loans with other performance issues. Of the Fitch Loans of
Concern, three (3.0%) are scheduled to mature or anticipated to repay
in 2008.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
This is a updated to a message issued on July 29, 2008. It
replaces that message.

   Fitch Ratings assigns an 'A+' rating to city of Fresno Joint
Powers Financing Authority (JPFA), California's approximately $3.5
million lease revenue bonds (master lease projects) series 2008E and
$21.3 million lease revenue bonds series 2008F (federally taxable).
The bonds will be sold through negotiation on or about August 6th.
Proceeds from the new issues will fund improvements to the Selland
Arena and other improvements in Fresno's (the city) convention center
facilities as well as a replacement chiller system for City Hall.

   The Rating Outlook is Stable.

   Fitch also affirms the following ratings:

   --$139.4 million in Fresno Joint Powers Financing Authority, CA
outstanding lease revenue bonds series 2004A, B and C, 2006A and B;
2008A, B, C and D at 'A+'.

   --City of Fresno implied general obligation at 'AA-'

   --$159.8 million sewer system revenue bonds, 2008 series A at
'A+', and

   -- $100 million senior lien sewer system revenue bonds (closed
lien) 'AA-'.

   The Rating Outlook is Stable.

   The 'A+' rating reflects Fresno's consistently strong financial
results characterized by prudent management practices, above-average
reserves and sound lease structure balanced by economic concerns
regarding the severity and duration of the substantial housing market
declines and its economic impact. Fitch believes the city's strong
reserves and conservative spending patterns will aid in retaining a
sound financial position as rising mortgage delinquencies and home
foreclosures result in weak tax revenue performance. Fresno's economy
has diversified into health care, education and other service sectors,
but its role as an agricultural center still dominates.

   Fresno's economy is experiencing weakness after several years of
very strong gains, largely the result of severe distress in the
housing sector. Mortgage delinquencies (60 days or more) and home
foreclosures are rising rapidly, and construction employment fell
nearly 10% in 2007. The construction sector remains vulnerable to
further decline given the sector's historically high level of
employment (7% of all jobs county-wide in 2007). The financial
activities sector also had a small employment decline. The city's
unemployment rate has risen dramatically in recent months, reaching
9.0% in May 2008, well above the May 2007 rate of 7.5%. Meanwhile, the
city's assessed valuation (AV) for fiscal 2009 increased just 1.5%
compared to the five year average growth rate of 11.1%. This slowdown
in the property tax base reflects the slowdown in new construction as
well as reductions in AV due to market value reductions. Appeals may
result in additional adjustments to the city's tax base and related
revenues.

   As the state's sixth largest city and an agricultural center, the
recent growth has added diversity to the city's economy, largely in
health care and other services. The county's job base rose 11% from
2001-2007, with only a slowdown during the nationally weak 2003.
Despite job losses in construction and financial activities in 2007,
total employment rose 1.2%. Through May 2008, growth in education and
leisure, retail and government employment offset losses in financial
activities and construction. The city's unemployment rate is typically
high, resulting from the large number of seasonal agricultural jobs,
but declined to 7.5% in 2006 from a 10-year high of 12.8% in 1998.
According to recent data, the unemployment rate is on the rise. The
city's downtown area has undergone significant development through
both public and private projects, including market-rate housing, a
regional medical center, federal courthouse, and multi-purpose
stadium.

   Fresno's financial operations are well managed, with conservative
revenue forecasting and cost control measures contributing to strong
year-end results. The city's general fund has run break-even or
operating surpluses in each of the last nine fiscal years, bringing
the 2007 fund balance to $59.6 million, a very high 24.1% of
expenditures and transfers out. The unreserved fund balance also is
high at $33.4 million, 13.2% of spending. Fitch views these levels as
prudent given the area's economic volatility and the fiscal strain
foreseen in the next few years. The unreserved balance includes a
designation for emergencies, which can only be used during times of
extreme financial distress or natural disasters. The city plans to add
to this amount in fiscals 2008 and 2009 despite budget pressures, and
keep the fund in excess of the council-adopted 5% policy.

   As a result of a 1994 pension obligation bond issue and moderate
benefits, the city's two pension systems are over-funded, which has
enabled the city's annual contribution to be paid from the actuarial
surplus until this year. The surplus also has funded a supplemental
benefits fund, which covered the retirees' health insurance costs. The
city's liability for other post employment benefits (OPEB) is valued
at $82.9 million, resulting from the implicit subsidy of retiree
premiums. The actuarial required contribution is $9.9 million, a
moderate rise from the $5.9 million spent on OPEB in fiscal 2007.
However, since the benefit is funded from a designated amount of the
actuarial surplus, the total cost is limited to available funds. Fitch
believes that the ability to eliminate this funding if no resources
are available may require trade-offs with labor groups.

   This transaction's legal provisions are sound and benefit from a
master lease structure that includes four series sold in March and
April, 2008. The leased assets consist of parts of a large city park
and five other essential city facilities, all of which have been in
use for several years. The leased assets have a combined market value
that equals the combined bond par.

   The city's economic growth has kept the debt burden to moderate
levels despite recent issuances. Overall debt now is $2,845 per capita
and 4.5% of taxable market value. Future debt needs appear manageable,
with the city working to identify revenue sources to be used to pay
some or all of the future debt service.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) on Wednesday posted an 8.5 percent rise in quarterly profit as a result of a strong performance by its media networks business, including sports network ESPN, as well as one-time gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Net income was $1.28 billion, or 66 cents per share, compared with $1.18 billion, or 57 cents per share, in last year's fiscal third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue rose 2 percent to $9.24 billion from $9.05 billion a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's earnings, excluding 4 cents in gains from the acquisition of the Disney Stores in North America, the sale of Movies.com, and the favorable resolution of certain prior-year income tax matters, beat Wall Street's average estimate of 61 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney shares ended the June quarter down 11 percent from  quarterly highs of about $35, as investors worried about the effects of high fuel costs and economic pressures on consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Disney were up at $32 in after-hours trade after closing at $31.67 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gina Keating; Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) today reported earnings for
the third fiscal quarter and nine months ended June 28, 2008. Diluted
earnings per share (EPS) for the third quarter increased to $0.66,
compared to $0.57 in the prior-year quarter. EPS for the current
quarter included an accounting gain related to the acquisition of the
Disney Stores in North America, a gain on the sale of movies.com, and
the favorable resolution of certain prior-year income tax matters.
Collectively, these items totaled $0.04 per share.

   For the current nine-month period, diluted EPS was $1.87. EPS for
the prior-year nine-month period, which included gains on sales of our
interests in E! Entertainment and Us Weekly, income from the
discontinued operations of the ABC Radio business, and an equity-based
compensation plan modification charge, which were all recognized in
the first quarter of fiscal 2007, was $1.81. Excluding these items and
the current-year items discussed above, EPS for the current-year nine
months was $1.83 compared to $1.50 in the prior-year nine months.

   "We've had another solid quarter at The Walt Disney Company,
further illustrating our creative momentum, the competitive strength
of our brands and our ability to cohesively manage a great collection
of assets to maximize shareholder value," said Robert A. Iger,
president and chief executive officer.

   Cable Networks

   Operating income at Cable Networks increased 14% to $1.2 billion
for the quarter primarily due to growth at ESPN and, to a lesser
extent, higher income from our cable equity investments and an
increase at the international Disney Channels. The growth at ESPN was
driven by higher affiliate and advertising revenue, partially offset
by higher programming and production, administrative and marketing
costs. The increase in affiliate revenue was primarily due to
contractual rate increases, subscriber growth, and increased
recognition of previously deferred revenue related to annual
programming commitments. Higher programming and production costs
reflected increased sports rights costs for various sporting events
and included production costs for additional NBA games. During the
quarter, ESPN recognized $78 million of previously deferred revenues
compared to $49 million in the prior-year quarter. Remaining deferred
revenues of $396 million as of the end of the current quarter are
expected to be recognized in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year
compared to $359 million recognized in the fourth quarter of the prior
year. Higher income from our cable equity investments was primarily
due to the recognition of previously deferred revenues in connection
with finalizing certain affiliate contracts at ESPN's Star Sports
joint venture in Asia and higher advertising revenues at Lifetime.
Increased operating income at the international Disney Channels
reflected higher affiliate revenues due to subscriber growth.

   Broadcasting

   Operating income at Broadcasting decreased 11% to $260 million for
the quarter primarily due to higher production cost amortization
related to programs in syndication and lower advertising sales at the
owned television stations, partially offset by lower costs for new
scripted programming for the ABC Television Network. These decreased
costs were the result of lower expenses for pilots as pick up
decisions were delayed in the current year primarily due to the
Writers Guild of America work stoppage.

   Revenues at the ABC Television Network were comparable to the
prior year as the impact of lower ratings was offset by higher
advertising rates and digital media revenues.

   Parks and Resorts

   Parks and Resorts revenues for the quarter increased 5% to $3.0
billion and segment operating income increased 3% to $641 million.
Revenue growth was primarily due to an increase at Disneyland Resort
Paris driven by favorable currency translation and higher guest
spending and attendance.

   Operating income growth was driven by increases at Walt Disney
World Resort and Disneyland Resort Paris, partially offset by a
decrease at Disneyland Resort. Operating results at the theme parks
reflected decreased attendance due to the timing of the Easter
holiday, which fell in the third quarter in fiscal 2007 and in the
second quarter in fiscal 2008.

   Domestic Resorts

   Operating results at both Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland
Resort reflected decreased attendance due to the shift of the Easter
holiday. This was more than offset by higher corporate alliance income
and increased guest spending at Walt Disney World Resort driven by
higher average ticket prices.

   International Resorts

   Operating income growth at Disneyland Resort Paris was primarily
due to higher guest spending, increased attendance and the favorable
impact of currency translation, partially offset by higher operating
costs. Increased guest spending was due to higher average ticket
prices. Higher operating costs were driven by labor cost inflation and
increased marketing, partially offset by a favorable claim settlement.

   Studio Entertainment

   Studio Entertainment revenues for the quarter decreased from $1.8
billion to $1.4 billion and segment operating income decreased from
$190 million to $97 million.

   Lower segment operating income was primarily due to a decrease in
worldwide theatrical distribution reflecting the strong performance of
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End in the prior-year quarter
compared to The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian in the current
quarter.

   Consumer Products

   Consumer Products revenues for the quarter increased from $537
million to $642 million and segment operating income decreased from
$118 million to $113 million. The acquisition of the Disney Stores in
North America drove a significant portion of the revenue increase for
the quarter.

   Lower segment operating income for the quarter was driven by a
decrease at Disney Interactive Studios which was largely offset by an
increase in earned revenue at Merchandise Licensing driven by the
success of Hannah Montana and High School Musical merchandise. The
decrease at Disney Interactive Studios was due to lower sales of
self-published video games due to the strong performance in the
prior-year quarter of games based on Pirates of the Caribbean: At
World's End compared to The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian and
High School Musical in the current quarter and higher video game
development costs.

   The increase in revenues due to the acquisition of the Disney
Stores in North America was offset by the related operating costs and
the absence of licensing revenue from the former licensee.

   OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION

   Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses

   Corporate and unallocated shared expenses increased from $115
million to $127 million for the quarter primarily due to timing of
expenses in various corporate departments and higher investments in
new business initiatives, partially offset by an increase in the
allocation of costs to the business segments.

*T

   The decrease in interest expense for the quarter was primarily due
to lower effective interest rates.

   The decrease in interest and investment income for the quarter
reflected a $13 million investment impairment.

   Income Taxes

   The effective income tax rate for the quarter decreased to 34.1%
from 37.6% in the prior-year quarter driven by the favorable
resolution of certain prior-year income tax matters which reduced the
effective income tax rate in the current-year quarter by approximately
3.0 percentage points.

   Minority Interests

   Minority interest expense increased from $69 million to $91
million for the quarter due to the impacts of improved performance at
Disneyland Resort Paris and ESPN. The minority interest is determined
on income after royalties, financing costs and income taxes.

   (1) Net borrowings is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the
discussion of non-GAAP financial measures that follows.

   The total borrowings shown above include $3,888 million and $3,583
million attributable to Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland as of
June 28, 2008 and September 29, 2007, respectively. Cash and cash
equivalents attributable to Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland
totaled $554 million and $604 million as of June 28, 2008 and
September 29, 2007, respectively.

   Non-GAAP Financial Measures

   This earnings release presents earnings per share excluding
certain items, net borrowings, free cash flow, and aggregate segment
operating income, all of which are important financial measures for
the Company but are not financial measures defined by GAAP.

   These measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant
GAAP financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures
of earnings per share, borrowings, cash flow or net income as
determined in accordance with GAAP. Earnings per share excluding
certain items, net borrowings, free cash flow, and aggregate segment
operating income as we have calculated them may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

   Earnings per share excluding certain items - The Company uses
earnings per share excluding certain items to evaluate the performance
of the Company's operations exclusive of certain items that impact the
comparability of results from period to period, including significant
dispositions and acquisitions. During the current nine months, these
items included gains related to the acquisition of the Disney Stores
in North America and the sale of movies.com and the favorable
resolution of certain prior-year income tax matters. In the prior-year
nine months, these items included gains on sales of equity investments
in E! Entertainment and Us Weekly, income from the discontinued ABC
Radio business and a charge related to a modification of equity-based
compensation plans in connection with the ABC Radio transaction. The
Company believes that information about earnings per share exclusive
of these impacts is useful to investors, particularly where the impact
of the excluded items is significant in relation to reported earnings,
because the measure allows for comparability between periods of the
operating performance of the Company's business and allows investors
to evaluate separately the impact of decisions regarding the sale and
acquisition of interests in businesses from the impact of the
operations of the business. The following table reconciles earnings
per share to earnings per share excluding certain items for the
current and prior-year nine-month periods:

   (1) Other income for the current nine-month period consists of an
accounting gain related to the acquisition of the Disney Stores in
North America ($18 million pre-tax) and a gain on the sale of
movies.com ($14 million pre-tax). Other income for the prior-year
nine-month period consists of gains on the sale of equity investments
in E! Entertainment Television ($780 million pre-tax) and Us Weekly
($272 million pre-tax).

   Net borrowings - The Company believes that information about net
borrowings provides investors with a useful perspective on our
financial condition. Net borrowings reflect the subtraction of cash
and cash equivalents from total borrowings. Since we earn interest
income on our cash balances that offsets a portion of the interest
expense we pay on our borrowings, net borrowings can be used as a
measure to gauge net interest expense. In addition, a portion of our
cash and cash equivalents is available to repay outstanding
indebtedness when the indebtedness matures or when other circumstances
arise. However, we may not immediately apply cash and cash equivalents
to the reduction of debt, nor do we expect that we would use all of
our available cash and cash equivalents to repay debt in the ordinary
course of business.

   Free cash flow - The Company uses free cash flow (cash provided by
continuing operations less investments in parks, resorts and other
property), among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its
operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than
capital expenditures. Management believes that information about free
cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash
available to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments
and pay dividends or repurchase shares.

   Aggregate segment operating income - The Company evaluates the
performance of its operating segments based on segment operating
income, and management uses aggregate segment operating income as a
measure of the performance of operating businesses separate from
non-operating factors. The Company believes that information about
aggregate segment operating income assists investors by allowing them
to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company's
portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that
affect net income, thus providing separate insight into both
operations and the other factors that affect reported results. A
reconciliation of segment operating income to net income is as follows

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Investors say it's a matter of time 
until deepening U.S. economic doldrums steal into the Magic 
Kingdom, but they expect Walt Disney Co to have mostly escaped 
their effects for the first half of calendar 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; As Disney reports its quarterly results this week, 
investors and analysts already are focused on the year's back 
half for signs that the company's astonishing profitability 
during the year-long economic downturn is faltering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street expects low-single-digit rises in profit and 
revenue for Disney's fiscal third quarter ended in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts, on average, expect Disney to post net earnings of 
60 cents per share and revenue of $9.14 billion, only slightly 
ahead of last year's quarterly EPS of 58 cents and revenue of 
$9.05 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said the true impact of souring consumer sentiment 
and falling disposable income on Disney may be masked by a 
number of factors that may narrow profits and depress revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The issues include a revenue deferral at ESPN, tough 
comparisons for the theme parks and movie businesses, and 
possibly higher costs at the consumer products division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Studios is expected to drag on overall company 
results, mainly because "The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince 
Caspian" failed to measure up to last year's blockbuster 
"Pirates of the Caribbean" sequel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The parks business, considered a consumer bellwether, is 
expected to post growth but will be compared against a 2007 
quarter that included an Easter holiday and record attendance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The parks have managed "stellar" results for two years, and 
the effects of high gasoline prices and a cut in airline 
capacity to Disney World resort in Florida may be unclear for a 
quarter or two, Caris  Co analyst David Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While global retail sales of Disney Consumer Products grew 
by 10 percent in fiscal 2008, profits may be squeezed by video 
game development costs and charges from retail stores Disney 
took over in May from Children's Place Retail Stores Inc, 
Standard  Poors Equity Research analyst Tuna Amobi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sports networks ESPN enjoyed strong ratings in the quarter 
from the National Basketball Association finals, Sunday 
baseball and racing's Triple Crown, but robust ad sales may be 
dampened by $120 million in revenue deferred to the fourth 
quarter, Amobi said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 'BODY LANGUAGE'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RBC Capital Markets analyst David Bank expects the stock 
price to follow the tone set by Disney executives on the 
post-earnings conference call on Wednesday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "For the quarter, I'm pretty confident," Bank said. "It's 
really what comes out of that call that's going to be 
interesting, the body language."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A positive word from Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs on 
Wednesday about advance hotel bookings and advertising sales 
could go far to re-energize shares that have dropped 11 percent 
from a quarterly high of $35, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The parks are really going to set the tone for the rest of 
the company. If the company reports the trends holding up in 
the parks, I think you could see the stock get a lift," said 
Amobi, who has a "strong buy" rating on Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The underlying trend of the parks is still healthy ... but 
the economic slowdown could potentially become more of a factor 
in the back half of the year," Amobi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts also are listening for weakness at ESPN, a main 
driver of its media networks business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If the advertising tone at ESPN changes dramatically, that 
would be something that we would be looking for," Bank said. 
"That would be a big negative."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's ABC broadcast networks also are expected to show a 
healthy increase in spot or "scatter" ad rates despite lower 
ratings, due to tight inventory in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "To our knowledge, scatter in the quarter was generally 
selling at a 10 percent premium to upfront because ABC was top 
rated," said Miller, who rates Disney "above average."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock has largely escaped a punishing of U.S. media 
stocks with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 12.4. Rival 
CBS Corp has dropped to 8.6 times estimated 2009 earnings, News 
Corp to 10.6 and Viacom Inc to 10.9. Only Time Warner Inc has 
bested Disney, with a multiple of 12.9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Gina Keating, editing by Gerald E. McCormick)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - SAIL Advisors, one of Asia's largest homegrown fund of hedge fund managers, said on Wednesday it hired former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) managing director Vincent Duhamel as its new chief executive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong-based Duhamel will replace Eliza Lau, who previously served as both chief executive and chief investment officer. SAIL said Lau would remain as CIO and continue to oversee its portfolios. The Hong Kong-based firm had about $2.5 billion (1.3 billion pounds) in assets under management as of the end of June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duhamel, who will start as CEO on September 17, was with Goldman in Asia from 2005 until earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Canadian executive initially ran its asset management business in the region, before the role was taken over by Oliver Bolitho. He moved on to help lead the unit's sovereign wealth fund and central bank strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to Goldman he was an executive with State Street Corp (STT.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As our business continues to grow rapidly we are focused on continuing to build the management team at SAIL. Vincent is a key part of this strategy," SAIL Chairman Robert Miller said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAIL was established in 2003 by Search Investment Group, the family office of billionaire Miller, who co-founded the retail chain Duty Free Shoppers. Search began managing the Miller family's money in 1974 and is a longtime hedge fund investor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAIL opened its funds to third-party investors starting in 2004, a move executives have said was made partly to ensure the firm had the resources to hire and retain top talent in a competitive industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asia-Pacific focused hedge funds had about $155 billion in assets at the end of June, according to hedge fund tracker Eurekahedge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After producing five straight years of double-digit percentage gains, the Eurekahedge Asian Hedge Fund Index is down 8.86 percent this year. This compares with a gain of 1.39 percent for its North American index and fall of 1.62 percent in its European index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) management was quoted by analyst Meredith Whitney as saying that the largest U.S. securities firm was "highly unlikely" to buy a retail bank given current regulation, and that current market environment posed strong headwinds to earnings growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While much speculation has been made about Goldman's interest in acquiring a retail bank, we believe the chances are less than slim," the Oppenheimer  Co analyst wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, analyst Whitney met with Goldman's Chief Financial Officer David Viniar, Co-President Jon Winkelried, and Head of Investment Banking David Solomon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Management stated that the company would only be interested in purchasing a bank if it was able to use the acquired deposits as a funding source for any other part of the business and without additional regulatory scrutiny," Whitney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously, current regulation makes that scenario impossible," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman did not immediately return a call seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The credit crunch has prompted analysts and investors to speculate that Goldman, eager to establish a new and more stable source of funds, would snap up a bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market talk has gained strength in recent weeks as rising loan losses and worries about the U.S. economy has made bank stocks cheap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Merrill Lynch analyst Guy Moszkowski, who had also met with CFO Viniar, said Goldman had considered buying a deposit-taking bank, but added that such a deal was not very likely now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CFO Viniar did caveat that clearly if the regulatory pendulum swung to an extreme so as to force broker dealers to convert into a bank holding structure... then GS would be interested in acquiring bank deposits," Whitney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar expects additional regulation for broker-dealers, including greater U.S. Federal Reserve oversight, more disclosure requirements and higher capital requirements, Whitney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar, however, does not expect broker-dealers to be subject to full bank regulations, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORE HEADWINDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which has largely avoided the credit losses hobbling its rivals, acknowledged that the current environment of low levels of activity and lack of confidence in the markets posed strong headwinds to earnings growth, Whitney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Management believes these headwinds will continue to persist if not accentuate," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also expects material reduction in investment banking headcount by year-end, Whitney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, however, has positioned itself with healthy liquidity and "dry powder" to take advantage of attractive opportunities and potential share buybacks, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitney rates the stock "perform." Shares of Goldman were up 1 percent at $183.47 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Jarshad Kakkrakandy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  VIENNA, AUSTRIA, Jul 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and kika/Leiner Group today announced that the furniture
retailer has signed an agreement for the global support of its
information technology (IT) infrastructure with IBM in Austria. The
contract will run for 5 years until 2013.

    To allow kika/Leiner to further expand in Eastern Europe and the Middle
East, IBM will provide the following:


--  Manage kika/Leiner's servers from a centralized data center in
    St.Poelten, Lower Austria
--  Provide kika/Leiner's more than 70 locations worldwide with IT and
    network services
--  Manage security applications and international helpdesk
    

    
The kika/Leiner Group has been growing rapidly in Central and Eastern
Europe. Today, there are locations in Slovakia, the Czech Republic,
Croatia and Hungary and the number of locations is still increasing. In
2008, kika/Leiner has plans to open kika stores in Bucharest, Romania,
Serbia and in Moscow, Russia. In 2007, kika opened stores in Saudi
Arabia, through franchising agreements, and has plans to also expand its
presence even further.

    In order to keep the IT growing in line with the quick international
expansion, kika/Leiner chose IBM Austria to support its IT-infrastructure.
A key element for IBM winning this deal was its flexibility and global
presence, as Paul Koch, CEO of kika/Leiner Group, points out, "In all of
our international locations, we require availability and security to be
guaranteed. This can be provided by IBM, whose international expertise is
very valuable for us."

    Kika/Leiner's centralized data center is headquartered in St. Poelten and
supplies all its locations with IT services. These locations work with
Thin Clients, which are connected to the data center through a secure
network. IBM supports and manages the servers in St. Poelten, ensures the
network connections globally by partnering with the Austrian
telecommunications company Telekom Austria, keeps LAN and WAN up-to-date
and runs their security applications. In addition, the IBM helpdesk
provides kika/Leiner employees, in all its country locations, with daily
support.

    The centralized datacenter concept helps kika/Leiner to quickly implement
in new locations. To set up the IT and support in new stores and
countries, IBM will establish the network connection and link it with the
datacenter in St.Poelten.

    The IT outsourcing agreement was signed in July of 2008.

    In May of 2008, kika/Leiner opened its new data center in St. Poelten, one
of the first green data centers in Austria. This data center was also
developed and built by IBM and reduces the energy use by up to 40 percent.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jul 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced a new suite of integrated data protection
solutions designed to help customers of all sizes deal with
ever-increasing volumes of information and increased pressure to retain
and rapidly recover data to meet legal and regulatory requirements.

    According to IDC, 161 exabytes of digital content was created, captured,
or replicated in 2006 -- enough data to stack books from the earth to the
moon a dozen times -- and the number is expected to multiply by 11 times
to 1,800 exabytes by 2011.[1]

    IBM's new Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack software -- the first new
products resulting from IBM's recent acquisition of FilesX -- can provide
customers with improved business continuity and comprehensive recovery of
data and applications, as well as the ability to address compliance across
customer data centers and remote offices. Part of IBM's Tivoli Storage
Manager line, the new software expands IBM's existing enterprise data
protection solutions with new capabilities to help protect data that
resides outside managed servers, on remote networks.

    "The explosion of data coupled with increasing compliance requirements is
driving the need for customers of all sizes to retain, protect and recover
information," said Kelly Beavers, director, IBM storage software. "These
new solutions complement our existing data protection software portfolio
by offering backup and recovery features tailored for remote office and
mid-market customers."

    "As an information technology provider, we require a data protection
solution that will help ensure business continuity while also providing us
the ability to retain and quickly recover customer information," said
Jason Waldrop, CEO, CWPS. "IBM's new offerings provide a comprehensive
data protection solution that will help us secure our own business data,
as well as, provide disaster recovery services for our customers."

    The new products deliver continuous data protection and near-instant
recovery of applications, databases, and file servers:


--  IBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack for continuous data protection and
    near-instant recovery technology for Windows file servers and applications
    including Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft SQL, Lotus Domino, Oracle, DB2 and
    others. The software provides data protection and recovery for applications
    in data centers or remote branch offices, enterprises and small business
    customers. Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack can eliminate backup windows by
    continuously capturing data changes at the block level with minimal impact
    to the systems it protects. Its policy-based approach to data protection
    allows administrators to improve recovery service levels -- specifically
    Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) and Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) on a per-
    application basis. Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack also provides a nearly
    instantaneous restore capability that enables applications to be up and
    running within minutes after data recovery is initiated, while data
    recovery is performed in the background.

--  IBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack for Microsoft Exchange for quick
    and easy restore of individual Exchange objects such as e-mail messages and
    attachments, contact lists, calendars, tasks and journal entries. Tivoli
    Storage Manager FastBack for Microsoft Exchange uses an intuitive interface
    which can reduce downtime and improve productivity.

--  IBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack for Bare Machine Recovery to help
    users easily recover entire systems to a comparable server, to a new server
    with different hardware or to a virtual machine. Tivoli Storage Manager
    FastBack for Bare Machine Recovery provides customers with a tool for
    performing server migrations, and offers a highly cost-effective business
    resilience solution for remote branch offices.

--  IBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack Center which combines the three
    Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack products into a single, convenient package.
    

    
"IBM's rapid integration of the FilesX solutions illustrates the
complementary nature of both companies' data protection solutions," said
Lauren Whitehouse, analyst at Enterprise Strategy Group. "With the FilesX
acquisition, IBM saw an opportunity to expand its enterprise data
protection portfolio to include remote offices and target the mid-market.
With the new products announced today, IBM now offers a more comprehensive
suite of products that address protection and recovery needs of SMB and
enterprise customers."

    The new, enterprise-level continuous data protection capabilities
complement IBM's existing file-based software called IBM Tivoli Continuous
Data Protection for Files, which is targeted at SMB customers as well as
laptop and desktop users.

    IBM System Storage DS4000 and IBM System Storage DS3000 select models have
been added to the suite of storage products intended to integrate with IBM
Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack to provide SMB customers with
comprehensive data recovery and business continuity solutions.

    The new IBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack solutions will be available
August 15, 2008.

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Honors Salesmanship Club, SMU Student with Annual Agency of the Year and Intern of the Year Awards

       Winners Receive $1,000 Awards for Contributions to Dallas
                   Community through ExxonMobil CSJP
DALLAS--(Business Wire)--
Salesmanship Club Youth and Family Centers and Brittney Titus,
intern at Methodist Dallas Medical Center, were named Agency of the
Year and Intern of the Year as part of the ExxonMobil Community Summer
Jobs Program (CSJP).

   The ExxonMobil CSJP, now in its 37th year nationally, pairs 75
undergraduate college students with local nonprofits for a paid
internship. Agencies receive the benefit of a talented staff member
during the busy summer months, while students gain real world
experience, learn more about the role of nonprofits in the community
and earn a paycheck.

   Titus and the Salesmanship Club received their awards during the
CSJP wrap-up celebration, where the 75 interns and agencies selected
for this year's program gathered to celebrate the end of a summer of
community service. In addition to a silver award, each recipient was
also presented with a check for $1,000. The Salesmanship Club will use
the funds for support of its program serving at-risk children and
families. Titus will use her $1,000 scholarship for educational
expenses when she returns to Southern Methodist University this Fall.
The Agency of the Year and Intern of the Year awards are given at the
conclusion of the ExxonMobil CSJP each year, in recognition of
outstanding participation and community impact through the program.

   The Salesmanship Club was selected as the Agency of the Year for
their development of an internship that enhanced the student's
professional skills while creating material of long-lasting impact for
the organization. In addition to creating a superior internship
experience, the Salesmanship Club also made mentoring their intern a
priority and helped her create a portfolio of the work she completed
over the summer. The Salesmanship Club was selected for the Agency of
the Year award by a panel of judges, who evaluated information
obtained during site visits at each of the 75 participating agencies.

   Titus, a junior corporate communications and public affairs major
at Southern Methodist University, was honored with the Intern of the
Year award for her work as the Junior Volunteer Coordinator at
Methodist Dallas Medical Center. During her internship, Titus
supervised 65 high school volunteers, planning all aspects of their
placements from training to activities, fundraisers and educational
field trips. Although she originally wanted to pursue a career in
event planning, she is now interested in working for a nonprofit
agency because of her CSJP internship experience.

   A panel of judges selected Titus as the Intern of the Year after
reviewing nominations submitted by participating agencies. Nominations
included information from each agency about the impact their intern
made on the organization and the ability of the intern to exceed
expectations set by their supervisors.

   "We are excited to honor our award recipients for their
outstanding participation in the ExxonMobil CSJP," said Truman Bell,
senior program officer for education and diversity, ExxonMobil
Foundation.

   "Today, Brittney and her fellow interns will leave the Community
Summer Jobs Program with a unique appreciation of the nonprofit
sector. Community service agencies, such as the Salesmanship Club, are
vital in fostering this understanding. We congratulate all 75 interns
and nonprofits for their hard work this summer, and wish the students
the best of luck as they complete college and enter the professional

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, July 30 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) said on
Wednesday that it is cutting its 2008 platinum price forecast by
$200 an ounce and its 2009 price outlook by 14 percent amid
fears over weakening demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The bank said it has sliced its 2008 price forecast to
$1,907 an ounce from $2,107, and its 2009 forecast to $1,963
from $2,300, in response to "a weakening macro environment".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank said the revision was due in part to
AngloPlatinum's confirmation of significantly weaker jewellery
demand this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anglo Plat expects consumption by jewellers to fall 37
percent in 2008 from a year ago, Goldman said, far more than the
16 percent dip the bank had previously expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We continue to expect platinum prices to increase through
2009 from current spot levels, but acknowledge that
significantly weaker demand for platinum jewellery products will
likely lead to looser platinum markets than we had previously
forecast," the bank said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It added that while it continues to forecast a market
deficit this year, its expects the shortfall to be smaller than
previously expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Almost a quarter of global platinum supply is sold into the
jewellery market, while around half is taken by carmakers, who
use the precious metal in autocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman is the second bank to cut its platinum forecasts
this session, after Standard Chartered trimmed its
fourth-quarter forecast to $1,750 an ounce from $2,050, and its
2009 number to $1,675 from $2,105 earlier on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Concerns over the weak economic outlook and its effect on
car demand, as well as a firmer tone to the dollar and a fall in
overall commodities prices, have all weighed on spot prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spot platinum XPT= was trading at $1,736.00/1,756.00 an
ounce at 1051 GMT, against $1,735.50/1,755.50 late in New York
on Tuesday.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - SAIL Advisors, one of Asia's largest homegrown fund of hedge fund managers, said on Wednesday it hired former Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) managing director Vincent Duhamel as its new chief executive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong-based Duhamel will replace Eliza Lau, who previously served as both chief executive and chief investment officer. SAIL said Lau would remain as CIO and continue to oversee its portfolios. The Hong Kong-based firm had about $2.5 billion (1.25 billion pounds) in assets under management as of the end of June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duhamel, who will start as CEO on September 17, was with Goldman in Asia from 2005 until earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Canadian executive initially ran its asset management business in the region, before the role was taken over by Oliver Bolitho. He moved on to help lead the unit's sovereign wealth fund and central bank strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to Goldman he was an executive with State Street Corp (STT.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As our business continues to grow rapidly we are focused on continuing to build the management team at SAIL. Vincent is a key part of this strategy," SAIL Chairman Robert Miller said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAIL was established in 2003 by Search Investment Group, the family office of billionaire Miller, who co-founded the retail chain Duty Free Shoppers. Search began managing the Miller family's money in 1974 and is a longtime hedge fund investor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAIL opened its funds to third-party investors starting in 2004, a move executives have said was made partly to ensure the firm had the resources to hire and retain top talent in a competitive industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asia-Pacific focused hedge funds had about $155 billion in assets at the end of June, according to hedge fund tracker Eurekahedge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After producing five straight years of double-digit percentage gains, the Eurekahedge Asian Hedge Fund Index is down 8.86 percent this year. This compares with a gain of 1.39 percent for its North American index and fall of 1.62 percent in its European index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Plans for a long-discussed Disneyland park in Shanghai could include a major media agreement between Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and the Shanghai government that could give the company unrivaled access to the market, documents obtained by Reuters show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The joint venture agreement would give Disney a huge advantage over U.S. media rivals by allowing it to bypass foreign film import quotas and summer and holiday blackout periods, as well as television censorship, both imposed by the central government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While its rivals vie for the 20 slots allotted by the Chinese government each year to foreign films, Disney would be tasked with creating movies, TV and web fare to promote its brand, stories and characters to grow attendance at the Disney and Shanghai government-owned park, the documents show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has engaged in on-again, off-again talks for more than a decade with the Chinese government over plans to build a large theme park and hotel complex in the southern outskirts of Shanghai's Pudong district, where Fortune 500 companies like General Motors Corp (GM.N) have regional headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those talks were stalled by a Shanghai government scandal in 2006 and Disney's need to focus on Hong Kong Disneyland, which opened in 2005 to a string of operational problems and lackluster attendance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan documents came from a presentation given by Shanghai city government officials at a meeting in April with local entrepreneurs and scholars who were then asked how to improve the plan, a source familiar with the meeting said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two people familiar with the documents, who declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the situation, said that a legally binding final agreement would not be reached until some time after the Beijing Olympics in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One source also said that current talks are focusing on other issues, such as potential funding and profit sharing, rather than the media and marketing proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JOINT VENTURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Chinese know Mickey Mouse and the Disney brand through the limited number of movies and TV shows allowed into the country each year and through Disney retail stores, they are less familiar with the fairy tales and characters that populate the parks, Disney officials have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The documents call for Disney to receive a large stake in a joint venture that would manage the park. Under the joint venture, Disney would handle marketing and promotions in exchange for providing capital and technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai government-led local consortium, including some of the city's major developers, would provide land near the Pudong International Airport in exchange for its share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The joint venture would be controlled by the city government, which would have the right to appoint the general manager and other senior positions, according to the same sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement would give the joint venture the right to publish and distribute a Disney-branded magazine, and to produce animated films and television shows for local broadcast and cable TV that showcase both the Disney brand and the new park, the documents show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The content of the magazine, movies and TV shows, and breadth of distribution would have to be approved on a case-by-case basis by the central government and relevant ministries and regulators under Chinese rules, the documents showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney also would get help from the joint venture in opening the Chinese market to its films and other programming, and in return would help distribute Chinese-made fare in the United States and other countries, the documents show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement also calls for the joint venture to authorize local manufacturers to produce Disney-branded toys in China and sell them internationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final talks for a Disneyland park in Shanghai could be accelerated after the Olympics, as central government leaders in Beijing prefer keeping the global focus on China's booming economy and improving standard of living in major cities, one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has been in talks since 1994 over the Shanghai park and was close to a deal about two years ago, when the project was stalled by a corruption scandal that sidelined several top Shanghai government officials involved in the negotiations, two sources close to the deal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's U.S. entertainment rivals, including NBC Universal and Time Warner Inc's (TWX.N) Warner Bros, have held talks with the Shanghai city government in the past decade but could not iron out differences over concerns such as management control and copyright protection. NBC Universal is 80 percent owned by General Electric Co (GE.N) and 20 percent by Vivendi (VIV.PA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Chinese media reports that a deal is imminent, Disney parks spokeswoman Leslie Goodman said there has been "no agreement and no deal" to proceed with plans for a park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said in December of 2006 that the Shanghai park was "something that I think we'd like to see happen down the road" but that the "course ... (and) speed of that conversation" had been "impossible to predict."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, the company has made no official statement about the progress of talks except to shoot down talk of a deal, emanating mainly from the Chinese press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, Shanghai Mayor Han Zheng made a surprise announcement that the city had applied to the National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic planner, which directly reports to the cabinet, for approval to build a Disney theme park in China's financial hub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Disney allows several years to build its international theme parks, the company was planning to set up a "special mini park" first at the World Expo in Shanghai in 2010 to promote a formal Disney theme park to tens of millions of tourists expected to attend the event, according to one of the sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gina Keating and George Chen, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) broke its own record for the highest-ever quarterly profit for a U.S. company on Thursday, but it was lower than Wall Street expected largely due to lost output from Venezuela and Nigeria and lower yields from some oil fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average price of a barrel of oil was slightly less than $125 in the quarter, nearly double last year, which also increased earnings reported by three of Europe's largest oil companies, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), Eni (ENI.MI) and Repsol (REP.MC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's second-quarter net income rose 14 percent to $11.68 billion, or $2.22 a share, in the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, after excluding one-time items, Exxon earned $2.27 a share, more than 10 percent below analysts' expectations, according to Reuters Estimates. The miss led to a 4.7 percent slide in Exxon's shares, a major factor in a decline in U.S. stocks on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shell, the world's second-largest non-government controlled oil company by market value, reported a 5 percent rise in second-quarter earnings to $7.9 billion, and said that excluding one-time items, it beat analysts' forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies' oil and gas exploration and production units were the main profit drivers because of high oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite billions of dollars in capital spending in the quarter, oil and gas production was sluggish. That, along with weak profit margins from refining, restrained the companies' earnings somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western oil companies' output has fallen in recent years and oil producing countries now prefer to award their richest fields to their own national oil companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The problem is that all these companies have no place to go to drill and no place to put their money," said Oppenheimer  Co analyst Fadel Gheit. "Access to resources is closing very, very fast."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's oil and gas production fell 8 percent from a year earlier, mostly due to the loss of assets taken over by Venezuela, a labor strike in Nigeria, and contracts that give host countries a larger share of production as oil prices rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shell said output fell 1.6 percent in the second quarter to 3.126 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) compared to the same quarter last year, while Repsol's production fell 19.7 percent to 335,000 boepd in the first half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROFITS DRAW CRITICISM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enormous profits drew criticism from politicians because of the high gasoline prices being paid by consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama termed Exxon's earnings "outrageous" and called for an end to the "tyranny of oil."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are making very large profits, I know that," Shell Chief Executive Jeroen van der Veer told reporters on a conference call. "But we are making very large investments," he said, referring to investments in exploration and production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Italy's Eni SpA posted a 4.4 percent rise in second-quarter adjusted net profit, below analysts' forecasts, as higher taxes weighed on its results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eni said second-quarter production was 1.77 million boepd, up 2.1 percent from the year before, and added that based on lower oil prices output would rise 2 percent in 2008, compared to an earlier forecast of 3.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjusted net profit strips out gains from changes in the value of inventories and non-recurring items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spain's Repsol YPF said its first-half adjusted net profit rose 15 percent to 1.883 billion euros ($2.94 billion), well ahead of analysts' forecasts, because of high oil prices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downstream refining and marketing profits fell sharply at most of the companies, as crude processing margins tightened, and retailers found it hard to pass on full price increases to motorists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's downstream profits dropped about 54 percent and Shell's downstream results fell 70 percent. Eni said refining and marketing profits fell 23 percent in the quarter, while Repsol's downstream profits fell 2 percent in the first half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's shares closed down $3.95 at $80.43 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shell's "A" shares closed down 2 percent at 1799 pence, Eni shares fell 1.4 percent to 21.74 euros and Repsol shares fell 0.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Paul Bolding, Toni Reinhold)&lt;/p&gt;

 July 31 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) pulled in
$11.68 billion in profits in the second quarter on Thursday,
the highest quarterly income ever recorded by a U.S. company.

 Here are a few facts about the company's record haul:

 ** Exxon earned over $128 million a day, or nearly $1,500 a
second during the quarter. The company said that was after it
paid $4,100 a second in taxes and $14,700 a second in expenses
to run the business.

 ** Exxon's quarterly earnings were slightly larger than
the annual gross domestic product of Afghanistan, which
was $11.63 billion in 2007, according to the World Bank.

 ** With Exxon's quarterly profit, one could potentially buy
Gap Inc (GPS.N), Ford (F.N) or Starbucks (SBUX.O), which have
market capitalizations of $11.67 billion, $10.76 billion and
$10.69 billion, respectively, according to Reuters data.

 ** Exxon's quarterly earnings translate to roughly $38.33

    per American

 ** $11.68 billion could buy roughly 2.95 billion gallons

    of gasoline, 179,692 new Cadillac Escalades, or 15.57
billion individual Snickers candy bars.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - China's financial hub, Shanghai, is
restricting the issue of business visas, underlining the
lengths to which authorities are going to keep out unwanted
foreigners ahead of the Beijing Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Business groups have already complained about tightened
visa policies ahead of the August Games, which have included a
ban on citizens of 33 countries applying for Chinese visas in
Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Shanghai Foreign Economic Relations and Trade
Commission said it will postpone approval of notification
letters needed for business visas till mid September for all
but essential travel, ruling out visits to carry out
inspections, market research and training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The South China Morning Post on Thursday cited unnamed
sources as saying that authorities in Beijing also have similar
curbs, as have Qingdao, Shenyang and Qinhuangdao -- all of
which will host some Olympic events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Foreigners coming to Shanghai on important business before
then need to get the Chinese organisation that is inviting them
to give detailed supporting documentation, the city commission
said in a notice posted on its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At the same time, (they) should try their best to limit
the number of people coming and the amount of time they spend
in Shanghai," the commission said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said the curbs were being introduced on orders from
above and were meant to "ensure the smooth hosting of the
Olympics and safeguard the city's social stability during the
Olympics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beijing has defended itself against criticism over its
tighter visa policies, saying they are necessary to ensure
security during the Games and keep "hostile forces" out of the
country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But business consultants say the restrictions are starting
to hurt exporters, which in some cases are unable to finalise
contracts because their clients' inspectors are unable to get
into the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jason Subler; Editing by Alan Wheatley)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (For more stories visit our multimedia website "Road to

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Schwartz career background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 31 (Reuters) - Former Bear Stearns Cos Chief
Executive Alan Schwartz, who was forced to sell his hobbled
investment bank to JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), will leave the
bank after the summer, JPMorgan said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Schwartz had been offered a position as a senior deal maker
, but is leaving to pursue "other career interests," according
to an internal memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although Schwartz, who came to prominence as a star MA
advisor, had been working on deals at JPMorgan, he did not have
a specific role and so he will not be replaced, according to
someone familiar with the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "After 32 years with Bear Stearns, the time is right for me
to look toward the next phase of my career," Schwartz said in a
memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Schwartz was named Bear's chief executive in January,
succeeding long-time chief James "Jimmy" Cayne, who stepped
down to become chairman after presiding over heavy subprime
mortgage losses last year. At the time, Schwartz was adamant
about the investment bank not being for sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Being acquired is not a strategy," he told Reuters in a
telephone interview at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But weeks later, Bear Stearns faced a run on the bank and
Schwartz sold the firm at a bargain price to JPMorgan Chase
with the encouragement of the U.S. government. More than 7,000
Bear Stearns employees were laid off as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Schwartz shot to Wall Street fame advising on large MA
deals, such as Disney's 1996 acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC
Inc for $19 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan completed its purchase of Bear Stearns in May for
$1.4 billion, a huge discount from where it traded only months
earlier.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks fell on Thursday, led by Exxon Mobil after its earnings fell short of Wall Street's expectations and as disappointing economic data revived fears of a U.S. recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with Thursday's decline, the Dow and the Nasdaq finished the month higher, aided by the worst month for oil since December 2004. The SP 500 finished the month down 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) profit miss, coupled with a 2 percent slide in the price of oil, drove the energy giant's stock down nearly 5 percent.

The SP 500 lost 1 percent in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nasdaq's losses on Thursday were limited by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's (BMY.N) offer to buy out the remaining stake in biotech partner ImClone.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds dateline, new throughout)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 31 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the
second-largest U.S. oil company, said on Thursday it started
production at its Agbami field offshore Nigeria, the country's
largest deepwater field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The field is currently producing about 20,000 barrels per
day of oil and natural gas liquids, and will ramp up to around
100,000 barrels per day by January or February, said Ali
Moshiri, president of Chevron's Africa and Latin America
exploration and production business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The project is expected to increase to 250,000 barrels per
day by the end of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a large project we are hoping to even have
positive surprises," Moshiri said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the company is not concerned about political
instability in Nigeria hurting the project, noting that Agbami
is 70 miles offshore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moshiri also said that phase 3 of the company's Escravos
gas project is still scheduled to come on stream in 2009, but
the Bonga southwest project, expected in 2012, could be
delayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said Chevron's Frade deepwater field offshore Brazil is
also on schedule for first production around the middle or end
of the first quarter of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron operates the Agbami project. Equity holders include
State-run Nigerian National Petroleum Corp (NNPC) and Norwegian
company StatoilHydro (STL.OL).

   The rating actions taken today reflect Fitch's analysis of
expected default and loss from delinquent loans, in addition to
projected losses from the currently performing pool. Fitch generates
its expectations using its ResiLogic default and loss model. These
expectations are adjusted based on actual performance to-date versus
model projected performance. The model incorporates the impact of
historical home price movements on mortgage performance, in addition
to projecting further stress for many regions of the U.S. The model
also reflects the demonstrated high default rates for loans that
exhibit risk-layering.

   Fitch is nearing completion of its review of the 2005-2007 Alt-A
transactions. This review was completed in two separate phases. The
first phase reviewed all mezzanine and subordinated bonds. The second
phase, which is nearly completed, reviewed the senior bonds that, in
many instances, required additional cash flow analysis to evaluate the
risk of the various individual classes within the senior tranche. Most
notably, the use of super-senior structures was considered in
evaluating senior bonds.

&lt;p&gt;  BANGALORE, INDIA, Jul 31 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Max New York Life Insurance Company Limited today
announced the rollout of an integrated solution for policy issuance and
administration for Max Vijay -- a brand new business initiative
introduced by Max New York Life. This is part of the 10-year
multi-million dollar services agreement signed between IBM and Max New
York Life Insurance in December 2007.

    IBM will help Max New York Life Insurance deploy and transform its
insurance policy processing platform and provide end-to-end technology
backbone for Max Vijay, a revolutionary new insurance product designed
specifically for the under-served segment of the Indian society. The
product combines the best of insurance and savings and gives the customers
a means to aggregate their earnings in a structured and well-planned
manner.

    Announcing the rollout, Mr. Analjit Singh, Chairman, Max New York Life
Insurance Company Limited, said, "Max Vijay empowers millions of Indians,
who may not be a part of the economic growth scenario that the country is
witnessing today, to participate in the revolution and realize their
dreams. The business model leverages innovation at every step, be it
product design, technology, distribution or service delivery, to ensure a
comprehensive offering for the common man."

    Mr. Shankar Annasamy, Managing Director, IBM India/South Asia, said, "IBM
will bring its deep global expertise in business transformation and
innovation in the insurance sector to help Max New York Life Insurance set
new benchmarks for customer experience, create new avenues for business
growth and address a largely under-served rural and semi-urban market for
life insurance. We are excited to have this relationship with the leading
player in the rapidly growing life insurance sector in India. This
initiative reinforces IBM's position as a leading and strategic partner
for Indian enterprises."

    As part of the rollout, IBM will provide services across the following
functions to Max Vijay:


--  Insurance policy system administration
--  Policy setup
--  New business processing
--  Customer care
--  Claims processing
    

    
For Max Vijay, IBM will use wireless handheld devices, which enable
data transfer via GPRS to the back-end systems facilitating on-the-spot
issuance of insurance policies. Aimed at making insurance available in
every nook and corner of the country, Max Vijay will also be sold across
channels like neighborhood stores, microfinance institutions and NGOs
among others. IBM will also provide disaster recovery services for Max

&lt;p&gt;Offshore Nigeria Field Expected to Reach 250,000 Barrels per Day
                      Production End of Next Year
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today announced that its Nigerian
affiliate, Star Deep Water Petroleum Ltd, has commenced crude oil
production from the Agbami Field, located offshore Nigeria.

   First oil from the Agbami Field was achieved on July 29, 2008,
from a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel.
Initial production from the Agbami Field is expected to be more than
100,000 barrels per day and is projected to increase to 250,000
barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids per day by the end of
2009. The Agbami field, discovered in 1998, is the largest deepwater
discovery in Nigeria and is estimated to hold potentially recoverable
volumes of 900 million barrels. Chevron is the operator and has a 68.2
percent interest under the unit agreement.

   "Chevron and our partners have reached an exciting milestone for a
major project 10 years in the making. Production from Agbami will now
bring new energy supplies to the world market and help provide long
term, sustainable returns to our shareholders," said Ali Moshiri,
president of Chevron Africa and Latin America Exploration and
Production. "Agbami is a world-class project, and I'm particularly
proud that Agbami represents the industry's largest ever support of
Nigerian content."

   Fred Nelson, Managing Director of Chevron Nigeria/Mid-Africa
Strategic Business Unit, added: "We congratulate our partners -- the
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Famfa Oil Limited, Petrobras
and Statoil -- for this remarkable achievement. We also thank the
Nigerian government and our partners for their strong support, which
has led to the delivery of outstanding results."

   "We value the contributions made by the project team, contractors
and suppliers who have made the start-up a reality. Chevron and its
partners have now delivered a major oil project that will help to
ensure a new source of global energy supply and also provide new jobs
and economic growth to Nigeria. The Agbami project sets a new
benchmark for Nigerian local content, including the largest module
ever fabricated in Nigeria."

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings upgrades J.P. Morgan Commercial Mortgage Finance
Corp.'s mortgage pass-through certificates, series 1999-C7, as
follows:

   --$38.1 million class F to 'AA' from 'A'.

   Additionally, Fitch affirms the following classes:

   --Interest-only class X at 'AAA';

   --$22.7 million class B at 'AAA';

   --$40.1 million class C at 'AAA'.

   --$52.1 million class D at 'AAA';

   --$12.0 million class E at 'AAA';

   --$26.0 million class G at 'BB';

   --$4.0 million class H at 'BB-'.

   Fitch does not rate the $23.4 million class NR certificates. The
class A-1 and A-2 certificates have paid in full.

   The upgrade reflects increased credit enhancement due to scheduled
amortization and loan payoffs since last review of 16.8%. As of the
July 2008 distribution date, the pool's aggregate balance has been
reduced 72.7%, to $218.4 million from $801.4 million at issuance. Two
loans (25.6%), including the largest loan in the pool, have defeased.

   One asset (3.3%) has been in special servicing since 2003 and real
estate-owned since 2004. The loan is secured by 107,052 sf of office
space in Ridgeland, MS, a Jackson-area suburb. The properties consist
of two office buildings, one of which needed significant repairs. The
special servicer is working to lease up vacant space and is marketing
the properties for sale. Recent valuations of the asset indicate
losses upon liquidation.

   Thirty-one (85.2%) of the remaining 51 loans in the transaction
have an anticipated repayment date in either 2008 or 2009. These
include the two defeased loans (25.6%). The 49 non-defeased loans have
a year-end 2007 weighted average DSCR of 1.71x.

&lt;p&gt;First ECM to support SharePoint Protocol, offering open choice for
              database, development and operating system
LONDON--(Business Wire)--
Alfresco Software, Inc. today announced the availability of
Alfresco Labs (Beta) 3, the open source alternative to Microsoft(R)
SharePoint(TM). Alfresco Labs 3, formerly called Alfresco Community,
offers Microsoft users greater choice by providing them with the first
open source fully-compatible SharePoint repository. With Alfresco Labs
3, companies can leverage existing investments in Linux and Java as
well as Microsoft .NET connection software to significantly reduce
their SharePoint total cost of ownership and maximize their hardware
and software investments. Alfresco Labs 3 is immediately available for
download at http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Alfresco_Labs_3

   The shift in how information and content is shared and created is
forcing enterprises to blur the lines between enterprise content
management (ECM) and social software. Today, employees need content
that can be accessible everywhere, not just in large, monolithic
applications. While most Fortune 1000 companies have implemented some
form of ECM software, it's commonly quoted that only 5% to 10% of
users in an enterprise use ECM. Instead, workers prefer to use shared
file drives or emails. As a result, products that offer basic content
services (BCS) like Alfresco Software and SharePoint are filling this
gap.

   "With the massive growth of SharePoint, customers are seeking an
open alternative that delivers equivalent benefits but with true
platform choice," said John Newton, CTO of Alfresco Software.
"Alfresco Labs 3 is the first ECM product to implement the SharePoint
protocol and provides users with the same access from Microsoft
Office, while giving companies the freedom of choice in their
hardware, database, operating system, application server and portal
products. Customers will experience the best of both worlds providing
workers with an easy-to-use content management and collaboration tool
that is integrated with Microsoft Office while lowering overall IT
costs and increasing return on existing investments."

   Microsoft released the SharePoint protocol as part of its
compliance with the European Commissions' decision issued on March 24,
2004. Alfresco is the first ECM system to implement the Microsoft
Office and Windows SharePoint Services protocols as a compatible
server.

   The Alfresco Labs 3 repository offers:

   --  Microsoft Office SharePoint protocol support requiring no
        additional client installation

   --  Alfresco Surf platform for building dynamic, REST-oriented web
        applications and collaborative web sites

   --  RESTful API delivering content and collaboration services for
        customizing and developing Alfresco applications

   --  Preview of Alfresco Share, a new social computing application

   --  Document library which scales to over 100 million documents

   Alfresco's new Surf platform is built on Alfresco Web Scripts
technology, which utilizes light-weight scripting and templating. The
Surf platform is designed to work in a number of different web
environments, as well as a Web Part in Microsoft SharePoint Portal. It
includes content oriented components designed around the Yahoo!(R)
User Interface (YUI) Library and Adobe(R) Flash(R) for dynamic uploads
and previewing of content and other information. The new user
interface components make it much simpler for users to develop new
collaborative web applications. Alfresco will be delivering a new
social computing application, Alfresco Share, built using the Surf
platform in September 2008. Previews of Alfresco Share are available
in Alfresco Labs 3.

   Alfresco has seen major adoption of its open source ECM system
throughout the world. Alfresco Labs is designed to be the research
"Community Lab" for new features, enabling developers to access a
nightly build with the latest functionality. There have been over one
million downloads of Alfresco Labs. The company also has more than 500
enterprise customers, including the NYSE, Los Angeles Times, Boise
Cascade, Sony Pictures, Activision, Kaplan, FedEx and KLM.

&lt;p&gt;PTP Microwave Revenues to Grow as 3.5G and 4G Becomes Reality, New Visant Strategies Study Finds

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The escalating build-outs of 3.5G and 4G mobile networks will
continue to propel the point-to-point microwave industry as radio
shipments with higher capacities will become the norm, a new report
from Visant Strategies finds.

   "Growth in PTP shipments is being driven by deployment and
preparation for advanced 3.5G technologies, mainly in Western Europe
now, and by continued expansion of GSM networks throughout the world
in emerging economies," said report author Andy Fuertes of Visant
Strategies. "Software defined radios that are upgradeable, offer high
capacity and which support TDM and IP natively have become the norm
for the 3.5G and 4G segment of the PTP microwave market, which is
experiencing over 40% annual growth."

   "This is like the last set of network upgrades. Now carriers are
now preparing backhaul networks for planned upgrades to HSPA+, EV-DO
Rev B, LTE, and WiMAX over the next two to five years," added Larry
Swasey of Visant Strategies.

   The study finds links with greater than 155 Mbps are expected to
account for 35% of shipments in 2013 and 40% in 2014. Current and
projected future capacity requirements per site are resulting in the
employment of higher frequency bands, and in some cases replacement of
wired backhaul with wireless solutions, according to the study.

   PTP microwave revenues reached over $5 billion in value in 2007
and are expected to top $6 billion in 2008, according to "PTP
Microwave Growth Markets 2008."

   Shipments of PTP microwave radios for public safety and enterprise
applications both experienced double digital growth year-to-year, the
report finds, and Trunking applications accounted for 17% of all PTP
microwave radio shipments this past year.

   The report includes world PTP microwave shipments, revenues and
ASPs from 2007 to 2014. Shipments and revenues are also given by
region, link capacity, IP vs. TDM/converged platforms, application and
operating frequency. Vendor market share is also provided. Mobile
subscribers and base station deployments by technology generation are
also given as are deployments of MSC/core switching centers and
BSC/RNC sites.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jul 31 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that analyst firm IDC has ranked IBM as
the worldwide market share leader in the enterprise portal software
market over Oracle, BEA and Microsoft, based on license and maintenance
revenue.(1)

    IDC projects that the enterprise portal software market will expand to
$2.0 billion by 2012. According to IDC, the enterprise portal software
market grew nearly 18.3 percent in 2007 with license and maintenance
revenue of $1.2 billion.(1)

    Hundreds of IBM business partners, resellers and other software companies
pair IBM's Web 2.0-enhanced WebSphere Portal software with their own
information technology (IT) products for a variety of clients worldwide.

    IBM also announced today that it has begun shipping the latest version of
its WebSphere Portal software, version 6.1. Designed to securely combine
information from both corporate enterprises and the Web, the new software
has Web 2.0 features that help people be more productive and find
information faster. Its live text feature allows a user to click on text
-- in the context of the business process being used -- and see supporting
information related to the job at hand. For example, when a salesperson
clicks on the address of a client, a map with driving directions could
appear, or an electronic business card could pop up when clicking on a
person's name.

    ARX Technologies is an IBM Advanced Business Partner using the latest
version of IBM portal software to serve its customers. Since its inception
in 1974, the Arlington, Texas-based company has provided software to
public sector and electric, water, gas and other utility organizations,
to help them with a variety of tasks including billing, payroll, public
works and community development. ARX Technologies has worked closely with
IBM to incorporate IBM's latest technology into its new, browser-based
products. Through the use of this ARX software, local governments and
utilities are able to enhance and improve their work flow, which allows
them to streamline their work processes.

    "We've gone through a massive product modernization and now have a
browser-based product based on IBM's latest WebSphere Portal software.
Version 6.1 has allowed us to have a product ideal for our government
customers. In addition, we've been able to get rid of those archaic icons
and drab gray screens," said Charlotte Foulkes, Chief Technology Officer,
ARX. She added that when IBM's portal is running, users don't have to
close screens and select icons. Instead, they can easily navigate to
quickly find what they need. "For example, it is easy to move from the
weather report, to instant messaging, to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency Web site," added Foulkes.

    Germany-based Fritz &amp; Macziol is another IBM partner using IBM portal
software to serve its customers. The company provides software, systems
and services to a variety of private sector and government organizations
including banks, insurance agencies and local authorities in Germany,
Austria and Switzerland.

    "Fritz &amp; Macziol has been able to double its portal-related service
revenue since we started using IBM WebSphere Portal technology to serve
our customers," said Anja Beckmann, Team leader, Middleware and Portal
Technology, Fritz &amp; Macziol.

    New York-based Prolifics is another IBM business partner using the latest
version of IBM's portal software to serve its customers. Prolifics
provides expert services including architectural advisement, design,
development, and deployment, assisting customers with their service
oriented architecture (SOA) initiatives. SOA is a business strategy that
helps a company reuse existing technology to more closely align it with
business goals resulting in greater efficiencies, cost savings, agility
and productivity. Since its inception in New York City in 1978, Prolifics
has serviced more than 3,000 customers worldwide, including Wall Street
firms and government agencies. It has more than 225 portals customers and
approximately 40 percent of its revenue comes from this arena.

    "We've had phenomenal success partnering with IBM in the portal arena.
Since we've incorporated IBM WebSphere Portal technology into our product
mix, we've seen a dramatic increase in our portal-related revenue," said
Prolifics' CEO Nicolas Jabbour.

    "The new IBM portal Web 2.0 interface is a leap forward," said Craig
Smith, Managing Director of UK-based OpenLogic. He added that new
features such as site management and integration with software such as
IBM Lotus Quickr, IBM Lotus Domino, IBM WebSphere Process Server and
Microsoft Exchange are compelling many of his customers to migrate to the
latest version of IBM's portal software. OpenLogic delivers IT products
based on WebSphere Portal to many blue-chip customers in the automotive,
telecommunications, education and other industries.

    IBM recently enabled clients to experiment with the latest version of
WebSphere Portal software through IBM Lotus Greenhouse, a Web site where
anyone can register to try out IBM WebSphere Portal, IBM's new Mashup
Center, Lotus Connections, Lotus Quickr and Lotus Sametime. This provides
clients with a safe and easy way to evaluate these products without
installing them in their own environments.

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Japanese government closed the consular section of its embassy in India and warned its citizens to avoid crowded places such as markets and train stations after receiving an e-mail warning of a possible attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jul 31 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Led by strong sales of IBM (NYSE: IBM) Lotus Notes and Domino 8 in the
second quarter of 2008, IBM's Lotus software business outgrew Microsoft
by winning millions of customer seats worldwide in direct competition
with Microsoft, aided by key wins over its Redmond-based rival in
emerging markets.

    IBM's emerging markets represented 18 percent of IBM's overall geographic
revenue in the second quarter of 2008, and together grew 21 percent as
reported. In addition, the Brazil, Russia, India and China subset grew 31
percent in the second quarter, led by strong growth in India.

    Among those customer wins was Lotus' largest Asian customer engagement to
date -- a major bank licensing 300,000 Lotus Notes seats as well as Lotus
Symphony, IBM's free personal productivity software based on the the
OpenDocument Format. Lotus Symphony has been downloaded by over 1.3
million individuals and businesses, including scores of Microsoft Office
customers. Customers that chose Lotus Notes and Domino over Microsoft in
key markets included Max New York Life, Reliance Industries, Vedanta, and
Aviva in India; GD Development Bank, Johnson Electric, HKG Environ
Protect, CED, DL Cosco Shipyard in China; Affin Bank and Trakando in
Singapore; and Russian Railways in Russia.

    "Enterprise customers -- especially many rapidly-growing businesses in
emerging global markets -- are choosing Lotus software for its open,
flexible design," said Bob Picciano general manager, Lotus Software.
"These companies prefer open standards over the restrictions of legacy
proprietary technology for their long-term collaboration investments."

    The second quarter saw the largest historical client win for Lotus in
North America as well. A member of the so-called "big six"
accounting/consulting firms purchased more than 150,000 seats of the
entire Lotus portfolio, selecting Lotus Notes, Lotus Sametime, Lotus
Connections, IBM Lotus Quickr and WebSphere Portal over Microsoft
Exchange and SharePoint, among other products. Other large companies that
chose Lotus Notes and other Lotus software over Microsoft products
included several leading banks in the U.S., the United Kingdom and
Germany, as well as the Australian government.

    Other clients who have recently invested in Lotus Notes and other Lotus
software over the competition include consumer goods giant
Colgate-Palmolive, chemical manufacturer Ineos of Belgium, the U.S.
Federal Aviation Administration, NutraFlo, Dutch Railways, Rohm Haas,
Imerys and the Salvation Army. Specifically moving to Lotus Notes 8 were
CFE Compagnie d'Enterprises of France, Virginia Commonweath University,
Winsol International, The U.S. General Services Administration, the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service, Standard Insurance, New York Life, Kentucky
Baptist Convention, Verizon, Publishers Printing, Hyatt Hotels, Union
Pacific and Nationwide Insurance.

    Many clients of all sizes are questioning their investments in legacy
Microsoft software products. Migrating to new versions of Microsoft
Exchange has proven to be a daunting and expensive task. Ferris Research
recently published a report (Exchange 2007 Implementation Issues, December
2007) that indicated 70% of Microsoft customers felt that migrating to
Exchange 2007 was either "Difficult or Very Difficult."

    Large companies are concerned with the prospect of upgrading to
Microsoft's Vista operating system and continued high percentage of IT
costs devoted to personal computers amid challenging economic conditions.
Meanwhile, more strategic IT investments that could spur top-line revenue
growth go unfunded and unrealized.

    Increasingly, both public and private sector companies are looking at open
alternatives such as IBM Lotus Symphony and other solutions from
OpenOffice.org. One such organization that is making the switch to Lotus
Symphony is the Anglican Church of Australia, which stated publicly that
it will save an estimated AU$150,000 a year.

    Industry analysts credit Lotus with a more innovative, open portfolio that
gives businesses freedom of choice, lower IT costs, and more insightful
employee tools. For example, the industry's first enterprise social
networking product, IBM Lotus Connections, doubled its client base this
year after debuting as the fastest growing new IBM software product in
2007. At the recent Enterprise 2.0 conference in Boston, attendees
witnessed a demonstration comparison pitting IBM Lotus Connections against
Microsoft SharePoint. Moderator Mike Gotta of the Burton Group summed up
the audience's reaction in his blog, "Collaborative Thinking." He wrote,
"IBM was the clear winner across the board. Maybe Microsoft underestimated
IBM. And in some cases, decision-makers are more open to at least
considering alternate solutions they might not have even entertained
before (which would be good news for IBM and Jive in particular)."

    IBM Lotus Sametime, IBM's platform for unified communications and
collaboration, vaulted to over 100 million individual licensed seats in
the second quarter with one-third of sales going to Microsoft customers.
IBM WebSphere Portal software with Web 2.0 technology has won marketshare
leadership for seven consecutive years by leading research firms, Gartner
and IDC (see separate release today). Lotus has also launched new
products in the software mashup, computer appliance, and
software-as-a-service categories.

    With 15 consecutive quarters of revenue growth, IBM's flagship Lotus Notes
and Domino products has been transformed into a versatile tool that
consolidates the individual's work world onto one screen, employs Web 2.0
technologies and reduces time spent on email. Lotus Notes and Domino
adoption has grown to more than 140 million licenses with gains across
small-medium business, more than half of the largest 100 corporations in
the world, 80 percent of the top 10 global companies in banking,
telecommunications, aerospace and defense, consumer products, electronics,
insurance, and pharmaceuticals.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, updates number of bombs found in Surat) NEW DELHI, July 31 (Reuters) - The Japanese government closed the consular section of its embassy in India and warned its citizens to avoid crowded places such as markets and train stations after receiving an e-mail warning of a possible attack. Japan's embassy in New Delhi said in a statement in Japanese on its website that it had received an e-mail warning of an attack on New Delhi's popular market district of Sarojini Nagar, where at least 66 people were killed in a 2005 bomb attack. The consular section of the embassy would be closed from July 30 for a while, according to a spokesman. Delhi police are investigating the e-mail, said Rajan Bhagat, a police spokesman. Indian authorities have been on a high alert since at least 45 people were killed when a series of 16 bombs ripped through Ahmedabad, the main city of Gujarat state, on Saturday. The attack came a day after bombs killed one woman in Bangalore, India's outsourcing and software capital. A group called the Indian Mujahideen said it carried out the Ahmedabad attack, writing in an e-mail sent five minutes before the first blast that it was in revenge for a 2002 massacre in Gujarat of around 2,500 people, mainly Muslims, by Hindu mobs.  Police have also defused at least 25 unexploded bombs in the western Indian city of Surat, one of the world's biggest diamond-polishing centres, in the last few days.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Thursday soaring oil prices pushed its second-quarter earnings up 14 percent, again breaking its own record for the highest-ever profit by a U.S. company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Net income in the quarter rose to $11.68 billion, or $2.22 a share, from $10.26 billion, or $1.83 a share, last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon -- the world's largest publicly traded company -- previously set the high-water mark for quarterly earnings in the fourth quarter of last year, when it brought in $11.66 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the new record, Exxon's results lagged behind analyst expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company posted operating earnings of $2.27 a share in the quarter, which exclude a $290 million charge related to the recent Supreme Court ruling in the Exxon Valdez case. Analysts, on average, had expected the company to earn $2.53 a share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue in the quarter rose about 40 percent to $138.07 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon both produces oil and refines it to make gasoline, and profit margins for gasoline were weak during the quarter, holding back earnings slightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said earnings from its exploration and production business rose about 68 percent to $10.01 billion. But its refining and marketing earnings fell about 54 percent to $1.56 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. oil prices averaged slightly less than $125 a barrel in the quarter, nearly double prices from a year earlier. Gasoline prices only rose 25 percent during that same period, resulting in weak profit margins for the fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Exxon Mobil fell 2.2 percent in pre-market trade after its earnings were announced. Through Wednesday's close, they were down about 10 percent this year, underperforming the Chicago Board Options Exchange's oil index, which has fallen about 5.2 percent over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michael Erman, editing by Dave Zimmerman)&lt;/p&gt;

facts, which reflect the view of JPCI's management with respect to future
events. When used in this report, words such as "believe," "expect,"
"anticipate," "estimate," "intend," "deem," "see" and similar expressions,
as they relate to JPCI or Componus or their plans or operations, identify
forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on
assumptions made by and information currently available to JPCI's
management. Although management believes that the expectations reflected
in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no
assurance that such expectations are reasonable, and it can give no
assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct.
Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially

Componus to execute its business plan, currency and commodity

and severe interest rate increases. JPCI can provide no assurance that
such cost increases can be passed on to its customers through
implementation of price increases for JPCI's products. Furthermore, the
ability of current management to evaluate the risk and viability of
Componus's business plan is limited by current management's lack of
experience in Componus's industry. The forward-looking statements
contained herein reflect the current views of management with respect to
future events and are subject to those factors and other risks,
uncertainties and assumptions relating to the operations, results of

&lt;p&gt;  (Recasts, adds share price, investor quote, environmentalist
quote)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Michael Erman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 31 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N)
broke its own record for the highest-ever quarterly profit by a
U.S. company again on Thursday, but earnings still disappointed
investors due to weaker-than-expected production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net income in the quarter rose to $11.68 billion, or $2.22
a share, on soaring oil prices. That compares with $10.26
billion, or $1.83 a share, last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon -- the world's largest publicly traded company --
previously set the high-water mark for quarterly earnings in
the fourth quarter of last year, when it brought in $11.66
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue in the quarter rose about 40 percent to $138.07
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, shares dropped around 3 percent as Exxon's results
lagged behind analyst expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company posted operating earnings of $2.27 a share in
the quarter, which exclude a $290 million charge related to the
recent Supreme Court ruling in the Exxon Valdez case. Analysts,
on average, had expected the company to earn $2.53 a share,
according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon was hurt this quarter by sharp declines in
production in most regions. The comparison versus the second
quarter last year for crude oil and liquids was down in every
region around the globe," said Gene Pisasale, who helps manage
about $13 billion at PNC Capital Advisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They are spending $25 billion a year, and they are not
even breaking even now in terms of production growth," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's oil and gas production fell 8 percent from a
year earlier, mostly due to the loss of assets taken over by
Venezuela, a labor strike in Nigeria, and contracts that give
host countries a larger share of production as oil prices
rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon both produces oil and refines it to make gasoline,
and profit margins for gasoline were weak during the quarter,
holding back earnings slightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. oil prices averaged slightly less than $125 a barrel
in the quarter, nearly double prices from a year earlier.
Gasoline prices only rose 25 percent during that same period,
resulting in weak profit margins for the fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said earnings from its exploration and
production business rose about 68 percent to $10.01 billion.
But its refining and marketing earnings fell about 54 percent
to $1.56 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Profit from the company's chemicals business dropped 32
percent to $687 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's record profits have made the company a target for
politicians and environmentalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The public is smart enough to know that (with) record high
gas prices and record breaking profits, there's a connection
there," Gene Karpinski of the League of Conservation Voters,
said on a conference call with reporters on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's clear that one thing that should be done now is to
break the stranglehold of big oil and cut their subsidies,
install a windfall profits tax and invest much more of that
money in clean air technologies and give a big significant
chunk of that money back to consumers to offset the increased
costs that they're paying."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Exxon Mobil fell $2.46 to $81.92 on the New York
Stock Exchange on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Through Wednesday's close, they were down about 10 percent
this year, underperforming the Chicago Board Options Exchange's
oil index .OIX, which has fallen about 5.2 percent over the
same period.

   EXXONMOBIL'S CHAIRMAN REX W. TILLERSON COMMENTED:

   "ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings excluding special items were
a record $11,970 million, up 17% from the second quarter of 2007.
Earnings per share excluding special items were up 24% reflecting the
impact of the continuing share purchase program. Net income for the
second quarter was $11,680 million, up 14% from the second quarter of
2007. Net income included an after tax special charge of $290 million
reflecting the $508 million maximum punitive damages set by the recent
Supreme Court ruling in the Valdez litigation. Record crude oil and
natural gas realizations were partly offset by lower refining and
chemical margins, lower production volumes and higher operating costs.
First half earnings excluding special items increased by 17% over the
first half of 2007 reflecting higher crude oil and natural gas
realizations. Net income for the first half of 2008 was up 16% versus
2007.

   "ExxonMobil increased investments across all business lines to
help meet global demand for crude oil, natural gas and finished
products. Capital and exploration project spending increased to $7.0
billion in the second quarter, up 38% from last year. For the first
half of 2008, spending on capital and exploration projects was
$12.5 billion.

   "The Corporation distributed a total of $10.1 billion to
shareholders in the second quarter through dividends of $2.1 billion
and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding of $8.0 billion, an
increase of 12% or $1.1 billion versus the second quarter of 2007."

   SECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS

   --  Earnings excluding special items were a record
        $11,970 million, an increase of 17% or $1,710 million from the
        second quarter of 2007.

   --  Earnings per share excluding special items were up 24% to
        $2.27 reflecting strong earnings and the continued reduction
        in the number of shares outstanding.

   --  Net income was a record at $11,680 million, up 14% from the
        second quarter of 2007.

   --  Second quarter 2008 net income included an after tax special
        charge of $290 million reflecting the $508 million maximum
        punitive damages set by the recent Supreme Court ruling in the
        Valdez litigation.

   --  The effective income tax rate increased to 49% versus 44%.

   --  Capital and exploration expenditures were $7.0 billion, up 38%
        from the second quarter of 2007.

   --  Cash flow from operations and asset sales was approximately
        $14.6 billion, including asset sales of $1.2 billion.

   --  Share purchases of $8.0 billion reduced shares outstanding by
        1.7%.

   --  ExxonMobil launched a new synthetic motor oil, Mobil 1
        Advanced Fuel Economy, that can improve fuel efficiency in
        modern gasoline engines and benefit the environment by
        reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

   --  ExxonMobil announced plans to complete development and testing
        of a commercial demonstration plant near LaBarge, Wyoming
        using its Controlled Freeze Zone(TM) technology. If
        successful, this technology will assist in the development of
        additional gas resources to meet the world's growing demand
        for energy and facilitate the application of carbon capture
        and storage to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

   --  ExxonMobil announced plans to begin commercial evaluation of
        unconventional hydrocarbon potential covering 184 thousand
        acres and exploration activities on an additional 387 thousand
        acres in the Mako Trough in southeast Hungary.

   Second Quarter 2008 vs. Second Quarter 2007

   Upstream earnings were $10,012 million, up $4,059 million from the
second quarter of 2007. Record crude oil and natural gas realizations
increased earnings approximately $6.1 billion. Lower sales volumes
decreased earnings about $1.7 billion. Higher operating costs and
increased taxes also reduced earnings.

   On an oil-equivalent basis, production decreased 8% from the
second quarter of 2007. Excluding impacts related to the Venezuela
expropriation, the Nigeria labor strike and lower entitlement volumes
(which include price and spend impacts and PSC net interest
reductions), production was down about 3%.

   Liquids production totaled 2,393 kbd (thousands of barrels per
day), down 275 kbd from the second quarter of 2007. Excluding the
Venezuela expropriation, the Nigeria labor strike and lower
entitlement volumes, liquids production was down just over 2%, as
increased production from projects in west Africa and the North Sea
was more than offset by mature field decline and higher maintenance
activity.

   Second quarter natural gas production was 8,448 mcfd (millions of
cubic feet per day), down 285 mcfd from 2007. Higher European demand
and new production volumes from project additions in the North Sea
were more than offset by mature field decline and increased
maintenance activity.

   Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations were $2,034 million,
$812 million higher than the second quarter of 2007. Non-U.S. Upstream
earnings were $7,978 million, up $3,247 million from last year.

   Downstream earnings of $1,558 million were down $1,835 million
from the second quarter of 2007 as lower margins reduced earnings by
$1.9 billion, driven by significantly lower worldwide refining
margins. Petroleum product sales of 6,775 kbd were 199 kbd lower than
last year's second quarter, mainly reflecting asset sales and lower
demand.

   U.S. Downstream earnings were $293 million, down $1,452 million
from the second quarter of 2007. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings of
$1,265 million were $383 million lower.

   Chemical earnings of $687 million were $326 million lower than the
second quarter of 2007. Lower margins, which reduced earnings
approximately $500 million, were partly offset by favorable foreign
exchange and tax effects. Prime product sales of 6,718 kt (thousands
of metric tons) in the second quarter of 2008 were 179 kt lower than
the prior year.

   Corporate and financing expenses of $287 million, excluding the
charge related to the Valdez litigation, increased by $188 million,
mainly due to tax items and lower interest income.

   During the second quarter of 2008, Exxon Mobil Corporation
purchased 98 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a
gross cost of $8.8 billion. These purchases included $8.0 billion to
reduce the number of shares outstanding, with the balance used to
offset shares issued in conjunction with the company's benefit plans
and programs. Shares outstanding were reduced from 5,284 million at
the end of the first quarter to 5,194 million at the end of the second
quarter. Purchases may be made in both the open market and through
negotiated transactions, and may be increased, decreased or
discontinued at any time without prior notice.

   First Half 2008 vs. First Half 2007

   Net income of $22,570 million ($4.25 per share) was a record and
increased $3,030 million from 2007. Excluding special items, earnings
for the first half of 2008 were $22,860 million, an increase of
$3,320 million from 2007.

   FIRST HALF HIGHLIGHTS

   --  Earnings excluding special items were a record
        $22,860 million, up 17%.

   --  Earnings per share excluding special items increased 25% to
        $4.30, reflecting strong business results and the continued
        reduction in the number of shares outstanding.

   --  Net income was up 16% from 2007. Net income for the first half
        of 2008 included an after tax special charge of $290 million
        reflecting the $508 million maximum punitive damages set by
        the recent Supreme Court ruling in the Valdez litigation. Net
        income for the first half of 2007 did not include any special
        items.

   --  The effective income tax rate increased to 49% versus 44%.

   --  Cash flow from operations and asset sales was approximately
        $36.4 billion, including $1.6 billion from asset sales.

   --  The Corporation distributed a total of $20.0 billion to
        shareholders in 2008 through dividends and share purchases to
        reduce shares outstanding, an increase of $2.2 billion versus
        2007.

   --  Year to date dividends per share of $0.75 increased 12%.

   --  Capital and exploration expenditures were $12.5 billion, an
        increase of 35% versus 2007.

   Upstream earnings were a record $18,797 million, up $6,803 million
from 2007. Record high crude oil and natural gas realizations
increased earnings approximately $10.5 billion. Lower sales volumes
reduced earnings about $2.5 billion. Higher taxes, increased operating
costs and lower gains on asset sales decreased earnings approximately
$1.2 billion.

   On an oil-equivalent basis, production decreased 7% from last
year. Excluding impacts related to the Venezuela expropriation, the
Nigeria labor strike and lower entitlement volumes, production was
down 2%.

   Liquids production of 2,431 kbd decreased 276 kbd from 2007.
Excluding the Venezuela expropriation, the Nigeria labor strike and
lower entitlement volumes, liquids production was down 3% as field
decline in mature areas more than offset project volume increases.

   Natural gas production of 9,333 mcfd decreased 86 mcfd from 2007.
Higher volumes from North Sea and Qatar projects and higher European
demand were more than offset by mature field decline.

   Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations for 2008 were
$3,665 million, an increase of $1,266 million. Earnings outside the
U.S. were $15,132 million, $5,537 million higher than 2007.

   Downstream earnings of $2,724 million were $2,581 million lower
than 2007. Lower worldwide refining and marketing margins decreased
earnings approximately $2.9 billion while higher operating costs
reduced earnings about $300 million. Improved refinery operations
increased earnings about $600 million. Petroleum product sales of
6,798 kbd decreased from 7,085 kbd in 2007, mainly reflecting asset
sales.

   U.S. Downstream earnings were $691 million, down $1,893 million.
Non-U.S. Downstream earnings were $2,033 million, $688 million lower
than last year.

   Chemical earnings of $1,715 million decreased $534 million from
2007. Lower margins, which decreased earnings approximately
$800 million, were partly offset by favorable foreign exchange and tax
effects. Prime product sales of 13,296 kt were down 406 kt from 2007.

   Corporate and financing expenses of $376 million, excluding the
charge related to the Valdez litigation, increased by $368 million,
mainly due to lower interest income, higher corporate costs and tax
items.

   Gross share purchases through the first half of 2008 were
$18.2 billion, reducing shares outstanding by 3.5%.

   Estimates of key financial and operating data follow.

   ExxonMobil will discuss financial and operating results and other
matters on a webcast at 10 a.m. Central time on July 31, 2008. To
listen to the event live or in archive, go to our website at
exxonmobil.com.

   Statements in this release relating to future plans, projections,
events or conditions are forward-looking statements. Actual results,
including project plans, could differ materially due to changes in
long-term oil or gas prices or other market conditions affecting the
oil and gas industry; political events or disturbances; reservoir
performance; the outcome of commercial negotiations; wars and acts of
terrorism or sabotage; changes in technical or operating conditions;
and other factors discussed under the heading "Factors Affecting
Future Results" on our website and in Item 1A of ExxonMobil's 2007
Form 10-K. We assume no duty to update these statements as of any
future date. References to quantities of oil expected to be developed
may include amounts not yet classified as proved reserves but that we
believe will ultimately be produced.

   Consistent with previous practice, this press release includes
both earnings excluding special items and earnings per share excluding
special items. Both are non-GAAP financial measures and are included
to help facilitate comparisons of base business performance across
periods. A reconciliation to net income is shown in Attachment II. The
release also includes cash flow from operations and asset sales.
Because of the regular nature of our asset management and divestment
program, we believe it is useful for investors to consider sales
proceeds together with cash provided by operating activities when
evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing
activities. A reconciliation to net cash provided by operating
activities is shown in Attachment II. Further information on
ExxonMobil's frequently used financial and operating measures and
other terms is contained under the heading "Frequently Used Terms"
available through the Investors section of our website at

&lt;p&gt;  ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA, Jul 31 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Athlone Global Security Corporation, an investment company specializing
in homeland security technologies, announced today the completion of a
new round of investment in Israel-based, DefenSoft, Ltd. An affiliate of
Goldman Sachs Asset Management also made an investment in the current
round.

    Headquartered in Yokneam, Israel, DefenSoft was established in 2002 to
bring modeling and simulation tools proven by the founders of DefenSoft
in other markets, for security system planning, design, performance
analysis and visualization. The toolkit is used by operational security
planners, analysts and engineers to automatically plan and optimize
complex security designs for protecting large outdoor areas, like country
borders, military bases, airports, seaports, utilities, industrial
complexes, and other critical infrastructure sites using proprietary
modeling and simulation techniques. 

    The DefenSoft security planning toolkit eliminates the guesswork for
determining sensor types and heights, sensor and communications tower
locations, and response force locations, while reducing security project
risk, costs and planning times. In the end, planners, analysts and
engineers have the confidence that the security system deployment planned
is the optimum - lowest cost with required coverage and accuracy. 

    DefenSoft established its subsidiary in the U.S. in January 2008 which
has since secured two contracts. Each contract is from a high-level
client known throughout the U.S. and abroad. Shay Peretz, President and
CEO of DefenSoft is proud to have had the support to make this happen so
early in the start-up of a new business. Both contracts are dual purpose. 

    The first contract was awarded for the evaluation of existing and future
security deployments at an international airport. It will also be used to
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using the DefenSoft toolkit as
compared with existing tools and methodologies used at airports. The
second contract is for the evaluation of existing communication
infrastructure in a remote area, consisting of 50 towers, and the
planning for five additional towers. It will also be used to evaluate the
toolkit cost-effectiveness for large open areas.

    About DefenSoft Planning Corporation 

    DefenSoft is one of eight current companies in the Athlone Global
Security Corporation portfolio that specializes in homeland security
technologies and solutions. The company's next-generation software
significantly enhances the planning processes required to implement
defense arrays and surveillance systems accurately and effectively.
DefenSoft platforms help protect vulnerable and strategic assets where
geographical terrain and critical infrastructure require impenetrable
security against breach threats. DefenSoft's technological edge lies in
its interdisciplinary "think tank" team of engineers and planners with
operational experience as well as management experts specializing in
homeland security, defense, 3D graphics, GIS and civil engineering.

&lt;p&gt;Disney's Animal Programs Leads International Effort to Help Africa Manage Growing Elephant Populations

LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Disney's Animal Programs is leading an international coalition of
veterinarians, conservation groups, zoos, universities and private
industry to conduct a series of procedures to effectively sterilize
male elephants and help reduce the elephant birth rates in areas of
South Africa. The team expects to perform laparoscopic vasectomies on
eight bull elephants at the Pongola Game Reserve in Kwa-Zulu Natal,
South Africa.

   Elephant overpopulation in wildlife parks and reserves in southern
Africa is a growing problem that can have devastating effects on the
natural habitat as well as other animal species that live there.
Wildlife officials in several countries are considering culling many
elephants in order to control the population growth.

   "Elephant population management is one of the most critical
conservation issues facing many areas of Africa" said Dr. Mark
Stetter, Director of Veterinary Services at Disney's Animal Programs
and principal investigator. "Through our recent successes, elephant
vasectomies have been an effective tool at several wildlife reserves
to reduce the need for culling, and help support the ecosystem. As an
accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) we
are committed to pioneering creative solutions to problems facing all
wildlife by using the technology and tools available to address
conservation and wildlife issues."

   In July 2004, this team of experts performed the first ever
sterilization of free-ranging female elephants. In 2005, the group
began its work with bull elephants and started developing laparoscopic
vasectomy techniques for sterilizing males in the wild. The team
returned to South Africa in 2006 and 2007 and effectively sterilized
bull elephants at the Welgevonden Wildlife Reserve and the Songimvelo
Wildlife Reserve.

   Elephants are unique among most mammals since their testes are
internal and require abdominal surgery to perform a vasectomy, making
the traditional procedure nearly impossible to do in the wild. This
innovative new procedure involves state-of-the-art medical equipment
specifically developed for this project and scaled from human to
elephant proportions. The elephant laparoscopic equipment was built by
the Karl Storz Company at their headquarters in Germany. Laparoscopic
surgery allows the surgeon to view the internal organs on a monitor
and use long thin instruments to perform the surgery. With this type
of minimally invasive surgery, the risk of infection is decreased, the
procedure time is significantly reduced and there is less
post-operative discomfort.

   Wildlife scientists and rangers will use telemetry tracking
collars placed on the elephants during the procedure, to closely
monitor the animals and ensure there are no post-operative
complications. All bull elephants that have had this procedure in 2006
and 2007, have fully recovered and shown no side effects from the
procedure. A vasectomy effectively sterilizes the bull elephants while
maintaining normal hormone levels and normal elephant social
behaviors.

   "Disney's Animal Programs commitment to the animal population is
truly admirable," said Jeff Hunt, President of Covidien's Patient Care
and Safety Products global business unit. "Minimally invasive surgery
has been implemented for years in people and more recently available
for pets - and now even wildlife. We are proud to participate with
this coalition's innovative approach to solving a complex conservation
issue."

   This is an international collaborative project that brings
together conservation groups, universities and private industry
including Disney's Animal Programs, Colorado State University/College
of Veterinary Medicine, the Zoological Society of San Diego, Covidien,
the Karl Storz Company, Catchco Africa - Wildlife Specialists, the
Veterinary College of South Africa at Onderstepoort and the Pongola
Game Reserve to address this complex problem. The long-term goal is to
have in country trained specialists and elephant laparoscopic
equipment to be able to provide this service to wildlife parks
throughout Southern Africa.

   U.S. Commercial Spending Grew 5.5 Percent to $19.7 Trillion in
2007
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Annual global commercial spending grew to an estimated $77.3
trillion in 2007, an increase of 12.2 percent from $68.9 trillion in
2006, according to data from the Commercial Consumption Expenditure
(CCE) index released today by Visa Inc. (NYSE: V). Commercial spending
in the United States grew to an estimated $19.7 trillion in 2007, up
5.5 percent from the 2006 total of $18.7 trillion.

   According to index estimates, spending in all global geographic
areas rose during the year. Europe represented the largest share of
commercial spending, followed by the United States, Asia/Pacific,
Central and Eastern Europe/Middle East/Africa, Latin America/Caribbean
and Canada. The CCE index is a financial metric that provides
standardized tracking of business and government spending globally and
is recognized as an industry benchmark for measuring commercial
spending.

   "The CCE index was developed by Visa to measure the penetration of
commercial payment products and to help client financial institutions
develop solutions tailored to meet the evolving payments needs of
business and government," said Darren Parslow, Head of Global
Commercial Products, Visa Inc. "Along with Visa's comprehensive suite
of commercial payment products, the CCE index helps Visa commercial
issuers to better serve organizations of all sizes in managing their
commercial payments."

   CCE Methodology

   The CCE index captures business to business purchases to acquire
goods and services used in production, wholesale and retail purchases
of final goods, business capital expenditures and government spending
on goods and services. Adjustments are made to exclude capitalized
expenditures such as construction and durable defense spending.
Calculations measure transactions at basic prices which include taxes
on production. Retroactive adjustments are made as necessary to
include revisions in officially published statistics and economic data
for current and prior years.

   Data sources used to calculate the U.S. CCE index include the
Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and U.S. Census Bureau which
conducts the Retail and Wholesale Trade Surveys. A variety of data
sources were used in the calculation of the Global CCE index including
the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the
STructural ANalysis (STAN) Database, the General Government Accounts
from the National Accounts of OECD Countries, the United Nations
Statistics Division National Accounts Main Aggregates Database,
Economist Intelligence Unit proprietary databases and government data
from several countries. A model developed by the Economist
Intelligence Unit was used to estimate results for countries where
government data was unavailable.

   This year, the U.S. CCE index was modified to include retail and
wholesale intermediate inputs which brings it into alignment with the
Global CCE index. Also, the U.S. segmentation methodology was revised
to improve consistency across all business segments. Results for
current and prior years include these adjustments.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds further details, background, CEO comment)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By George Hatzidakis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATHENS, July 31 (Reuters) - Greece's Coca-Cola Hellenic
(CCH) HLB.AT confirmed its 2008 earnings targets on Thursday,
despite concerns the global economic downturn and high commodity
prices will weigh on its performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's No.2 Coke drinks bottler reported its first
quarterly profit drop in more than five years on high raw
material costs, bad weather and economic slowdowns in key
markets, which led to fewer people buying their products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's our first quarterly drop in 21 quarters and, yes, we
are concerned," Doros Constantinou, CCH's managing director told
Reuters. "We have to remain watchful as does the rest of the
industry. We are confident we can meet our targets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bottlers globally have been hard hit as costs for basic
commodities, such as oil used for plastic bottles (PET) and corn
syrup used to sweeten drinks, continue to rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coupled with a downturn in economic sentiment worldwide and
adverse weather conditions, which has seen people less willing
to spend money on soft drinks, concerns have been stoked that
businesses such as CCH are headed towards a downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CCH reported an 8 percent fall in second-quarter net profit
to 182 million euros ($284.3 million), above expectations, with
operating profit down 9 percent to 247 million euros. Sales
volume in the quarter rose 3 percent to 585 million unit cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "For the second half, our main concern is commodity prices
and sustained bad weather," said Constantonou. "For the time
being, we can cope with the challenges, but if problems persist,
not just us, but other businesses will be affected as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, CCH has taken cost cutting and other measures to
combat concerns which forced it last month to cut full year
earnings per share (EPS) growth targets by about half to
1.37-1.40 euros a share, down from previous guidance of
1.46-1.49 euros a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Most of our commodities (costs) are locked in, such as for
sugar, aluminium and juice so we have good visibility on those,
but PET does remain an open item that we will watch," CFO Nik
Jhangiani told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CCH, 23.3 percent owned by Coca Cola (KO.N), reaffirmed its
revised targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While we remain cautious at this point we believe we can
deliver on the revised guidance. We are obviously doing things
to ensure we can protect our profitability," Jhangiani said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CCH shares rose rose 4.3 percent to 15.90 euros in early
trade in Athens, partly on market optimism that the group's
targets would be met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The company reiterated its guidance. Investors were afraid
the company would further downgrade its targets, after the

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Sam Raimi, the director of Sony's "Spider-Man" films, is going Disney for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The studio has picked up "The Transplants," an action-adventure described as a superhero story with a comedic bent. The project was pitched by scribes Adam Jay Epstein and Andrew Jacobson, who are best known for "Not Another Teen Movie."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raimi is known more for his horror fare and "Spider-Man" movies, not to mention his comedic sensibilities that attract the geek audience. Disney, on the other hand, isn't exactly known for its edge, with fare that plays fairly broad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, a few projects and names pop from the Disney slate, such as the Bruce Willis sci-fi actioner "Surrogates" and the Tim Burton-directed "Alice in Wonderland," which is sure to attract literary hipsters as much as families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N), the world's largest
credit card network, said on Wednesday that quarterly earnings
rose 41 percent, beating estimates, as credit and debit card
processing volume jumped globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The results were better than the average forecast of
analysts, according to Reuters Estimates, and the company's
shares edged higher in after-hours trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors are watching credit card processors closely for
evidence that slowing economic growth is weighing on results.
Visa makes money from processing transactions and does not
lend, making it immune to credit concerns, but exposed to
overall spending volume, whose growth could slow if the economy
weakens enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Offsetting the potential for spending volume to slow is the
fact that more consumers globally, particularly in the
developing world, are embracing credit and debit cards for
everyday spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Visa continues to ... benefit from the global migration to
electronic payments," Joe Saunders, Visa's chairman and chief
executive officer, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa said payments volume grew 19 percent for the quarter
ended March 31. Volume in that quarter translates to revenue in
the quarter ended June 30. Growth came from the U.S., but also
Asia and Latin America, among other places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With that growth, Visa boosted its forecast for operating
margins for the year to the mid-to-high 40-percent region,
compared with its prior estimates of the low 40 percent area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa said net income for the fiscal third quarter ended
June 30 was $422 million, or 51 cents per class A share,
compared with pro forma results of $299 million in the same
quarter a year earlier, when the company was privately held.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excluding litigation, restructuring and other expenses and
items, the company earned 59 cents per class A share, compared
with analysts' average forecast of 50 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Total operating revenue rose to $1.61 billion from $1.37
billion in the same quarter a year earlier. International
transaction fee revenue rose 44 percent to $449 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa shares rose 1.6 percent to $79.70 in after-hours
trade. The company's shares trade at about 30 times expected
fiscal 2009 earnings, a significantly higher multiple than the
broader market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa went public in March at $44 a share in the biggest
U.S. initial public offering ever, and has since risen about 78
percent while the Standard  Poor's 500 index .SPX is
essentially unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Dan Wilchins; Editing by Ted Kerr, Phil
