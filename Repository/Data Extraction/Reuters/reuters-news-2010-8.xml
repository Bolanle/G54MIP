&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today said that it will not sell upgrades for the upcoming Office for Mac 2011, mimicking the move it made earlier this year when it ditched upgrades for the Windows Office 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new suite's lowest-priced edition will also lack a dedicated e-mail client, another decision copied from Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier Monday, Microsoft set an end-of-October launch of Office for Mac 2011; debuted a free offer for anyone who purchases its predecessor, Office for Mac 2008, between Aug. 1 and Nov. 30; and revamped the editions it will offer and their prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft acknowledged that the last of those three was to bring the Mac version of its suite in line with the more widely-sold Windows edition. "For better alignment across platforms, the Office 2011 pricing and edition options map closer with Office for the Windows operating system," said Microsoft in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft touted the new prices. "The new Office 2011 lineup makes purchasing decisions easier -- with a lower price-per-installation for all editions ... [and] these changes ensure that customers get the right products and applications at the right price."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prices will be lower at best, the same at worst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entry-level edition, Home and Student 2011, costs $149 for a three-license version, the same price as the comparable 2008 package. But the new single-license version will run $119, a savings of $30 for those who have only one computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a per-install basis, however, the $119 edition is no bargain: Users who have two computers can effectively get Office 2011 (or the current 2008) for just $75 per machine, and if they install it on three Macs, the cost drops to less than $50 per system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has not offered an upgrade price for Home and Student in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation's better for buyers looking at Office for Mac Home and Business 2011, which, like the cheaper Home and Student, takes its name from a Windows edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There, the single-license version runs $199, a $41 savings from the $240 upgrade price for the comparable Office 2008 edition, Office for Business 2008. A two-license package of Home and Business 2011 will cost $279, or $140 per installation, significantly less that the $400 for the current full version of Mac Office for Business 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers used to upgrading still save under Home and Business' pricing, since an upgrade to what had originally been called Office for Mac 2008 -- and later renamed Business -- was for just one license.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the introduction of the one-license versions of Home and Student and Home and Business, Microsoft is taking the Mac edition of Office down the same path walked earlier by Office 2010. In January 2010, Microsoft confirmed that it would not offer "upgrade" pricing for Office 2010, a move that effectively raised the cost for some users planning on migrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, Microsoft has sold discounted versions to users who already have an earlier edition on their PCs, whether that's Office or Windows. This year, Microsoft instead instituted the same single-license pricing it announced today for the Mac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's unclear whether Microsoft will also mimic Office 2010's product key card -- a small credit card-sized piece of plastic sold at retail that includes a single license activation key -- for the Mac. Microsoft has pitched the key card as a simpler way to obtain upgrade rights to Office 2010. The public relations firm that handles Office for the Mac for Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is also duplicating the application mix of its Windows suite in the Mac versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office for Mac Home and Student 2011, for example, will not include the Outlook e-mail client, just as Office Home and Student on Windows omits that program. That's a change for Mac users, who have been getting the Entourage e-mail software with the 2008 version of Mac Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The users most likely to be affected are those who were buying Home and Student 2008, then running Entourage rather than Apple's own Mail client. The copy of Entourage in Home and Student was deliberately crippled so it could not connect with a company's Exchange mail server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will also sell an academic edition of Office 2011 for $99 that includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook -- the same apps included with Home and Business -- to college students, faculty and staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keep customers buying Office 2008, Microsoft launched a Technology Guarantee program Monday that will let users download a free copy of Office 2011 if they purchased the older edition between Aug. 1 and the end of November. Consumers who purchase Office for Mac Home and Student 2008 will get the three-license version of the 2011 suite, while people who buy the 2008 Business Edition in full, upgrade or student versions will receive a free copy of the two-license Home and Business 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information on the free upgrade program has been published on Microsoft's Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office for Mac was last upgraded in January 2009 , when Microsoft released the 2008 edition several months later than projected earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rarely finds itself in second place, but Microsoft's head of server virtualization says he doesn't mind playing catch-up to VMware in the hypervisor market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, Microsoft's Mike Neil notes that Hyper-V's market share is growing faster than VMware's, and says "that's a good position for us to be in." A skeptic might say outpacing VMware's growth isn't much of an achievement, because Microsoft is starting from a far smaller user base, and gets easy access to customers by offering Hyper-V as a component of Windows Server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMware vs. Microsoft vs. Citrix&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Neil expresses confidence for another reason, simply that VMware customers are by and large also Windows customers. Microsoft and its virtualization partner Citrix have repeatedly butted heads with VMware, notably by pulling out as sponsors of last year's VMworld conference after claiming that VMware unfairly limited competition at the show. h&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft will maintain a limited presence at VMworld in San Francisco Aug. 30 to Sept. 2, as it did last year, and make its pitch to VMware customers. VMware, by the way, is led by CEO Paul Maritz, a former Microsoft official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The vast majority of people running VMware are running Windows," says Neil, general manager of Microsoft's server virtualization and Windows Server division. "That's the reason I go to something like VMworld. People who are running Windows are running it on top of VMware and I want to make sure they're having the best experience they can. From our perspective, regardless of whether customers are running on Hyper-V or VMware, first and foremost they're a Windows customer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neil made the comments during an interview at last week's Burton Group Catalyst conference, which featured a little bit of sparring between VMware and its rivals Microsoft and Citrix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citrix CTO Simon Crosby was quite outspoken against VMware, taking shots on-stage at the company's security model and writing in a tweet that VMware's SpringSource general manager Rod Johnson's speech was "patently nonsensical."&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's a competitor," Johnson said of Crosby, during an interview. "I wouldn't argue with Simon about virtualization, but he probably shouldn't argue with me about Java and middleware."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On stage, Crosby said the Xen virtualization security model has proven its capabilities in the Amazon cloud, while Neil said VMware has acted irresponsibly by attempting to take antivirus agents out of guest operating systems, in effect moving security to the hypervisor layer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMware senior director Allwyn Sequeira clarified that VMware's official position does not recommend taking antivirus tools out of guest operating systems, but he did say that running antivirus in every guest OS is inefficient. Sequeira also said that open source software such as Xen isn't automatically more secure than proprietary systems such as VMware's. Crosby pounced on this statement, noting that VMware's SpringSource software is based on open source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He told you that SpringSource is not secure. SpringSource is not ready for the enterprise," Crosby said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comment seemed primarily to be a joke but is indicative of tensions between VMware and its rivals heading into VMworld. Last year, Microsoft claimed new VMworld rules prevented it from exhibiting its System Center Virtual Machine Manager technology at the conference, which VMware hosts, but set up a small booth on the show floor anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMware's new rules prevented vendors from sponsoring VMworld if they are not members of VMware's Technology Alliance Partner program, but VMware said the rule should not have prevented Microsoft from exhibiting competing products. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMware said the rule changes were spurred by Microsoft "shenanigans" in 2008, when Microsoft gave attendees poker chips in a package that said "Looking for your best bet? You won't find it with VMware."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conflicts aside, Microsoft and VMware have to work together because customers use the two companies' technologies in tandem. A VMware customer may not want to virtualize Windows with Hyper-V, but that customer is still using Windows.As such, VMware's hypervisor has been certified to work on Windows technology, and customers can call either VMware or Microsoft in case of system failures. "We have mechanisms between the two companies, we can hand off technical support issues between the two companies," Neil said.Use of Hyper-V has more than doubled in the past year, but it is still only the third most used hypervisor, after two VMware products: VMware ESX and VMware Server, according to IDC. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft has been outspoken in its criticism of VMware, Neil blamed VMware for much of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously VMware has taken sort of an anti-Microsoft stance, they don't want to be a partner of ours in the traditional sense," Neil said. "But like I said it's the same set of customers, so we're going to talk to them regardless."&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow Jon Brodkin on Twitter: www.twitter.com/jbrodkin&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more about data center in Network World's Data Center section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;As promised, Microsoft today issued an emergency patch for the critical Windows shortcut bug attackers have been exploiting for several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also as pledged, Microsoft did not deliver a fix for users running Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) or Windows 2000, which were retired from support three weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was little in Monday's accompanying bulletin that wasn't already known, noted Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was almost entirely public at this point," said Storms. "The only question I had was whether Microsoft would try and release a patch for unsupported operating systems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storms' reference was to XP SP2 and Windows 2000. "There's a ton of people still running SP2, and it just went end-of-life," Storms argued. "And SCADA systems typically run on older versions of the OS. I thought Microsoft might be strong-armed by SCADA vendors into releasing a fix for SP2."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft stuck to its long-standing policy and did not provide patches for machines running Windows XP SP2, Windows 2000 or any other off-support version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability addressed today was first described in mid-June by VirusBlokAda, a little-known security firm based in Belarus, but attracted widespread attention only after security blogger Brian Krebs reported on it July 15. A day later, Microsoft admitted that attackers were already exploiting the flaw using the "Stuxnet" worm , which targets Windows PCs that manage large-scale industrial-control systems in manufacturing and utility firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those control systems are often dubbed SCADA, for "supervisory control and data acquisition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flaw was in how Windows parsed shortcut files, the small files displayed by icons on the desktop, on the toolbar and in the Start menu that launch applications and documents when clicked. By crafting malicious shortcuts, hackers could automatically execute malware whenever a user viewed the shortcut or the contents of a folder containing the malevolent shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploit code went public last month, and Microsoft and others have spotted several attack campaigns based on the bug. When the company announced last Friday that it would patch the shortcut bug today, it also said that it had seen the virulent "Sality" malware family using the shortcut exploit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft patched the problem by "correctly validating the icon reference of a shortcut," according to MS10-046 bulletin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also told users who had deployed a recommended workaround -- which involved disabling the displaying of all shortcuts -- to undo that workaround after applying the patch. Scattered reports on the Web, however, have noted problems unless the workaround is reversed before the patch is applied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Microsoft's patch results in a new version of Shell32.dll being pushed to users, the quality of the update will be important: Shell32.dll is a crucial Windows library file that contains numerous Windows Shell API (application programming interface) functions. If it's flawed, or incorrectly updated on some machines, PCs will lock up with the notorious Blue Screen of Death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storms didn't think there was anything to worry about. "They patched a Windows kernel bug in 20 days back in January," Storms pointed out. "They probably understand the risks here by going out-of-band."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jason Miller, data and security team manager for Shavlik Technologies, said he wasn't expecting a rush patch because of the proximity of August's regular security updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not uncommon for Microsoft to release out-of-band," said Miller, "but Patch Tuesday is just a week away. I expected that they would just wait until then."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's regularly-scheduled monthly updates are to ship Aug. 10, a week from tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Miller, out-of-band updates are usually released in-between a pair of Patch Tuesdays, in other words, approximately two weeks before the next slated release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft must have seen something in this that prompted them to release now," said Miller, referring to last Friday's announcement that Sality had begun exploiting the shortcut bug. "I'd bet that they're probably expecting that we'll see an additional uptick in attacks as other viruses add this [exploit] to their payloads," Miller concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patch, which is available for all still-supported versions of Windows, including XP SP3, Vista, Windows 7 , Server 2003, Server 2008 and Server 2008 R2, can be downloaded and installed via the Microsoft Update and Windows Update services, as well as through Windows Server Update Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;For the second straight month, Microsoft's Internet Explorer (IE) browser gained ground in the usage share race, a company manager said today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Net Applications, the Web metrics firm whose data Microsoft cited, IE's gains came at the expense of both Mozilla's Firefox and Google's Chrome, with the former posting its biggest one-month decline in more than a year while the latter's loss broke a string of 20 consecutive months of increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of July, IE accounted for 60.7% of all browsers used globally, Net Applications' data revealed. The increase of four-tenths of a percentage point was the second month in a row that IE jumped, and after June's, was the second-highest increase recorded for the browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has never seen two straight months of IE increases in Net Applications' numbers: Its occasional bumps have been single-month gains, with a return the next month to IE's long-term decline. IE's gains in July effectively turned back the clock to last March, when IE also owned a 60.7% share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it has the last three months, Microsoft used Net Applications' numbers to trumpet the success of its browser strategy. "To see two consecutive months worldwide is encouraging and promising," said Roger Capriotti, a product management lead on the IE team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capriotti also boasted of gains made by Microsoft's newest browser, IE8', repeating what other IE team members have said previously. "IE8 is the most widely-used and the fastest-growing browser," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IE's overall gains were again due to IE8, the 2009 browser that's integrated with the also-surging Windows 7 . Globally, IE8 gained just over one percentage point to end the month with a 26.9% share. When the number for the browser's compatibility mode -- a feature that lets it properly render pages designed for older editions -- is taken into account, IE8 total usage share was 30.3%, the largest for any one browser edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., IE8 did even better than its worldwide average, said Capriotti. "IE8 increased its U.S. share to 42.2%," he said, with a surge of almost 1.4 percentage points during July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capriotti acknowledged that Windows 7 's success has helped IE8, but argued that the browser had been doing well before that operating system launched last October. "Windows 7 has definitely had a halo effect," he said, "but we grew IE8 to a sizable number before Windows 7's release." By Net Applications' numbers, IE8 had climbed to 18.1% by October 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he refused to speculate on whether the two-month increase would be sustained, or whether the release of IE9 -- the next upgrade slated to ship in beta next month -- would maintain the momentum. His only comment: "You'll see great things from IE9."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like last month, several browsers lost share to IE's surge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mozilla's Firefox slipped to 22.9%, a drop of nine-tenths of a percentage point, nearly the equal of the browser's record 1.1-point fall in May 2009. July's slide was not only the second-largest ever for the browser, but the third in a row and the sixth in the last eight months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firefox, once seemingly a lock to reach, then soar by the 25% milestone, now holds about the same share it did in August 2009, just a two months after the major upgrade Firefox 3.5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More unusual was Chrome's dip in July. Google's browser lost one-tenth of one percentage point during the month to end at 7.1%. According to Net Applications, the decline was the first for Chrome since October 2008, the month after Google introduced its browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chrome's increases were slowing before last month: In both May and June, Chrome's gains globally were significantly smaller than its 12-month average. And as early as May, Net Applications tracked a fall-off in Chrome's U.S. numbers, a fact that Microsoft used to claim its rival was already "in retreat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Capriotti declined to speculate about the reason for Chrome's July drop, saying that the numbers spoke for themselves. "Chrome picked up share in a short period of time, but it has slowed dramatically the last few months," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other browsers fared better than Firefox and Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple 's Safari gained two-tenths of a percentage point to end July at 5.1%, a record for the browser, while Opera Software's namesake climbed by two-tenths of a point to 2.5%, also a record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safari's share is actually larger than that of Mac OS X on the operating system side -- 5.1% for the browser, 5% for OS X. That, too, is a first, perhaps explained by the fact that although Safari is bundled with Apple's operating system, it's also available in a version for Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While IE8 boosted Microsoft's overall share, other versions continued to slide. IE7, which debuted in 2006 alongside Windows Vista, lost four-tenths of a percentage point to end at a historical low of 11.4%. The even older IE6 -- which Microsoft is determined to kill -- fell two-tenths of a point to 17%, and still accounts for more than a quarter of all versions of IE in use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The battle [to drive IE6 into extinction] is definitely winnable," said Capriotti, talking about Microsoft's overt campaign to convince users to ditch the old browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numbers for July from rival Web metrics firm StatCounter were significantly different from those of Net Applications. The Irish company pegged IE's global usage share at 52.7%, a drop of nearly two-tenths of a percentage point from June, and it had Firefox at 30.7% and Chrome at 9.9%, for a decline of one-half of a percentage point and an increase of six-tenths of a percentage point, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net Applications uses data acquired from the 160 million unique visitors who browse the 40,000 Web sites it monitors for clients to calculate its usage share number. The firm's July browser usage share data is available on its site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

Chevron Profits Shoot Up

Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) -- the second largest U.S. oil company --
reported a jump in its second-quarter 2010 profits. 

As has been the case with the other integrateds that have already reported, such
as ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM), ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) and Royal Dutch Shell PLC
(NYSE: RDS.A), results were boosted by higher fuel prices. Robust upstream
production growth and buoyant downstream margins also contributed towards
Chevron`s strong results. 

Earnings per share (excluding foreign-currency effects) came in at $2.58, ahead
of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.43 and more than double that of the
year-ago adjusted profit of $1.10. 

Quarterly revenue of $53.0 billion was up 31.8% from the year-earlier level and
was 2.6% above our projection. 

Upstream

Chevron`s total production of crude oil and natural gas increased 2.9% from the
year-earlier level to 2,746 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (MBOE/d),
driven by new project start-ups and the continued ramp-up of existing fields in
the U.S. and Brazil, expansion of capacity at Tengiz in Kazakhstan, together
with the restoration of Gulf of Mexico volumes that were offline in the second
quarter of 2009 due to hurricanes. 

U.S. volumes rose marginally (by 1.1%), while Chevron`s international operations
experienced an approximately 3.5% rise in output. Gains on the production front
were supported by higher realized oil and gas prices, resulting in a 174.1%
year-over-year rise in upstream earnings to $4.5 billion. 

Production Outlook

Chevron`s production outlook remains one of the most robust in its peer group,
with a number of major deepwater projects scheduled to come online during the
next few years. Major start-ups during the last few months include the Tahiti
and Perdido in the Gulf of Mexico, Frade offshore Brazil and Tombua-Landana in
Angola. 

Downstream

Chevron`s downstream segment's earnings soared to $975 million during the
quarter, as against a profit of just $131 million in the previous-year period.
The positive comparison can be attributed to improved refined products margins
and higher earnings from chemical operations, primarily from the 50%-owned
Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC. 

Capital Expenditure &amp; Balance Sheet

Chevron spent $5.0 billion in capital expenditures during the quarter, up
marginally from the year-earlier level. Approximately 88% of the total outlays
pertained to upstream projects. At the end of the quarter, the company had $9.4
billion in cash and total debt of $10.5 billion, with a debt-to-total
capitalization ratio of about 9.5%. 

New Share Repurchase Program

Chevron informed that it has terminated its three-year, $15 billion share
repurchase program that was started in 2007. The San Ramon, California-based oil
behemoth approved a new, ongoing share repurchase program with no set term or
monetary limits. Chevron further pointed out that it does not plan to purchase
any shares in the third quarter. 

Our Recommendation

Despite the second quarter results and the strong outlook, our short-term as
well as long-term recommendations on Chevron remain Hold (Zacks #3 Rank) and
Neutral, respectively. 

We like Chevron`s strong pipeline of development projects and impressive recent
exploration successes that will drive its long-term success. The company`s high
oil price sensitivity and rebounding downstream operations add to the positive
sentiment. 

However, production shortfalls associated with PSC (Production Sharing Contract)
interest reductions, exploration results and unpredictable downstream
performance continue to keep us on the sidelines.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is issuing an out-of-band patch today to address rising attacks against the Windows shortcut vulnerability discovered last month. The update comes just over a week ahead of the regularly scheduled Patch Tuesday for the month of August, but leaves Windows 2000 and Windows XP SP2 systems to fend for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft Malware Protection Center noted "Although there have been multiple malware families that have picked up this vector, one in particular caught our attention this week--a family named Sality, and specifically Sality.AT. Sality is a highly virulent strain. It is known to infect other files (making full removal after infection challenging), copy itself to removable media, disable security, and then download other malware. It is also a very large family--one of the most prevalent families this year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To protect customers against a rising tide of attacks--like Sality--which exploit the LNK flaw in Windows, Microsoft expedited the release of the patch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qualys CTO Wolfgang Kandek points out in a blog post that "Primary attack vectors for the LNK vulnerability are USB sticks and shared drives, the attack depends on a specially crafted LNK file and a custom DLL to function. Remote attacks through e-mail or websites are theoretically possible, but require multiple steps and user interaction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kandek explained "Windows 2000 and XP SP2 users will not be covered and are now in a predicament that will become increasingly urgent. Attacks will continue to become more prevalent and their defensive options are limited."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft does provide advice for a workaround that could mitigate the risk on these legacy platforms in security advisory KB2286198. However, implementing the workaround seriously impedes the usability of the Windows system. All desktop icons are disabled--replaced with a blank white sheet, and network navigation is affected as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many companies face hurdles in migrating to newer operating system platforms. Reliance on archaic legacy applications which are not compatible with a newer OS like Windows 7 for critical business functions means hanging on to outdated Windows platforms. Some companies simply feel that the current environment is working fine and there is no compelling reason to invest the time and money required to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the justification for clinging to unsupported Windows operating systems, the time has come to seriously evaluate the alternatives to that decision. IT admins managing legacy Windows platforms are already at a disadvantage because Windows 2000 and Windows XP don't have the improved security features included in Windows 7. Now that support for those platforms has expired, IT admins must face new threats and exploits without any patches or updates from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IT admins can provide additional protection against remote attempts to exploit this vulnerability by disabling the SMB and WebDAV protocols for outbound traffic on Internet-facing firewalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are mitigations and workarounds, but IT admins can only stop the damn from breaking for so long. It's time for companies to seriously look at applying SP3 if they are running Windows XP, or simply upgrading the operating system entirely and making the move to Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * European Commission starts two investigations into IBM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * One probe follows emulator software vendors' complaints&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * TurboHercules welcomes probe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * IBM says will cooperate, claims have no merit
 (Adds TurboHercules' statement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Marcin Grajewski and Foo Yun Chee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BRUSSELS, July 26 (Reuters) - European Union competition
regulators launched two anti-trust investigations against
International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), suspecting it of
abusing its dominant position in the mainframe computer
market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One investigation followed complaints by emulator software
vendors T3 Technologies Inc and TurboHercules against IBM's
practices, and focuses on the U.S. computer group's alleged
tying of mainframe hardware to its mainframe operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second probe, opened on the European Commission's own
initiative, concerns alleged discriminatory behaviour towards
competing suppliers of mainframe maintenance services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Commission has concerns that IBM may have engaged in
anti-competitive practices with a view to foreclosing the
market for maintenance services ... in particular by
restricting or delaying access to spare parts for which IBM is
the only source," said the Commission on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Commission enforces EU competition rules and can fine
companies that break them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM rejected the allegations but promised to cooperate
fully with the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "IBM is fully entitled to enforce its intellectual property
rights and protect the investments we have made in our
technologies," the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and its other big
competitors had inspired the Commission's action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The accusations made against IBM by TurboHercules and T3
are being driven by some of IBM's largest competitors -- led by
Microsoft," it said, adding that in this way the software
supplier wanted to cement the dominance of its Wintel servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A local Microsoft spokesman had no immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM shares dipped 0.5 percent in a flat U.S. market by 1356
GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mainframes are powerful computers which many large
companies and government institutions use to store and process
critical information. In 2009 customers spent approximately 8.5
billion euros ($11 billion) worldwide and 3 billion in the
European Economic Area on new mainframe hardware and operating
systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Commission said T3 and TurboHercules had alleged IBM
had been illegally tying its mainframe hardware products to its
dominant mainframe operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TurboHercules welcomed the Commission's probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Hopefully, it will lead to remedies that will allow
companies like TurboHercules to compete in the mainframe

mainframe applications on the hardware of their choice. It is

system to value the securities on which it sold credit
protection until December 2007.

at no additional cost.

&lt;p&gt;* RiskMetrics und Glass Lewis empfehlen Aktion&#228;ren, auf au&#223;erordentlicher
Vollversammlung gegen die Entsandten von Novartis zu stimmen
* Drei f&#252;hrende Experten im Bereich Corporate Governance zeigen sich besorgt
&#252;ber den Versuch von Novartis, Minderheitsaktion&#228;ren unfaires und n&#246;tigendes
Fusionsangebot aufzuzwingen

H&#220;NENBERG, Schweiz--(Business Wire)--
Der unabh&#228;ngige Aufsichtsratsausschuss von Alcon (der &#8222;Ausschuss") hat heute
bekannt gegeben, dass die RiskMetrics Group, Inc., und Glass Lewis &amp; Co., zwei
weltweit f&#252;hrende Dienstleister in den Bereichen Risikomanagement, Corporate
Governance und Vollmachtsberatung, empfohlen haben, dass Minderheitsaktion&#228;re
von Alcon gegen die Aufnahme aller f&#252;nf Entsandten der Novartis AG (&#8222;Novartis")
in den Verwaltungsrat von Alcon stimmen. Wie zuvor bekannt gegeben wurde, werden
Aktion&#228;re von Alcon gem&#228;&#223; den Bedingungen einer 2008 eingegangenen Vereinbarung
zwischen Novartis and Nestl&#233; SA anl&#228;sslich einer au&#223;erordentlichen
Vollversammlung am 16. August 2010 &#252;ber die Wahl der Entsandten von Novartis in
den Verwaltungsrat abstimmen. 

In einem deutlich formulierten Bericht, den RiskMetrics am 1. August an seine
Klienten verschickt hat, wird Novartis f&#252;r seine Position in Bezug auf das
Fusionsangebot und die Minderheitsaktion&#228;re getadelt. RiskMetrics merkte an,
dass die Stimmabgabe der Minderheitsaktion&#228;re als &#8222;Referendum" gegen den
&#220;bernahmeversuch von Novartis angesehen werden d&#252;rfte, obwohl das Resultat der
Abstimmung als sicher gilt. RiskMetrics stellte fest, dass die
Minderheitsaktion&#228;re &#8222;angesichts des signifikanten Nachhalls, den ihre
Stimmabgabe in zuk&#252;nftigen Verhandlungen zwischen dem Ausschuss und Novartis
haben k&#246;nnte", etliche Punkte in Verbindung mit der anstehenden Abstimmung
beachten sollten:

* Novartis hat &#246;ffentlich festgestellt, dass es nach Abschluss der
Nestl&#233;-Transaktion in der Lage sein wird, eine &#220;bernahme allein zu genehmigen,
und zwar unabh&#228;ngig von eventueller Opposition der Minderheitsaktion&#228;re. 
* Novartis h&#228;tte die Besorgnisse, ob seine f&#252;nf Entsandten sich den
Minderheitsaktion&#228;ren verpflichtet f&#252;hlen, zerstreuen k&#246;nnen, indem es die
Autorit&#228;t des Ausschusses anerkennt. Stattdessen wurde behauptet, dass der
Schutz von Minderheitsaktion&#228;ren in den organisationellen Regelungen von Alcon
hier nicht zutrifft. 
* Die Charakterisierung der vorgeschlagenen Direktoren von Novartis als
&#8222;unabh&#228;ngig" im Sinne der NYSE-Standards ist &#8222;eine irrelevante Antwort auf die
falsche Frage", welche die &#8222;&#228;u&#223;erst wichtige Frage, warum die Wahl von f&#252;nf
grunds&#228;tzlich konfliktbelasteten Direktoren durch den Anbieter in ihrem besten
Interesse sei", unbeantwortet l&#228;sst. 
* Und Novartis hat Besorgnisse dar&#252;ber gesch&#252;rt, dass es im Versuch, seinen
Fusionsvorschlag durchzudr&#252;cken, im Alleingang n&#246;tigende Verwaltungsratsman&#246;ver
unternehmen werde, indem Einschr&#228;nkungen f&#252;r den Hauptaktion&#228;r in den
organisationellen Regelungen von Alcon abgelehnt werden und die
NYSE-Unabh&#228;ngigkeit der Entsandten mit der wichtigeren Frage ihrer potenziellen
Interessenkonflikte zusammengeworfen wird.

RiskMetrics kam zu dem Schluss, dass &#8222;eine Unterst&#252;tzung dieser Entsandten von
Novartis [nicht] im besten Interesse der Minderheitsaktion&#228;re" sei, und empfahl,
dass &#8222;Minderheitsaktion&#228;re GEGEN die Wahl der Entsandten von Novartis stimmen." 

RiskMetrics stimmte der Sicht des Ausschusses zu, dass die f&#252;nf von Novartis
vorgeschlagenen Direktoren &#8222;Entsandte" seien, und zitierte Abschnitt 2.1(f) des
Anteilseignervertrags von 2008 zwischen Nestl&#233; und Novartis sowie Artikel VIII
der organisationellen Regelungen von Alcon. Die Direktoren seien daher
konfliktbeladen und m&#252;ssten sich bei allen Fragen in Verbindung mit Novartis der
Stimme enthalten. Der Ausschuss merkt an, dass der Terminus &#8222;Entsandte" dem
Artikel VIII der organisationellen Regelungen von Alcon nach der Transaktion
zwischen Nestl&#233; und Novartis im Jahr 2008 speziell hinzugef&#252;gt wurde. 

In einem Bericht, der den Klienten am 29. Juli zugesendet wurde, dr&#252;ckte Glass
Lewis seine Besorgnis &#252;ber den Versuch von Novartis aus, den
Minderheitsaktion&#228;ren ein unbilliges Angebot aufzun&#246;tigen, indem &#8222;ein
rechtliches Schlupfloch genutzt werde". Glass Lewis dr&#252;ckte die Erwartung aus,
dass die Entsandten von Novartis &#8222;in Bezug auf den Zusammenschluss die Position
von Novartis beziehen werden", woraus sich schlie&#223;en lasse, dass der Zuspruch
einer Sitzmehrheit im Rat an Novartis &#8222;nicht im Interesse der
Minderheitsaktion&#228;re" sei. Deswegen wird empfohlen, dass die Aktion&#228;re von Alcon
gegen alle Entsandten von Novartis in den Rat stimmen. 

Thomas G. Plaskett, Vorsitzender des Ausschusses, sagte: &#8222;Es handelt sich hier
um deutliche Aussagen f&#252;hrender unabh&#228;ngiger Experten im Bereich Corporate
Governance, und sie sind zu Recht besorgt &#252;ber den Versuch von Novartis, den
Minderheitsaktion&#228;ren ein extrem unangemessenes Angebot in eklatanter
Missachtung ihrer Rechte auf einen fairen Ablauf und fairen Wert aufzun&#246;tigen.
Wir sind erfreut dar&#252;ber, dass RiskMetrics Group wie auch Glass Lewis den klaren
Interessenkonflikt sehen, dem die Entsandten von Novartis in Bezug auf die
Transaktionen der beteiligten Parteien zwischen Alcon und Novartis ausgesetzt
sind. Dazu geh&#246;rt auch das Fusionsangebot von Novartis und damit verbundene
Themen. Diese Sichtweise best&#228;tigt die seit Langem bestehende Position des
Ausschusses in Bezug auf deren konfliktbeladenen Status und steht in
&#220;bereinstimmung mit den bew&#228;hrten Prinzipien der guten Corporate Governance. Wir
merken an, dass sowohl RiskMetrics als auch Glass Lewis empfehlen, dass die
Minderheitsaktion&#228;re ihre Stimmen auf der au&#223;erordentlichen Vollversammlung
nutzen, um Novartis die Botschaft zu &#252;bermitteln, dass sie angesichts der
n&#246;tigenden Taktiken von Novartis nicht unt&#228;tig bleiben werden." 

Zudem hat auch Manifest Information Services Ltd., europ&#228;ischer Ableger von
Proxy Governance, am 27. Juli einen Bericht an seine Klienten geschickt, in dem
Manifest verschiedenen Besorgnissen in Bezug auf die Wahl der Entsandten von
Novartis Ausdruck verleiht. Speziell gibt Manifest an: &#8222;Das Vorhandensein einer
Mehrheit der von Novartis ernannten Direktoren k&#246;nnte zu Konflikten f&#252;hren,
welche die Einheit und die T&#228;tigkeiten des Rates merklich beeintr&#228;chtigen."
Manifest empfiehlt den Aktion&#228;ren kein bestimmtes Abstimmungsverhalten. 

Das aktuelle Angebot von Novartis betr&#228;gt 2,8 Novartis-Aktien f&#252;r jede
ausgegebene Aktie von Alcon und wird derzeit mit ca. USD 136 bewertet. Dies
bedeutet einen Abschlag von ca. 25 % gegen&#252;ber den USD 181,71, die Nestl&#233; f&#252;r
die Abgabe der Aktienmehrheit erh&#228;lt, und Abschl&#228;ge von ca. 17 % bzw. 9 %
gegen&#252;ber den Preisen, die einen Tag bzw. einen Monat vor dem Angebot von
Novartis erzielt wurden. 

Greenhill &amp; Co., Sullivan &amp; Cromwell LLP und Pestalozzi (Z&#252;rich) sind weiterhin
beratend f&#252;r den Ausschuss t&#228;tig. 

Wichtige Informationen &#252;ber das Angebot werden weiterhin auf der Website des
Ausschusses ver&#246;ffentlicht: www.transactioninfo.com/alcon.

SAN FRANCISCO SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today launched Rightcliq&#8482; by Visa, an online shopping tool
that improves the way consumers browse and compare products, checkout on
merchant websites, and track packages to their doorstep. The web application
features the Wishspace, a visual wish list that lets consumers collect, organize
and share images of products they`re considering purchasing. Other key features
let consumers browse merchant offers from popular brands, easily solicit advice
from friends, and auto-fill payment information at point of sale using a digital
wallet that can hold any credit, debit or prepaid card. 

Visa developed Rightcliq to address many of the frustration points consumers
experience while shopping online and to help them make smart online buying
decisions. According to a recent Visa survey, half of all online shoppers rely
on inconvenient methods - like bookmarking and written lists - to track items
they are interested in buying, but not yet ready to purchase. More than 90
percent said they would do more online shopping if they had an easy way to
compare items and see available merchant discounts and promotions.1 Rightcliq`s
features address these opportunities and will help make online shopping simpler,
smarter, and more fun. 

"At Visa, we know consumers love to shop online, but they also want better ways
to streamline the experience and eliminate some of the frustrations they
encounter in the process," said Gerry Sweeney, global head of ecommerce and
authentication, Visa Inc. "Rightcliq is Visa`s answer to that consumer demand.
Our deep knowledge of our consumers` needs combined with our longstanding
commitment to making ecommerce more convenient, secure and rewarding has
resulted in a product that we believe will change the way people shop online.
Today Visa is synonymous with a better way to pay. Rightcliq is a key step
toward becoming the better way to shop." 

How Rightcliq Works

Rightcliq plays a role in every step of the online shopping process.

       &#8226;    Browse: As consumers browse merchant sites, the downloadable Rightcliq plug-in lets them add products of interest to the Wishspace with a simple click. Consumers can easily build a visual wish list of items that can be grouped into "bundles" and shared with their social network via email or Facebook. In addition to this social shopping experience, consumers will also see relevant offers from merchants, and can even share those offers with the same social networks.                                            
       &#8226;    Buy: Consumers can purchase items from the Wishspace by clicking through to merchant websites. At checkout, the plug-in lets consumers auto-fill personal, payment and shipping information that has been stored in their Rightcliq account, eliminating the inconvenience of searching for their wallet and manual data entry. The digital wallet helps consumers make the best payment choice at point of sale, but also allows them to store sensitive information in one secure place and decide when to share it with      
            merchants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
            When consumers choose to pay with a stored Visa account, they are guaranteed even more peace of mind thanks to protections consumers have come to expect from Visa - including Zero Liability for fraudulent transactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
       &#8226;    Delivery: After an online purchase has been made, Rightcliq makes package tracking easy by visually displaying the shipping status of all packages in one convenient location.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  


The launch of Rightcliq follows several months of live market testing which
enabled Visa to refine features based on user input. Visa plans to listen to
what users say they like, dislike and want to see in the future and enhance the
product based on that feedback. 

"Rightcliq is unique in the marketplace, as it adds value across the whole
shopping experience and offers the convenience and peace of mind consumers
expect from Visa," Sweeney said. "We think people will find Rightcliq not only
helps them make smarter shopping decisions, but also makes online shopping
simpler and more fun." 

To support the launch of Rightcliq, Visa is rolling out an integrated marketing
campaign that emphasizes how Rightcliq empowers online shoppers to make smarter
buying decisions. The campaign includes digital advertising, social media and
public relations, all with the intention of creating consumer awareness and
driving enrollment. 

Utilizing the line Power to the Shopper, elements of the campaign will address
two target consumers - the young trendsetter, who is a tech enthusiast and early
adopter of new products and services; and the shopping enthusiast, who loves
shopping online, comparing across sites and sharing finds with friends.
Co-founders of WhoWhatWear.com, Katherine Power and Hillary Kerr, are featured
as the fashion-expert faces of the campaign. Media focuses on product categories
where word-of-mouth plays an important role in influencing purchase decisions -
apparel, consumer electronics and movies/music. High-engagement creative will be
delivered through buys on Daily Candy, Federated Media, Gawker Media, Pitchfork,
Yahoo! Shine and WhoWhatWear.com. Gawker Media will feature a "Wish Big" Contest
where readers will enter to win their biggest wish by submitting their dream
Wishspace bundle. The contest will be promoted on Gizmodo and Lifehacker through
banners and sponsored posts. Additionally, Yahoo! Shine will feature a home page
roadblock that will include an expandable unit with up to six digital "magazine"
pages. Users can flip pages to learn more about the product, view videos, and
engage with the brand.

&lt;p&gt; * Says priced AIG's collateral based on available info&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Valuation details revealed in report submitted to FCIC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aug 2 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) said that it believed
its trades with the bailed out insurer AIG (AIG.N) during the
financial crisis were accurate and its collateral calls made to
AIG were reflective of the conditions in a deteriorated market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a response submitted to the Financial Crisis Inquiry
Commission (FCIC) on July 28, Goldman said it priced the
collateral posted by AIG based on the best available market
information at the time, including observed trades, actionable
bids or offers from other parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We made those collateral calls based on prices that
reflected the deteriorating conditions in the market for the
underlying collateral in Residential Mortgage Backed Securities
and CDOs," Goldman said in its report to the FCIC that was
obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On July 23, a source told Reuters that Goldman Sachs had
turned over a list of the counterparties to the FCIC following a
recent hearing exploring the links between Goldman and AIG.
[ID:nN23175125]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has long been criticized for benefiting from the
U.S. taxpayer bailout of AIG. Taxpayers pledged up to $182
billion to address problems at AIG's financial products
division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The foundation of our approach to risk management is based
upon disciplined mark-to-market accounting," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said it had also used other market information
obtained through its franchise for pricing collateralized debt
obligations (CDOs) posted by AIG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "From July of 2007 through November of 2008 there was
observable market data which provided the basis for our
collateral requests to AIG," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also said AIG did not have an internal pricing
system to value the securities on which it sold credit
protection until December 2007.

&lt;p&gt;LIMA (Reuters) - At least one farmer died on Tuesday when police cleared a roadblock set by coca growers demanding the government halt efforts to eradicate coca plantations in the world's top producer of the leaf, used to make cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clash, which injured at least two other growers, occurred in the Padre Abad province of the region of Ucayali, 484 miles east of the capital of Lima.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juan Zarate, the director of the eradication program in the area, said police forcefully responded to protesters carrying guns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Violence associated with eradication is relatively rare though it may intensify as President Alan Garcia comes under additional pressure to slow the spread of coca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Nations recently said Peru has overtaken Colombia as the biggest grower and Peru resumed eradication efforts in January after a long pause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the country's main coca growing regions, the Alto Huallaga and the Ene and Apurimac valleys, police and soldiers trying to catch drug runners periodically fight with remnant bands of leftist Shining Path rebels who moved into the cocaine trade after their leaders were captured in the 1990s for waging a war against the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Patricia Velez; Writing by Terry Wade; Editing by Jackie Frank)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atlantic Magazine Exposes Offer to Journalist to Go Undercover to Sabotage $27
Billion Environmental Case
LAGO AGRIO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
Chevron, long accused of engaging in an illegal dirty tricks campaign in
Ecuador, tried to recruit an American journalist to take part in a corporate
espionage spy ring in Ecuador`s Amazon to undermine an expected multi-billion
judgment against the oil giant in a high-profile environmental lawsuit,
according to an article published in the latest issue of The Atlantic. 

Mary Cuddehe, an Iowa-born graduate of Columbia University with a Masters degree
in Journalism, published an article documenting that the investigative firm
Kroll has been running an espionage operation in Ecuador on behalf of Chevron,
which faces a $27 billion damages claim for creating what experts believe is the
worst oil-related catastrophe on the planet. 

A Kroll employee offered Cuddehe $20,000 for six weeks of work to appear as an
independent journalist while working as an undercover spy in Lago Agrio,
Ecuador. Lago Agrio is the jungle town in the Amazon where the trial is being
held at Chevron`s request after the case was originally filed in New York
federal court several years ago. 

The Kroll employee, identified as a former journalist named Sam, paid for
Cuddehe to travel to Bogota where the case was explained and she was offered the
money in the suite of a luxury hotel. Cuddehe said in a blog that she has
published articles in The New Republic, the Miami Herald, and for the Associated
Press. 

"Last February, I got an offer from Kroll &#8230; to go undercover as a journalist-spy
in the Ecuadorian Amazon," wrote Cuddehe in the article, titled "A Spy In the
Jungle". 

"At first I thought I was underqualified for the job. But as it turned out I was
exactly what they were looking for: a pawn." 

She added: "&#8230;there was a reason [Chevron] wanted me&#8230; If I went to Lago Agrio
myself and pretended to write a story, no one would suspect that the starry-eyed
young American poking around was actually shilling for Chevron." 

Representatives for the Amazon communities who are victims of the environmental
damage blasted Chevron and Kroll for engaging in corporate espionage. The
article suggested that numerous Kroll employees were working on the Ecuador
project from a base in neighboring Colombia. 

With headquarters in New York, Kroll is considered the largest investigative
firm in the world and is publicly traded. 

"This is disturbing evidence of questionable if not outright illicit conduct by
Chevron and Kroll, possibly subjecting Chevron`s lawyers to sanctions or penalty
in the U.S.," said Jonathan Abady, an American lawyer who represents the
plaintiffs. "It is hard to imagine Kroll engaging in this conduct alone without
oversight from Chevron`s lawyers." 

"Legitimate investigations are fine; paying journalists to lie is unethical and
a direct attack on the credibility of all journalists worldwide," he added. 

Abady noted that Kroll investigators who misrepresent themselves at the behest
of legal counsel could be violating the ethical rules of the legal profession,
subjecting Chevron`s lawyers to sanctions in the United States. 

Events described in Cuddehe`s article fit with a larger pattern in recent years
of unethical and potentially illegal activity by Chevron to undermine the rule
of law in Ecuador. The company has admitted to deliberately dumping more than 18
billion gallons of toxic waste into the Amazon when it operated an oil
concession from 1964 to 1990. 

Last year, the Amazonian communities accused Chevron of violating the U.S.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in Ecuador by engaging in a "sting" operation
where a bribe was offered to help remove the trial judge from the case. An
investigation determined that the "sting" operation and bribe offer was made by
a long-time Chevron employee, Diego Borja. 

Chevron later paid to move Borja to a luxury villa close to Chevron`s global
headquarters in California to avoid questioning by Ecuadorian prosecutors. 

Once in the U.S., Borja was taped in a telephone conversation with childhood
friend Santiago Escobar as saying Chevron was "cooking" evidence in the Ecuador
trial, using fake soil samples, and representing its own laboratory as
independent when in fact it was operated by Chevron agents. He described himself
to Escobar as being in charge of Chevron`s dirty tricks campaign in Ecuador. 

Borja also admitted to Escobar that Chevron bribed an Ecuadorian army official
in 2005 to charge local indigenous leaders were planning a terrorist attack
against Chevron`s lawyers, forcing the cancellation of a critical judicial
inspection of a contaminated Chevron well site. 

Information relating to the Borja sting operation has been turned over to the
U.S. Department of Justice. 

In 2006, lawyers for the Amazonian communities were hit with a series of
anonymous threats that prompted protest letters from the International
Commission of Jurists and the United Nations. 

The U.S. law firms employed by Chevron to defend the Ecuador trial are Gibson
Dunn, King &amp; Spalding and Jones Day. One or more of the firms likely is
overseeing Kroll`s work, said Abady. 

"I have two words for Chevron`s management and Board of Directors: Hewlett
Packard," said Ilann Maazel, who represents the Amazonian plaintiffs in the
United States. "This is outrageous and potentially exposes Chevron to even more
liability." 

In 2006 the Chairperson of Hewlett Packard`s Board, Patricia Dunn, was forced to
resign and fight criminal charges from California`s Attorney General for
authorizing espionage to find out the source of leaks to journalists. Chevron is
a California-based company.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Aug 4 (Reuters) - Hong Kong-listed ChinaVision
Media Group (1060.HK) may buy the 50 percent stake in
Microsoft's (MSFT.O) MSN China joint venture held by another
local partner, the China Daily reported on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This week, ChinaVision said it aims to buy 50 percent of "a
company that is principally engaged in Internet-related
businesses" for about $100 million, according to a filing to
the Hong Kong stock exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It did not disclose the name of the acquisition target, but
mainland media reported the company was seeking to buy the
stake in MSN China, which operates Microsoft's Bing search
engine in China as well as other online assets, the China Daily
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft China declined to comment on the report, and a
ChinaVision representative was also not available, according to
the China Daily report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ChinaVision could not be immediately reached for comment by
Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of ChinaVision shot up after the news first began
circulating late last week, with the shares rising as much as
17 percent from their close on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's current partner in the venture is Shanghai
Alliance Investment, a city government investment arm run by
the son of former Chinese President Jiang Zemin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Media had reported in April that NetEase (NTES.O) was in
talks to buy the stake, but those talks later broke down.
[ID:nTOE63K047].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft formed the venture in 2005 to introduce MSN, an
instant messaging platform and Internet portal, to China. But
the company has struggled to gain traction with Chinese users
and compete effectively with homegrown titan Tencent Holdings'
(0700.HK) QQ platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft also has high hopes for its Bing search service,
which launched a Chinese version last year and aims to compete
with market leaders Baidu (BIDU.O) and Google (GOOG.O).

&lt;p&gt;Although some had hoped that Microsoft would violate its own patching policy, the company yesterday stuck to its guns and declined to provide a fix for a critical bug to users running Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Microsoft shipped an emergency patch for the Windows shortcut bug that attackers have been exploiting for several weeks. The vulnerability affects all versions from Windows 2000 on, including XP, Vista and Windows 7 .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, per Microsoft's practice, the oldest operating systems and service packs were denied the update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To be crystal clear, there is no security update for XP SP2," said Microsoft spokesman Christopher Budd in a Webcast on the out-of-band patch that he hosted Monday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft retired XP SP2 , as well as the even older Windows 2000, from all support on July 13, when both editions exited the company's final five-year "extended support" phase. Products dropped from extended support no longer receive security patches or other non-security fixes from Microsoft via its Automatic Update service and business patch mechanisms like Windows Server Update Service (WSUS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, a few security researchers had held out a little hope that Microsoft would issue a fix for the Windows shortcut vulnerability to machines running XP SP2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The only question I had was whether Microsoft would try and release a patch for unsupported operating systems," Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Security, said in an interview Monday. "There's a ton of people still running SP2, and it just went end-of-life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other researchers, including Jason Miller, data and security team manager for patch management vendor Shavlik Technologies, echoed Storms yesterday, saying that he had looked carefully for any sign that Microsoft was pushing a fix to Windows XP SP2 or Windows 2000. There wasn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolfgang Kandek, CTO of Qualys, confirmed that. "The recently discontinued Windows 2000 and Windows XP SP2 are not covered by the patch," said Kandek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined to directly answer questions yesterday about whether XP SP2 users would be served the out-of-band update. "Microsoft does not comment on the possible vulnerability of out-of-support versions of products," said Budd in an e-mail reply to those questions Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day, however, Budd had been more forthcoming. "Now that those products are no longer publicly supported, we do not call them out in our security bulletins, and we do not provide support for those products, which means that there is no security update for those products," Budd said during the Webcast, which kicked off at 4 p.m. ET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An audio recording of the Webcast is available on Microsoft's site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Microsoft confused some customers when the Download Center description for the shortcut bug fix initially listed both Windows XP SP3 and Windows XP SP2 as supported operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's actually an error on the Download Center text, and something that we are addressing as soon as possible," Budd said during the QA portion of the Webcast. Microsoft later revised the download's system requirements section by striking the reference to XP SP2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because users running Windows XP SP2 will never be offered an update for the shortcut bug -- or for any other future vulnerabilities for that matter -- Microsoft has been urging customers to upgrade to XP SP3 or a newer version such as Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failing that, users who decide to stick with XP SP2 have several options, including doing nothing, implementing the shortcut-disabling workaround that Microsoft first recommended, or installing Sophos' free tool that blocks malicious shortcuts from executing attack code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sophos tool works on Windows XP SP2, but not on Windows 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minus a patch, workaround or other protection, Windows XP SP2 users will remain vulnerable to current and future exploits. "Users need to work on an upgrade strategy, as without patch support they will become increasingly susceptible to attacks from malware," Kandek said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is gearing up to release a version of its Visual Studio integrated developer environment that it promises will be easy enough for even business managers to use.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On August 23, the company will release a beta version of Visual Studio, called Visual Studio LightSwitch, aimed at simplifying the process of developing applications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Professional developers are no longer the only people building business applications," said Dave Mendlen, Microsoft senior director of developer tools platform marketing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, it is a business manager who will see a need for an office application, and try to rig one together using tools such as spreadsheets or word processing macros. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"LightSwitch gives business end users  a simple way to create their own applications," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software will be a stripped-down version of Visual Studio bundled with a set of templates that cover a number of different enterprise processes, which a user can deploy to set up an application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can start with one of these templates and add on top of it, using either Visual Basic or C#," Mendlen said. In some cases, the user may not have to add in code at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applications built with LightSwitch can be run either on a local machine or on the Microsoft Azure cloud computing service, and be accessed with a browser using Microsoft Silverlight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the templates, the software also offers a number of prebuilt functions, called experiences. Users must also identify a data source for the program, which can not only be a database such as SQL Server or Microsoft Access, but even a SharePoint repository or an Excel or Microsoft Word file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The user interface is unique insofar that development mode and run-time mode are not separated, meaning that as soon as a user makes a change it will show up in the test instance of the program being run, Mendlen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using the Microsoft .NET framework, LightSwitch also creates programs in such a way that, should they become widely used within an office environment, they can be easily taken over by a Visual Studio developer for further enhancement and improved scalability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is still in the process of finalizing the templates it will include with the first release of LightSwitch.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mendlen describe one possible template: a centralized contact list. A manager of 30 salespeople for instance could use LightSwitch to create a single contact list, instead of having each sales person maintaining a list through Excel or Microsoft Word. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has not set the pricing for LightSwitch, though it will be modest enough to be appealing "to the average business user," Mendlen said. The company has not determined how long the beta period will last. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is also working with other third-party Visual Studio tool vendors to help them build additional templates. Eventually, the company would like to build out a process that large enterprises to build out their own internal-use templates as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the templates, Microsoft created a new Extensible Markup language (XML)-based file format, though Mendlen did not specify the name of this format. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forrester Research analyst Jeffrey Hammond praised the LightSwitch's focus on providing a way to easily build Web and cloud-based applications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Development environments for allowing business managers to build applications with little no coding is not a new concept--Think of IBM's Lotus Notes as an example--but most of these products were client-server or local-machine based. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In that spirit, there should be an easy way to build basic Web applications as it was to build Access applications back in the day," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joab Jackson covers enterprise software and general technology breaking news for The IDG News Service.

&lt;p&gt;  STEVENSON, MD, Aug 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Brower Piven, A Professional Corporation ("Brower Piven"), today
announced that a class action has been commenced in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all
purchasers of Elan Corporation, plc's ("Elan") (NYSE: ELN) CALL OPTIONS
during the period between June 17, 2008 and July 29, 2008 (the "Class
Period"). 

    If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later
than 60 days from today. If you wish to discuss this action or have any
questions concerning this notice or your rights or interests, please
contact plaintiff's counsel, Yelena Trepetin of Brower Piven at
410/415-6616, or via e-mail at trepetin@browerpiven.com. If you are a
member of this class, you can view a copy of the complaint as filed at
www.browerpiven.com. Any member of the putative class may move the Court
to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose
to do nothing and remain an absent class member.

    The complaint charges Elan and certain of its officers and directors and
Pfizer, Inc., as successor-in-interest to Wyeth, Inc. ("Wyeth") with
violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Elan is a
neuroscience-based technology company. Wyeth is a wholly-owned operating
subsidiary of Pfizer, Inc. ("Pfizer"). Pfizer is a pharmaceutical company.

    The complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants made
materially false and misleading statement about bapineuzumab, a drug Elan
was developing in association with Wyeth for the treatment of Alzheimer's
disease. Specifically, defendants failed to disclose unfavorable results
from a Phase 2 clinical study of bapineuzumab that Elan and Wyeth
conducted. When those results were finally disclosed, the price of Elan's
American Depository Receipts ("ADRs") plunged from $33.75 to $19.63 in
one day.

    Plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of all purchasers of Elan's
call options during the Class Period (the "Class"). The plaintiff is
represented by Brower Piven, whose attorneys have combined experience
litigating securities and class action cases of over 40 years. The Brower

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Housing: Still Flooded

The $2.4 trillion number is the total amount of the mortgage, not the amount
that is underwater. It is the underwater portion that is the potential loss to
the big banks that made the mortgages, like Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) and J.P.
Morgan (NYSE: JPM). However, mostly the risk is to the taxpayer, since the
biggest holders of mortgages are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and more recently,
the Fed. 

The underwater portion is estimated to be $771 billion as of the first quarter
of 2010. The depth of the water counts. Since the likelihood of foreclosure is
related to the depth of the water, the distribution of how far people are
underwater also matters. 

People just a little bit under are not that likely to let the house go back to
the bank. It simply is not worth it in terms of family disruptions, credit
ratings and the personal sense of honor in paying your debts even if you are not
legally obligated to do so (most mortgages are non-recourse, meaning if you
don`t pay, you lose the house, but that`s as far as your legal obligations go).
People who are deeply under are downright stupid if they don`t. 

The second graph shows the breakdown. There are a total of 14.75 million
homeowners who are underwater. Of those, over 4 million are sitting deeper than
the wreck of Transocean`s (NYSE: RIG) Deepwater Horizon. That big first bar is
homeowners with more than 50% negative equity. 

In other words, for that $250,000 mortgage, the house is worth less than
$125,000...OUCH! With the end of the tax credit, it is highly likely that we
will see a renewed decline in existing home prices. If housing prices fall by
5%, then each bar on the graph -- with the exception of the first one -- will
move one spot to the left, and the first one will grow by approximately the size
of the second bar (offset by the actual number of foreclosures or short sales). 

So where is the flood? The final graph shows the breakdown by state, in those
states for which the data was available. The worst "flooding" by far is in the
desert of Nevada. It is a pretty good bet that the 18% of homeowners (red
portion of the bar) there that are more than 50% underwater will go into
foreclosure. Right now, by paying the mortgage each month, they are acting like
gamblers who are deep in the hole and increase their bets in the hope of
breaking even. Even the yellow portion of the bar makes it a bit of a long shot
for the probability of the house price rebounding enough to eventually have
positive equity again. 

Combined, those two groups are more than half the homeowners with mortgages in
the state! Then consider that Nevada now has the highest unemployment rate in
the country, and it looks like the whole state is rolling snake eyes. The other
two poster children for the housing bubble -- Florida and Arizona -- are not in
quite as bad shape; to get to half of all homeowners underwater, you need to
include even those that are just "damp" on their mortgages. Still, that is a lot
of people who are underwater. 

Housing wealth is -- or at least was, before it all evaporated -- far more
widespread and "democratic" than stock market wealth. For many people, the
equity in their houses was a form of "forced" savings that was going to be a big
part of retirement plans, or the way they were going to put their kids through
college. Now either they have to abandon those plans ("Sorry Billy, I know you
worked hard in high school and got into the Ivy league like you always dreamed,
but you will just have to go to community college instead,") or people are going
to have to save a lot more out of current income. 

As the savings rate rises, it means people will spend less at the stores,
particularly on discretionary items. It means fewer meals out, and when people
go out, it means it is more likely to be at McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) than it is at
Red Lobster (part of Darden, NYSE: DRI).

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) posted higher-than-expected quarterly results and stood by its longer-term profit view, allaying investor concern over looming generic drug competition and lifting its shares almost 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's second quarter revenue in particular surpassed expectations, helped by a weak dollar that boosted the value of goods sold overseas, and strong demand for its top-selling Lipitor cholesterol drug and Lyrica nerve pain treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest drugmaker also said its full-year earnings would come in at the high end of its forecast range and reaffirmed its view for earnings in 2012, the first full year that Lipitor will face generic rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The issue with Pfizer is whether they can deliver the numbers and they're doing exactly that," said Deutsche Bank analyst Barbara Ryan. "It was a strong quarter on both the top and bottom line."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan said the company exercised strong control of expenses as it continues to integrate its $67 billion purchase of Wyeth in October, although foreign-exchange benefits were probably the biggest reason for the company's earnings beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio said the company aims to boost its dividend in stages within three years to the industry's payout range of 40 percent of annual company earnings. Pfizer's current dividend equates to 33 percent of annual earnings. The first boost should come in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have speculated Pfizer or another large rival might emerge to challenge Sanofi-Aventis' bid (SASY.PA) for Genzyme Corp GENZ.O that sources told Reuters is valued at about $18.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked by an analyst during a conference call if Pfizer was interested in a deal of that magnitude, D'Amelio said it was on the lookout for "bolt-on" acquisitions of up to "several billion" dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York-based drugmaker earned $2.48 billion, or 31 cents per share in the quarter. That compared with $2.26 billion, or 34 cents per share, a year earlier, when it had fewer outstanding shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 62 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 52 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global revenue rose 58 percent to $17.33 billion, well above the analysts' average forecast of $16.65 billion. Excluding the impact of a weaker dollar, revenue would have risen 53 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it now expected 2010 profit to be at the upper end of its previous forecast of $2.10 to $2.20 per share, excluding special items. It said its expenses this year would be at the lower end of its earlier forecast range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of Lipitor increased 5 percent to $2.81 billion, nearly $200 million above the average estimate of analysts, according to Thomson Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipitor sales are expected to fall as much as 75 percent late next year when cheaper generics flood U.S. drugstores, a main reason Pfizer bought Wyeth and its array of medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of Lyrica, for neuropathic pain, rose 21 percent to $762 million, roughly $60 million above estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEEP DISCOUNT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares trade at a deep discount to rivals, having failed to develop many big drugs over the past decade. They are valued at about seven times Pfizer's expected per-share 2011 earnings, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of 9.9 for rival large U.S. and European drugmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're not getting any credit for their pipeline," Ryan said. But she said many investors are sticking with the company due to its strong cash flow and hopes that its pipeline will eventually pay off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Pfizer on Tuesday reaffirmed its view for 2012 earnings of $2.25 to $2.35 a share. It suggests the Wyeth merger will prevent a plunge in Pfizer earnings during the first full year that Lipitor faces the generic onslaught.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer's current valuation does not adequately reflect the company's stable earnings through the patent expiration and more diversified business model," J.P. Morgan analyst Chris Schott said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is the last of the large U.S. drugmakers to report quarterly earnings over the past two weeks, and Schott said its performance rounded out an "overall modestly better than expected reporting season for the U.S. pharma group."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company shares rose 86 cents to $16.34 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson and Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Michele Gershberg, Lisa Von Ahn, Dave Zimmerman)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Updates to afternoon)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ryan Vlastelica&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Aug 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday
after disappointing results from Dow component Procter  Gamble
and weak economic data, but a bullish profit and outlook from
Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker, helped limit losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Procter  Gamble Co (PG.N) fell 3.7 percent to $59.78 and
was the top drag on the Dow after the consumer goods maker
reported fourth-quarter earnings that missed expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) posted higher-than-expected profit
and stood by its longer-term forecast, sending the stock up 5.5
percent to $16.33. For details, see [ID:nN03138108] and
[ID:nN03138985]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Markets were off session lows as investors paid renewed
focus to a strong earnings season in which three-fourths of
companies beat profit expectations, according to the Thomson
Reuters Director's Report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The number of declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones
by four-to-one in early trading, but the ratio narrowed to
almost even as the session continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The tone is positive enough that good results are having
just as much weight as negative ones," said CJ Jones, vice
president of capital markets at Nollenberger Capital Partners
in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The market seems to be shaking off negative news, and
that's a real positive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was down 39.06
points, or 0.37 percent, at 10,635.32. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX was down 5.89 points, or 0.52 percent, at
1,119.97. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was down 11.45
points, or 0.50 percent, at 2,283.91.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides PG's disappointing results, stocks fell on data
showing consumer spending and incomes were unexpectedly flat in
June. The SP Consumer Discretionary Sector .GSPD fell 1.4
percent while the SP Retail index .RLX lost 1.8 percent.
[ID:nN03194366]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With spending so weak, it makes me concerned about the
retail environment and the same-store sales data we're set to
get on Thursday," said John Massey, portfolio manager at
SunAmerica Asset Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said the market was ripe for consolidation after
Monday's climb to a 10-week high that built on a jump of nearly
7 percent for July -- the best month in a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SP 500 held above its 200-day moving average of around
1,114, a potentially positive signal. But it was struggling to
maintain its grip on the 1,121 mark, the midpoint between the
historic high reached in October 2007 and the 12-year closing
low hit in March 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other data included U.S. factory orders, which fell steeply
in June, and a plunge in an index of pending home sales to a
record low, giving additional evidence that growth assumed a
more sluggish tone at the end of the second quarter..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dow Chemical Co (DOW.N) slid 10 percent to $25.42 after it
reported a weaker-than-expected second-quarter profit while
Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM.N) rose 1 percent to $28.61
after its stronger-than-expected quarterly profit.
[ID:nN03137061] and [ID:nN0396778]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S.-listed shares of Research in Motion RIM.TO RIMM.O
slipped 1.2 percent to $56.28 after it unveiled a new
BlackBerry smart phone product in an effort to counter Apple
Inc's (AAPL.O) popular iPhone product. [ID:nN03163111].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NPD analyst Ross Rubin said, "The operating system has some
new touches and integration, but there's nothing here that
really represents a leap forward beyond what others are
providing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In sync with Pfizer's strong quarterly results, the SP
healthcare sector index .GSPA rose 0.7 percent, while the
Morgan Stanley Healthcare Payor Index .HMO climbed 1.7
percent.

"Most System z customers can increase the amount of work their existing
mainframe storage hardware systems can safely deliver by as much as 30%, by
simply using IntelliMagic Balance, in conjunction with INNOVATION`s FDRPAS and
FDRMOVE," says Dr. Gilbert Houtekamer, the author of the definitive work on the
subject of storage system efficiency. "Coming from someone, who together with
Dr. Pat Artis wrote the well know classic on `MVS I/O Subsystems,` and who has
over 20 years of experience in I/O performance analysis, that is a declaration
we believe. It is also one of principle reasons we are collaborating with
IntelliMagic to offer System z mainframe sites who take up the IntelliMagic
offer of a Free assessment of their current storage efficiency and hardware
reclamation potential, a No-Obligation 20 volume Free Trial of FDRPAS and
FDRMOVE," says INNOVATION spokesman and Vice President, Advance Technology,

currently installed storage. 

- Eliminating those disk storage hot spots, that can steal performance from your
existing hardware. 

- Moving volumes and files to new hardware in a layout that can maximize
performance and longevity. 

- Avoiding performance contention positioning during smaller to larger volume
migrations. 

- Intelligently implementing multiple storage tiers that reflect workload
performance requirements. 

- Identifying data that can benefit from Solid State Devices and efficiently
moving it there. 

"The key to achieving these benefits is knowing how to balance your workloads
across the storage hardware you`ve already paid for and moving it there with
minimal disruption to your ongoing business processing," said IntelliMagic US
spokesperson Brent Phillips, adding, "IntelliMagic knows how to create balance
on mainframe storage better than anyone else. And INNOVATION Data knows how to
move data better than anyone else. Together we can make it surprisingly easy for
System z users to reduce risk and to realize very significant savings on
hardware spending by maximizing the I/O performance of their existing hardware.
That`s why we are currently working with INNOVATION to have IntelliMagic Balance
seamlessly create the FDRPAS and FDRMOVE control statements necessary to
`balance` your storage system."

FORT A.P. HILL, Va.--(Business Wire)--
Former astronaut Dr. Bernard A. Harris, Jr. gave Boy Scouts and their scout
masters a first-hand experience with the wonders of science, technology,
engineering and math at the National Scout Jamboree. 

"The Dream Tour, presented by ExxonMobil" featured Dr. Harris, ExxonMobil
engineers and high-tech, high-energy performances - all focused on encouraging
scouts to pursue careers in math and science. Boys from across the country
joined Dr. Harris, a former scout himself, for the two-hour program where they
also earned a unique patch that was designed for the event. 

"When I was growing up, I dreamed of traveling in space. Education and being a
scout enabled my dream, and now I encourage these scouts to follow their dreams
by pursuing careers in math and science," Dr. Harris said. "America`s students
have incredible opportunities. The Dream Tour is one way to open their eyes to
the limitless possibilities they have, as long as math and science education is
part of the equation." 

From humble beginnings in Houston to making history as the first African
American to walk in space in February 1995, Dr. Harris is a living example of
achieving high aspirations. His story provides a powerful backdrop to bring his
message to students in cities across America. Since 2008, Dr. Harris has
encouraged almost 35,000 middle school students in more than 20 cities
nationwide. The tour is designed to encourage middle school students to realize
their potential and strive to acquire strong math and science skills. 

"ExxonMobil is focused on inspiring America`s young minds through engaging
educational programs such as The Dream Tour," said Rex Tillerson, chairman and
CEO of ExxonMobil and current national president of the Boy Scouts of America.
"It is a privilege to have Dr. Harris at this year's National Scout Jamboree
where so many heard his inspirational message about the possibilities of math
and science in realizing one's dreams."

&lt;p&gt;DALLAS--(Business Wire)--
The National Math and Science Initiative (NMSI) today announced Kenneth P.
Cohen, Vice President of Public and Government Affairs at Exxon Mobil
Corporation, and Dr. Ray O Johnson, Senior Vice President and Chief Technology
Officer of the Lockheed Martin Corporation, as the newest members of its Board
of Directors. 

"It is critical that our Board of Directors is filled with strong business,
academic and philanthropic leaders, and we are honored that Ken Cohen and Ray
Johnson have joined our board," said Tom Luce, president and CEO of NMSI. "Their
business expertise, coupled with their individual passion for improving math and
science education, will be invaluable." 

NMSI was launched in 2007 by top leaders in business, education, and science to
reverse the United States` troubling decline in math and science education.
Thanks to NMSI grants, Advanced Placement achievement has been significantly
boosted in six states and the UTeach program to train math and science teachers
is being implemented in 22 universities across the country. 

"The important work that NMSI is doing in advancing math and science education
in the U.S. is critical to the future of our economy and our country," said
Cohen. "We need to drastically expand the pipeline of math and science students
and future STEM professionals in order to tackle major global issues we face
today. Exxon Mobil Corporation has made a long-term commitment to organizations
such as NMSI that help develop and maximize the potential of students - and, in
particular young women and minorities - in these fields. As such, I am proud to
serve alongside the organization`s prominent leaders to further support NMSI`s
efforts." 

"It is an honor to join this distinguished group and represent Lockheed Martin
on the NMSI board," said Johnson. "Our nation is facing a critical shortage of
American scientists and engineers, and NMSI is serving a vital role in inspiring
the future technical workforce of this country." 

NMSI`s board of directors is comprised of a prestigious list of influential
industry and education leaders. They include Norman R. Augustine, Chairman of
the Review of the U.S. Human Space Flight Plans Committee and member of the
American Energy Innovation Council; Dr. Bernard Harris, who is president and
founder of the Harris Foundation, Inc., and as a NASA Astronaut was the first
African-American to walk in space; Dr. Sally Ride, who is president and CEO of
Sally Ride Science and as a NASA astronaut was the first woman in space; and Dr.
Charles M. Vest, president of the National Academy of Engineering and president
emeritus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. More information about
Cohen and Johnson can be found by visiting NMSI`s website here. 

NMSI board member Carl Wieman, a Nobel Prize laureate in physics and Director of
the Carl Wieman Science Education Initiative at the University of Colorado at
Boulder and the University of British Columbia, recently resigned to accept a
nomination as Associate Director of Science at the White House Office of Science
and Technology Policy; that nomination is pending in Congress. A complete list
of NMSI`s board members can be found by visiting www.nationalmathandscience.org.


About the National Math and Science Initiative

The National Math and Science Initiative -- launched by top leaders in U.S.
business, education and science in 2007 -- is an agent of change focused on
improving student achievement in math and science across the American public
school system. NMSI brings best practices in management to the education sector
by replicating proven programs on a national scale. 

In its first two years, NMSI has awarded grants to expand an Advanced Placement
Training and Incentive Program to six states and to implement the UTeach program
in 22 universities. Recent College Board results showed that schools

&lt;p&gt;Pioneer in Least Privilege Management Releases "Regulatory Compliance and Least
Privilege Security" White Paper to Simplify Compliance for Enterprises
NORTH ANDOVER, Mass. &amp; MANCHESTER, United Kingdom--(Business Wire)--
Avecto Ltd, the most trusted name in least privilege management for Windows
systems, today announced that it has partnered with noted Microsoft Windows
expert and author Russell Smith, to create a free educational white paper to
simplify least privilege security for enterprises. The new white paper, titled
"Regulatory Compliance and Least Privilege Security," is available immediately
for download at Avecto`s website. 

Industry and government regulations - such as the Payment Card Industry Data
Security Standard (PCI DSS), Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) and
Government Connect in the UK - have made securing data as it passes through
personal computers a crucial requirement to prevent security breaches that could
result in expensive data loss. In this new whitepaper, Russell Smith discusses
the concept of least privilege security for personal computers, and why it is
needed to meet requirements set out by regulatory bodies. Readers will learn:

* The risks associated with administrative rights in Windows 
* How least privilege security can be applied to Windows systems 
* Common challenges enterprises face in implementing least privilege security 
* How to map regulatory compliance requirements to least privilege security

"In most enterprises, it is common practice for employees to log in to Windows
with full administrative privileges, which dramatically increases their exposure
to malware," said Smith. "Organizations cannot rely on antivirus or firewalls
alone to protect their Windows systems. By taking a least-privilege approach
that eliminates admin rights from Windows users without reducing their
productivity, businesses can increase their security and satisfy regulatory
requirements." 

"Removing administrative rights is a crucial step to secure Windows systems and
more effectively meet requirements for multiple industry regulations," said Tony
Bolland, CEO of Avecto. "We are thrilled to be partnering with an industry
thought leader like Russell Smith to educate companies on how they can implement
a policy of least privilege to address their security, risk and compliance
needs." 

To download a free copy of the "Regulatory Compliance and Least Privilege
Security" white paper, please visit: http://www.avecto.com/resources/index.php.

Russell Smith is the author of the newly released Least Privilege Security for
Windows 7, Vista and XPpublished by PACKT, which includes details about the
applications of Avecto`s Privilege Guard software for Windows least privilege
management. 

Smith is also contributing editor for Microsoft Best Practices at CDW's Biztech
magazine and a regular contributor to leading industry journal Windows IT Pro.
He holds a diploma of higher education from the University of London and is a

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - "Oblivion," the upcoming illustrated novel from "Tron Legacy" director Joseph Kosinski, has found a home with Disney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is set on a future Earth, where civilization lives above the clouds and alien scavengers stalk the irradiated surface below. When a surface drone repairman finds a woman inside a crashed spacepod planetside , it leads him on a journey filled with romance and adventure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kosinski, who will direct and produce the feature version, created the comic. Writtem by Arvid Nelson and illustrated by Andree Wallin, it will be released in the fall by Radical Publishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He spent the last year honing the story while putting the finishing touches on "Tron," which is shaping up to be one of the most important movies for Disney in quite a while. The costly sci-fi remake is set for release on December 17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts with pricing)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 4 (Reuters) - A Goldman Sachs and Citigroup
$788.5 million commercial mortgage-backed security (CMBS) drew
better-than-expected demand as the dealers priced the issue on
Wednesday, according to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The top AAA-rated portions of the issue priced at yields
about 5 basis points lower than levels discussed last week,
said one investor familiar with the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The $410.6 million 10-year class was priced to yield 1.35
percentage points above the interest-rate swap rate, a common
bond benchmark, for a yield of 4.243 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is the largest CMBS since the market that finances
office, retail and apartment buildings began crawling back from
the financial crisis in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Loans in the new issue had an average loan-to-value ratio
of 53.7 percent -- more conservative than issues during the
real estate boom. The debt-service coverage ratio of 1.88 is
also safer than older issues sold at levels that could not meet
routine debt payments without help from interest reserves.

&lt;p&gt;CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc plans to spin off its proprietary trading business as early as this month to comply with the so-called Volcker rule, CNBC reported on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be the first move by the New York-based investment bank to adapt its business to comply with the U.S. financial reform package signed into law last month, and would follow similar moves from other banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As we've said all along, we are considering our options," said Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally. "When we have something to announce, we'll announce it. Of course anything we do will comply with the law."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares ended 2.1 percent higher at $156.41 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It gets them out of the way of the Volcker rule without causing any deterioration in their earnings. Therefore it's a significant positive," said Dick Bove, analyst at Rochdale Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman will receive a substantial number of benefits from the reform law, potentially offsetting the prop trading restrictions, Bove said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others took a more cautious view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What does Goldman become without proprietary trading?" said Walter Todd, co-chief investment officer of Greenwood Capital. "We're going back to the old days. It starts to look like what investment banks used to look like."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOCAL POINT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports of a spin-off of Goldman's proprietary trading business come just a few weeks after Goldman's chief financial officer said the impact of the new law would be difficult to predict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The new financial regulatory legislation represents the most sweeping change for the financial industry in decades," Goldman CFO David Viniar said on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent months, Goldman has been a focal point for critics of the financial sector's ills leading into the 2008 crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 16, Goldman paid $550 million to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil fraud charges over how it marketed a subprime mortgage product to institutional investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASSET SALES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new Volcker rule, named for former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, banks are restricted from proprietary trading and have new limits on the size of private equity or hedge fund investments. Proprietary trading has been a key source of Wall Street investment bank profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rule was a key, and sometimes contentious, provision in the financial reform legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the act, banks are only allowed to invest up to 3 percent of their Tier 1 capital in such assets, and many are shedding such stakes as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Goldman, the bank had $15.5 billion invested in private equity or hedge funds, with another $12.1 billion in commitments at the end of first quarter, according to a securities filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With $68.5 billion in first quarter Tier 1 capital, Goldman's investments exceed the threshold, which would cap at $2.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other major U.S. banks have already begun shedding other business and investments in the wake of the new capital rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, CNBC reported Morgan Stanley plans to spin off its hedge fund unit FrontPoint Partners within the next three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that Morgan Stanley was close to a no-cash deal to give up control of FrontPoint, but would retain a 20 percent to 25 percent stake in the unit for at least five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 13, Citigroup Inc announced it had agreed to sell its private equity unit to StepStone Group LLC and Lexington Partners for undisclosed terms. The deal would reduce Citigroup's total assets by $1.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp, the largest U.S. bank by assets, is shedding a $1.2 billion commitment to funds managed by Warburg Pincus LLC, and spun off a $1.9 billion portfolio of private equity investments to New York-based investment firm Sterling Stamos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joe Rauch in Charlotte, N.C., additional reporting by Maria Aspan and Matthew Goldstein in New York; Editing by Tim Dobbyn, Phil Berlowitz and Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

early as this month to comply with the so-called Volcker rule,
CNBC reported on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would be the first move by the New York-based investment
bank to adapt its business to comply with the U.S. financial
reform package signed into law last month, and would follow
similar moves from other banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As we've said all along, we are considering our options,"
said Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally. "When we have something
to announce, we'll announce it. Of course anything we do will
comply with the law."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares ended 2.1 percent higher at $156.41 on the
New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It gets them out of the way of the Volcker rule without
causing any deterioration in their earnings. Therefore it's a
significant positive," said Dick Bove, analyst at Rochdale
Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman will receive a substantial number of benefits from
the reform law, potentially offsetting the prop trading
restrictions, Bove said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Others took a more cautious view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What does Goldman become without proprietary trading?"
said Walter Todd, co-chief investment officer of Greenwood
Capital. "We're going back to the old days. It starts to look
like what investment banks used to look like."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FOCAL POINT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reports of a spin-off of Goldman's proprietary trading
business come just a few weeks after Goldman's chief financial
officer said the impact of the new law would be difficult to
predict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The new financial regulatory legislation represents the
most sweeping change for the financial industry in decades,"
Goldman CFO David Viniar said on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In recent months, Goldman has been a focal point for
critics of the financial sector's ills leading into the 2008
crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On July 16, Goldman paid $550 million to settle U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission civil fraud charges over how
it marketed a subprime mortgage product to institutional
investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ASSET SALES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the new Volcker rule, named for former Federal
Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, banks are restricted from
proprietary trading and have new limits on the size of private
equity or hedge fund investments. Proprietary trading has been
a key source of Wall Street investment bank profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rule was a key, and sometimes contentious, provision in
the financial reform legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the act, banks are only allowed to invest up to 3
percent of their Tier 1 capital in such assets, and many are
shedding such stakes as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At Goldman, the bank had $15.5 billion invested in private
equity or hedge funds, with another $12.1 billion in
commitments at the end of first quarter, according to a
securities filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With $68.5 billion in first quarter Tier 1 capital,
Goldman's investments exceed the threshold, which would cap at
$2.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other major U.S. banks have already begun shedding other
business and investments in the wake of the new capital rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, CNBC reported Morgan Stanley (MS.N) plans to
spin off its hedge fund unit FrontPoint Partners within the
next three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday
that Morgan Stanley was close to a no-cash deal to give up
control of FrontPoint, but would retain a 20 percent to 25
percent stake in the unit for at least five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On July 13, Citigroup Inc (C.N) announced it had agreed to
sell its private equity unit to StepStone Group LLC and
Lexington Partners for undisclosed terms. The deal would reduce
Citigroup's total assets by $1.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), the largest U.S. bank by
assets, is shedding a $1.2 billion commitment to funds managed
by Warburg Pincus LLC, and spun off a $1.9 billion portfolio of
private equity investments to New York-based investment firm
Sterling Stamos.

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

H-P Settles DOJ Litigation

As per the latest disclosure made by the world`s largest computer maker,
Hewlett-Packard Co. (NYSE: HPQ), the tech major has agreed to settle a lawsuit
in principle imposed against it by the U.S. Department Of Justice (DOJ). 

The government body has previously accused Hewlett-Packard and other tech giants
of paying illegal consideration to Accenture (NYSE: ACN) for securing
endorsements for government orders. 

Although H-P has denied its involvement in the case, it expects that the
settlement will result in an outflow of $50.0 million, which is expected to
lower its third quarter profit by 2 cents per share. 

This lawsuit dates back to the year 2007, when Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT)
first initiated it, and the DOJ and others formed a combined lawsuit against the
three tech majors, namely H-P, Sun Microsystems and Accenture. 

These companies were accused of forming an illegal cartel for securing
government contracts. This lawsuit should have just a trivial impact on the
reputation of the company, and we believe that the current achievements of the
company will make up for it. 

As per the latest findings of the market research firm IDC, global PC shipments
in the second quarter 2010 inched up to 22.4% year over year, while another
research firm, Gartner, calculated the growth to be 20.7%. The findings of IDC
also confirms the fact that market leader Hewlett-Packard retained the first
position worldwide, with an 18.1% market share, which declined marginally by
1.6% as a result of lower international sales. 

It seems that while all tech companies are reaping the benefits of improved
macroeconomic fundamentals across the globe, the maximum benefit has been tapped
by H-P. As per a recent report published by Gartner, H-P also grabbed the
leading position in the server market during the first quarter of 2010. 

Although we remain positive about the company`s performance going forward given
that the demand has been improving, we believe competition from other big
technology companies, such as Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) and Apple (Nasdaq:
AAPL), as well as smaller Asian players, will continue to intensify. 

On the other hand, we also believe that the tech giant will come out of this
legal development against it, keeping its reputation unscathed. 

We currently have a short-term Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) rating on Hewlett-Packard.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights: Hanger Orthopedic (NYSE: HGR) as the Bull of
the Day and AMB Property (NYSE: AMB) as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks
Equity Research provides analysis on MasterCard Inc. (NYSE: MA), Visa Inc.
(NYSE: V) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

We reiterate our Outperform recommendation on Hanger Orthopedic (NYSE: HGR).
Earnings for the last quarter beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.
Top-line growth was fueled by healthy contributions from patient-care and
distribution businesses and acquisitions. 

Hanger is the market leader in the orthotic and prosthetic (O) patient care
services market, operating through 678 patient care centers across the U.S. The
company's economies of scale are unmatched by its competitors. Hanger continues
to pursue acquisitions to expand its geographic presence and revenues. 

While costs associated with relocation are expected to dilute earnings in the
third quarter, the company is poised to achieve meaningful cost synergies from
such initiatives in future reporting periods. 

Bear of the Day: 

We are changing our long-term recommendation for AMB Property (NYSE: AMB) to
Underperform from Neutral as we anticipate the stock to perform well below the
broader market. Fiscal 2010 earnings estimates were reduced by 11 out of 13
analysts covering the stock, while none increased them over the last 30 days. 

With a decline in commercial real estate fundamentals, demand for AMB's services
has decreased comparatively. However, AMB's second quarter 2010 results were in
line with the Zacks Consensus estimate. 

Our long-term Underperform recommendation on the stock indicates that AMB would
perform well below the broader market. Our target price of $24.00 at 19.5X 2010
FFO/Share factors in this view. Over the last five years, AMB s shares have
traded in a range of 4.1X to 21.2X trailing 12-month FFO. 

Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog: 

MasterCard Beats, Margins Up

MasterCard Inc.`s (NYSE: MA) second quarter operating earnings per share of
$3.49 came in substantially ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.33 and
$2.67 in the year-ago quarter. Net income for the reported quarter was $458
million, up 31.2% from $349 million in the prior-year quarter. 

Results for the reported quarter improved over the prior-year quarter primarily
due to better pricing, an increased number of processed transactions and reduced
operating expenses that drove operating margins higher. However, higher income
tax expenses and flattish growth in the number of processed transactions were on
the downside for MasterCard. 

Total revenue increased 6.7% year over year to $1.37 billion, primarily due to a
4% favorable pricing changes, a 0.1% growth in the number of processed
transactions to 5.6 billion and a 15.2% increase in cross-border volumes. GDV
increased 8.5% to $656 billion during the reported quarter. As of June 30, 2010,
MasterCard issued 1.6 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards. 

Total operating expenses decreased 9.7% year over year to $648 million. Currency
fluctuation contributed 0.7 percentage point of the increase to the expenses.
The overall increase was primarily attributable to a 13.8% decrease in general
and administrative expenses and a 3.8% drop in depreciation and amortization
expenses. The operating margin for the reported quarter came in at 52.6%, up
from 43.5% in the year-ago quarter. 

MasterCard's effective tax rate for the reported quarter was 35.7%, up from
35.0% in the year-ago period. The increase was primarily attributable to some
discrete adjustments recorded in the quarter. 

As of June 30, 2010, MasterCard`s net operating cash flow was $438 million, down
from $778 million as of June 30, 2009. At the end of June 30, 2010, cash and
cash equivalents totalled to $2.32 billion; long-term debt totalled to $19
million while total equity was recorded at $4.13 billion. 

Dividend Update

On June 7, 2010, the board of MasterCard declared a quarterly cash dividend of
15 cents per share, to the shareholders of its Class A common stock and Class B
common stock. The cash dividend will be paid on August 10, 2010 to the holders
of record in both categories as on July 6, 2010. 

Our Take

MasterCard`s results have outshone its prime competitor, Visa Inc. (NYSE: V)
that reported its fiscal third quarter earnings of 97 cents on July 28, 2010.
This came in ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents, but was in line
with the prior-year quarter. 

MasterCard benefits from strong secular demand growth, meaningful international
exposure, high barriers, excellent pricing power, risk-free balance sheet and
impressive operating leverage. Also, the above-average earnings growth, strong
competitive position and leverage to an eventual economic recovery will result
in a relative valuation premium. 

However, we are concerned about MasterCard`s resilience and ability to raise
prices, the detrimental effects of the ongoing financial overhaul reform and
scope for increasing cash flow. Hence, the cautious outlook over the near term
justifies our Neutral recommendation. 

Strong Quarter for Pfizer

Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) reported second quarter earnings of 62 cents per share,
well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 52 cents, and 29.2% above the
year-ago earnings of 48 cents. Performance was boosted by the Wyeth acquisition,
which was partially offset by increased expenses. 

Revenues were up 58%, mainly due to the Wyeth acquisition, which added $5.4
billion or 50% to the total. While foreign exchange boosted revenues by $584
million, or 5%, legacy Pfizer products positively impacted revenues by $315
million or 3%. Second quarter revenues came in at $17.3 billion, comfortably
above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.6 billion. 

International revenues increased 54% to $9.9 billion, reflecting 45% operational
growth and a 9% favorable foreign exchange impact. Meanwhile, US revenues
increased 63% to $7.4 billion. 

Following the Wyeth acquisition, Pfizer operates through two segments:
Biopharmaceutical and Diversified. The Biopharmaceutical segment posted second
quarter revenues of $15 billion, up 49%. Wyeth products contributed $4.5 billion
to segment revenues with performance being boosted by drugs like Premarin,
Enbrel, Prevnar, and Effexor. Foreign exchange boosted Biopharmaceutical segment
revenues by 5% ($485 million). 

Meanwhile, several Pfizer legacy products like Camptosar and Norvasc continued
to struggle during the quarter, mainly due to the presence of generic
competition.

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Savings Rate Rising

A large part of the decline in the savings rate can be tied to rising asset
prices, particularly for houses. People figured that if the value of the house
they were living in was growing quickly, they could save less and consume more
today, and then be able to spend the gains in the value of the house when it
came time to retire or put the kids through college. Large numbers of people
started to use their houses as if there were an ATM in the kitchen, using Home
equity lines of credit, and cash out refinancing to support current consumption,
such as go on vacation or buy a new car. 

The popping of the housing bubble changed all that. Housing wealth, which is the
only real wealth that millions in the working and middle classes had, has
evaporated. For 14.75 million homeowners in the first quarter, not only do they
have no housing wealth anymore, but they owe more than the house is worth. 

As a result they have to put away more of their current income and repair their
shattered personal balance sheets. The balance sheet repair operation has begun,
but it is a long way from finished. As a result, the savings rate will probably
continue to rise (not necessarily in a straight line, but trending up over
time). 

If the rise in the savings rate occurs because income is rising faster than
spending, it will be less painful than what we saw during the recession, when it
was spending that simply fell off a cliff, and income declined more slowly.
Still, it means that economic growth will be lower than it otherwise would have
been, had the savings rate stayed stable. Holding more money in the bank might
be nice for the likes of J.P. Morgan (NYSE: JPM), but it is bad news for
retailers like Macy`s (NYSE: M). 

It will be the more discretionary parts of the economy that will grow more
slowly. Less money spent on vacations means that fewer people will take cruises
on Carnival Cruise Lines (NYSE: CCL). People will tend to hold on to their cars
longer, meaning fewer new cars sold by Ford (NYSE: F). 

The economy can handle this if it happens gradually, but it still means lower
growth than what would have occurred. In essence, at least some of the economic
growth between 1982 and 2006 was a mirage -- a case of living large on the
credit card. Now comes the part where we have to pay off the bill. 

This will be a long-term headwind for the economy, just as the falling savings
rate provided a tailwind that lasted for a quarter of a century. The headwind
will probably not last that long, but don`t expect it to be over in just a few
months, or even a few years, for that matter. 

P Misses Zacks Estimates

Procter &amp; Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) registered disappointing fourth quarter 2010 net
earnings from continuing operations of 71 cents a share, which dipped 5% from 75
cents posted in the year-ago period. Earnings also missed the Zacks Consensus
Estimate of 73 cents. 

However, P`s net earnings from continuing operations in fiscal 2010 surged 4%
to $3.53 per share from $3.39 delivered in fiscal 2009, though well below the
Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.12 per share. The upswing came on the back of
sales growth, expansion of operating margin and share buybacks, partly offset by
higher tax rate. 

From a year ago, core earnings per share in the quarter plunged 9% to 71 cents
in the quarter, but climbed 6% to $3.67 in the reported year. 

Procter &amp; Gamble forecasts first-quarter 2011 net earnings from continuing
operations and core earnings to be in the range of 97 cents to $1.01 per share,
reflecting a 0%-4% growth rate. The guidance implies that P will continue to
invest in innovation and various marketing program.

&lt;p&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; *3.5 mln Pfizer contracts changed hands Tuesday-OCC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; *Pfizer options volume was daily record-Trade Alert&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; *Nearly all option volume was tied to dividend plays&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Doris Frankel and Ann Saphir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHICAGO, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Trading in Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)
options soared on Tuesday, accounting for an astounding 22
percent of all stock-options volume, as traders tried to
capitalize on the drugmaker's quarterly dividend payout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some 3.5 million Pfizer contracts changed hands over the
course of the day, nearly all at NASDAQ OMX Group Inc's
(NDAQ.O) PHLX options exchange, the Options Clearing Corp.
reported on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Total trading in all other options at the eight U.S.
markets was 12.3 million contracts on Tuesday. It was a daily
volume record for the drugmaker's contracts, said Henry
Schwartz, president of option analytics firm Trade Alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares rose almost 6 percent after Pfizer's
better-than-expected quarterly results, but most of the trading
in the drugmaker's options appeared to have little to do with
its earnings performance (for details, see [nN03138985]).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, professional traders on the floor of the old
Philadelphia Stock Exchange were pairing up to buy and sell
massive numbers of deep in-the-money call options to each other
in a strategy designed to win control of as much stock as
possible in time for the dividend-payment cutoff date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At stake were at least $300,000 in dividend payments,
Schwartz said. Investors had to buy Pfizer stock before
Wednesday to receive the 18-cent per-share quarterly dividend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Professional traders were taking advantage of
nonprofessionals who failed to turn their call options into
stock by the deadline, known as the ex-dividend date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The so-called dividend strategy has come under fire from
the International Securities Exchange, which says such trading
distorts market-share data and poses potential systemic risks
to options exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday, the low-risk, high-volume strategy accounted
for about 37 percent of all U.S. stock-options trading, mostly
at PHLX, according to the ISE, owned by Deutsche Boerse AG's
(DB1Gn.DE) futures market Eurex. For more on Nasdaq's options
markets, please see [nN03167568].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday, traders were also furiously buying and selling
options on Intel (INTC.O), with 986.9 million contracts
changing hands, according to OCC, which guarantees all U.S.
options trades. Like Pfizer, Intel's ex-dividend date was on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A call option is said to be deep in-the-money if the price
of the underlying stock is well above the option's strike price
- the price at which the owner has the right to buy the
shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the August Pfizer $15 strike, 1.4 million calls crossed
the tape on Tuesday, Trade Alert data show. Pfizer shares
closed at $16.34 on that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The OCC reported about 90 percent of the 173,000 contracts
of open interest in that strike were exercised, leaving 16,545
contracts outstanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That works out to about $300,000 of dividends available for
traders involved in the strategy, Schwartz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Doris Frankel; Editing by Andrew Hay)

&lt;p&gt;In May, Microsoft sued Salesforce -- which specializes in sales software sold and used online -- charging it with stealing its intellectual property.

&lt;p&gt;Aug 5 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) met Wednesday
with Japan's Fair Trade Commission officials to object to the
planned tie-up between Yahoo Japan (4689.T) and Google Inc
(GOOG.O), the Nikkei business daily reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft expressed concerns about the deal from a
competitive standpoint, citing how it will give Google nearly
complete control over Japan's search services and related
advertising, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, Microsoft said it planned to provide proof
underscoring how the Google-Yahoo Japan partnership would be
detrimental to competition, Nikkei said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo Japan, Japan's largest Internet portal operator that
currently uses Yahoo Inc's (YHOO.O) search technology, has
confirmed with the Japanese government that the partnership
with Google will not violate antitrust regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The proposed deal between Google and Yahoo Japan -- an
independent company in which Yahoo holds a 35 percent stake --
marks a divergence from the course set by Yahoo, which has
forged a pact with Microsoft Corp for Web search technology.

juice maker Nidan to Coca Cola (KO.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 4 (Reuters) - A Goldman Sachs and Citigroup
$788.5 million commercial mortgage-backed security is drawing
better-than-expected demand ahead of its formal sale on
Wednesday, according to an investor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The top AAA-rated portions of the issue are expected to
price at yields about 5 basis points lower than where it was
discussed last week, said one investor familiar with the
deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 10-year class would yield about 1.35 percentage points
above a common interest-rate benchmark for a yield of 4.25
percent to 4.30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will be the largest deal since December, when the
market that finances office, retail and apartment buildings
began crawling back after the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new CMBS will be sold with an average loan-to-value
ratio of 53.7 percent -- more conservative than issues during
the real estate boom. The debt-service coverage ratio of 1.88
is also safer than older issues sold at levels that could not
meet routine debt payments without help from interest
reserves.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Shares of Depomed Inc (DEPO.O) jumped as much as 20 percent on Wednesday, a day after the company said Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) did not file a patent infringement lawsuit against Depomed's experimental neuropathic pain drug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is a significant positive for Depomed, and ahead of our expected outcome of a settlement between Pfizer and Depomed," Caris  Co analyst James Molloy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug, DM-1796, is an extended release, once-daily tablet formulation of gabapentin, which is marketed by Pfizer for treatment of epileptic seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A challenge from Pfizer would have delayed Depomed's plan to launch the drug for up to 30 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our position had been that Pfizer had no merits to filing an infringement case, and that Depomed ultimately could have won on summary judgment," Roth Capital Partners' Scott Henry wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henry said though the news was expected, it removes an overhang from Depomed shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of the company were up 16 percent at $3.27 Wednesday morning on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;Sheraton Unveils Specially Designed, Branded Portal Powered by Microsoft`s Bing
Decision Engine

Sheraton Guests Can Now Discover Their Destination with Just One Click
WHITE PLAINS, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
Sheraton Hotels &amp; Resorts today unveiled a new online experience for guests
designed by Microsoft`s new decision engine, Bing, featuring intuitive tools
that promotes a sense of discovery and captures the "pulse" of the local
destination, helping guests seamlessly navigate their stay. Designed as a
social, interactive online global destination, the new "Sheraton Guest Portal
powered by Bing" will be featured worldwide in the "Link@SheratonSM experienced
with Microsoft" in addition to in-room web access. As part of the brand`s $6
billion revitalization effort, Sheraton Hotels have redesigned nearly 400
lobbies worldwide with the addition of its innovative Link@Sheraton experience
with Microsoft, a unique lobby lounge that enables today`s travelers access to
information and technology for work, leisure and social networking. 

The new portal was specially designed to provide guests with an intuitive,
tailored on-line experience specific to their destination - like having a
personal concierge in the palm of your hand. As part of the new online
experience, guests will find constantly updated relevant content, specific to
each Sheraton location, such as local maps and the top search results for area
restaurants, attractions, special events and services. With this pertinent
information right at their fingertips, guests are able to make smarter, faster
decisions on the road whether they`re looking for a local favorite to grab a
bite in Boston or the top shopping tour in Milan. The new portal uses a mix of
rich imagery with a dashboard of dynamic tools that aggregates the top items
requested from the concierge and makes them easy to find. With one click of the
mouse guests can print a boarding pass, find the nearest entertainment and must
see sites, get the local weather forecast, read the top news stories of the day
or discover more about their hotel, such as the restaurant hours and spa
offerings. 

"Microsoft has been an integral partner during our revitalization of the
Sheraton brand from the beginning with the launch of the Link@Sheraton powered
by Microsoft," said Hoyt Harper, Senior Vice President, Global Brand Management
for Sheraton Hotels &amp; Resorts. "Utilizing the Bing technology we`ve created a
portal that will provide our guests with a geographically relevant and unique
online experience whether they`re in the lobby or their room." 

"We`re thrilled to work with Starwood to bring the powerful decision making
tools of Bing to Sheraton customers," said Yusuf Mehdi, senior vice president,
Online Services Division, Microsoft. "When you are on the road for business or
vacation and staying at a Sheraton hotel or resort, Bing will be a great asset
for helping customers make important decisions on the go, including local search
tools that help you decide where to eat, what to see, and an immersive mapping
experience to help customers get around." 

The Link@Sheraton experienced with Microsoft and the Sheraton Guest Portal
powered by Bing are signature components of Sheraton`s $6 billion global effort
to enhance the brand and differentiate the guest experience at properties
worldwide. The Link`s unique lobby lounge enables today`s travelers to stay
connected with instant access to information and technology for work, leisure
and social networking. Designed as a social environment, The Link invites guests
to interact with each other while they check their email, research local
attractions and even print boarding passes using free Wi-Fi and Internet-enabled
computer stations. It also features a Link Caf&#233;, televisions and daily
newspapers. Nearly 50% of all Sheraton guests use the Link@Sheraton during their
stay - that is more than eat breakfast, use the gym or go to the bar.

&lt;p&gt;  ALEXANDRIA, VA and ST. PAUL, MN, Aug 04 (MARKET WIRE)
-- 
Surescripts, the Nation's E-Prescription Network(TM), today announced a
service that will make it easier for consumers to access an electronic
record of their prescriptions. This service -- Medication History for
Personal Health Records (PHRs) -- will allow consumers that use Microsoft
HealthVault to request and receive records of their dispensed medications
from community pharmacies using Surescripts' secure electronic connection
to HealthVault.

    Users will be prompted to log into their HealthVault account from the
websites of participating community pharmacies and request that their
medication history be downloaded into their HealthVault account. A robust
identity proofing process is incorporated as part of this initial request
to protect privacy. Upon successful completion of this process,
medication history can be updated any time there are new prescriptions
dispensed from a participating pharmacy without further action by the
HealthVault user. Updates to medication history will be made daily,
allowing users to keep their records as current as possible.

    Providing consumers with the opportunity to create or supplement their
own record of medication history using information provided by pharmacies
empowers them to take a more active role in their care. And, when shared
with their various healthcare providers, this information promotes more
complete drug-to-drug and drug-allergy interaction checks, which supports
improvement in the safety and quality of the prescribing process. 

    "Medication history is critical to ensuring that people have a useful
longitudinal view of their health -- whether they are monitoring their
own well-being or that of a family member," said David Cerino, general
manager for Microsoft's Health Solutions Group. "By connecting its
service to HealthVault, Surescripts is enabling people to actively use
their prescription history in the context of their broader health and
wellness information, which we think will lead to smarter decisions, and
ultimately better health management."

    Significant Benefit to Pharmacies as well as Patients
 Surescripts'
Medication History for PHRs service also provides a significant benefit
to pharmacies. By using their existing connection to the Surescripts
network to deliver this information to their customers, pharmacies avoid
the added expense and complexity of developing and maintaining direct,
individual connections with personal health record services.

    "Our Medication History for Personal Health Records service represents a
unique opportunity to simplify the way this information is delivered to
consumers," said Bob Beckley, senior vice president for customer
innovation at Surescripts. "Pharmacies and PHR vendors can now link over
one connection instead of many. This will consolidate their operations
and enable them to make it easier for consumers to access their
prescription information."

    Surescripts operates the nation's largest e-prescription network,
offering e-prescribing services that allow physicians to electronically
send prescriptions from their offices to over 85% of retail pharmacies
and six of the largest mail order pharmacies. In addition, Surescripts
provides physicians with electronic access to their patients'
prescription benefit and medication history, which improves safety and
enables doctors to prescribe medications with the lowest out-of-pocket
cost to the patient.

    About Surescripts

e-prescription network and supports a rapidly expanding ecosystem of
healthcare organizations nationwide. Surescripts was founded on the

&lt;p&gt;IBM said on Wednesday that it has included the Industrial Design Centre (IDC) at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT Bombay) to participate in its ongoing research into mobile phone interfaces. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The research aims at developing mobile device interfaces that can be easily used by people who are semiliterate or illiterate, as well as individuals who have limited or no access to information technology, IBM said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IIT Bombay is one of the top academic institutions in the country, and a number of technology companies, including Microsoft, do joint research with the institute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM and IIT Bombay are researching mobile user interfaces as part of IBM's Open Collaborative Research program, that aims to promote innovation through research collaboration between universities and industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM announced in March that it is doing research on mobile access for the aged and the illiterate with the National Institute of Design (NID) in India and the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology (RCAST) at the University of Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company decided to do the research in these two countries as Japan has a large aging population, which is not comfortable working with technology, while India has a large illiterate population. IBM has research labs in both countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 30 students of NID have already spread out into villages in a number of states in India to collect information on what would be required for a mobile phone to be accessible to illiterate people, and to people speaking languages other than English, a spokesman for IBM Research India said on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NID will be working on analyzing the device interface requirement from the perspective of users&#8217; requirement, as they have expertise in the area, while IIT Bombay will look into the systems design of the interface, the spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of the research and any applications or technology developed are to be released to the open source community, the spokesman said. Working with the open source community will help speed up the adoption of the technologies, and attract developers to build applications for the target populations, IBM said in March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today said it will deliver a record 14 security updates next week to patch a record-tying 34 vulnerabilities in Windows, Internet Explorer (IE), Office and Silverlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But people still running Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) will receive only a few of those fixes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Call it Massive Patch Tuesday," said Wolfgang Kandek, CTO of security risk and compliance provider Qualys. "It's a huge update, and more importantly, everybody's involved. I'm actually a little surprised at how large it is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight of the 14 updates were tagged with Microsoft's "critical" label, the highest threat ranking in its four-step scoring system. The remaining six were marked "important," the second-highest rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next week's Patch Tuesday will be a record on several fronts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 14 updates -- Microsoft dubs them "bulletins" -- are a record, beating the count from both February 2010 and October 2009 by one. The 34 individual patches equals the single-month record, which was first set last October and repeated in June 2010. And the eight critical updates next week will also tie the record set in October 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been shipping alternating large and small batches of fixes, with the larger-sized updates landing in even-numbered months, so the month's big numbers shouldn't have come as a complete shock. In July, for example, the company issued just four bulletins that patched five vulnerabilities. June's collection, however, amounted to 10 bulletins that fixed 34 flaws .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IE is also patched on an every-other-month schedule. Microsoft last fixed IE flaws in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is big, not only because of the numbers, but also because they'll affect everybody," said Kandek, referring to next week's lineup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Microsoft's monthly advance notification, the company will deliver 10 updates for Windows, half of them critical, the other five rated important. Two updates will patch one or more critical bugs in IE and Silverlight, while another pair affect Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All currently-supported versions of Windows are impacted by multiple updates, Microsoft said, with Windows XP Service Pack 3 (SP3), the oldest edition that receives patches, affected by all five Windows-only critical updates, as well as by the critical IE and Silverlight fixes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nor will Windows 7 escape next week: Two of the five critical Windows updates apply to the newest operating system, as do the critical IE and Silverlight patches. Windows 7 will receive at least 10 of the 14 planned updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Office updates are aimed at flaws in Word and Excel, and affect all versions of the word processor and spreadsheet with the exception of those in Office 2010. Both updates also apply to the Mac editions of Word and Excel, said Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A large month was expected," said Kandek, "but my main worry now is for Windows XP SP2 users who haven't upgraded."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Microsoft retired Windows XP SP2 and Windows 2000 from "extended support," which means security patches will no longer to crafted or supplied for those operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft made that clear earlier this week when it released an emergency, or "out-of-band" update , to quash a critical bug in Windows shortcuts that hackers have already used to hijack PCs, including machines in multiple companies that oversee important industrial control systems. It did not provide a patch then for XP SP2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Microsoft's policy prevents it from confirming whether unsupported software contains vulnerabilities, it's likely that XP SP2 harbors the same bugs as XP SP3, which will be patched next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All of those for XP SP3 are quite probably also in XP SP2," said Kandek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only will Microsoft not offer the applicable Windows updates to PCs running XP SP2, but it will also deny those machines the critical IE update .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Office updates may be delivered to users running Windows XP SP2, however; Microsoft evaluates Office's patching needs using the version of the suite running on the system, not on the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no free pass just because Windows Update doesn't offer you patches," said Kandek, talking to XP SP2 users, who might think they're safe because they won't see any updates offered on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qualys has offered users of obsolete operating systems a hand by testing some exploits against out-of-support versions of Windows. The company publishes the results on its Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll continue to do this to substantiate our suspicion that [XP SP2] is very vulnerable now that it's not being patched," said Kandek."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will release the 14 updates at approximately 1 p.m. ET on Aug. 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;CHARLOTTE, N.C./NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc is considering two options for its main proprietary trading group as it tries to comply with a new U.S. financial reform law, sources familiar with the process said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman executives have been meeting to decide what to do with the Goldman Principal Strategies Group, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One option is to spin it off into a separate fund that would raise its own capital from investors, these people said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also shift the group's employees into Goldman's asset management business, where they would become part of a $7 billion internal hedge fund that manages money for the firm's wealthy customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg first reported the news of the possible spin-off. A Goldman spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The restructuring would be the first big move by a large U.S. bank to deal with the new restriction on proprietary trading after the financial regulatory overhaul law passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman would benefit by being one the first Wall Street banks to determine how it was going to deal with its proprietary trading operations, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's going to be a lot of firms that have to do this, and I think there is a first-mover advantage for them," said Walter Todd, co-chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Goldman spins off the group, it is not clear how much money it would have to raise.

&lt;p&gt;Tired of managing those Exchange servers in your data center? So are many other companies, and even some of America's Fortune 50 companies are now starting to migrate e-mail and other productivity apps to the cloud -- disproving the notion that SaaS and cloud services are fit only for small or mid-sized businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dow Chemical is one such example. One of the leading providers of plastics, chemicals and agricultural products, the Midland, Mich.-based Dow has plans to move its Exchange servers to Microsoft's cloud service for business apps, called BPOS (business productivity online suite).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BPOS includes online versions of Exchange, SharePoint, Office Communication Server and Live Meeting, operated by and delivered through a Microsoft data center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dow is a company in transition regarding e-mail and productivity apps. With roughly 50,000 worldwide employees, the company is currently upgrading to Office 2007; it is beginning a full migration to Windows 7 that should be completed by the end of next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move to BPOS will transition Exchange 2003, OCS and Live Meeting to a cloud environment running Exchange 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dow will begin a global pilot testing program for its e-mail migration in November, and plans to have it implemented for its entire 52,000-person workforce by the second quarter of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ For complete coverage on Microsoft's new Windows 7 operating system -- including hands-on reviews, video tutorials and advice on enterprise rollouts -- see CIO.com's Windows 7 Bible. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It can go that fast because the migration will be transparent for users," says David Day, Dow's Director of Global Information Systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SharePoint aspect of BPOS will be new for Dow, as it has only been dabbling in SharePoint for document management and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find a Vendor You Trust&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is Dow convinced the change will be so transparent to users? The company is a Microsoft shop and having the Microsoft ecosystem in place was admittedly a factor in choosing BPOS, says Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dow did go through an RFP (Request for Proposal) and looked at a few BPOS competitors. Day says he is not at liberty to say which competitors Dow considered, but added that a couple competitors were neck and neck with BPOS on cost and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our previous relationship with Microsoft and its ability to deliver support were a big part of our decision," Day says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay Private&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dow's transition to the cloud for e-mail will not be jarring for users because Dow has had what Day considers a "private cloud" for years now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2000, Dow has had a third-party provider manage its e-mail servers on-premise in Dow's data center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A private cloud hosted by Microsoft is not such a new thing for us," he says. "It feels like a logical extension of our current sourcing strategy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One choice Dow never considered: a public cloud option. Why? Too many security and privacy risks, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The risk profile of a public cloud offering doesn't fit a corporation like Dow Chemical," Day says. "I can't imagine there are many Fortune 50 companies that think they're gonna 'Go Google' and save a million dollars."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get Added Security, Not Just Savings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though reluctant to discuss specific costs, Day says the value in moving to BPOS is to gain more capabilities without a huge increase in the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We did a very detailed cost comparison between re-architecting what we have on-premise versus a Microsoft BPOS solution and the cloud option won," says Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slideshow: Windows 7 Hardware in Pictures: The Latest and Greatest Laptops&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slideshow: Microsoft's Home of the Future: A Visual Tour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slideshow: Fighting the Dark Side: Tech's Heroes and Villains&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dow is doing a big uplift from Exchange 2003, with its limited mailbox sizes and quotas that just don't cut it in today's corporate e-mail environment. The BPOS advantage is that Dow will get Live Meeting and OCS for its worldwide workforce and Exchange mailboxes that can compete with Gmail on capacity, says Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another advantage in moving to the cloud, says Day, is the savings culled from letting Microsoft handle security measures such as intrusion protection and spam filtering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nobody can run Exchange like Microsoft," he says. "From a security perspective, I can't afford to spend as much on securing an Exchange environment as Microsoft can."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, says Day, IT departments need to work with their cloud vendor to ensure compliance regulations are being met. "We're not going to just toss all our data over the wall to Microsoft. We're going to engage with them regularly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Push the Vendor to Do More on Compliance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day understands that although Microsoft has been providing services via the Internet for years with its MSN mailboxes, it's quite a different thing to provide e-mail services to a Fortune 50 company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is going through a paradigm shift," says Day. "We're going to have to coordinate with them a lot and learn together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But one thing Microsoft must do is deliver on its cloud customers' compliance needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day has been adamant that Microsoft not just provide a console for Dow to monitor its own data, but to provide near real-time information flow through an automation interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So we're pushing Microsoft to feed us all available data through an automation framework so we can take immediate action for compliance reasons."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter what vendor you choose, Days adds, never enter into a cloud partnership lightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have to push them. That's critical."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shane O'Neill is a senior writer at CIO.com. Follow him on Twitter at twitter.com/smoneill.

BofA Spins Off Private Equity Firm

Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC) has spun off its private equity wing
Banc of America Capital Investors to form Ridgemont Equity Partners. Ridgemont
will manage a portfolio of about $1.5 billion or approximately 23% of BofA`s
private equity portfolio as of June 30, 2010. 

The decision to spin off the private equity division followed the regulatory
reform bill that became law in July 2010. Since the enactment of the law, this
is the first private equity business to have branched out from a bank. 

Banc of America Capital Investors has invested over $3 billion in 140 companies
since 1993. Now the principals of Ridgemont will continue to manage the legacy
Banc of America Capital Investors portfolio on behalf of BofA. Ridgemont intends
to raise a new private equity fund in the near future to focus on middle-market
buy-out and growth equity investments of $25 million to $100 million. 

Headquartered in Charlotte, Ridgemont will target companies in basic industries,
consumer &amp; retail, energy, healthcare, telecommunications, media, technology and
financial services. The team will have 19 investment professionals. 

According to the regulatory reform, banks will be restricted from investing more
than 3% of their capital in private equity in the long term. There is
significant regulatory pressure on banks to put more capital against such
private equity investments. Also, banks are experiencing decreasing returns from
private equity. As a result, many of the banks have been contemplating
divestments of their private equity arms. 

Among the major U.S. banks, Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) and Citigroup (NYSE: C)
have significant private equity exposures. These banks are considering a number
of options to comply with the new regulations. 

BofA`s second quarter earnings came in at 27 cents per share, 3 cents ahead of
the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 24 cents. However, this compares unfavorably
with the earnings of 33 cents in the prior-year quarter. 

Lower credit costs and sale of non-core assets were primarily responsible for
the better-than-expected results. However, pressure on trading and mortgage
banking income was the primary offsetting factor. An increased charge related to
the U.K. payroll tax was also among the negatives. 

Though continuing pressure on trading revenues will hurt the profitability of
BofA in the upcoming quarters, a slowdown in loan loss reserves like other large
banks will support the bottom-line. 

VeriSign Misses

VeriSign, Inc. (Nasdaq: VRSN) reported revenues of $169 million from continuing
operations for the second quarter of 2010, up 4% from the prior quarter and up
9% from the same quarter in 2009. The results underperformed the Zacks Consensus
Estimate of $203 million. 

Continuing operations primarily consist of Naming Services (comprising Registry
Services and Network Intelligence and Availability (NIA) Services). NIA includes
iDefense and the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) mitigation business. 

Results related to the Authentication Services business for the second quarter
have been reclassified as discontinued operations following the announced sale
of this business to Symantec. 

On May 19, 2010, VeriSign announced a definitive agreement to sell its
Authentication Services business to Symantec Corp. (Nasdaq: SYMC) for
approximately $1.28 billion in cash. 

Naming Services generated revenues of $168 million, up 9% sequentially. The
non-core Content Portal Services (CPS) business reported $1 million of revenues.


Revenues from discontinued operations were $102 million during the second
quarter. 

Both Naming and Authentication Services continue to see improvements driven by
the rebounding economy. Increases in advertising and e-commerce spending should
positively impact the company's business. 

The base of registered names in .com and .net totaled 101.5 million active
domain names, up from 99.3 million names at the end of March and growing 9% year
over year. The company added 2.2 million net domain names in the quarter, in
line with management's guidance of 2 million to 2.3 million names. During the
quarter, VeriSign processed 7.9 million new registrations, down from the record
8.1 million new registrations in the quarter, but up 13% year over year. Renewal
rate was strong at 72.1%, up from 71.2% in the previous quarter. 

On July 1, VeriSign increased the price for .com and .net new and renewing names
from $6.86 to $7.34 and from $4.23 to $4.65, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;Electric Vehicles Can Charge up in 20 to 30 Minutes
PORTLAND, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
Portland General Electric (NYSE:POR), Oregon`s largest utility, and NEC
Corporation (NEC) (TOKYO:6701), a leading network, communications and
information technology company, announced today they have opened North America`s
first public-use, quick-charge station for electric vehicles. 

The station was awarded public-use certification by the City of Portland
following the successful installation and testing of the station manufactured by
Takasago Ltd., a subsidiary of NEC, at the PGE headquarters in the Two World
Trade Center parking garage, 121 SW Salmon St, Portland, Ore. The Takasago Rapid
Charging Station is specialized for recharging electric vehicles with
lithium-ion batteries and requires only 20 to 30 minutes to recharge a battery
to 80 percent of full strength. 

PGE and NEC officially opened the quick-charge station today with Governor Ted
Kulongoski, who charged up an all-electric Nissan LEAF, during a two-day LEAF
test drive event at PGE. Portland and the state of Oregon have been designated
as top-tier launch markets for the Nissan LEAF when it goes on sale in the
United States in December. 

"Quick-charging stations are an exciting advancement in our effort to bring
electric vehicles to Oregon," said Gov. Kulongoski. "By making charging
convenient and available for public use, we are telling car manufacturers that
Oregon is ready for the next generation of electric vehicles - and we want our
state to be a leader in introducing these cars to the rest of the country." 

"Partnering with NEC to bring the nation`s first publicly available,
quick-charge station to Oregon further solidifies PGE`s commitment to developing
the infrastructure needed to support electric vehicles now coming to the U.S.
market," said Jim Piro, president and CEO, PGE. 

"With the addition of the Takasago Rapid Charging Station to the growing network
of EV charging stations in Oregon, we are able to further our research on how
this new technology will interact with our electrical system and support our
EV-driving customers," Piro added. 

"This project reflects NEC`s ongoing commitment to the development of new
infrastructure that utilizes renewable resources. As a supplier of electric
vehicle batteries, our introduction of the rapid electric vehicle charging
station is a natural stage in the evolution of NEC`s environmentally friendly
solutions," said Hideki Niwaya, general manager, Public Utility Solutions
Division, NEC. "Looking forward, NEC aims to continue developing mission
critical solutions, including information and communications technologies (ICT)
services and smart grids that represent the latest in technological innovation."


The Takasago Rapid Charging Station complies with the "CHAdeMO," a global EV
charging standard developed in Japan. The station provides power output of 50kw
(50-500V, 0-125A) and supports power input of AC200V&#177;30V. 

PGE`s alliance partner, Portland State University, and the Oregon Transportation
Research and Education Consortium will document the acquisition, installation,
certification, and testing procedures for this quick charger and release its
findings in September.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Salesforce.com have agreed to settle their patent suits against each other. The tale of two clouds can move on to the next chapter now as the two agree to disagree and enter into a license sharing agreement for the competing cloud technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft press release states "The cases have been settled through a patent agreement in which Salesforce.com will receive broad coverage under Microsoft's patent portfolio for its products and services as well as its back-end server infrastructure during the term. Also as part of the agreement, Microsoft receives coverage under Salesforce.com's patent portfolio for Microsoft's products and services."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horacio Gutierrez, corporate vice president and deputy general counsel of Intellectual Property and Licensing at Microsoft declared "Microsoft's patent portfolio is the strongest in the software industry and is the result of decades of software innovation. Today's agreement is an example of how companies can compete vigorously in the marketplace while respecting each other's intellectual property rights."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major players like Google, Amazon, and Salesforce exist solely in the cloud and have been a leading force in demonstrating the benefits of Web-based applications and storage, and driving businesses to migrate to the cloud. Microsoft has an advantage, though, with its vision of the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is easier to take an established dominance in client-server technologies, messaging, and productivity--software and services that businesses already rely on--and convince customers to migrate to the cloud, than it is to take an established presence in the cloud and build credible tools and services to compete with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It often seems like Microsoft is oblivious to technology trends, and simply lacks the agility to compete in new markets. Over time, though, Microsoft also has a demonstrated ability to come late to the party, crash it, and emerge as a dominant force after the fact. That seems to describe Microsoft's ascent into the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft seemed opposed to the cloud trend, fighting for the traditional client-server model it has built its server and desktop operating system empire on. When stubborn denial fails, though--and the cloud goes on despite Microsoft--eventually Microsoft has to recognize that there is a culture shift going on in technology and figure out how to adapt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for Microsoft, it has the intellectual property to create a compelling cloud service, as well as the customer base and corporate credibility to successfully market its Azure services and carve out a significant share of the cloud market. With the recently unveiled Windows Azure Platform appliance, Microsoft also offers a bit of a bridge between the traditional client-server model and the true cloud-based Azure platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with the Salesforce patent suits out of the way--including some monetary compensation to line Microsoft's pockets--Microsoft can proceed with doing what it does best: assimilate, adapt, and overcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chevron Corp urged a federal appeals court not to force it into Ecuador's courts to defend a $27.4 billion lawsuit alleging its oilfields polluted the Amazon rainforest and sickened thousands of Ecuadorians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Chevron contended the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York should instead uphold a lower court ruling in March allowing the second-largest U.S. oil company to take the 17-year-old case into international arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecuadorian farmers and indigenous residents accused Texaco, which Chevron bought in 2001, of making residents ill and damaging forestry and rivers through the discharge of some 18 billion gallons of toxic water into the rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Texaco had oil operations in Ecuador from 1964 to 1992, Chevron wants the country and state-owned Petroecuador, once a Texaco partner, to handle further cleanup and remedial costs, saying Texaco was released in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's really the government of Ecuador that should have to pay," said Randy Mastro, a partner at Gibson Dunn  Crutcher LLP representing Chevron, during the unusually long 1-3/4-hour argument on Thursday before a three-judge Second Circuit panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But lawyers for Ecuador and the residents said the matter should be tried in the Ecuadorian town of Lago Agrio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arbitration is "inconsistent fundamentally with the commitment (Chevron) repeatedly made" to let Ecuador's courts exercise jurisdiction, said Gene Schaerr, a partner at Winston  Strawn LLP representing the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Abady, a lawyer for the farmers and residents, said Chevron was trying to back out of its "unequivocal" agreement to let Ecuador's courts handle the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's shameless, an offense to this court," for Chevron "to engage in a global forum-shopping spree," said Abady, a partner at Emery Celli Brinckerhoff  Abady LLP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is hoping both to avoid liability, and to ensure that Ecuador will cover its losses if it were found liable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The San Ramon, California-based oil company has accused Ecuador of breaching the U.S.-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT), and interfering with and thus tainting litigation in the Lago Agrio court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a different judge in that case recused himself amid allegations of bribery, the current judge said a verdict is unlikely before early 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCOPE OF ARBITRATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Thursday's argument, Circuit Judge Gerard Lynch asked Mastro what Chevron hoped to accomplish by arbitrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are you really asking the arbitral court in the Hague that you are not liable to the plaintiffs?" Lynch asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mastro later responded that "we have not and will not ask the BIT tribunal to stop the entry of a judgment," but that "we do intend to fight enforcement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texaco had been based in Harrison, New York, within the Second Circuit's jurisdiction. The Second Circuit typically issues decisions several weeks or months after oral argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oil pollution dispute is the subject of the 2009 film "Crude." The Second Circuit on July 15 ordered the filmmaker Joe Berlinger to turn over some raw footage to Chevron, which the company sought for its defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a Tuesday filing in Manhattan federal court, Chevron said the outtakes show "collusion" between the residents' lawyers and a court-appointed expert, Richard Cabrera, who estimated the potential $27.4 billion liability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Ecuador et al v.

&lt;p&gt; * 17-year-old case carries potential $27.4 bln liability&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Chevron says Ecuador should pay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) urged a
federal appeals court not to force it into Ecuador's courts to
defend a $27.4 billion lawsuit alleging its oilfields polluted
the Amazon rainforest and sickened thousands of Ecuadorians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lawyers for Chevron contended the U.S. Second Circuit Court

argument on Thursday before a three-judge Second Circuit
panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But lawyers for Ecuador and the residents said the matter
should be tried in the Ecuadorian town of Lago Agrio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Arbitration is "inconsistent fundamentally with the

exercise jurisdiction, said Gene Schaerr, a partner at Winston

said Chevron was trying to back out of its "unequivocal"
agreement to let Ecuador's courts handle the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's shameless, an offense to this court," for Chevron "to
engage in a global forum-shopping spree," said Abady, a partner

that Ecuador will cover its losses if it were found liable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The San Ramon, California-based oil company has accused
Ecuador of breaching the U.S.-Ecuador Bilateral Investment
Treaty (BIT), and interfering with and thus tainting litigation
in the Lago Agrio court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After a different judge in that case recused himself amid
allegations of bribery, the current judge said a verdict is
unlikely before early 2011. [ID:nN30195531]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SCOPE OF ARBITRATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At Thursday's argument, Circuit Judge Gerard Lynch asked

(GS.N) is planning to shift its principal strategies business
into a fund that raises outside money, Bloomberg reported on
Thursday, citing a source with direct knowledge of the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The unit makes bets with the company's own capital, and
Goldman may announce as soon as Friday plans to separate the
business from the bank's equities unit, Bloomberg reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Led by Hong Kong-based Morgan Sze, 44, the team has not set
a target for how much outside money it wants to raise, though
it aims to complete the process by year-end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Bloomberg reported the unit is attempting to beat other
proprietary trading desks to raising outside capital, in a wave
of expected spin-offs by Wall Street banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the new Dodd-Frank Act passed in July, banks are
prohibited from engaging in proprietary trading, or making bets
in the market for the bank's own profits.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft on Wednesday updated its bare-bones preview of Internet Explorer 9 (IE9) for the last time, saying that the next release would be a beta build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on Wednesday updated its bare-bones preview of Internet Explorer 9 (IE9) for the last time, saying that the next release would be a beta build.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Microsoft hasn't named a release date for IE9's beta, the six-to-eight week stretch between each Platform Preview may provide a clue: If the company sticks to the same gap between the fourth preview and the beta, the latter should show on or after Sept. 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In IE9 Platform Preview 4, Microsoft has integrated its new JavaScript engine into the browser , finished its work on hardware acceleration and boosted performance in several areas, including the Acid3 test, said the IE team's leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The IE9 platform is nearly complete," said Dean Hachamovitch, general manager of IE, in a detailed post on the browser's blog Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last updated six weeks ago , the IE9 Platform Preview is not a full-fledged browser, but instead consists of a minimalist interface wrapped around Microsoft's newest rendering and JavaScript engines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Microsoft debuted IE9 in mid-March, the company committed to updating the IE9 preview approximately every eight weeks until it issues a public beta. That beta is slated to ship next month , according to comments made last week by Kevin Turner, Microsoft's chief operating officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth preview includes fixes for previously reported bugs, wraps up the graphics processor-powered audio, video and text acceleration, and moves Microsoft's new "Chakra" JavaScript engine inside the browser for better performance, Hachamovitch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One aspect of [meeting our goals] is integrating the JavaScript engine natively inside the browser, rather than bolting it onto the side to support multiple JavaScript engines as some other browsers do today," Hachamovitch said, taking a shot at rivals such as Mozilla's Firefox. "How a JavaScript engine is integrated into the browser is as important as the engine itself for real-world HTML5."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Microsoft once downplayed JavaScript speeds -- Hachamovitch dismissed the contest for fastest browser as just a "drag race" during IE8's development -- it's aggressively touted Chakra's performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Hachamovitch, IE9 Platform Preview 4 scores better on the SunSpider JavaScript test suite than all rivals except Google 's Chrome and Opera Software's Opera. Microsoft's SunSpider results differ from Computerworld's latest, which pegged Apple's Safari as the fastest on Windows, with Opera and Chrome close behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the Acid3 benchmark, which checks how closely a browser follows certain Web standards, the IE9 Platform Preview 4 scored 95 out of a possible 100, the highest ever for a Microsoft browser. The score was a 14% improvement over Platform Preview 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hachamovitch hinted that the score of 95 would be IE9's best effort, arguing that the standards which prevent it from acing the benchmark are "in transition" and thus unlikely to get full support from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IE is on a two-month upswing in usage share, according to the most recent data from Net Applications, and Microsoft has to hope that when it ships in final form, that IE9 will be able to turn around the browser's long-term decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 16MB Platform Preview 4 can be downloaded from Microsoft's site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike production versions, the IE9 preview can run alongside other editions, such as IE7 on Vista or IE8 on Windows 7 . However, neither the Platform Preview nor the final version of IE9 will run on Windows XP, a sticking point with some users of that nine-year-old operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more about browsers in Computerworld's Browsers Topic Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
Nine properties across North Carolina will sell at a bank-ordered real estate
auction on August 17 and 18. J. P. King Auction Company, the nation`s leading
real estate auction marketing firm, will conduct four events that span across
two days, where they will offer commercial buildings, homes and land. The four
events will take place in Spindale, Winston-Salem, Southern Pines and
Kannapolis. 

"It`s a great opportunity to buy a variety of properties at a fraction of the
original cost," said Craig King, president and CEO of J. P. King Auction
Company. "When banks acquire properties through foreclosure, they want to
convert those properties back into active loans as quickly as possible, and this
provides discounted rates and high values for buyers." 

The first event, in Spindale, takes place on August 17 at 10 a.m. where a
two-story home will be offered followed by six acres of development land. The
land, which is zoned for a residential development, will sell absolute with no
minimums and no reserves. 

Two land tracts and five homes will be offered at the Kannapolis event,
including 52 acres in The Falls Subdivision and 42 acres at 412 Village Park.
This event will be held at the Holiday Inn in Salisbury at 3 p.m. 

In Winston-Salem, J. P. King will offer an 11,000 square-foot commercial
building fronting Reidsville Road. This brick building sits on 1.5 acres and
will be auctioned at 10 a.m. on August 18. At 3 p.m. in Southern Pines, a large
commercial building, formerly an indoor golf facility, will sell on-site at 110
Pinehurst Avenue. 

For additional information, including information on property tours, individuals
may contact J. P. King at 800.558.5464 or visit the company`s website at
www.jpking.com. 

J. P. King Auction Company specializes in high-value properties and portfolios
such as luxury homes, developments, condominiums, land and ranches. The company
has marketed properties in all 50 states and six countries with recent sales in
Texas, Florida, Tennessee, Oregon, Wisconsin, Alabama and Wyoming. This sale is
conducted through its asset division, which serves corporate clients, financial
institutions and government entities in the disposition of strategic assets.

&lt;p&gt;Early users endorse first milestone of the LexisNexis customer collaboration and
innovation initiative


NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Since the introduction of Lexis&#174;for Microsoft Office earlier this year, legal
professionals are expressing excitement for this first-of-its-kind solution that
integrates sources of valuable legal content directly within the trusted
Microsoft Office desktop applications they use every day. LexisNexis has been
installing the solution for a growing number of its customers since spring, and
announced today that the solution is now broadly available. Early users of Lexis
for Microsoft have provided overwhelmingly positive feedback. 

"Lexis for Microsoft Office is a great concept. It helps save time when
researching or validating briefs from opposing counsel," said George Hampton, a
law firm partner who served as one of the beta testers for Lexis for Microsoft
office. "In the past, you`d have to write the citations on a piece of paper and
then visit Lexis.com to look each one up, one at a time. Now, you don`t have to
manually input citations, Lexis for Microsoft Office enables you to be self
sufficient." 

Created through close collaboration with thousands of customers, Lexis for
Microsoft Office enables users to work more efficiently and productively,
delivering greater service to clients. This is achieved by offering seamless
access and management of information and services from LexisNexis&#174;, the open Web
and designated law firm or corporate files with the click of a button without
ever leaving Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Word or Microsoft SharePoint Server. 

"I just saw a demonstration of Lexis for Microsoft Office and wow, seamlessly
integrating Lexis analysis and content into the platforms where we, and our
lawyers and legal staff spend most of our days is a huge breakthrough," said
Carol Gruenburg, Director of Library Services, Miller &amp; Chevalier Chartered.
"Add in full text of statutes and case citations that pop up magically in a new
window as soon as you open the email or document and the capability of being
able to simultaneously search the Web, lexis.com, and your firm`s internal
documents, and your jaw just drops open! Looks like a winner to me, and we have
already signed up for this exciting platform." 

"I can see myself using Lexis for Microsoft Office to help streamline and
simplify workload," said Ryan Pak, law firm associate and beta tester for Lexis
for Microsoft Office. "It`s a great product that helps highlight cases and
judges, while bringing in the Web component in an easy-to-use manner." 

"LexisNexis has a history of collaborating with customers to create new ways for
legal and business professionals to do their jobs, find what they need and
manage their businesses," said Bob Romeo, SVP, Research and Litigation Solutions
at LexisNexis. "Lexis for Microsoft Office continues this tradition by
introducing a new era of improved collaboration, productivity and access to
information for legal professionals and others - freeing them to focus on
strategy, client service and confidently managing legal matters." 

How Lexis for Microsoft Office Works

While reviewing an Outlook e-mail message or a Word document, Lexis for
Microsoft Office users can seamlessly access vital information and services. Key
features and benefits include:

* "Search" - A single search box for one-click access to the vast collection of
legal content from LexisNexis, the open Web and the user`s desktop files.
Results are displayed in a window next to the active document for easy review
and management - virtually eliminating the time and effort to switch between the
desktop and search sites to conduct research. 
* "Background" - This function scans an Outlook message or Word document for
"entities" such as people, companies, organizations and cases and provides
hyperlinks to relevant documents, full text case law, news and other types of
information within internal, LexisNexis and Web resources. Upon clicking a
hyperlink, information is displayed in a side pane within the Microsoft Office
applications. The Background feature also displays Shepard`s&#174; reports and
applies Shepard&#8217;s&#174; SignalTM indicators directly to the cases cited within the
text of the document. These features benefit users by minimizing the need to go
back and forth between multiple databases to collect information - speeding the
process and reducing the risk of missing information when transposing it from
one place to another. 
* "Suggest" - By manually highlighting any text in an Outlook or Word file, the
user can prompt a search that will pull up relevant information from internal,
LexisNexis and Web resources. The content is displayed in a side pane within the
application for use and management for more productivity and efficient work.

Lexis for Microsoft Office is available either through a standard installation
with easy to download instructions or through a custom installation and
deployment that includes integration of an enterprise document management system
or SharePoint site. The custom installation allows a firm to leverage its
existing IT investment by giving legal professionals the ability to search all
available documents in a single search from within Microsoft Outlook and Word. 

Lexis for Microsoft Office is compatible with Microsoft Office 2010 and
Microsoft Office 2007 and requires a current LexisNexis subscription. More
information is available at: www.lexisnexis.com/office.

PORTLAND, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
Portland General Electric Company (NYSE:POR) today reported net income of $24
million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the three months ended June 30, 2010,
compared to $24 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, for the three months ended
June 30, 2009. PGE now estimates earnings per diluted share to range from $1.40
to $1.55 for 2010, which reflects positive impacts from improvements in hydro
conditions, strong thermal plant operations, and Oregon Senate Bill 408 (SB
408), offset by a decrease in the 2010 load forecast. 

Retail revenues increased $26 million, or 7%, from the second quarter of 2009
primarily due to a change in the mix of customers purchasing their energy
requirements from PGE. A 4% decrease in average retail prices reduced retail
revenues in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2009,
which was offset by a $13 million increase related to SB 408. 

Retail energy deliveries were flat, with residential deliveries increasing 2.4%,
primarily driven by cooler temperatures in the second quarter of 2010, offset by
a 1.1% decrease in industrial and commercial deliveries. On a weather adjusted
basis, retail deliveries decreased 3.5% due to the continuation of a weak
economy. Weather adjusted retail energy deliveries for 2010 are expected to be
approximately 1% to 1.5% below 2009. 

The average variable power cost in the second quarter of 2010 decreased 7%
compared to the second quarter of 2009 and was driven primarily by an increase
in lower-cost generation, which was driven by lower fuel costs and higher plant
availability. Availability of the plants PGE operates was approximately 92% in
the first half of 2010 compared to 84% in the first half of 2009, with Colstrip
availability at 96% and 72%, respectively. 

Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2010 was $51 million, or $0.68 per
diluted share, compared to $55 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, for the
comparable period of 2009. A 4.5% decrease in retail energy deliveries, driven
by the continuing effects of the economy and mild weather, partially offset by a
7% decrease in the average variable power cost, contributed to the decrease in
net income. A $12 million increase in revenues related to SB 408 also partially
offset the decrease in net income. 

"Our continued focus on operational excellence delivered positive results this
quarter. We executed strong thermal operations. Our distribution system
performed well, delivering high power quality and reliability to customers.
Construction of Phase III of our Biglow Canyon Wind Farm is on time and under
budget, with the first 24 wind turbines now in service," said Jim Piro,
President and Chief Executive Officer. "The General Rate Case process is
proceeding on schedule and we have reached agreement on all items related to
revenue requirements." 

Second Quarter Highlights

* Reached agreement in the Company`s 2011 General Rate Case proceeding among
PGE, the Public Utility Commission of Oregon (OPUC) staff and customer groups on
all items related to revenue requirement issues in the case, with the following
impact to the original filing:

                                       General               Net Variable                            
                                       Rate Case *           Power Costs              Total          
                                                                                                     
 Original filing                        $     158           $      (33    )        $   125      
 Revenue requirement stipulations             (48   )              -                   (48  )   
 Cost of capital stipulation                  (15   )              -                   (15  )   
 NVPC update                                  5                    (15    )            (10  )   
                                                                                                     
                    Filing as revised  $     100           $      (48    )        $   52       
                                                                                                     
 * - Forecasted 2011 NVPC will be updated at various dates through November 2010. In addition, the load forecast will be updated in September. These updates may impact the amounts presented. 
                                                                                                           
 Included in the stipulated items, PGE agreed to remove four capital projects expected to be placed in service in 2011 from the proposed 2011 average rate base, with the OPUC staff and customer groups supporting the use of deferred accounting that would begin at the time each related capital project is placed in service. The parties have also agreed on a fixed Power Cost Adjustment Mechanism deadband range of $15 million below to $30 million above baseline NVPC, a capital structure of 50% debt and 50% 
 equity, a return on equity of 10% and a cost of capital of 8.033%. PGE is in the process of aligning its 2011 budgets to reflect stipulations reached. 
                                                                                                           
 The initial filing as proposed would have resulted in an overall customer price increase of approximately 7.4%, compared to approximately 3% after considering all items agreed to date among PGE, OPUC staff and customer groups, which is subject to change for updates to the forecast for 2011 load and NVPC. The regulatory review process is continuing, with a final order on this general rate case expected from the OPUC before the end of 2010. New rates are expected to be effective January 1, 2011. 


* Continued to advocate for a solution that balances the interests of customers
and the environment with regard to the continued operation of Boardman that
allows sufficient time to secure replacement facilities and ensure system
reliability. The Oregon Environmental Quality Commission denied PGE`s petition
seeking to revise Regional Haze rules, which would have supported the Company`s
proposal to cease coal-fired operations at Boardman by 2020, and directed the
Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) to propose alternatives. In
June, the DEQ proposed three alternatives for ceasing coal-fired operations at
Boardman between 2015 and 2020. PGE believes that these options would impose
greater costs, price volatility risks and power availability risks on its
customers than the Company`s proposal to cease coal-fired operation at Boardman
in 2020. 
* Received approximately 1% more energy from hydro resources than normal during
the second quarter of 2010, compared to 21% less in the first quarter of 2010,
for 10% less in the first half of 2010. For the year, energy from hydro
resources is expected to remain below normal. 
* Completing the final phase of the Biglow Canyon Wind Farm project on time and
under budget, which consists of 76 wind turbines with a capacity of
approximately 175 MW. Phase III is expected to be completed in the third quarter
of 2010 at an estimated total cost of $390 million. Energy from wind resources
provided 6% of PGE`s retail load requirement in the second quarter of 2010
compared to 3% in the second quarter of 2009, which was due to the completion of
Phase II during the second quarter of 2009. 
* Issued $58 million of First Mortgage Bonds, completing PGE`s planned long-term
debt issuances for 2010. PGE`s effective interest rate has decreased
approximately 7% during the first half of 2010 compared to the first half of
2009. 
* Received the 2010 Edison Award for the Selective Water Withdrawal structure,
the first of a kind floating surface fish collection facility coupled with power
generation in the world. Presented by Edison Electric Institute annually, this
award is the electric utilities industry`s highest and most prestigious honor,
recognizing U.S. and international electric utilities for their innovation and
role in advancing the industry.

Second Quarter Operating Results

* Revenues increased $26 million, or 7%, in the second quarter of 2010 compared
to the second quarter of 2009 primarily due to:

* A $21 million increase related to retail energy deliveries consisting of:

* A 2.4% increase in residential energy deliveries, driven by colder than normal
weather in the second quarter of 2010 compared to warmer than normal weather in
the second quarter of 2009, and an increase in residential customers of 3,500
and; 
* A shift in the mix of customers purchasing their energy requirements from PGE,
partially offset by 1.1% decrease in commercial and industrial energy
deliveries, with commercial energy deliveries decreasing 4.1%, primarily due to
the continued impact of the slowed economy, partially offset by industrial
energy deliveries increasing 4.9%;

* A $13 million increase related to SB 408. In the second quarter of 2010, PGE
recorded an estimated collection from customers of $4 million, compared to an
estimated refund to customers of $9 million in the second quarter of 2009; 
* A $5 million increase related to the decoupling mechanism. In the second
quarter of 2010, PGE recorded a collection from customers of $3 million,
compared to a refund to customers of $2 million in the second quarter of 2009,
partially offset by; 
* A $16 million decrease related to a 4% decrease in average retail price, which
primarily reflects a decrease in net variable power costs, partially offset by
increases for the Biglow Canyon Phase II and Selective Water Withdrawal capital
projects.

* Purchased power and fuel expense increased $2 million, or 1%, in the second
quarter of 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2009, with $15 million related
to an 8% increase in total system load, offset by $13 million related to a 7%
decrease in average variable power cost. The average variable power cost
decreased to $35.60 per MWh in the second quarter of 2010, from $38.12 per MWh
in the second quarter of 2009, primarily due to a shift in the mix of sources of
energy and a decrease in the average cost of purchased power. Thermal generation
was reduced during the second quarter of 2009 as a result of the economic
curtailment of natural gas-fired plants due to the high cost of natural gas and
extended maintenance outages at Colstrip Unit 4 and Boardman. 
* Depreciation and amortization expense increased $7 million, or 14%, in the
second quarter of 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2009 largely due to
increased capital additions related to Biglow Canyon Phase II and the smart
meter project. 
* Other income, net decreased $9 million primarily resulting from an $8 million
change in the fair value of non-qualified benefit plan assets. In the second
quarter of 2010, PGE recorded a $3 million loss, compared to a $5 million gain
recorded in the second quarter of 2009.

2010 Earnings Guidance

PGE revised 2010 earnings guidance from the previously reported range of $1.30
to $1.45 earnings per diluted share to $1.40 to $1.55 earnings per diluted
share. The key drivers for the guidance revision include:

* Improved hydro conditions, driven by the wettest June on record in the Pacific
Northwest; 
* Strong thermal plant operations; 
* A positive impact from SB 408; and 
* Decline in margin from retail sales, driven by the reduction in weather
adjusted load forecast from approximately flat to down 1% to 1.5%.

Each of the first three items above represents approximately a $0.05 increase in
earnings per diluted share, with the decline in margin representing
approximately a $0.05 decrease in earnings per diluted share.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM and Aetna Inc on Thursday jointly launched a service aimed at helping hospitals improve patient care by making better use of electronic medical records and other digital data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp said the service, developed with Aetna subsidiary ActiveHealth Management, would help physicians access patients' health data like previous medical records, claims, and lab data from multiple sources and quickly analyze what the best treatment might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service, which will incorporate IBM's analytical software, is also designed to flag overdue check-ups and alert doctors to which patients in their wards require the most immediate attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These services could help hospitals reduce medical mistakes and unnecessary tests and treatments, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Merkel, vice president and healthcare industry leader of IBM Global Business Services, said: "With the adoption of electronic medical records, there's a huge increase in digital information that's available on patients. We're leveraging that information and providing deep analytical insight to support doctors and patient care, and providing the most advanced analytics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service will also help physicians and hospitals measure their performance against national standards. Doctors who show higher quality, lower-cost care could win higher reimbursement rates from insurance companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has over the past decade shifted its focus from hardware to software and services, and is investing heavily on developing more analytical and predictive technologies that can be used to, for example, prevent fraud or help ease traffic congestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also sees the healthcare market as a key business opportunity, with the overall health IT market estimated at around $20 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to that, Merkel said, IBM was hoping to win access to $30 billion of federal funds for the adoption of electronic healthcare records.

&lt;p&gt;The Google security engineer who stirred up a hornets' nest two months ago after publicizing a critical Windows vulnerability said Friday that Microsoft will credit his work on four of the 34 bugs slated for patching on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Apparently I'm getting four credits on Tuesday," said Tavis Ormandy in a Twitter message Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ormandy is the researcher who disclosed a bug in Windows' Help and Support Center just five days after reporting it to Microsoft. Ormandy said he took the bug public when Microsoft wouldn't commit to a patching deadline; Microsoft has disputed that, claiming that it had only told Ormandy it needed the rest of that week to decide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting debate over Ormandy's actions grew heated at times , as some researchers defended his actions while others criticized him for revealing information that later was used by hackers to attack Windows PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the incident, Google said researchers should give vendors a 60-day window to patch, then go public with their findings to pressure patching. Not surprisingly, Microsoft has disagreed with setting patch-or-else deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plugged Ormandy's vulnerability on July 13 as part of that month's Patch Tuesday. Microsoft did not credit Ormandy, or anyone else for that matter, in the MS10-042 advisory that accompanied the Help and Support Center patch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, Microsoft reiterated that that was standard practice, and had nothing to do with Ormandy specifically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When a security researcher is acknowledged in one of Microsoft's monthly security bulletins, it means that the vulnerability was reported to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) privately," said Jerry Bryant, a group manager with the MSRC, in a e-mail reply to questions last month. "The acknowledged individual or organization security researcher worked with us to help us understand the vulnerability, the extent of the risk to the products and platforms, and possible mitigations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bryant's language was identical to policies Microsoft has spelled out on its Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four flaws that Ormandy said will be acknowledged were reported privately to Microsoft, Bryant intimated. "Credit given in our bulletins is always based on the finder working with us to keep vulnerability details private until the update goes out," he said Friday. "The August bulletins will not deviate from normal process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bryant declined to confirm that Ormandy will, in fact, receive credit for several vulnerabilities. "As usual, we cannot discuss details of bulletins, beyond the [advanced notification] and yesterday's blog post, until they are released," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ormandy did not reply to questions about when he reported the vulnerabilities to Microsoft, and whether he thought it meant anything more than Microsoft following its usual practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Storms, director of security operations for nCircle Security, noted that researchers typically receive a heads-up several days prior to a Patch Tuesday that will include fixes for bugs they have privately reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French security researcher Matthieu Suiche said Friday that he would also receive credit for reporting four vulnerabilities on Tuesday's fix list. "Apparently I'm getting only 4 credits too," he said on Twitter .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suiche, who now has his own security consultancy, MoonSols , has worked for EADS, the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company; the Netherlands Forensics Institute of the Dutch Ministry of Justice; and, according to his LinkedIn profile, participated in Google's Summer of Code, a program that provides student developers stipends to write code for open-source projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storms assumed that there was nothing under the surface about Ormandy receiving credit next week. "It would be pure speculation if Microsoft is patching his bugs any quicker than others," Storms said in an interview conducted via instant message. "In fact, I don't think I'd touch that topic with a 10-foot pole. But we can certainly be certain that Microsoft is keeping the conversation open and often with Tavis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bryant declined to respond to additional questions, including whether Microsoft was giving Ormandy's vulnerabilities higher priority than other researchers' bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That didn't surprise Storms. "I think everyone wants to keep the relationship open and professional as much as possible," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Microsoft urged others to drop the term "responsible disclosure" and instead substitute "coordinated vulnerability disclosure" (CVD) to describe the collaboration between researchers and vendors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Mike Reavey, the director of the MSRC, the name change would eliminate the loaded word "responsible" from the debate about how researchers report bugs and how and when companies provide patches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview two weeks ago, Reavey denied that the name change was triggered by the Ormandy disclosure, saying that Microsoft had been working with outside researchers and security experts for months before the June brouhaha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Aug. 10, Microsoft will release 14 updates -- 8 labeled "critical" and 10 affecting Windows -- that will patch 34 bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) expects a measure of its capital strength to fall slightly under the latest proposals from banking supervisors, according to a quarterly filing with regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Basel Committee of global banking supervisors last month issued revisions to its Basel III reform, which aims to force banks to hold more and better-quality capital to withstand future shocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank, said the measure of its capital strength known as its Tier 1 common ratio, that is, its Tier 1 common capital divided by its risk-weighted assets, would fall between 100 and 200 basis points under the latest proposals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That ratio was 9.6 percent at the end of the second quarter. The bank has been increasing its capital strength during the financial crisis. In the year-earlier period, its Tier 1 common ratio was 7.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York-based JPMorgan also said that if the latest Basel revisions are adopted as proposed last month, it would need to change the profile of its assets and liabilities to make them more liquid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Group of 20 leading countries agreed in June to phase in the Basel III reforms over several years. Banks had argued that introducing the reforms could crimp their ability to lend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan gave no update in its filing of the expected impact on its business from U.S. financial reform, signed into law by President Barack Obama last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank only said that the reform could result, among other things, in "significant" loss of revenue and additional costs for its businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay)&lt;/p&gt;

$1.08. Revenue increased 11% to $1.2 billion, with Tysabri and Rituxan being the
primary growth drivers. 

Based on second quarter results and Biogen's new guidance for 2010, we have
raised our earnings estimate for 2010 by 29 cents to $4.73. Key products Avonex
and Tysabri continue to contribute significantly to sales and we expect Biogen
to maintain its leading position in the multiple sclerosis market. The company
is working on building its pipeline through acquisitions and in-licensing deals.


In our opinion, Biogen has the best pipeline in all of biotech, and could be an
attractive takeover candidate for pharma companies interested in biologics.
Although we remain concerned about an increase in the occurrence of PML in
patients using Tysabri, we are upgrading the stock to Outperform based on the
second quarter performance and improved outlook for 2010. 

Bear of the Day: 

Eastman Kodak Company (NYSE: EK) reported disappointing results for the second
quarter of 2010 based on lower prices and higher raw material costs. We believe
this will continue in the near future based on a slower market recovery. 

Thus, we reduced our earnings estimate for the quarter and fiscal year.
Moreover, a highly competitive market and Kodak's huge exposure to volatile
products pose immense risks. The company also faces integration and other risks
related to acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, divestitures and
outsourcing of transactions. 

Moreover, a huge dependence on third party manufacturers and external suppliers
negates both top-line and bottom-line results. Thus, we reiterate our
Underperform rating on the stock.

Social Security Still in Good Shape

There is a huge amount of hysteria in the country that says that Social Security
is nothing but a ponzi scheme and is about to go bankrupt. This is simply not
true, and is mostly being propagated by those who would love to see Social
Security turned over to Wall Street. Doing so would put the retirement security
of millions of Americans into grave danger. 

Just think of what would have happened if a big part of the Social Security
assets had been in the hands of Lehman Brothers or even Morgan Stanley (NYSE:
MS) or Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) two years ago. 

The overhead costs to administer the program are exceptionally small. Yes, in
this case, the government is more efficient than the private sector, and not
just marginally. Starting in 1982 with the Greenspan Commission, Social Security
recognized the demographic time bomb posed by the "baby boom" and subsequent
"baby bust." As a result, the idea was that people would pay in more than
required for Social Security to run on a pay-as-you-go basis (which is how it
was run up until that point). The extra funds would go into a trust fund. That
trust fund now holds $2.5 Trillion. 

So how is that money invested? It is invested in the safest assets around:
T-Notes and Bonds. The government holding its own liabilities is a bit strange,
and that is where the claim that the Social Security trust fund is composed of
nothing but "worthless IOUs" comes from. However, if that is true, then it is
equally true that the assets of a T-bond fund run by Vanguard or PIMCO are also
composed of worthless IOUs. 

In nominal terms, as long as the liabilities of the government are denominated
in dollars, the government cannot default. That is true if the liabilities of
the government are held by PIMCO, or the Chinese, or the Social Security Trust
Fund. 

Allstate Outshines Estimates

Allstate Corporation`s (NYSE: ALL) second quarter operating earnings of 81 cents
per share came in way ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 70 cents and the
55 cents per share recorded in the year-ago quarter. 

Results for the quarter deteriorated primarily due to lower revenue as a result
of a significant decline in investment income. However, decreased expenses,
prudent capital management and strong liquidity impressed during the reported
quarter. 

Allstate`s net income for the reported quarter came in at $145 million or 27
cents per share, compared with $389 million or 72 cents in the prior-year
quarter. Operating income for the reported quarter, which excludes realized net
gains and losses from the sale of investments as well as accruals on unhedged
derivative instruments, was $441 million, up 48.5% from $297 million in the
year-ago quarter.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Goldman May Divest Proprietary Trading

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) is planning to spin off some or all of its
proprietary trading businesses this month in order to abide by new regulations,
according to a report on CNBC yesterday. 

The decision to spin off the proprietary trading businesses followed the
regulatory reform bill that became law in July 2010. A provision in the law
called Volcker Rule, named after Paul A. Volcker, former Federal Reserve
chairman, restricts banks from utilizing their money to speculate on trades in
order to prevent huge risky bets. Since the enactment of the law, this is the
first step taken by New York-based investment bank to adapt its business,
mindful the U.S. financial reform package. 

Goldman is considering two options before arriving at any decision. The first is
to seed a hedge fund staffed by its former proprietary traders with the money of
the bank and swap it with third party money with the implementation of the new
rule in the coming years. The second option is to shift proprietary trading into
the bank's asset management unit, in which clients' money is invested instead of
the bank`s own money. 

According to the regulatory reform, banks will be restricted from proprietary
trading and investing more than 3% of their capital in private equity or hedge
fund investments in the long term. Proprietary trading has been a pivotal source
of investment bank profits and the step is an attempt to minimize the
speculation on banks, which might be the reason of the recent financial crisis. 

At present, GS has more than 27% of its capital invested in such entities,
followed by Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) at 8.9%; Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) and Bank
of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC) each having 4%. Such portion of investment in
such entities will affect the bank`s trading revenues to a greater extent in the
coming years. 

Apart from Goldman, many other U.S. banks including Citigroup, Bank of America
Corporation, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM), and othersare trying to reduce
their investments in hedge funds and private equity. Though the regulation will
take several years before its effects can be seen, these banks are considering a
number of options to comply with it. 

In the upcoming quarters, we believe that though continuing pressure on trading
revenues will hurt the profitability of GS, a slowdown in loan loss reserves
like other large banks will support the bottom line. 

Goldman currently retains its Zacks #5 Rank, which translates to a short-term
Strong Sell rating. However, considering the fundamentals, we are maintaining a
Neutral recommendation on the stock.

&lt;p&gt;SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation has today filed a petition before the Provincial Court of
Sucumb&#237;os in Lago Agrio, Ecuador seeking dismissal of the lawsuit pending
against it there. In support of its petition, Chevron has submitted to the court
video outtakes from the movie Crude that show the plaintiffs' counsel,
consultants, and associates meeting with the court's supposedly neutral "Global
Expert," Richard Stalin Cabrera Vega, to plan and create the $27.3 billion
damages report that Cabrera later would present to the court as his own. 

Chevron believes that the video evidence proves that plaintiffs' counsel and
consultants colluded with Cabrera to present a fraudulent report and then to
present a fraudulent "peer review" of their own work. Chevron also believes that
the video proves that plaintiffs' and Cabrera's denials of their collusion in
filings and testimony before the Ecuadorian court, before various United States
courts and other institutions, and before the worldwide press have been false. 

Chevron's petition argues that the case must be dismissed as a sanction for the
abusive misconduct by plaintiffs and their attorneys, and because the fraudulent
"Global Expert" report submitted under Cabrera's name is the only "evidence"
supporting plaintiffs' case. 

Chevron is one of the world's leading integrated energy companies, with
subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company's success is driven by
the ingenuity and commitment of its employees and their application of the most
innovative technologies in the world. Chevron is involved in virtually every
facet of the energy industry. The company explores for, produces and transports
crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes transportation fuels
and other energy products; manufactures and sells petrochemical products;
generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides energy efficiency
solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future, including biofuels.
Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif. More information about Chevron is

&lt;p&gt; * Exxon seeks to recover more than $45 mln&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Suit says gov't controlled Baytown complex in wartime&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Gov't says it did not have operational control of plants&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Anna Driver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOUSTON, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) is
suing the United States to recover more than $45 million in
clean-up costs at its refining and petrochemical plants in
Baytown, Texas, saying the government controlled the facilities
during World War Two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon argues it should be reimbursed for what it spent to
clean up toxic substances around the complex because the
government assumed ownership and or "substantial operational
control" of the plants throughout the war in the 1940s and up
to the Korean War in the early 1950s, according to a lawsuit
filed in federal court in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The wartime-related operations at these plants resulted in
the generation and disposal of a significant amount of waste at
the Baytown site," the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a separate filing, the government denied it had assumed
operational control over the facility during wartime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Baytown plant, owned by Exxon predecessor Humble Oil,
began as a small refinery around 1920. During the 1940s, Exxon
says, the government reconfigured and expanded the plant to
make war-related materials including aviation fuel, rubber and
toluene, the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The refineries and five other production plants at Baytown
generated "substantial hazardous waste" that was disposed of at
the site, while treated wastewater was discharged into nearby
bodies of water, including the Houston Ship Channel, the oil
company's complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, the owner or operator
of a facility is responsible for response costs for the release
of hazardous materials, Exxon's lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Since 2004, ExxonMobil has been working in good faith with
the government to resolve these claims," Exxon spokeswoman
Kristen Hellmer said in a statement. "In light of the looming
statutory deadline to file our contract action, ExxonMobil has
determined it necessary to proceed with filing our contract
claim."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon said that it still hopes for an amicable resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon is liable as the current owner and operator of the
Baytown complex, and as the owner and operator of the Baytown
refinery when the disposal of hazardous substances occurred,"
the U.S. government said in its response to Exxon's complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice declined
additional comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "For Exxon, this is chicken feed, it's barely a rounding
error on their annual budget," said Tom "Smitty" Smith, state
director of consumer environmental group Public Citizen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon reported a net profit of $7.56 billion in the second
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon and the government had engaged in confidential
settlement discussions, which have so far been unsuccessful,
the two sides said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's Baytown complex, located about 25 miles east of
Houston, is home to the largest refinery in the United States.
The facility also has a chemical plant, an olefins plant and a
plastics plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A hearing on the case is set for Sept. 24 in U.S. District
court in Houston, where the case was transferred from the
Eastern District of Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is Exxon Mobil Corporation v United States of
America, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Texas, No. 10-02386.

&lt;p&gt; By Dena Aubin

 NEW YORK, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co's marquee brand
name has caused its bonds to trade at yields very close to
gold-plated U.S. Treasuries, but little upside is left and
other media companies offer credit investors better value.

 Disney's (DIS.N) bonds are trading as high as 120 cents on
the dollar, with yield spreads as thin as 42 basis points over
Treasuries, according to MarketAxess.

 Overall, its bonds are trading as though the company were
rated Aa1, or four notches higher than its A2 rating, according
to Moody's Market-Implied Ratings data. That is one of the
largest gaps of any U.S. corporate borrower.

 "It's brand-name investing," said Jake Newman, analyst at
fixed-income research service CreditSights. Bond investors
"probably own it because they don't want to have to think about
it. It's one of the ones you just put away and you're not going
to worry about a huge credit blowup."

 Even so, Disney is facing challenges. Its ABC network has
lagged peers and may face more competition as GE's (GE.N) NBC
Universal invests to revive the fortunes of NBC, Newman said.

 Disney's film studio has been able to generate some big
blockbusters every year, "but I do worry that too much of their
pipeline is derivative of stories they've already done," he
said. That panned out with "Alice In Wonderland" but not so
well for "Sorcerer's Apprentice."

 Disney is still able to attract the people who make the
best movies, "so over time I think the film studio should be
OK, but there are short-term issues such as too many sequels,"
he said.

 Disney is also spending heavily on new cruise ships, a
cyclical business that will likely be volatile, and on share
buybacks to offset shares issued to buy Marvel Entertainment,
he said.

 According to fixed-income research Gimme Credit, News Corp
(NWSA.O) NWS.N or Omnicom Group (OMC.N) would be better bets
for credit investors.

 "News Corp has more exposure to the advertising market,
which has really done well over the past two quarters,
particularly this past quarter," said Gimme Credit analyst Dave
Novosel. Moreover, the company for the most part has a
conservative financial policy, he said. "They've resisted the
urge to buy a lot of companies or add a lot of debt," he said.

 News Corp's News America Inc bonds with an 8 percent coupon
due in 2016 are yielding 196 basis points over Treasuries,
according to MarketAxess.

 Omnicom is also benefiting from the revival of the
advertising market and has a variable cost structure, which has
allowed it to keep margins relatively high even during the
industry downturn, Novosel said. "As we go into the upturn, I
think they're very well positioned to boost margins," he said.

 A new issue of 10-year notes from Omnicom Group is yielding
148 basis points over Treasuries, according to MarketAxess.

 Viacom Inc's VIAb.N bonds also offer more value than
Disney's, according to CreditSights' Newman.

 "The company has been a lot more disciplined than I think
the market has given them credit for," he said. For example,
management has said the company will not do any share buybacks
until the fourth quarter, when the majority of its cash flow
comes in, he said.

 Even without buybacks, its shares are outperforming the SP
500 index by a wide margin, making it easier for management to
stick to its conservative policy, he said.

 Viacom's 6.125 percent notes due in 2017 are yielding 78
basis points over Treasuries, according to MarketAxess. Its
five-year credit default swaps are trading around 80 basis
points versus 50.5 basis points for Disney.

 Newman said he also likes CBS Corp's (CBS.N) bonds. The
company handily beat Wall Street expectations for revenue and
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
in the second quarter, thanks to a rebound in its ad business
and strong international demand for its content.

 CBS Corp's 5.75 percent notes due in 2020 are yielding
around 160 basis points over Treasuries.

&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Chevron Corp has acquired an exploration license for the Beaufort Sea in Canada's Far North with a C$103.3 million ($101 million) bid as the country gets set to review offshore drilling following the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, which is responsible for oil and gas activity in the Arctic, awarded Chevron a 205,946 hectare (508,800 acre) block north of the Yukon coast and just east of the Canada-U.S. boundary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acreage was up for grabs as part of a 2009-10 call for bids and follows Chevron's last winning Beaufort acreage bid, a C$1 million package in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has yet to devise seismic and drilling plans for the new block, Chevron Canada Vice-President David MacInnis said. The plans will require approval by Canada's National Energy Board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron already had interests in 10 Beaufort discoveries, including 33 percent of the 1986 Amauligak find and 13 percent of the adjacent Issungak discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its latest acquisition comes after a nearly C$600 million acquisition of Beaufort Sea exploration rights in 2007 by Imperial Oil Ltd and Exxon Mobil Corp and a C$1.2 billion winning bid for acreage by BP Plc the following year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, the three formed a joint venture to explore on their parcels to avoid duplication of equipment and personnel in the remote, icy region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacInnis said Chevron was not part of that tie-up, but was open to looking for opportunities to work with other players in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imperial said last week that the partners will not start exploratory work until after the NEB completes its review of offshore safety and environmental impact. The regulator announced the review in response to heightened government and public concern after the U.S. Gulf spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron will participate in the proceedings, MacInnis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're looking forward to the review and putting forward some ideas as to how to improve performance and especially address questions that are coming up on oil spill prevention and containment," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the NEB announced the review in May, it canceled a planned hearing on a request from BP and Exxon to reexamine a requirement that Arctic drillers need to drill a relief well in the same season that an exploratory well is completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no date yet for when the review is to begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is operating Canada's only current offshore drilling project, the deep water Lona 0-55 well in the Orphan Basin off the coast of Newfoundland. It is expected to reach its target depth next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares were down $1.04, or 1.3 percent, at $78.03 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=$1.02 Canadian)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jeffrey Jones; editing by Peter Galloway)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TORONTO (Reuters) - A woman in the Toronto area has admitted to faking cancer, running a bogus charity and collecting thousands of dollars from people who thought she was dying, a Toronto newspaper reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashley Anne Kirilow, 23, shaved her head and eyebrows, plucked her eyelashes, and starved herself to look like she was going through chemotherapy treatments, the report in the Toronto Star said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She befriended different local groups and recruited volunteers to help her organize events and benefit concerts in her own honor, and even convinced a cancer awareness organization -- Skate4Cancer -- to fly her to Disney World to fulfill what she said was a dying wish. All told, she raised C$20,000 ($19,400), volunteers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her charity 'Change' for Cure, was never registered with tax authorities. On its Facebook page, which has over 4,000 members, she said it was "started October 2009 one very late night while I was sick in bed after my 'Chemo Day.'" (here)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Star said Kirilow contacted the paper, saying she was sorry for what she had done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was trying to be noticed.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chevron Corp urged a federal appeals court not to force it into Ecuador's courts to defend a $27.4 billion lawsuit alleging its oilfields polluted the Amazon rainforest and sickened thousands of Ecuadorians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Chevron contended the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York should instead uphold a lower court ruling in March allowing the second-largest U.S. oil company to take the 17-year-old case into international arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecuadorian farmers and indigenous residents accused Texaco, which Chevron bought in 2001, of making residents ill and damaging forestry and rivers through the discharge of some 18 billion gallons of toxic water into the rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Texaco had oil operations in Ecuador from 1964 to 1992, Chevron wants the country and state-owned Petroecuador, once a Texaco partner, to handle further cleanup and remedial costs, saying Texaco was released in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's really the government of Ecuador that should have to pay," said Randy Mastro, a partner at Gibson Dunn  Crutcher LLP representing Chevron, during the unusually long 1-3/4-hour argument on Thursday before a three-judge Second Circuit panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But lawyers for Ecuador and the residents said the matter should be tried in the Ecuadorian town of Lago Agrio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arbitration is "inconsistent fundamentally with the commitment (Chevron) repeatedly made" to let Ecuador's courts exercise jurisdiction, said Gene Schaerr, a partner at Winston  Strawn LLP representing the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Abady, a lawyer for the farmers and residents, said Chevron was trying to back out of its "unequivocal" agreement to let Ecuador's courts handle the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's shameless, an offense to this court," for Chevron "to engage in a global forum-shopping spree," said Abady, a partner at Emery Celli Brinckerhoff  Abady LLP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is hoping both to avoid liability, and to ensure that Ecuador will cover its losses if it were found liable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The San Ramon, California-based oil company has accused Ecuador of breaching the U.S.-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT), and interfering with and thus tainting litigation in the Lago Agrio court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a different judge in that case recused himself amid allegations of bribery, the current judge said a verdict is unlikely before early 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCOPE OF ARBITRATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Thursday's argument, Circuit Judge Gerard Lynch asked Mastro what Chevron hoped to accomplish by arbitrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are you really asking the arbitral court in the Hague that you are not liable to the plaintiffs?" Lynch asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mastro later responded that "we have not and will not ask the BIT tribunal to stop the entry of a judgment," but that "we do intend to fight enforcement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texaco had been based in Harrison, New York, within the Second Circuit's jurisdiction. The Second Circuit typically issues decisions several weeks or months after oral argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oil pollution dispute is the subject of the 2009 film "Crude." The Second Circuit on July 15 ordered the filmmaker Joe Berlinger to turn over some raw footage to Chevron, which the company sought for its defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a Tuesday filing in Manhattan federal court, Chevron said the outtakes show "collusion" between the residents' lawyers and a court-appointed expert, Richard Cabrera, who estimated the potential $27.4 billion liability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Ecuador et al v. Chevron Corp et al, U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 10-1020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ACCRA Aug 6 (Reuters) - Ghana's government will soon decide
whether or not to approve Kosmos Energy's proposed sale of a
stake in the Jubilee oilfield to ExxonMobil (XOM.N), the West
African country's energy minister said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) said last month
it had rejected a request by Kosmos to sell its stake in Jubilee
to ExxonMobil [ID:nLDE66410L].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kosmos separately wrote to President John Atta Mills asking
for the government's approval. At the time, a government
spokesman said Ghana would not approve the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The government of Ghana subsequently set up a committee to
... study the request and advise government," Energy Minister
Joe Oteng-Adjei said in Friday's statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The committee has since finished its work and presented its
report to the government who is studying the report and would
soon state its official position on the matter," the statement
said, without saying when a decision will be announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First oil is due in the final quarter of 2010 with initial
output expected at 120,000 barrels per day.

 (Adds company comment, background. In U.S. dollars unless
noted)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CALGARY, Alberta, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N)
has acquired an exploration license for the Beaufort Sea in
Canada's Far North with a C$103.3 million ($101 million) bid as
the country gets set to review offshore drilling following the
BP (BP.L) oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, which is responsible
for oil and gas activity in the Arctic, awarded Chevron a
205,946 hectare (508,800 acre) block north of the Yukon coast
and just east of the Canada-U.S. boundary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The acreage was up for grabs as part of a 2009-10 call for
bids and follows Chevron's last winning Beaufort acreage bid, a
C$1 million package in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has yet to devise seismic and drilling plans
for the new block, Chevron Canada Vice-President David MacInnis
said. The plans will require approval by Canada's National
Energy Board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron already had interests in 10 Beaufort discoveries,
including 33 percent of the 1986 Amauligak find and 13 percent
of the adjacent Issungak discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its latest acquisition comes after a nearly C$600 million
acquisition of Beaufort Sea exploration rights in 2007 by
Imperial Oil Ltd (IMO.TO) and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and a
C$1.2 billion winning bid for acreage by BP Plc (BP.L) the
following year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, the three formed a joint venture to explore on
their parcels to avoid duplication of equipment and personnel
in the remote, icy region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MacInnis said Chevron was not part of that tie-up, but was
open to looking for opportunities to work with other players in
the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Imperial said last week that the partners will not start
exploratory work until after the NEB completes its review of
offshore safety and environmental impact. The regulator
announced the review in response to heightened government and
public concern after the U.S. Gulf spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron will participate in the proceedings, MacInnis
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're looking forward to the review and putting forward
some ideas as to how to improve performance and especially
address questions that are coming up on oil spill prevention
and containment," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When the NEB announced the review in May, it canceled a
planned hearing on a request from BP and Exxon to reexamine a
requirement that Arctic drillers need to drill a relief well in
the same season that an exploratory well is completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is no date yet for when the review is to begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron is operating Canada's only current offshore
drilling project, the deep water Lona 0-55 well in the Orphan
Basin off the coast of Newfoundland. It is expected to reach
its target depth next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron shares were down $1.04, or 1.3 percent, at $78.03
on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=$1.02 Canadian)

PASADENA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Disney Store continued the worldwide roll-out of its newly-designed stores with
a grand opening event at Southern California`s Santa Monica Place. Mickey Mouse,
Minnie Mouse, celebrity guests and mom bloggers helped officially open the third
newly designed Disney Store in the United States. Guests lined up to receive
their free Disney Store-branded Mickey ears, build their very own custom car in
the Disney&#8729;Pixar CARS-branded RIDEMAKERZ experience, and wave their wand in the

moment featuring their favorite princess. In the Disney Store Theatre guests
were treated to a special eight minute preview of Walt Disney`s Tinker Belland
the Great Fairy Rescue, releasing on Disney Blu-ray and DVD September 21st.
Adding to the excitement was a group of L.A.`s top mom bloggers blogging live

years. In addition to Santa Monica and the already opened Montebello location,
the next California location will open at San Diego`s Fashion Valley mall this

look and feel today. Infusing the site with more storytelling moments and
imagination-filled elements, guests will enjoy a 24-hour a day magical online

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings downgrades and assigns Loss Severity (LS) ratings, Recovery
Ratings (RR) or revises the Rating Outlook to the following classes of J.P.
Morgan Commercial Mortgage Finance Corp., Series 1999-C8 (JP Morgan 1999-C8)
mortgage pass-through certificates: 

--$16.5 million class G to 'BB/LS4' from 'A-'; Outlook to Negative from Stable; 

--$20.1 million class H to 'C/RR4' from 'B'. 

In addition, Fitch affirms the ratings, assigns LS ratings and revises RRs as
indicated: 

--$9.1 million class D at 'AAA/LS4'; Outlook Stable; 

--$25.6 million class E at 'AAA/LS3'; Outlook Stable; 

--$11 million class F at 'AAA/LS4'; Outlook Stable; 

--$4.7 million class J at 'D/RR6' from 'D/RR5'. 

Fitch withdraws the rating of the interest-only class X. (For additional
information, see 'Fitch Revises Practice for Rating IO &amp; Pre-Payment Related
Structured Finance Securities', dated June 23, 2010.) 

The downgrades are the result of Fitch's revised loss estimates for the
transaction following Fitch's prospective analysis, which is similar to its
recent vintage fixed-rate commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) analysis.
Fitch expects potential losses of 20.25%, approximately $17.6 million, of the
remaining pool balance from the loans in special servicing and the loans that
are not expected to refinance at maturity based on Fitch's refinance test. The
Rating Outlooks reflect the likely direction of any rating changes over the next
one to two years. 

As of the July 2010 distribution date, the pool has paid down 88.1% to $86.9
million from $731.5 million at issuance. Two loans (12.2%) are defeased. Fitch
has identified 11 Loans of Concern (57.6%), including seven loans in special
servicing (50.4%). 

The largest specially serviced asset (24% in total) is a delinquent multifamily
property located in Rolling Meadows, IL. A recent sale of the property did not
close and the special servicer is moving forward with a previously filed
foreclosure action. 

The next largest specially serviced asset (6.7%) is a real estate owned (REO)
office property located in St. Louis, MO. This former railroad station was
transferred to special servicing in 2008 after the borrower discontinued loan
payments. 

The third largest specially serviced asset (5.8%) is a multifamily property
located in Columbus, OH. As part of a foreclosure action, the property is
currently under contract for sale. 

Fitch stressed the cash flow of the remaining non-defeased loans by, generally,
applying a 10% reduction to 2008 fiscal year-end net operating income or
adjusted 2009 cash flow based on performance issues, such as a significant
decline in occupancy, and applying an adjusted market cap rate between 7.25% and
10.5% to determine value. 

Similar to Fitch's prospective analysis of recent vintage CMBS, each loan also
underwent a refinance test by applying an 8% interest rate and 30-year
amortization schedule based on the stressed cash flow. Loans that could
refinance to a debt service coverage ratio of 1.25 times or higher were
considered to pay off at maturity. Under this scenario, two loans are not
expected to pay off at maturity with both loans incurring a loss when compared
to Fitch's stressed value. 

Additional information on Fitch's amended criteria for analyzing recent vintage
U.S. CMBS is available in the July 7, 2009 report, 'Surveillance Methodology for
Recent Vintage U.S. CMBS,' which is available at 'www.fitchratings.com' under

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Plans by the United States to charge travelers a $14 fee for its visa waiver program are regrettable and inconsistent with a U.S. commitment to ease transatlantic travel, the European Union said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The levy will be required from September 8, when an interim U.S. rule covering the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) becomes effective, the European Commission said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I regret very much the fee established by the interim rule," EU Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said in a statement, saying she had repeatedly raised concerns about the introduction of a fee that may deter or complicate travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I remain convinced that these new requirements ... are inconsistent with the commitment of the U.S. to facilitate transatlantic mobility and will be an additional onus for European citizens traveling to the U.S.," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ESTA system requires travelers to complete an online application form, answering questions they previously had to respond to on paper forms aboard flights or ships bound for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The questions include whether a passenger has a communicable disease, a physical or mental disorder, abuses drugs, has been convicted of certain criminal offences, or been involved in espionage, terrorism or genocide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the EU first studied the introduction of ESTA in December 2008, it did not believe the system was tantamount to a visa application process, which can incur a fee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission said it now would carry out a definitive assessment of the ESTA, once U.S. authorities published the final rules. It stressed that the fee requirement would be a factor in the assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Brunnstrom)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Aug 6 (Reuters) - The first trade in European Union
carbon permit futures for delivery in 2020, the year the next
phase of the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme ends, was done on
Friday for 22.72 euros ($29.98) a tonne, the deal's broker said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The over-the-counter trade on the European Climate Exchange
(ECX) between Gunvor Global Energy and JP Morgan (JPM.N)
involved a complex structure that included contracts with other
delivery dates within phase 3 of the scheme (2013-2020),
Tradition said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This supports our belief in the longevity of the carbon
market, and we are pleased to remain at the forefront as it
continues to evolve," said Mike Anderson, head of European
energy at Tradition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Friday marked the first day the ECX, the world's largest
carbon marketplace, offered trade in EU Allowance futures for
delivery in 2015-2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The size of the trade was not disclosed, but data from ECX's
website showed that 10 lots of Dec-2020 EUA futures, equivalent
to 10,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide, changed hands this morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another 10 lots of Dec-18 futures and 20 lots of Dec-19
futures were also traded OTC on the ECX at undisclosed prices.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft on Friday said it is investigating an unpatched vulnerability in Windows after an Israeli researcher revealed a bug in the operating system's kernel driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Gil Dabah, a researcher from Tel Aviv who goes by the nickname "arkon," the Windows' kernel harbors a heap overflow vulnerability. Dabah also posted a short proof-of-concept to demonstrate the bug on RageStorm.com, a site he and two others run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is investigating reports of a possible vulnerability in Windows Kernel," said Jerry Bryant on Friday. "Upon completion of the investigation, Microsoft will take appropriate actions to protect customers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an alert published Friday , Danish bug tracker Secunia pinpointed the bug in the "Win32k.sys" kernel-mode device driver, the kernel component of the Windows subsystem. Attackers could exploit the flaw using "GetClipboardData," an API (application programming interface) that retrieves data from the Window clipboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A successful exploit would allow hackers to execute their attack code in kernel mode, which would then let them infect the PC with malware or pillage any data on the machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flaw exists in several versions of Windows, including XP SP3, Server 2003 R2, Vista, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 SP2, said Secunia, which rated the bug as "less critical," the firm's second-lowest threat ranking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has patched 13 Windows kernel vulnerabilities this year. In June, for example, MS10-032 patched three vulnerabilities in Win32k.sys; in April, it quashed eight bugs with MS10-021 ; and in February, MS10-015 fixed two flaws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One researcher with experience digging up kernel bugs said the latest is business as usual. "I don't think there's been more than a few days this year that Microsoft [hasn't] been vulnerable to public kernel flaws," said Tavis Ormandy on Twitter . Ormandy reported three of this year's kernel vulnerabilities to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of those bugs were rated as "important," Microsoft's second-highest ranking, because they could not be exploited remotely, but required an attacker to have physical access to the PC and valid log-in credentials. It's likely that Dabah's find will as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will issue 14 security updates , including 10 for Windows, on Tuesday. But unless the company found Dabah's flaw on its own, or the vulnerability was reported by another researcher earlier -- it's not unheard of for several researchers to stumble across the same bug -- a fix won't appear until September or later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, said Secunia, "Grant access [only] to trusted users."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 8 (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) shares are
cheap and would be a "reasonable" long-term bet, thanks to an
investor overreaction to the new financial regulatory reform
law, Barron's business weekly said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Rival MasterCard Inc (MA.N) could be an even safer bet
than Visa, due to its lower market share in processing debit
transactions, the newspaper said in a separate article on
Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both Visa and MasterCard process debit and credit card
transactions for banks. A provision of the sweeping Dodd-Frank
law will restrict the processing fees that merchants pay banks
every time a customer pays for a product or a service with a
debit card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors fear that Visa and MasterCard could see their
growth stifled by the law, especially if banks react by
raising other card-related fees, Barron's said. The stock
prices of both card companies have fallen about 20 percent
since that provision surfaced in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Barron's said that investors have overlooked the
companies' core strengths. Both generate growth from a
"powerful" long-term trend as consumers shift from paying with
cash to paying with plastic. Investors are also ignoring the
probability that earnings will rise in the next year, before
the law is implemented, the weekly financial paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa, the world's largest credit and debit card processing
network, is growing rapidly abroad and developing emerging
technologies, including mobile payments and e-commerce,
Barron's said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is as cheap as you are going to get Visa shares. They
have been terribly discounted," Goldman Sachs analyst Julio
Quinteros Jr. told Barron's, predicting that the price of Visa
shares could rise almost 30 percent over the next 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, MasterCard might even reap benefits from the
law, Barron's said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. regulators must implement a provision of the law
requiring more competition in certain types of debit card
processing, which could give MasterCard an opportunity to take
market share from Visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "MasterCard has a pristine balance sheet, great free cash
flow and a strong fundamental business, and it is under good
management," C.T. Fitzpatrick, a former portfolio manager at
LongLeaf Partners, told Barron's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MasterCard represents 6.6 percent, or the largest holding,
of his new Vulcan Value Partners fund, according to the
paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MasterCard is "an excellent long-term bet," Fitzpatrick
told Barron's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Friday, Visa's stock closed at $72.14, up 64 cents, or
less than 1 percent, while MasterCard shares ended at $207.42,
up $5.79, or almost 3 percent.

&lt;p&gt;Chevron`s Hypocrisy On Display As Oil Giant Tries to Block Relief It Had
Previously Requested
LAGO AGRIO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
In what should be viewed as a gain for Chevron, the Ecuadorian judge overseeing
the multi-billion dollar environmental lawsuit against the oil giant has ordered
both parties to submit independent damages assessments within six weeks, lawyers
for the Amazonian communities announced today. 

Chevron, however, is opposing the order that allows it to do its own damages
assessment, said Jonathan Abady, who represents the Amazonian communities. 

The court last week ordered the new damages assessments based on the existing
evidence in the case, which includes more than 64,000 chemical sampling results
documenting contamination at more than 100 former Chevron oil production sites.
The reports are due in late September. 

The latest order came in response to numerous complaints by Chevron over the
report produced by Dr. Richard Cabrera in 2008. However, when the judge ordered
the parties to submit their own assessments, Chevron immediately filed a motion
to block the court from implementing its order. That motion was denied. 

The order to conduct new assessments suggests that the judge in Ecuador is
bending over backwards to accommodate Chevron`s numerous requests for relief,
but that Chevron is not really interested in participating in the trial, said
Abady. 

In light of its own soil sampling currently in evidence - which proves
overwhelmingly that Chevron is liable for extensive and costly remediation -- it
appears the company`s only strategy is to try to attack a single report prepared
by Cabrera, said Abady. 

"This is the ultimate test for Chevron to put up or shut up," Abady said. "Since
Chevron seems to be so unhappy with the Cabrera report, it is incumbent on the
company to do its own damages assessment now that the court is providing that
opportunity. If they refuse to participate in the process, at this juncture
under these circumstances, Chevron`s obstructionism and hypocrisy will be on
display for everyone to see." 

"Chevron essentially asked the judge to issue an order blocking Chevron from
receiving the very relief it had requested," said Abady. "That`s because Chevron
knows the extent of the pervasive damage it caused to the Ecuadorian rainforest.
Any legitimate damages assessment will corroborate this essential fact." 

"Now that Chevron has gotten what it had asked for, it claims it doesn`t want
it," added Abady. "Chevron has an opportunity to submit its own damages analysis
from its own expert - and it doesn`t want to do that? 

"These facts speak for themselves. There is nothing new in this tactic. Chevron
continues to try to block a judgment on the merits," he added. 

The Amazonian communities in Ecuador have defended the Cabrera report as valid
and technically sound, and have pointed out that the $27.3 billion damages
number in his report is modest compared to clean up costs of other large
disasters such at the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico. 

The judge issued his order on August 2. It asks the parties to assess the
"economic cost" of the environmental damages documented by more than 100 expert
reports and the tens of thousands of chemical sampling results now before the
court. 

It is unclear whether the court ultimately will rely on the Cabrera report or
one of the numerous other expert reports currently in evidence when assessing
liability and damages, said Ilann Maazel, another American lawyer who represents
the plaintiffs. 

Even though Cabrera had asked that both parties submit information he could use
in his report, Chevron boycotted the process as part of a strategy to discredit
the court, said Maazel.

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

AIG Surpasses Zacks Estimate

American International Group Inc. (NYSE: AIG) reported second-quarter operating
earnings of $1.34 billion or $1.99 per share, significantly ahead of the Zacks
Consensus Estimate of 99 cents and operating income of $1.14 billion or $1.71
per share in the year-ago period. 

On a GAAP basis, AIG reported a net loss of $2.66 billion or $3.96 per share,
compared with a net income of $1.82 billion or $2.30 per share in the year-ago
quarter. This included loss from discontinued operations, derivative hedging
loss and net realized capital losses, marginally offset by gains from divested
businesses. 

Although results from insurance operations appeared sluggish due to AIG`s
ongoing business restructuring process, stability persists which has driven the
book value per share during the quarter. It is notable that premiums, deposits
and other considerations were up 24% year over year. 

AIG`s continuing insurance operations reported an adjusted operating income
(before net realized capital gains) of $2.2 billion, significantly ahead of $1.5
billion reported in the year-ago quarter. 

AIG recorded catastrophe losses of $287 million in its General Insurance
business. As a result, the division managed to earn $955 million compared with
$1.0 billion in the year-ago quarter. Combined ratio was 102.0% compared with
98.2% in the prior-year period. 

Con Edison In Line with Consensus

Consolidated Edison Inc. (NYSE: ED) announced its second quarter fiscal 2010
results of EPS of 51 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and
beating the year-ago EPS of 48 cents. On a reported basis, including the net
mark-to-market effects of the competitive energy businesses the company reported
earnings of 65 cents per share compared with 55 cents per share in the year-ago
quarter. 

The GAAP EPS variances reflect the year-over-year differences, where Con Edison
of New York reported higher operations and maintenance expenses (12 cents),
Depreciation and property taxes (9 cents) and Other including dilutive effect of
new stock issuances (2 cents). The weighted average number of common shares was
281 million and 274 million for the three months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. 

The above negatives were partially offset by higher rates authorizing higher
recovery of costs (20 cents), and lower net interest expense (2 cents). The net
effect was that EPS was down by a penny year over year while the Orange and
Rockland utilities and parent company expenses remained steady. In the
Competitive Energy businesses, EPS rose by 11 cents. 

Earnings from ongoing operations were $144 million compared with $131 million in
the year-ago quarter. Consolidated Edison`s net income increased to $183 million
from $150 million. The upside came from lower costs at its utilities and
stronger-than-expected performance at its competitive energy businesses. 

Consolidated Edison raised its earnings per share from ongoing guidance range
for fiscal 2010 to $3.25 - $3.45 from the earlier guidance range of $3.10 -
$3.30 per share. The higher range reflects, among other things, stronger than
projected financial performance at Con Edison of New York through cost control
efforts and stronger than projected financial performance at the competitive
energy businesses. Earnings per share from ongoing operations exclude the net
mark-to-market effects of the competitive energy businesses. 

Activision Marginally Beats

A leading publisher of online, personal computers, console, handheld and mobile
games, Activision Blizzard Inc. (Nasdaq: ATVI) reported second-quarter earnings
of 5 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents but was
down a penny per share year over year. 

The decline can primarily be credited to declining revenue growth and
contraction in operating margins. Fewer releases and continued weakness at
retail led to the quarter`s weak results. Earnings include stock-based
compensation expenses but exclude one-time items. 

Revenues

Revenues on a non-GAAP basis (excluding net effect from deferral) decreased
14.7% year over year to $683.0 million in the second quarter. 

Lower revenues were attributable to the 29.0% plunge in sales of consoles from
the year-earlier quarter. Sales of handheld games declined 40.0% year over year
and distribution revenues were down 19.0% year over year in the quarter. These
were partially offset by the sales of digital online channels, which grew more
than 20.0% year over year. 

Activision published four games during the quarter and two Call of Duty map
packs. During the second quarter of 2010, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 game
held the number one position in the U.S. in the action category, according to
research firm NPD Group. 

In June this year, Activision released a map pack for Call of Duty: Modern
Warfare 2 Resurgence Pack for Microsoft Corp.`s (Nasdaq: MSFT) Xbox Live online
entertainment network. This pack was also available for Sony Corp.`s (NYSE: SNE)
PlayStation 3 and personal computers. Contracts with large companies have
enabled Activision to reach the 20 million mark for the Call of Duty game in the
second quarter. We expect Call of Duty to drive revenues for the company in the
second half of the year.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights: AMERCO (Nasdaq: UHAL), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:
GS), Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT), Target (NYSE: TGT) and Toyota (NYSE: TM). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

AMERCO (Nasdaq: UHAL) is the parent company of U-Haul International, the largest
consumer truck rental company in the world. It is also the second largest
self-storage company in North America. 

The impact of the decline in housing and a decrease in apartment occupancy rates
appears to have ended. We expect continued improvements in operating parameters.
Based on a low valuation of EBITDAL, we continue to rate the stock Outperform
with a price target of $80.00 a share. 

The stock has usually been valued on EBITDAL (EBITDA plus lease expense) per
share, selling between two and three times EBITDAL. Based on our estimates for
the next four quarters EBITDAL of $36.49 a share, we would expect a price range
of $55 to $91. We expect a valuation at the mid-end to high end of the range. 

Bear of the Day: 

We are downgrading our recommendation on Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) to
Underperform from Neutral, based on the effects related to Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) charges and the negative impact of new financial
regulatory reform. 

Litigation issues not only impact a company's reputation but also dent its
financials. Further, the new regulatory reform will continue to pressure trading
revenues, which will hurt the profitability of Goldman in the upcoming quarters.


Our six-month target price of $142.00 equates to about 9.5x our earnings
estimate for 2010. Combined with the $1.40 per share annual dividend, this price
target implies an expected negative total return of 8.5% over that period, which
is consistent with our Underperform recommendation.

Employment Report In-Depth

The private sector job gains were a little bit short of expectations of about
80,000 job gains. The big disappointment was the sharp downward revision to just
31,000 private jobs gained in June rather than the 83,000 reported last month. 

The goods producing sector added 33,000 jobs, up from a loss of 3,000 jobs in
June (originally -8000). The services sector added 38,000 jobs versus 34,000 in
June, although the June number was revised down from a gain of 91,000 jobs.
Relative to the state of things a year ago, though, these are very good numbers.
Last July, the economy lost a total of 346,000 jobs including 297,000 in the
private sector, 128,000 in the goods producing sector and 169,000 in the service
sector. 

Within the goods producing sector, manufacturing added 36,000, up from a gain of
13,000 in June. That makes seven straight months of manufacturing job gains. The
last time that statement could have been made was back in March of 1998. Since
the start of the year, the economy has added a total of 183,000 manufacturing
jobs. 

As the graph below shows, that does not begin to reverse the secular decline
that manufacturing employment (blue line, left scale) has been in since 1979.
The peak in manufacturing employment was back in July 1979 at 19.531 million.
The decline in factory jobs really accelerated in 2001; in January 2001 there
were still 17.211 million factory jobs in the country. Even with the recent
rebound, today there are just 11.717 million manufacturing jobs. 

There have been two forces at work here. First is automation, which means
employers can make the same or more stuff with fewer workers. The second is the
shipping of jobs overseas where labor costs are much lower. Since we no longer
make the stuff here we import it. 

The trade deficit is entirely on the goods side; we actually regularly run a
small trade surplus in services. While about half the goods trade deficit is due
to oil, the rest is from all the imported stuff that fills the aisles of
Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) and Target (NYSE: TGT). While over the years foreign auto
makers such as Toyota (NYSE: TM) have gained significant market share from
domestic auto makers.

 (Adds details, closing stock price)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Joe Rauch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHARLOTTE, N.C., Aug 9 (Reuters) - Sluggish markets and the
May 6 "flash crash" pinched even highflier Goldman Sachs Group
Inc (GS.N) in the second quarter including the first daily
trading loss of more than $100 million in over a year,
according to the company's quarterly report filed on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York-based investment bank reported 10 days of
trading losses in the period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman posted losses of more than $100 million on three
trading days in the quarter, after reporting zero in 2009. The
bank tallied 36 such days in 2008 throughout the height of the
financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the first quarter, Goldman hit trading perfection by
reporting trading gains of at least $25 million every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's trading gains and losses have mirrored those of
its Wall Street counterparts: Surging first-quarter trading
results cooled in the spring and early summer. (For a graphic
that shows trading day losses at the major Wall St. banks,
click here: link.reuters.com/heb24n)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SP 500 Index .SPX fell 12 percent in the second
quarter as the flash crash, the debate in the U.S. Congress
over financial reform, and renewed investor fears about U.S.
economic growth resulted in low returns and high volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts and investors said Goldman's second-quarter
results were not surprising, given the quarter's trading
headwinds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It speaks to the difficulty of the markets we're in right
now," said Walter Todd, co-chief investment officer at
Greenwood Capital  Associates. "It's a very tough market for
anyone to figure out and try to make any money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the second quarter was still largely profitable for
Goldman's trading operations, positive trading days seesawed
between booming returns and sluggish results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank reported 17 days with more than $100 million in
trading gains, and 12 days with gains of nil to $25 million.
(For a Breakingviews on Goldman's trading results, see
[ID:nN09227715].)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley (MS.N) reported 11 days of trading losses in
the quarter. Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) reported only one day
with trading losses above $100 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's second-quarter results come as the bank is
working to comply with financial reform legislation that
restricts so-called proprietary trading -- making market bets
backed by its own capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The restrictions of the so-called Volcker Rule also curb
banks' investments in private equity and hedge funds at 3
percent of a bank's total capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman is weighing a number of options for its proprietary
trading unit, including merging the employees into its asset
management business or spinning off the division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares closed up on Monday 0.14 percent, at $155.40 on the
New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;A Gartner report about users looking at migrating from Lotus Notes and Domino didn't sit well with IBM's Ed Brill, who spoke his mind in a Friday blog post. But his spin on the contents of the report is too one-sided, according to Gartner's Tom Austin, who shot back over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Gartner published a report called "Migrating off Notes/Domino e-mail may make sense in some circumstances," saying that more Lotus customers come to Gartner for advice about moving to other e-mail systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report is much ado about nothing, according to Brill, director of product marketing at IBM Lotus. A headline that better describes the content of the report would be: "Migrating off Notes/Domino doesn't make sense in most circumstances," according to Brill's blog post. However, that name probably wouldn't sell as much consulting time, Brill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To back up the assumption that migrating off Notes and Domino doesn't make sense, Brill highlights a number of quotes from the report, including that "IBM customers migrating to Microsoft will likely be disappointed" and that "IBM remains a strong and viable e-mail provider." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk of an increasing number of users migrating off Notes and Domino is more apt to be gossip at cocktail parties than "hard evidence of anything other than due diligence in the market," according to Brill. In fact, sales of new licences grew during the second quarter, Brill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That sounds like good news, but Brill's summary of the report doesn't tell the whole story, said Austin, vice president and fellow at Gartner and also the author of the report, in a blog post on Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, from July 1 in 2009 to April 30, 116 different clients booked one or more calls with Gartner analysts seeking advice on migrating away from Notes for e-mail, and no Microsoft customers called Gartner for advice on whether to migrate to Notes and Domino for e-mail, Austin added in a second blog post on Sunday. That disparity is a significant factor, Austin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Austin stressed that Gartner's research is based on substantive data and very serious discussions with professionals with serious issues and concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Send news tips and comments to mikael_ricknas@idg.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disaster recovery has become table stakes in the world of server virtualization. Any good virtualization platform these days will find a way to restart a virtual machine in the event of a hardware failure. But which vendor excels more than any other at getting critical applications back online after failures, and making sure the most important virtual machines are given priority in the restart process?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMware vs. Microsoft vs. Citrix&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debate has broken out over this topic since the Burton Group research and analysis firm declared that Microsoft's Hyper-V is not enterprise-ready because it lacks a specific feature found in both the VMware and Citrix hypervisors. But Microsoft contends that Hyper-V does meet the core features customers are looking for, and even the Burton Group concedes that Microsoft has surpassed its rivals in certain types of disaster-recovery scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feature in question is restart priority. According to the Burton Group, enterprise-class virtualization products must let IT administrators assign a restart priority to virtual machines, ensuring that the most critical workloads restart before any others in the event of a physical server outage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft insists that its virtualization management tools allow this type of prioritization, if perhaps in a roundabout way, but the Burton Group has refused to give Hyper-V a final seal of approval, saying only VMware and Citrix allow this functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VM restart priority setting in VMware's High Availability software lets IT assign VMs a priority of low, medium or high, with the high priority VMs starting first. But this is not a perfect tool, as administrator cannot set a restart order within the "high priority" bucket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citrix's XenServer provides a greater level of control and is therefore the best platform for this type of disaster recovery scenario, according to Burton Group analyst Chris Wolf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The idea behind priority is to ensure that mission critical workloads come up first," he says of VMware's system. "Only those types of systems should be given high priority. Even if I had 10 VMs with high priority set, those 10 would all come up before any VMs set to medium or low priority. That's the point. Customers would like greater granularity with VMware's priority metric (XenServer's is better) and we've called that out in our vSphere assessment. Still VMware's behavior meets the minimum expectation of our criteria, while the XenServer implementation is the most ideal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMware counters that its Site Recovery Manager software does provide "strict ordering of VM restart," while conceding that its High Availability software does not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, Wolf says his team at the Burton Group has discussed the restart priority issue with Microsoft, and that Microsoft officials "understand the use case and they understand why it's important."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft tells a somewhat different story. "I've gone back and forth with Burton Group about this specific feature," says Edwin Yuen, a virtualization director at Microsoft. "Certainly we have alternatives, or ways around it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyper-V lets IT delay the restart of certain virtual machines by a set time, 15 seconds, 30 seconds, or whatever amount of time is chosen. Delaying the restart of lower-priority virtual machines effectively allows the highest-priority ones to start up first, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers can go even further in Microsoft's System Center Virtual Machine Manager, which lets IT write scripts defining which VMs restart first in the case of failure. Customers can also set rules preventing restart of certain virtual machines while back-end services are restarted. For example, if a Web application running in one virtual machine requires a SQL database that runs in another VM, Microsoft admins can require that the database start up before the application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Microsoft's virtualization management tools can evaluate whether applications running inside virtual machines are healthy, instead of simply looking at whether the virtual machine itself is online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolf agrees that "Where Microsoft has a decided advantage is application-aware high availability. That's something we highlight as a real strength in the Microsoft solution that neither Citrix nor VMware can offer." VMware treats the virtual machine as a black box, so if an application inside a VM stalls, the company's high availability product won't detect the problem unless there is a complete failure of the operating system, according to Wolf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Yuen puts it, Microsoft "can look at the VMs, the operating systems and the services. We literally can tell 'is the SQL database up and running? Has the mailbox service started?' We can do a level of detection that VMware can't do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, combined with the other features Yuen described, should meet the requirements of customers as much, if not more than the specific restart priority feature that the Burton Group considers to be crucial, Yuen says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't believe that the feature requirement for restart priority fulfills what the customer wants to do anyway. That's my opinion," Yuen says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few Network World readers expressed dissatisfaction with both the Microsoft and VMware approaches in comments posted to a recent article titled "It's time to virtualize Microsoft Exchange (but not with Hyper-V)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Setting a 'high, medium, low' priority is just as weak and unmanageable as setting a startup delay. Neither gives any sort of guarantee that the service that you are relying on is actually available," one reader commented. "Both ways are fragile and prone to failure and need to improve."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolf notes that many customers have deployed Hyper-V despite the restart priority issue, and despite other areas in which VMware excels. For example, VMware allows VMs to run in lockstep on two physical hosts at the same time, providing a better level of fault tolerance. Citrix achieves this through a partnership with Marathon Technologies, while Microsoft doesn't have the feature yet but should in the near future, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large enterprises that have virtualized mission-critical apps and have high service-level expectations may feel this lockstep feature is important, but "to be honest that level of availability is not something that's that important to most enterprise organizations today," Wolf says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers may also be willing to accept a slightly lower level of availability in exchange for the better pricing offered by Hyper-V. Since Hyper-V is bound to improve over time, customers may also prefer to start their virtualization journey with Hyper-V than VMware to avoid the high exit cost of a future switch away from VMware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for the time being, Wolf says VMware is clearly in the lead in providing disaster recovery and high availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's definitely VMware because they have the richest integration with the storage vendors," Wolf says. "Their Site Recovery Manager product today is very mature. Their live migration is more powerful than the competition" allowing concurrent migration of up to eight virtual machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's market share has been growing more rapidly than VMware's, but the two most widely deployed hypervisors are VMware ESX and VMware Server, with Hyper-V in third place, according to IDC.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft argues that the higher cost for VMware does not justify the extra features offered by the company, but Wolf says "It's going to take a long time for VMware to be unseated as the dominant player, in my opinion. But Microsoft has done this before. &#8230; VMware is going to have to be very good in terms of execution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow Jon Brodkin on Twitter: www.twitter.com/jbrodkin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more about data center in Network World's Data Center section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/226c9f/motion_picture_pro) has
announced the addition of the "Motion Picture Production and Distribution"
report to their offering. 

The US motion picture production and distribution industry includes about 11,000
companies with combined annual revenue of about $55 billion. Major companies
include Disney, FOX, MGM, Paramount, Sony Pictures, Universal, and Warner Bros.
The industry is highly concentrated: the 50 largest companies account for about
80 percent of revenue. 

The top motion picture studios are generally part of larger media companies.
Most companies in the industry engage in both production and distribution of
motion pictures; about 500 companies are solely distributors. 

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE 

Consumer spending drives demand. The profitability of individual companies
depends on creativity, marketing, and distribution. Large companies often have
the advantages of long-term contracts with key actors and directors, a permanent
staff of technical employees, and wide distribution networks. Small companies
can compete successfully by creating marketable movies, often for niche
audiences, on low budgets. The industry is capital-intensive: average annual
revenue per employee is about $310,000. 

PRODUCTS, OPERATIONS &amp; TECHNOLOGY 

Licensing of rights for exhibit, broadcast, and renting of motion pictures
accounts for about half of industry revenue; other products include commercials,
music videos, special features, and post-production and technical services. Some
companies sell merchandise or earn fees from licensing brand names to
third-party manufacturers. Distribution of previously released products is
through theatres; wholesalers and retailers; network, local, cable, and
satellite TV; the Internet; and other distributors.

&lt;p&gt;TORONTO (Reuters) - A woman in the Toronto area has admitted to faking cancer, running a bogus charity and collecting thousands of dollars from people who thought she was dying, a Toronto newspaper reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashley Anne Kirilow, 23, shaved her head and eyebrows, plucked her eyelashes, and starved herself to look like she was going through chemotherapy treatments, the report in the Toronto Star said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She befriended different local groups and recruited volunteers to help her organize events and benefit concerts in her own honor, and even convinced a cancer awareness organization -- Skate4Cancer -- to fly her to Disney World to fulfill what she said was a dying wish. All told, she raised C$20,000 ($19,400), volunteers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her charity 'Change' for Cure, was never registered with tax authorities. On its Facebook page, which has over 4,000 members, she said it was "started October 2009 one very late night while I was sick in bed after my 'Chemo Day.'" (here)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Star said Kirilow contacted the paper, saying she was sorry for what she had done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was trying to be noticed. I was trying to get my family back together. I didn't want to feel like I'm nothing anymore. It went wrong, it spread like crazy, and then it seemed like the whole world knew," the paper quoted her as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by John McCrank; Editing by Frank McGurty)&lt;/p&gt;

adding that his remit was to advise on potential deals across
the life insurance and asset management sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Financial News earlier reported that Winters, who quit as
co-chief executive of JP Morgan's investment banking unit in a
management reshuffle last September, had been tasked
specifically with identifying potential asset management

($4.39 billion), having bought life insurer Friends Provident
last year for 1.8 billion pounds. [ID:nLDE65D06T]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company aims to acquire and merge at least three life
insurers or asset managers before floating or selling the

&lt;p&gt;  LA HABRA, CALIFORNIA, Aug 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
New usability features make ProjectManager.com, an online competitor to
Microsoft project software, a solid challenger in the project management
software world.

    Project Manager Online Ltd, the makers of the web-based project
management tool ProjectManager.com, have MS project software in their
sites as they introduce new usability features in the latest release of
their product. Entry of detailed task information including resources,
estimated and actual effort, task interdependencies, and percent complete
has become even easier with a new entry interface designed to speed up
the process for project managers.

    "Our product was already easily one of the most user-friendly project
tracking tools available to project professionals today," states Jason
Westland, CEO and president of Project Manager Online Ltd. "With this
latest release we've tweaked the task information entry interface
somewhat and project managers and team members will find it even easier
to keep their project information up to date."

    An out of date project schedule is of no use to anyone. That's why
Project Manager Online Ltd. strives to make their product as user
friendly as possible. The more user friendly it is, the more it will get
used. The easier the data entry is, the more project team members will
use it in a timely manner to enter the latest status information on the
tasks they're working on. And all of that adds up to a project schedule
that is up to date, accurate, and ready to go to the customer and
executive management at any time.

    Project Manager Online employs 30 people in three countries and has seen
their product adoption grow by 20% over the past year. Now boasting over
20,000 users in more than 200 countries worldwide, ProjectManager.com has
truly become a global project management software solution.

    "We know that project managers have the target on their head for every
single project that they are leading," says Westland. "It's never easy
being in the project manager's position, and controlling project tasks
and managing diverse resources is a never-ending job. We've designed
ProjectManager.com to make their jobs as easy as possible. We strive to
automate whatever we can for the project manager and project team
members. By making the task entry and update processes smoother than
ever, we believe we're giving project managers the best chance possible
to have full usage compliance from their team members and to have the
most up to date schedule possible."

    Project managers and team members can take advantage of Project Manager
Online Ltd's offer of a thirty day free trial of their web-based
software. The entire team can sign up and use it on a current project to
fully test all of its features. If you're not completely convinced that
it's the best tool for the money, then you're out nothing.
ProjectManager.com costs a fraction of what a Microsoft Project license
costs - but with all of the most commonly used features already included.

&lt;p&gt;Update extends the WatchDox Windows plug-in to support Microsoft Office 2010
users who collaborate but also want to control and track sensitive documents
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Confidela, developer of WatchDox, a document control, tracking and protection
solution, today announced an update to its WatchDox Windows plug-in to support
Microsoft Office 2010. WatchDox adds a much-needed layer of defense over
Microsoft Office documents, allowing content owners to share documents securely
and seamlessly, and enabling recipients to view and edit these documents
natively within Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint. WatchDox also equips users
of Microsoft Office 2010 with the ability to track documents at all times -
inside or outside the organization - and dynamically modify who can view, edit,
copy, print or forward them. 

The Microsoft Office 2010 package includes many new collaboration and sharing
capabilities, such as online sharing via Windows Live SkyDrive and more. While
these features further support users` desires to work together with internal and
external stakeholders, they also introduce additional levels of risk. WatchDox
offers the simplest way to mitigate these risks. 

With the WatchDox plug-in for Microsoft Office 2010, users can:

* Send protected attachments directly from Microsoft Outlook 2010 and
automatically set configurable security policies. 
* Download and view Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents offline,
within their native applications, while maintaining the document owner`s
original restrictions. 
* Edit and collaborate on documents among authorized users. 
* Dynamically change permissions of documents or revoke access to them
altogether - even after they have been downloaded. 
* Ensure that the shared Microsoft Office documents are synchronized and
up-to-date.

"The market has responded enthusiastically to our document security offerings,
and we have dedicated ourselves to quickly rolling out solutions that seamlessly
integrate with the latest versions of popular software programs," said Adi
Ruppin, vice president of marketing and business development at Confidela. "Our
support for Microsoft Office 2010 soon after its release indicates our
commitment to dynamic and secure document sharing for businesses eager to
protect their documents and intellectual property." 

The new WatchDox plug-in is available immediately for WatchDox Business,
Publisher and Virtual Data Room customers with plug-in enabled subscription
plans.

&lt;p&gt;CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - U.S. and British regulators are investigating the timing of Goldman Sachs Group Inc's disclosure to them that the bank was the subject of a federal civil fraud probe, Goldman said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-based Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the UK-based Financial Services Authority are continuing their own probes of the bank's marketing of 2007 collateralized debt obligations tied to subprime mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Goldman with civil fraud over the CDOs. The bank paid $550 million last month to settle the charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said on Monday that the FINRA and FSA investigations include the matter of when those regulators were notified of the SEC probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokesman was not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joe Rauch; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Reversal from first-quarter trading perfection&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman reported 3 days with losses above $100 mln&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Posted gains of more than $100 mln on 17 days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHARLOTTE, N.C., Aug 9 (Reuters) - Sluggish markets and the
May 6 flash crash pinched even trading highflier Goldman Sachs
Group Inc (GS.N) in the second quarter, according to the
company's quarterly report filed on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York-based investment bank reported 10 days of
trading losses for the period, with three days of more than
$100 million in trading losses, according to the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's trading gains and losses have mirrored those of
its Wall Street counterparts, whose surging first-quarter
trading results cooled in the spring and early summer, as the
SP 500 Index .SPX shrank 12 percent during second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the first quarter, Goldman hit trading perfection,
reporting zero days of losses, or no trading days below $25
million in revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the second quarter was still largely profitable for
Goldman's trading operations, the positive trading days
oscillated between booming returns and sluggish results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank reported 17 days with more than $100 million in
trading revenues, followed closely by 12 days with revenues
between $0 and $25 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other Wall Street banks' results have largely followed the
same trend, but their success has varied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley (MS.N) reported 11 days of trading losses in
the second quarter, one day worse than Goldman. Bank of America
Corp (BAC.N) only reported one day with trading losses above
$100 million, lower than Goldman's total.

&lt;p&gt;Bringing More Choice and Flexibility are Key Goals
HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
NBTA International Conference--Rearden Commerce today announced a new alliance
with IBM`s Managed Business Process division (IBM MBPS), with the goal to
introduce more choice to the expense management and online procurement category.


Rearden Commerce will work with IBM to deliver an integrated solution that
consolidates booked transaction data from the Rearden Commerce Platform, and
actual business expense data from IBM`s Global Expense Reporting Solution (IBM
GERS) system. By working with IBM, the Rearden Personal Assistant can give
administrators in accounts payable, finance, procurement, travel and other key
departments the ability to manage policies, spend and preferred providers.
Additionally, companies using these solutions can gain deep insight into
employee business expenses and spending patterns. 

"Rearden Commerce believes it is important to provide the market with choice,
and the ability to find best of breed solutions," said Tony D`Astolfo, vice
president of travel at Rearden Commerce. "We have had multiple instances where
our customers and prospects have asked for this partnership and we`re thrilled
that it has come to fruition." 

"One of IBM's biggest advantages is that it offers clients the ability to select
the best fitting solutions from the travel spectrum without forcing them into a
specific set of products. With this approach, clients can benefit from the
flexibility they need, along with all the advantages of an integrated solution,"
said Ray Curatolo, director of IBM Global Expense Reporting Solutions. "IBM and
Rearden Commerce will work together to provide the highest level of corporate
and end user convenience and functionality around booking travel and expense
management." 

More information about the companies' joint solution is available at the
National Business Travel Association's (NBTA) International Convention &amp;
Exposition.

regulators are investigating the timing of Goldman Sachs Group
Inc's (GS.N) disclosure to them that the bank was the subject
of a federal civil fraud probe, Goldman said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S.-based Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and
the UK-based Financial Services Authority are continuing their
own probes of the bank's marketing of 2007 collateralized debt
obligations tied to subprime mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Goldman
with civil fraud over the CDOs. The bank paid $550 million last
month to settle the charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said on Monday that the FINRA and FSA
investigations include the matter of when those regulators were
notified of the SEC probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman spokesman was not immediately available for
comment.

Supporting Quotes

    Steven Heller, director of technology, Graubard Miller: eDiscovery is
critical to our firm, as attorneys must be able to store and search email
records quickly during the legal hold stage at the beginning of the
litigation process. We continue to trust Proofpoint Enterprise Archive
for our archiving needs and are thrilled with its ability to generate
search results in near-real time. New legal hold features will empower
our team to track and identify key information faster and easier than
ever before.

    Andres Kohn, general manager, archiving for Proofpoint: With more and
more organizations involved in litigation, and being held to stricter
data preservation and increasingly strict compliance standards, we're
seeing greatly increased demand for solutions that make it easier to
preserve, collect, process and review email. Over the past 12 months,
we've seen a doubling in both the number of searches and number of
messages managed by Proofpoint Enterprise Archive. This trend is
accelerating as we continue to add many new enterprise customers, who
typically need to archive data for 10,000 or more inboxes.

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) has informed the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) that 25 percent to 35 percent of its revenue was derived from the derivatives businesses, the Wall Street Journal said, citing a person familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figures were part of a Goldman response to a request by the FCIC to disclose information about its derivatives holdings and operations, the Journal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCIC was set up by the U.S. government to examine the causes of the financial and economic crisis. The panel is also examining the role of derivatives in flaring up the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman was already scrutinized by the panel for its derivative deals with the bailed out insurer AIG (AIG.N) during the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A memo sent to the panel Thursday night by Goldman included an analysis of derivatives-based revenue from 2006 through 2009, a person told the Journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the percentages provided by Goldman, derivatives businesses generated $11.3 billion to $15.9 billion of the company's $45.17 billion in net revenue for 2009, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An FCIC spokesperson did not immediately confirm that the commission has received the information from Goldman or any other firm, according to the Journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have asked for the same information from several banks," the FCIC spokesman told the Journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have all indicated they are working hard to provide that information to us. If we need additional information, we will ask for it," the spokesman told the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commission is required to issue a report on the causes of the financial crisis by December 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FCIC and Goldman could not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sakthi Prasad in Bangalore; Editing by Hans Peters)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  PLEASANTON, CA, Aug 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Polycom, Inc. (NASDAQ: PLCM) has signed a multi-year, strategic global
agreement with Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) to deliver integrated
end-to-end unified communications (UC) and to improve customers' business
productivity. Under the agreement, Polycom plans to develop and market
standards-based UC solutions that span the enterprise, small-to-medium
business, and government markets, that will encompass software, hardware,
networking and services, and will enable customers to improve business
productivity and reduce travel, telecom and IT operating costs. 

    Polycom and Microsoft share a vision for business productivity solutions
built on standards-based platforms that work with the tools and
applications people know and use today. The companies' strategic
agreement is a major step towards streamlining communications across
messaging, video and voice with connected applications and devices. 

    "Microsoft and Polycom solutions play a critical role within our current
and future unified communications strategy," said Martin Smale, IT
director at NDS, a News Corp. company. "We're already benefiting from
improved collaboration, increased productivity, and significant ROI based
on our existing UC network, and we're looking forward to leveraging the
expanded offerings from two of our most valued vendors in the UC space." 

    "Our research shows that nearly 70 percent of the companies considering a
unified communications solution are thinking of deploying Microsoft
Office Communications Server," said Brent Kelly, senior analyst and
partner at Wainhouse Research. "These enterprises need seamless
integration and interoperability between Office Communicator on the
desktop and personal, group, and telepresence video solutions like those
offered by Polycom for executive offices, meeting suites, and conference
rooms. By working together, Microsoft and Polycom are making it easier
for organizations to have a true end-to-end unified communications
environment, which includes high definition video."

    Offering a broad portfolio of integrated solutions spanning voice, video
and application integration for Microsoft UC, this agreement makes
Polycom a member of Microsoft's key strategic global alliance for the
company's UC business. As part of this long-term strategic agreement,
each company is investing in product development, sales, and marketing.
Through resources, investments, and strong field engagement, Polycom and
Microsoft will deliver rich, compelling UC solutions, offering customers
the flexibility to deploy the features that help them lower their costs,
improve productivity and meet their unique business needs. 

    "Microsoft and Polycom are committed to a roadmap that will deliver
interoperable UC solutions with choice and innovation in video
conferencing and customer devices that will help transform enterprise
communications," said Gurdeep Singh Pall, corporate vice president of
Unified Communication at Microsoft. "By integrating video, voice, instant
messaging and conferencing solutions, Microsoft and Polycom give
customers the ability to be present, anytime, anywhere." 

    "Polycom and Microsoft deliver a winning combination to our customers
around the globe by delivering seamless, easy-to-use, high-definition
communications at the click of a mouse," said Andrew Miller, Polycom
president and CEO. "Polycom is 100 percent committed to delivering
best-in-breed, standards-based, fully interoperable UC solutions to
market, and Microsoft is integral in helping us achieve this goal and
meet the needs of our customers." 

    Product Development
 The roadmap entails Polycom developing a broad base
of solutions for Microsoft Communications Server "14" and beyond,
including:


--  New and next-generation Polycom CX series endpoints optimized for
    Microsoft UC, featuring Polycom's market-leading HD video and voice 
    technologies
--  New, innovative room-based video systems designed specifically for
    enabling direct integration with Microsoft Communications Server "14"
--  Additional interoperable solutions between Polycom's existing and
    future video conferencing solutions

    

Global Polycom / Microsoft UC Go-to-Market Initiatives


--  Sales resources and training

--  Polycom participation in multiple Microsoft Technology Centers around
    the globe, with active demos already available in Atlanta, Chicago,

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today issued a record 14 security updates to patch a record-tying 34 vulnerabilities in Windows, Internet Explorer (IE), Office and Silverlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Don't get mired in the details," recommended Andrew Storms, director of security operations for nCircle Security, as he acknowledged that the sheer number of updates and patches could easily overwhelm users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are so many patches here that you could go in all kinds of different directions," agreed Jason Miller, data and security team manager for patch-management vendor Shavlik Technologies. "It could come down to what people think are the biggest attack vectors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one was questioning the size of today's Patch Tuesday. The August update was the biggest ever by number of security bulletins, and equaled the single-month record for individual patches, which was first set last October and repeated in June 2010. This month's collection also tied the October 2009 record for the most critical bulletins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 34 fixes flaws, Microsoft rated 14 as "critical," the highest threat ranking in the firm's four-step scoring system. Seventeen were pegged as "important," and three were labeled as "moderate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Microsoft throwing nearly three-dozen patches at customers, it's not a surprise that researchers disagreed on which updates people should apply first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'd have to put MS10-056 at the top," said Storms, referring to a three-patch update for Office that included a pair of critical vulnerabilities in Office 2007. "All one needs to do is have the preview pane open [in Outlook 2007] and just look at a malformed RTF file," Storms added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike most exploits delivered via e-mail, these wouldn't require the recipient to open an attachment, a practice people know is risky. But as Storms pointed out, most users preview e-mail messages without a second thought. "I'd put this in the same category as a drive-by," Storms said. "I can imagine someone sticking an RTF file in a spam engine and just going crazy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While other researchers agreed with Storms that MS10-056 was dangerous, they nominated different updates -- or combinations of updates -- for their top pick of the month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm concerned about the two media-related updates, MS10-052 and MS10-055 ," said Miller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those updates, both judged critical, address a pair of bugs in two codecs - software that compresses and decompresses video data -- included with Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Miller, video vulnerabilities are a juicy target for criminals. "They want to find the biggest market [for their attacks], and media, and social media are so huge today," he said. "Everybody is watching stuff, they're not reading stuff."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller said he expected attackers to leverage the codec flaws in the coming month, a bet Microsoft also made: Its Exploitability Index rated both vulnerabilities as a "1," meaning it anticipates active exploits in the next 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolfgang Kandek, CTO at Qualys, seconded Miller, but lumped in other bulletins, including the six-patch IE update, MS10-053 , with the codec updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With so many [updates] today, prioritization is important," said Kandek. "And since most attacks today happen through the browser, we've put several updates into a group that should be applied first."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kandek added three more updates to that patch-first group because they could also be exploited through IE or another browser: MS10-049 , MS10-051 and MS10-060 .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third of that bunch patches a pair of critical vulnerabilities in Silverlight, Microsoft's rival to Adobe's Flash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Silverlight is almost as popular as Adobe Reader on end-user systems," said Kandek, citing data Qualys has compiled from its new " BrowserCheck " plug-in checking service. Kandek said that Silverlight is installed on approximately 60% of all PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first major security update for Silverlight," said Miller, who backed up Kandek. "It's pretty easy to install, and lots of users may not even remember that it's on their machines. Plus, just visiting a site means you're exploited."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Josh Abraham, a security researcher with Rapid7, took a different tack. For his money, the biggest threat was the three-patch MS10-054 update, which fixed one critical and two important bugs in SMB (server message block), the Microsoft-made network file and print-sharing protocol that worms have leveraged in the past to infect PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's going to be non-trivial to 'worm' this," admitted Abraham, whose company also manages the Metasploit open-source hacker toolkit. "But if you can come up with a reliable exploit, one that lets you leverage the vulnerability without authentication, it will be worth it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abraham pointed out that the most vulnerable targets -- Windows XP SP3 and Windows XP x64 SP2 -- are widely deployed in both enterprises and among consumers, even though they're nearly nine years old. It's also likely that Windows XP SP2, which was retired from support last month and no longer receives patches, is also vulnerable, Abraham said. "So you're also looking at things that are not being patched at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapid7 and Metasploit will put resources into developing a reliable exploit for the SMB bugs, he added. "It's definitely a high request already," Abraham said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller agreed that the SMB vulnerabilities are potentially dangerous, but looked on the bright side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You hear the three letters 'S-M-B' and the first thing you think of is 'worm,'" said Miller. "This could be bad, but right now, it looks like the most likely result is a denial-of-service. That doesn't mean that researchers won't dig deeper to see if they can create a reliable exploit. But the patch is available now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it takes a week, even two for researchers like Abraham to devise a 'wormable' exploit, that gives everyone that much time to patch, Miller continued. "With this one, it's on a clock that starts right now," he said. "And you don't want to lose this race."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month's security update can be downloaded and installed via the Microsoft Update and Windows Update services, as well as through Windows Server Update Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Hit movies like "Toy Story 3" and higher advertising sales lifted Walt Disney's quarterly profit above Wall Street's expectations, despite dwindling theme park attendance in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other box office smashes such as "Iron Man 2" and "Alice in Wonderland" helped studio revenue rise 30 percent and generated a strong operating profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue at its media networks arm, home to sports cable network ESPN and broadcaster ABC, rose 19 percent to $4.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studio entertainment division chalked up a $123 million operating profit after posting a loss a year ago. But in the theme parks arm -- which operates Disneyland resorts around the world -- operating income slid 8 percent to $477 million as attendance and hotel occupancy dropped.

3" and higher advertising sales lifted Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N)
quarterly profit above Wall Street's expectations, despite
dwindling theme park attendance in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors had expected solid numbers from the entertainment
and leisure conglomerate after strong results from media rivals
Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) and CBS Corp (CBS.N) underscored an
advertising rebound. Disney executives said on Tuesday spot
pricing was running about 20 percent above "upfront" -- or
advance -- advertising prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Disney closed out the big media earnings posting strong ad
revenue growth at the ABC and ESPN and gave an optimistic
picture for scatter pricing. Their comments look like others
we've seen to date," said Tony Wible, an analyst with Janney
Capital Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Box office smashes such as the latest Toy Story movie,
"Iron Man 2" and "Alice in Wonderland" helped studio revenue
rise 30 percent and generated a strong operating profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue at its media networks arm, home to sports cable
network ESPN and broadcaster ABC, rose 19 percent to $4.7
billion. But the results included $344 million in previously
deferred revenue because of annual programming commitments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The cable division is the business that drives this
business and Disney had an impressive quarter," said RBC
Capital analyst David Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Operating income in media networks rose 43 percent to $1.9
billion, outpacing analysts' forecasts for about $1.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The studio entertainment division chalked up a $123 million
operating profit after posting a loss a year ago. (Graphic:
link.reuters.com/fav34n)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But at the theme parks arm -- operator of Disneyland
resorts around the world -- operating income slid 8 percent to
$477 million as attendance and hotel occupancy dropped. Disney
ended widespread ticket discounts in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This quarter, domestic hotel reservations were running
about 9 percent below the prior-year quarter's pace, executives
told analysts on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they also noted that after accounting for a calendar
shift of one extra week a year ago, fourth quarter bookings so
far this year are running just one percent behind last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's net income rose to $1.3 billion, or 67 cents per
share, in the third quarter ended July 3, from $954 million, or
51 cents a share, a year earlier. That beat the average analyst
forecast for 58 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Total revenue rose 16 percent to $10 billion, surpassing
Wall Street's target of just under $9.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney shares rose 1.4 percent to $35.80 after closing at
$35.29. The stock has risen nearly 5 percent since the start of
August as expectations of an advertising recovery solidified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, Time Warner raised its full-year outlook after
quarterly revenue grew at the fastest pace in two years, thanks
to better advertising sales at cable networks and strong
turnouts for movies such as "Clash of the Titans".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That forecast came a day after CBS Corp's (CBS.N) strong
quarterly report, allaying near-term fears that economic
weakness could derail an ad recovery. [ID:nN04225068]

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

GE in Utility Privatization Project

GE Intelligent Platforms, a part of General Electric (NYSE: GE), will be working
on the Alaska Utility Privatization Project being developed by Doyon Utilities
LLC. The project will use GE`s Proficy Process Systems, providing productive and
flexible power generation solution. 

Doyon has received this utility privatization contract for the United States
Army Forts Wainwright, Richardson and Greely in Fairbanks, Anchorage and Delta
Junction, Alaska. The period of contract is 50 years, during which Doyon will
have ownership of the electric, natural gas, steam and potable water
distribution systems, as well as the wastewater collection system. Doyon will be
responsible for the operation and maintenance of these systems and aims to
improve the quality and efficiency of the systems over time. 

General Electric`s Proficy Systems provides a solution to Doyon`s goal of
providing a quick upgrade to the existing aging infrastructure at a low
implementation cost. The Proficy Process Systems and Proficy Historians,
together with GE`s Proficy Troubleshooter software, provide an accurate and
stable control of optimized boiler. These systems also regulate power generation
and provide scope for future expansion. With the help of these systems, Doyon
will be able to calculate the use of electricity, water, wastewater and steam,
which will help it to derive further benefits through conservation. 

Proficy is a product of the company`s $4 billion annual revenue generating
software and solutions services businesses, engaged in providing productivity
improving solution to customers. Headquartered in Charlottesville, VA., GE
Intelligent Platforms is a global provider of software, hardware, services, and
has expertise in automation and embedded computing. 

General Electric has one of the best infrastructure franchises worldwide with
solid organic growth rates, exposure to favorable secular trends and a large
installed base supporting a growing annuity-like service business.
Infrastructure businesses of the company are helping to build energy, health,
transportation and technology infrastructure of the new century. These
businesses provide products and services that facilitate the developing regions
to participate in the global economy, while also assisting developed regions to
upgrade with cleaner, more efficient and better infrastructure technologies. 

However, the company`s global expansion is subject to economic and political
risks pertaining to various operating geographies. 

Operating in more than 100 countries globally and employing about 300,000 people
worldwide, General Electric Co. is a diversified infrastructure, finance and
media company. Within the energy sector, the company aims to develop and install
technology for the efficient use of natural resources. The major competitors of
General Electric are Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE: HON), Siemens AG (NYSE:
SI) and United Technologies Corp. (NYSE: UTX ). 

We currently maintain our Neutral rating on General Electric, with a Zacks #3
Rank over the next one-to-three months. 

Scripps Network Beats

Scripps Networks Interactive Inc. (SNI) today reported strong second quarter
2010 financial results. Quarterly GAAP net income was $106.2 million or 63 cents
per share compared to a net income of $79.5 million or 48 cents per share in the
prior-year quarter. However, excluding one-time special items, Scripps Networks`
second quarter 2010 EPS was 59 cents, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58
cents. 

Quarterly consolidated revenue of $516 million was an improvement of 31.9%
year-over-year and also better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $507
million. Interestingly, even excluding the contribution from newly acquired
Travel Channel, organic revenue increased 16% year over year. 

The strong performance were mainly attributable to double-digit growth in
advertising and affiliate-fee revenue at the company`s flagship Lifestyle Media
business and higher total segment profit. 

Quarterly operating income was $193.6 million, up 32% year-over-year. In the
reported quarter, total segment profit (excluding special items) was $227.9
million, up a whopping 37.2% year over year. 

During the first half of 2010, Scripps Networks generated $217.3 million of cash
from operations compared to $245.4 million in the prior-year period. Free cash
flow (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) in the same period
was $183.4 million compared to $205 million in the year-ago period. 

At the end of the second quarter 2010, Scripps Networks had $331 million of cash
and cash equivalents and $884.32 million of debt outstanding on its balance
sheet compared to $254.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and $884.2 million
of outstanding debt at the end of fiscal 2009. At the end of the second quarter
2010, debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.35 compared to 0.37 at the end of
fiscal 2009.

BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) today reported earnings for its third fiscal
quarter and nine months ended July 3, 2010. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) for
the third quarter increased 31% to $0.67 from $0.51 in the prior-year quarter.
For the nine month period, EPS increased 24% to $1.60 from $1.29 in the
prior-year period. The quarter and nine month results were driven by growth at
Media Networks and Studio Entertainment. Media Networks benefitted from earlier
recognition of previously deferred revenue at ESPN. 

"We`re very pleased with our strong third quarter, in which we grew revenues
substantially and improved profitability across the majority of our businesses,"
said President and Chief Executive Officer Robert A. Iger. "Our performance
underscores the value of sticking to a smart strategy even in tough times, of
investing in the right people, and of focusing relentlessly on quality and
innovation to drive growth in shareholder value." 

The following table summarizes the third quarter and nine-month results for

Cable Networks

Operating income at Cable Networks increased $561 million to $1.7 billion for
the quarter due to an increase at ESPN and to a lesser extent, at the worldwide
Disney Channel. The increase at ESPN was primarily due to earlier recognition of
previously deferred revenues related to annual programming commitments. During
the quarter, ESPN recognized a net $344 million of previously deferred revenue
compared to a net deferral of $37 million in the prior-year quarter. In addition
to the timing of deferred revenue recognition, ESPN growth reflected higher
affiliate and advertising revenue, partially offset by higher programming and
production costs. Higher affiliate revenue was due to contractual rate
increases, and subscriber growth, which was driven by the launch of a new
network in the United Kingdom. The increase in advertising revenue was driven by
higher sold inventory and increased rates. Higher programming and production
costs reflected coverage of the World Cup and ESPN`s new network in the United
Kingdom. Improved operating results at the worldwide Disney Channel reflected
higher affiliate revenues, driven by contractual rate increases and subscriber
growth, and increased advertising revenue at the international channels. 

Broadcasting

Operating income at Broadcasting increased $5 million to $209 million for the
quarter primarily due to higher advertising revenues at the owned television
stations and higher revenues from ABC Studios productions driven by
international sales of Castle, Lost and Ghost Whisperer and increased third
party network license fees for Criminal Minds. These increases were largely
offset by higher programming costs at the ABC Television Network driven by
programming write offs, unfavorable foreign currency impacts at our television
distribution business, and higher pension and post-retirement medical expense.
Advertising revenues at the ABC Television Network were comparable to the
prior-year quarter as a decrease in sold inventory and lower ratings were
largely offset by higher rates. 

Parks and Resorts

Parks and Resorts revenues for the quarter increased 3% to $2.8 billion and
segment operating income decreased 8% to $477 million. Results for the quarter
were driven by decreases at our domestic parks and Disney Cruise Line, partially
offset by improved results at our international operations. 

Decreased operating income at our domestic parks was due to higher costs and
lower attendance and hotel occupancy, partially offset by higher guest spending.
Increased costs reflected labor cost inflation, higher pension and
post-retirement medical expenses and costs for new guest offerings, including
World of Color at Disneyland Resort, partially offset by lower volume-related
costs. Decreased attendance in part reflected an unfavorable impact due to a
shift in the timing of the Easter holiday period relative to our fiscal periods.
Higher guest spending was primarily due to higher average ticket prices. 

Disney Cruise Line operating income decreased due to lower passenger cruise
days, increased operating costs to support the fleet expansion and higher fuel
costs. 

Improved results at our international operations reflected the sale of a real
estate property and increased guest spending, hotel occupancy and attendance at
Disneyland Paris. Improved results also reflected an increase at Hong Kong
Disneyland Resort driven by increased attendance, guest spending and hotel
occupancy. 

Studio Entertainment

Studio Entertainment revenues for the quarter increased 30% to $1.6 billion and
segment operating income increased $135 million to $123 million. Higher
operating income was primarily due to the strong worldwide performance of our
key titles in theatrical markets and improvements in domestic home entertainment
and worldwide television distribution. 

Worldwide theatrical results reflected the strong performance of Toy Story 3,
Alice in Wonderland, and Iron Man 2 in the current quarter, partially offset by
higher film cost write-downs. The prior-year quarter included Up, Hannah
Montana: The Movie and The Proposal. 

The increase at domestic home entertainment was primarily due to a lower
production cost amortization rate and lower distribution and marketing expenses
resulting from cost reduction initiatives. Key releases included Alice in
Wonderland in the current quarter versus Bedtime Stories, Bolt and Confessions
Of a Shopaholic in the prior-year quarter. 

The improvement at worldwide television distribution was driven by the timing of
titles available in international markets. 

Consumer Products

Consumer Products revenues for the quarter increased 19% to $606 million and
segment operating income increased 22% to $117 million. 

The increase in segment operating income was primarily due to an improvement at
our retail business, driven by lower costs at The Disney Store North America,
and an increase at Publishing driven by Marvel titles. Lower costs at The Disney
Store North America were driven by lower cost of sales reflecting global
procurement efficiencies. 

At Merchandise Licensing, higher licensing revenue driven by the strength of Toy
Story and sales of Marvel merchandise was offset by a higher revenue share with
the Studio Entertainment segment and operating costs and intangible asset
amortization associated with Marvel. The increased revenue share with the Studio
Entertainment segment was primarily due to growth from Toy Story merchandise. 

Interactive Media

Interactive Media revenues for the quarter increased 74% to $197 million and
operating results improved from a loss of $75 million in the prior-year quarter
to a loss of $65 million in the current quarter. 

Improved operating results were primarily due to higher self-published video
game sales at Disney Interactive Studios, reflecting the performance of current
quarter releases, partially offset by higher marketing costs. The current
quarter included the release of Toy Story 3 and Split Second, whereas the
prior-year quarter included the release of Hannah Montana.

OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Restructuring and Impairment Charges

The Company recorded $36 million of restructuring and impairment charges in the

The decrease in interest expense for the quarter was driven by lower average
debt balances. The decrease in interest and investment income was primarily due
to a gain on the sale of an investment in the prior-year quarter. 

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rate for the current quarter was 35.6% compared to
37.8% in the prior-year quarter. The decrease was driven by favorable
adjustments related to certain prior-year income tax matters. 

Noncontrolling Interests

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the quarter increased
$97 million to $174 million driven by higher operating results at ESPN. The net
income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined based on income
after royalties, financing costs and income taxes.

(1) Free cash flow is not a financial measure defined by GAAP. See the
discussion of non-GAAP financial measures that follows below. 

The increase in cash provided by operations for the nine months was driven by
higher segment operating results. 

The increase in capital expenditures for the nine months reflected higher
construction progress payments on two new cruise ships, the expansion at
Disney`s California Adventure and Hong Kong Disneyland, and the construction of
a Disney Vacation Club Resort in Hawaii, partially offset by the construction of
broadcast and film production facilities in the prior-year nine month period.

The total borrowings shown above include $2,443 million and $2,868 million
attributable to Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort as of July 3,
2010 and October 3, 2009, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents attributable
to Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort totaled $526 million and

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This earnings release presents earnings per share excluding the impact of
certain items, net borrowings, free cash flow, and aggregate segment operating
income, all of which are important financial measures for the Company but are
not financial measures defined by GAAP. 

These measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP
financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of earnings per
share, borrowings, cash flow or net income as determined in accordance with
GAAP. Net borrowings, free cash flow, and aggregate segment operating income as
we have calculated them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
reported by other companies. 

Earnings per share excluding certain items - The Company uses earnings per share
excluding certain items to evaluate the performance of the Company`s operations
exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period
to period. The Company believes that information about earnings per share
exclusive of these impacts is useful to investors, particularly where the impact
of the excluded items is significant in relation to reported earnings, because
the measure allows for comparability between periods of the operating
performance of the Company`s business and allows investors to evaluate the
impact of these items separately from the impact of the operations of the
business. The following table reconciles reported earnings per share to earnings
per share excluding certain items:

(1) Other income for the current quarter included a gain on the sale of the
Power Rangers property. Other income for the current nine months consists of
gains on the sales of our investments in television services in Europe in the
first and second quarters, an accounting gain related to the acquisition of the
Disney Stores in Japan in the second quarter, and a gain on the sale of the
Power Rangers property in the third quarter. Other income for the prior-year
nine months consists of a gain on the sale of an investment in two pay
television services in Latin America. 

Net borrowings - The Company believes that information about net borrowings
provides investors with a useful perspective on our financial condition. Net
borrowings reflect the subtraction of cash and cash equivalents from total
borrowings. Since we earn interest income on our cash balances that offsets a
portion of the interest expense we pay on our borrowings, net borrowings can be
used as a measure to gauge net interest expense. In addition, a portion of our
cash and cash equivalents is available to repay outstanding indebtedness when
the indebtedness matures or when other circumstances arise. However, we may not
immediately apply cash and cash equivalents to the reduction of debt, nor do we
expect that we would use all of our available cash and cash equivalents to repay
debt in the ordinary course of business. 

Free cash flow - The Company uses free cash flow (cash provided by operations
less investments in parks, resorts and other property), among other measures, to
evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for
purposes other than capital expenditures. Management believes that information
about free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the
cash available to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments and
pay dividends or repurchase shares. 

Aggregate segment operating income - The Company evaluates the performance of
its operating segments based on segment operating income, and management uses
aggregate segment operating income as a measure of the performance of operating
businesses separate from non-operating factors. The Company believes that
information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors by
allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company`s
portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net
income, thus providing separate insight into both operations and the other
factors that affect reported results. 

A reconciliation of segment operating income to net income is as follows (in
millions):

&lt;p&gt;  HOUSTON, TEXAS, Aug 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
NBTA International Convention &amp; Exposition - BMO Spend &amp; Payment
Solutions, a division of BMO Financial Group, today announced an alliance
with IBM's Managed Business Process unit to help joint clients control
business travel and expense management costs, drive process and policy
transformation, and improve compliance with corporate spend policies. 

    The partnership benefits organizations and their employees: Rich expense
data from BMO and Diners Club corporate cards - both of which run on the
MasterCard network - feeds automatically into IBM's Global Expense
Reporting Solution (IBM GERS), reducing employee's time and effort to
submit expense reports, and giving corporate travel managers improved
visibility and control into travel and entertainment (T) spend. 

    Additionally, organizations that utilize BMO or Diners Club corporate
cards automatically qualify for preferred pricing on GERS. The preferred
pricing is an ongoing benefit, and will stay in place as long as
organizations continue to utilize BMO-issued corporate cards and the IBM
GERS solution.

    Bolstered by its acquisition of the Diners Club North American franchise
last year, BMO offers a comprehensive portfolio of corporate card
solutions with the global acceptance of the MasterCard network. The
partnership with IBM can give multinational organizations new flexibility
to integrate travel spend data with an expense management solution
deployed in more than 85 countries, in 35 languages and that supports
country-specific tax rules and reclamation requirements. 

    "Our approach has always been to listen to customers and tailor solutions
to meet their immediate and long-term needs. That means freedom to choose
from an array of best-in-class solutions," said Terry Wellesley,
Executive Managing Director &amp; Group Head of BMO Spend &amp; Payment
Solutions. "With our card programs married to IBM's expense management
solution; we are ideally positioned to provide global business travel
solutions."

    With IBM GERS, employees can easily track purchases made on their BMO or
Diners Club corporate card, and access specific and categorical
breakdowns of where the card was used and what was purchased. Employees
quickly discern personal or business charges, and approval managers get
maximum visibility into business travel spend - with airlines,
restaurants, taxis and even hotel folio detail - essential insight to
improve controls, shape policy and drive better terms with preferred
vendors.

    "This partnership gives organizations tightly integrated tools to control
T costs and encourage compliance with spend policies, empowering our
clients to drive even more costs out of their business," said Ray
Curatolo, director for Global Expense Report Solutions, IBM MBPS. "We're
extremely excited to align these two original world-class brands in
business travel as we strive to deliver the highest levels of success to
our clients."

    Developed and used internally by IBM for decades, GERS is based on
advanced automation and analytics to help businesses of every size
improve process efficiency. With web-based accessibility and integrated
receipt imaging and scanning, GERS simplifies the way employees report
travel and other reimbursable expenses.

    About BMO Spend &amp; Payment Solutions

    A division of BMO Financial Group, BMO Spend &amp; Payment Solutions is a
leading commercial card, spend and payment solutions provider in North
America. BMO Spend &amp; Payment Solutions' products are widely used by
corporations, non-profit and government-sector organizations to manage,

payments.

&lt;p&gt;IBM made the latest in its long run of acquisitions on Tuesday, announcing the purchase of document capture software vendor Datacap. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Datacap's technology allows customers to quickly extract information from unstructured formats, such as tax returns, invoices and claim forms, saving time and money over manual processes, according to a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While IBM already had similar capabilities via its FileNet acquisition, it intends to make Datacap's software "the foundation" of its document capture strategy, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, companies and government organizations are facing an ever-increasing amount of unstructured data as well as regulatory pressure to improve records management, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Datacap's roughly 200 customers include government clients like the Virginia Department of Taxation and health-care provider Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona. Customers' investments in Datacap products will be preserved, according to IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Datacap CEO Scott Blau has been named director of enterprise content management at Big Blue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM and Datacap are long-time partners. Datacap also partners with IBM rivals in the content management market, such as Oracle, Open Text and EMC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Kanaracus covers enterprise software and general technology breaking news for The IDG News Service.

&lt;p&gt;Scores 83 Percent on CCAGW`s Congressional Ratings
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
The Council for Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW) today honored Rep.
Walt Minnick (D-Idaho) as the lone Democratic Taxpayer Hero in Congress for
scoring 83 percent on its 2009 Congressional Ratings. The average for the entire
House was 31 percent, and the average for the Senate was 39 percent; this makes
the Rep. Minnick`s achievement that much more impressive. Since 1989, CCAGW has
tracked roll call votes to separate the taxpayer advocates in Congress from
those who favor wasteful programs and pork-barrel spending. 

The 2009 Congressional Ratings cover the voting year 2009, the first session of
the 111th Congress. CCAGW rated 120 key votes in the House and 74 in the Senate.


"Rep. Minnick is the first Democratic Taxpayer Hero since 2006 and deserves
special recognition for this achievement. His vote rating shows that is it not
impossible for Democrats to vote to cut wasteful spending, reduce the tax
burden, and making government more accountable to taxpayers, and it stands in
stark contrast to the average of 4 percent for his House colleagues," said CCAGW
President Tom Schatz. "Unlike members of Congress who talk about voting to cut
waste back home but then vote to raise taxes and spending in Washington, Rep.
Minnick has been consistent in both his rhetoric and his actions. If more of his
Democratic colleagues voted as he did last year, the budget deficit and national
debt would both be lower." 

CCAGW`s website, http://ccagwratings.org/, features the complete 2009
Congressional Ratings, including vote descriptions, scorecards for the House and
Senate, and averages by chamber, party, and state delegation. In the House,
there were a total of seven "Taxpayer Super Heroes," with a grade of 100
percent. In 2008, there was one House member with a perfect score. In 2009,
there were 89 "Taxpayer Heroes" with a grade of 80 percent or above, a 51
percent increase from the 59 in 2008. The big difference was in the number of
members with a perfectly abysmal score of zero. In 2008 there were only 34. In
2009, however, the number of members with a score of zero skyrocketed to 105,
which is 41 percent of the 256 House Democrats. 

From 2006 through 2008, there were no "Taxpayer Super Heroes" (scoring 100
percent) in the Senate, but fortunately there were two in 2009, Sens. John
Barrasso (R-Wyo.) and Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.). There were a total of 29 "Taxpayer
Heroes," 52 percent greater than the 14 in 2008. The two next highest scores
were achieved by Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) at 99
percent. There were no senators with a score of zero, compared to 17 in 2008. 

The Council for Citizens Against Government Waste is the lobbying arm of
Citizens Against Government Waste, the nation`s largest nonpartisan, nonprofit
organization dedicated to eliminating waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement in
government.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has launched a new Windows 7 campaign to take on Mac OS X. A new tab on the Windows 7 sites compares Windows 7 to Mac OS X in a number of areas--listing out the reasons that Windows 7 is the superior choice. Most of the points made by Microsoft are valid, but the campaign itself is a waste of resources that could be better used battling Apple where it counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is a threat to Microsoft, but Mac isn't much of a threat to Windows. All versions of Mac combined have about five percent of the operating system market, while Windows owns more than 91 percent. Mac is the second place OS, but--with 15 times the market share and a virtual monopoly on the OS market--dedicating resources to comparing Windows to Mac OS X is like Toyota creating a marketing campaign comparing the Camry to the Lotus Elise. The Elise is pretty, but its sales are no threat to the Camry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I realize that the "Get a Mac" ads had to sting a little. It was a very clever marketing campaign and it made Windows look bad--sometimes by distorting the facts in Mac's favor. In the end, though, Windows 7 is the fastest selling operating system of all time and Microsoft still has over 90 percent market share, so why dignify the Apple campaign with a response or stoop to that level?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where Apple is stealing Microsoft's lunch money is on the mobile front. Here, the tables are turned and Apple is the dominant player to Microsoft's underdog. If Microsoft wants to dedicate resources to fighting Apple, it should create ads or develop a site convincing users why they should choose Windows Phone 7 smartphones over an iPhone, and bring a Windows 7 (or--better yet--Windows Phone 7) tablet worthy of comparing to the iPad to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft can take some solace in knowing that the vast majority of those iPods, iPhones, and iPads are being synced to iTunes running on a Microsoft Windows PC. But, the trend is toward mobility, and users are increasingly relying on smartphones and tablets for tasks that have traditionally belonged to the PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem Microsoft faces is that it is the king of yesterday's hill, and Apple has already staked its flag on the hill of the future. Microsoft does need to recognize the Apple threat, but it needs to realize that the threat is on a different battlefront than PC vs. Mac and dedicate its resources to making the culture shift from desktop to mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft should let Apple tilt at windmills if it chooses--pitting its Mac OS X "David" against the Windows 7 "Goliath"--and not let pride distract it from more urgent matters. Microsoft should ignore Mac OS X and worry about the iPhone and iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

additional file formats and applications. According to company Founder

Plus reduces software licensing costs for individuals and businesses
since users are able to view and print virtually any file in its original
format without having the actual application on their desktop. It not
only saves purchasing and maintenance expenses for applications that
aren't regularly used, but also eliminates information-exchange issues
with vendors and associates."

    New features and capabilities in Quick View Plus 11 Standard Edition:


--  Support for Microsoft Windows 7 (32-bit version);
--  Support for Microsoft Office 2010 file formats (including Word, Excel
    and PowerPoint);
--  New and expanded file format support, including: Microsoft Office 2008
    for Mac (including Word, Excel and PowerPoint); IBM Lotus Symphony
    1.2; Lotus Notes DXL, PDF 1.7, AutoCAD 2005, 2006 and 2007 (with
    limitations); RAR and JAR files;
--  Ability to view .PST and .OST files over 2GB;
--  Support for Microsoft Office 2007 charts;
--  Support for Adobe Acrobat 9; and
--  Support for Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 and Mozilla Firefox 3.5.

    

In addition to expanding support for additional file types, Quick
View Plus 11 Standard Edition is closely aligned with Windows and
Microsoft Outlook. New capabilities include:


--  Ability to view files directly in the Preview Pane within Windows
    Explorer for Microsoft Windows 7 and Vista users.
--  Direct viewing of attachments within Microsoft Outlook 2007.

    

In addition to Quick View Plus 11 Standard Edition, Avantstar is
also offering a Professional Edition for the first time. Quick View Plus
11 Professional Edition provides larger enterprises, government agencies,

&lt;p&gt;  HOUSTON, TEXAS, Aug 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
NBTA International Convention &amp; Exposition - BMO Spend &amp; Payment
Solutions, a division of BMO Financial Group, today announced an alliance
with IBM's Managed Business Process unit to help joint clients control
business travel and expense management costs, drive process and policy
transformation, and improve compliance with corporate spend policies. 

    The partnership benefits organizations and their employees: Rich expense
data from BMO and Diners Club corporate cards - both of which run on the
MasterCard network - feeds automatically into IBM's Global Expense
Reporting Solution (IBM GERS), reducing employee's time and effort to
submit expense reports, and giving corporate travel managers improved
visibility and control into travel and entertainment (T) spend. 

    Additionally, organizations that utilize BMO or Diners Club corporate
cards automatically qualify for preferred pricing on GERS. The preferred
pricing is an ongoing benefit, and will stay in place as long as
organizations continue to utilize BMO-issued corporate cards and the IBM
GERS solution.

    Bolstered by its acquisition of the Diners Club North American franchise
last year, BMO offers a comprehensive portfolio of corporate card
solutions with the global acceptance of the MasterCard network. The
partnership with IBM can give multinational organizations new flexibility
to integrate travel spend data with an expense management solution
deployed in more than 85 countries, in 35 languages and that supports
country-specific tax rules and reclamation requirements. 

    "Our approach has always been to listen to customers and tailor solutions
to meet their immediate and long-term needs. That means freedom to choose
from an array of best-in-class solutions," said Terry Wellesley,
Executive Managing Director &amp; Group Head of BMO Spend &amp; Payment
Solutions. "With our card programs married to IBM's expense management
solution; we are ideally positioned to provide global business travel
solutions."

    With IBM GERS, employees can easily track purchases made on their BMO or
Diners Club corporate card, and access specific and categorical
breakdowns of where the card was used and what was purchased. Employees
quickly discern personal or business charges, and approval managers get
maximum visibility into business travel spend - with airlines,
restaurants, taxis and even hotel folio detail - essential insight to
improve controls, shape policy and drive better terms with preferred
vendors.

    "This partnership gives organizations tightly integrated tools to control
T costs and encourage compliance with spend policies, empowering our
clients to drive even more costs out of their business," said Ray
Curatolo, director for Global Expense Report Solutions, IBM MBPS. "We're
extremely excited to align these two original world-class brands in
business travel as we strive to deliver the highest levels of success to
our clients."

    Developed and used internally by IBM for decades, GERS is based on
advanced automation and analytics to help businesses of every size
improve process efficiency. With web-based accessibility and integrated
receipt imaging and scanning, GERS simplifies the way employees report
travel and other reimbursable expenses.

    About BMO Spend &amp; Payment Solutions

    A division of BMO Financial Group, BMO Spend &amp; Payment Solutions is a
leading commercial card, spend and payment solutions provider in North
America. BMO Spend &amp; Payment Solutions' products are widely used by

&lt;p&gt;StoredIQ leverages native file classifications to accelerate and facilitate
records management and eDiscovery on Windows Server 
AUSTIN, Texas--(Business Wire)--
StoredIQ, a leading provider of information management, compliance and

Management (IIM) Platform is now fully interoperable with the Microsoft File
Classification Infrastructure (FCI) technology included in Microsoft Windows
Server 2008 R2. Through its integration with FCI, StoredIQ aggregates the
intelligence of Microsoft`s data classification technology with StoredIQ`s own
enterprise-scale classification engine to create a semantically richer set of
classifications across the entire spectrum of electronically stored information
(ESI).

better manage and control all of their unstructured data to address their
eDiscovery and information management needs. Based on the classifications
applied to unstructured data by the combined solution, StoredIQ can
automatically execute records management, legal holds and document retention and
disposition policies, thereby reducing costs, mitigating risks, and simplifying
information governance. 

"Classifying unstructured information is increasingly important as today's
organizations face mounting pressure to establish and maintain effective
corporate governance strategies and respond timely to litigation requests," said
Eric Jewett, Director of Marketing, Windows Server at Microsoft. "The combined
data classification capabilities of StoredIQ and FCI will help organizations
identify and manage information according to its business value, retain only
necessary records, while meeting compliance requirements and reducing legal risk
and storage costs." 

"StoredIQ can leverage the data classifications inherent in Microsoft`s File
Server and apply policies to automatically act on that data including copying,
moving, deleting, changing security information, placing data on legal hold,
etc.," said Keith Zoellner, chief technology officer for StoredIQ. "This is a
powerful resource, allowing companies to accelerate the understanding of their
unstructured data based on the value of their information."

&lt;p&gt;NEW ORLEANS--(Business Wire)--
Sandy Sachs first stepped inside Bourbon Pub back in 1980. She was nineteen
years old at the time, attending Tulane University on a tennis scholarship, and
it would be her first visit to a gay nightclub and her first step in coming out
openly as a lesbian. 

Now, thirty years later, Sachs walks through Bourbon Pub`s French Quarter purple
front double doors as if she owns the place. That`s because she does. In time
for Labor Day Weekend`s Southern Decadence, Sachs takes sole ownership of the
nation`s oldest continuously operating gay nightclub from retiring owner Bobby
Revere, who is passing the torch to her. Revere became the bar/nightclub`s
second owner in 1986, while Jerry Menefee opened the club originally in 1974. 

"I really feel like I`ve come full circle," Sachs explains. "The Bourbon Pub &amp;
Parade has played such an important role in both my career and my life." 

After graduating from Tulane, Sachs went to work for Jerry Menefee at Menefee`s
which was the sister bar of the Bourbon Pub. She was the first female employee,
working in various positions from bartender, to manager, even a DJ. 

In 1986 Sachs moved back home to New York City, where she worked in the city`s
first video bar, Private Eyes, for three years. She migrated west to Los Angeles
in 1989 and went on to become owner of West Hollywood`s largest nightclub and
event space, The Factory, as well as launching Girl Bar, the country`s largest
dance and entertainment group for lesbians and its signature annual Palm Springs
event, Girl Bar Dinah Shore Week. 

"I`m very excited to be a part of the re-birth of the city that means so much to
me," explains Sachs, who will be traveling back and forth from Los Angeles to
The Big Easy. 

Southern Decadence September 1 - 6 is the city`s biggest gay event and the Pub
is at the center of the action. To purchase weekend passes online, visit:
www.bourbonpub.com

Sachs adds, "New Orleans has endured a lot, but I see this as an opportunity to
give back to the place that gave me my start and hopefully make it even greater
than before."

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc has raised average prices at its stores by about 6 percent in a month, according to a recent study in Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A check by J.P. Morgan Securities said average prices at the Wal-Mart Supercenter in Virginia were upped by 5.8 percent, the most significant sequential increase since it started the study in January 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest retailer is still the cheapest bet among supermarkets, but traditional rivals like Kroger Co and Safeway Inc are gaining ground -- in July Wal-Mart had a 10.4 percent lead relative to a 16 percent lead in June, JP Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising costs of raw materials and oil are pressuring companies across the board. Companies are passing on some of the input costs to consumers by rising prices as they try and guard margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safeway also raised prices by a modest 1.1 percent. Competitor Kroger, on the other hand, has cut prices 1.3 percent from June to July, as it tries to remain competitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A firm that received a $200 million settlement from MIcrosoft in May filed similar patent infringement charges against Apple Wednesday, claiming that the iPhone and iPad illegally use its technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotts Valley, Calif.-based VirnetX sued Apple and three other companies -- Cisco, NEC and phone maker Aastra -- in the same East Texas federal court where it was awarded a $106 million judgment in March in its case against Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months later, Microsoft settled for almost twice that amount to dismiss the original three-year-old lawsuit and a newer follow-up that added Windows 7 to the list of infringing products. Microsoft also licensed the VirnetX patents as part of the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wednesday's suit claimed that Apple's iPhone -- all models, including the newest iPhone 4 -- iPod Touch and iPad infringed a pair of VirnetX patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the two that Apple allegedly infringed -- identified as Patent No. 6,502,135 -- was also one of the pair that VirnetX said Microsoft violated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patent cited in both lawsuits, titled "Agile network protocol for secure communications with assured system availability," describes technologies for creating and managing a virtual private networking (VPN) connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VirnetX is a holding company that claims a portfolio of four dozen patents, many of them awarded to a team of engineers who once worked at SAIC, or Science Application International Corp., a firm that regularly contracts with the Department of Defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect to derive the majority of our revenue from license fees and royalties associated with these patents," VirnetX plainly states on its Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It hasn't done badly. On Monday, the company announced second-quarter revenues of $200 million, up nearly 28,000-fold from the $7,200 it earned in the same quarter in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit also named Canadian company Aastra, U.S.-based Cisco, and the Japanese multinational firm NEC, with the other defendants charged with infringing one, four and two VirnetX patents, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VirnetX drew the same judge who heard the Microsoft case, U.S. District Court Judge Leonard Davis, for its latest lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VirnetX has asked for both unspecified damages and injunctive relief, although the latter is rarely awarded in patent litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it's not impossible. Last October, Davis did issue an injunction in another patent lawsuit when he barred Microsoft from selling its Word program. The injunction went into effect in January 2010, forcing Microsoft to strip the infringing technology from Word 2007 .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VirnetX is again represented by McKool Smith, the Dallas law firm that represented it in the Microsoft patent infringement case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;Aug 13 (Reuters) - Toshiba Corp (6502.T), Japan's biggest
chipmaker, plans to reduce its procurement costs by 1 trillion
yen ($11.73 billion) over the next three years, mainly in its
home electronics business, by seeking new suppliers in emerging

to do the same in Russia and Eastern Europe. It will also hire
local experts to speed its search for new suppliers, the daily
reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company will begin cooperating on cost-cutting with the
foreign sub-contractors that design and manufacture its

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights: Wynn Resorts (Nasdaq: WYNN) as the Bull of the
Day and StanCorp Financial (NYSE: SFG) as the Bear of the Day. In addition,
Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Macy`s Inc. (NYSE: M), Visa (NYSE: V)
and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

We have an Outperform rating on Wynn Resorts (Nasdaq: WYNN) as the company's
second quarter 2010 earnings were well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.
They were primarily driven by better-than-expected top-line growth and
improvements in the bottom line. 

The company set record results in the Macau market. Additionally, with the
global economy showing a gradual recovery, the company is experiencing an
increase in demand. Its Las Vegas business, which was the worst hit at the time
of slowdown, is also rebounding. 

We remain encouraged with the company's strong brand name, healthy balance
sheet, relatively low capital requirements and ability to execute in a difficult
operating environment. 

Bear of the Day: 

We are downgrading StanCorp Financial (NYSE: SFG) to Underperform from Neutral
as we suspect organic growth will remain restricted in the near term, given the
sluggish economic environment and challenging labor market conditions.
Additionally, delinquencies on commercial mortgage loans are expected to remain
modestly high in the foreseeable future. 

Shares of StanCorp currently trade at 8.5x our earnings estimate for 2010, a 30%
discount to the industry average of 12.2x. On a price-to-book basis, the shares
trade at 1.0x, representing a 43% premium to the industry average of 0.7x. The
valuation on a price-to-book basis looks fair, given a trailing 12-month ROE
that is only 58% ahead of the industry average. 

Our six-month target price of $36.00 equates to 7.8x our earnings estimate for
2010. Combined with the annual dividend of $0.80 per share, this target price
implies a negative return of about 7.2% over that period. This is consistent
with our Underperform recommendation on the shares. 

Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog: 

Macy`s Outperforms, Ups Outlook

Macy`s Inc. (NYSE: M) has posted second-quarter 2010 results that topped Zacks'
expectations. The quarterly earnings of 35 cents a share outperformed the Zacks
Consensus Estimate of 28 cents, and rose 75% from 20 cents delivered in the
prior-year quarter. 

The company has been taking prudent steps to increase sales, profitability and
cash flows, which include integration of operations, consolidation of divisions
and customer-centric localization initiatives. To help drive traffic, Macy`s
continues to focus on price optimization, inventory management and merchandise
planning. 

The Cincinnati, Ohio-based Macy`s said that total sales grew 7.2% to $5,537
million from $5,164 million in the prior-year quarter. Total revenue also
comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Revenue Estimate of $5,481 million.
Comparable-store sales for the quarter jumped 4.9%. 

Online sales, which include macys.com and bloomingdales.com, sustained their
growth momentum and were up 28.1% in the quarter, favorably impacting
comparable-store sales by 0.5%. 

Deleveraging and Deficits

Even though the federal government is running very high budget deficits, the
overall ratio fo debt-to-GDP is actually declining now for the first time since
the country was sending Rosie the Riveter back to the kitchen. 

The ratio of private debt-to-GDP has plunged from an all-time high of 282.9% in
2008 to "just 234.8%" in the first quarter. While the level of private
debt-to-GDP is still very high, far exeeding where it was even in the depths of
the Great Depression after GDP had evaporated -- and well above where it was in
1929 -- it is also deleveraging extremely rapidly. 

Effectively what the country has been doing as a whole is paying down private
debt and adding to public debt. The former is outpacing the later. Money spent
paying down debt is money that is not being used to buy current production,
which helps explain why consumer spending has been so weak. 

The decline in the overall debt level is a good thing in the long term, but in
the short term it is very painful. Constantly increasing the ratio of overall
debt to income is essentially a case of living large on the credit card. We have
been doing that since everyone liked Ike, but it really picked up steam starting
with the Reagan Revolution. 

While the credit card is not totally maxed out -- after all, the government can
still borrow at historically low rates -- we have decided that it is time to pay
more than the minimum on the balance. Over time that is the prudent thing to do,
but it does not make sense to pay so much paying down the Visa (NYSE: V) that
you cannot afford bus fare to get to work. 

Disney Tops Zacks Estimates

The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) recently posted third-quarter 2010 results
that topped Zacks Consensus expectations. The quarterly earnings of 67 cents a
share comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents and jumped
29% from 52 cents delivered in the prior-year quarter. 

Total revenues for the quarter rose 16% to $10,002 million from the year-ago
quarter, and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9,334 million, whereas
total operating income surged 37% to $2,537 million. 

Recognition of deferred revenues at ESPN and strong theatrical releases, most
notably Alice in Wonderland, Iron Man 2 and Toy Story 3 were the major factors
driving growth. 

Segment Breakdown

Media Networks revenues rose 19% to $4,729 million, driven by revenue increase
across Cable Networks (up 28%) and Broadcasting (up 4%). Total operating income
soared 43% to $1,885 million. Cable Networks` operating income grew 50%,
benefiting from the recognition of deferred revenue of net $344 million at ESPN,
and increase in affiliate and advertising revenue, offset by a rise in
programming and production costs. 

Operating income at Broadcasting climbed 2%, reflecting an increase in
advertising revenue at owned television stations and rise in revenue from ABC
Studios productions, offset by increase in programming expenses at the ABC
Television Network. 

Parks and Resorts revenues grew 3% to $2,831 million. However, operating income
dropped 8% to $477 million due to the rise in costs and fall in attendance at
the theme parks, as well as higher fuel costs and decline in passenger cruise
days at Disney Cruise Line. 

Studio Entertainment revenues jumped 30% to $1,639 million, but posted a
substantial increase in operating income to $123 million, compared to a loss of
$12 million in the prior-year quarter, driven by the increase in worldwide
theatrical distribution and lower marketing and distribution costs. 

Consumer Products revenues soared 19% to $606 million and operating income
surged 22% to $117 million, reflecting improvement at its retail business,
growth at Publishing driven by Marvel titles, and a fall in costs at The Disney
Stores North America. 

Interactive Media revenues for the quarter jumped 74% to $197 million and posted
an operating loss of $65 million, an improvement of 13% over the prior-year
quarter, reflecting the rise in sales of video games, partly offset by increased
marketing costs.

Goldman Reveals Derivatives Revenue

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) has revealed that 25% to 35% of its total
revenue is gained from derivatives businesses, according to a report in The Wall
Street Journal. The disclosure came in response to a request by the Financial
Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) related to its probe into the recent financial
crisis. 

In July 2009, a 10-member FCIC panel was appointed by the United States
government to investigate the causes of the worst US financial and economic
crisis since the Great Depression. The panel, led by chairman Phil Angelides and
vice chairman Bill Thomas, is also examining the role of derivatives in
aggravating the financial crisis. The FCIC has been asked to submit the report
to the Congress by December 15. 

Derivatives are contracts whose value is derived from assets such as stocks,
bonds, currencies or commodities, or events such as changes in interest rates or
the weather. Derivatives have been considered a major offender in intensifying
the credit crisis, leading to the scrutiny of several other banks besides
Goldman Sachs. 

Goldman has already come under the FCIC scanner during the financial crisis for
its derivatives contracts with American International Group Inc. (NYSE: AIG),
the insurer that was being bailed out by the US government. 

On being requested by the panel, Goldman submitted information related to its
derivatives holdings and operations from 2006 through 2009. 

Statistics provided by Goldman indicates that its derivatives businesses
produced $11.3 billion to $15.9 billion of the company`s $45.17 billion in net
revenue for 2009. Additionally, according to a June report from the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the company held a gross amount of $49.1
trillion of derivatives contracts as of March 31, 2010. 

For the first half of 2010, Goldman reported $11.8 billion in revenues from
trading fixed- income, currencies and commodities and $3.57 billion from trading
equities, which together accounted for 71% of the company`s net revenues of
$21.6 billion. 

Wendy`s/Arby`s Expands in Russia

Wendy`s/Arby`s Group, Inc. (NYSE: WEN), the third largest quick-service
restaurant company in the United States, has set its eyes on the Russian market
for growth. The Russian market is one of the fastest growing markets; thereby
enabling Wendy`s/Arby`s to benefit considerably from its long-term growth
opportunities. 

Just before its second-quarter earnings, Wendy`s/Arby`s announced that through
its subsidiary Wendy`s/Arby`s International it has signed an agreement with
local franchisee Wenrus Restaurant Group Limited, to open 180 dual-branded
Wendy's and Arby's restaurants in Russia over the next 10 years. Wenrus is an
affiliate of Food Service Capital, one of the largest players in the Russian
hospitality industry. Food Service Capital runs 28 restaurants in Russia, the
Ukraine and Britain, including Goodman Steak Houses. 

Wendy's/Arby`s has limited presence in the international markets, which offers
ample opportunities to enhance its reach. The company opened its first
international dual-branded Wendy's and Arby's restaurant in Dubai, UAE in May
2010. This marked a milestone achieved by the company to broaden its global
footprint. Wendy`s/Arby`s also plans to open 100 Arby`s restaurants over the
next ten years in Turkey, 80 dual-branded restaurants in the Middle East/North
Africa and 35 Wendy's in Singapore. 

We see strategic growth opportunities at both Wendy`s and Arby`s brands,
including international development under dual-brand restaurants. The dual-brand
units, combining Wendy`s and Arby`s under one roof, can generate higher sales
volumes and better return on investment. 

Wendy's/Arby`s close competitor McDonald`s Corp. (NYSE: MCD), the leading fast
food chain operator, has 240 restaurants in Russia, and enjoys 70.0% market
share of Russia's quick-service restaurant. Moreover, McDonald`s plans to open
additional 45 restaurants in Russia. Wendy's/Arby`s other rival Burger King
Holdings Inc. (NYSE: BKC) opened its first Russian restaurant in January and
henceforth planning to open at least 5 restaurants within two years in Moscow. 

The company will also announce its second quarter 2010 results on August 12,
2010.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Trade Deficit Jumps to $49.9B

In June, the nation's Trade Deficit jumped to $49.90 billion from $41.98 billion
in May, and from just $27.14 billion a year ago. That is an 18.9% rise for the
month and a 83.9% increase from a year ago. It is far worse than the
expectations which were for the trade deficit to be more or less unchanged from
May. 

It also strongly suggests that when the next look at second quarter GDP comes
out that it will be revised downwards. The trade deficit is a direct subtraction
from GDP in the form of net exports, so any increase in it directly hits GDP
growth. 

The non-oil part of the trade deficit actually started to level out in mid-2004,
and started to improve sharply in early 2007. That progress, though, was masked
by a sharp deterioration in the oil side of the deficit, as the price of oil
spiked from early 2007 through the summer of 2008. The collapse in oil prices
during the freeze up of the financial markets proved to be a great cushion for
the rest of the economy. 

As oil prices have recovered from the mid-$30's to the current level of near $80
a barrel, oil has once again helped contribute to the growth of the trade
deficit. More worrisome, though, is that now the non-petroleum side is showing
an extremely sharp deterioration again. 

It appears that the strength of the dollar in recent months due to the Euro
crisis is already starting to take its toll on U.S. international
competitiveness. It is not just that our trade deficit with Europe is
deteriorating, rising to $7.8 billion in June from $6.2 billion in May. Our
companies compete directly with European companies in many third-world
countries. 

For example, General Electric (NYSE: GE) and Siemens (NYSE: SI) of Germany both
make products like MRI machines. If the value of the euro falls 10% against the
dollar, then Siemens can easily undercut the price it quotes to a Chinese
hospital that is interested in upgrading its medical imaging department, and
thus get sales that might have otherwise gone to GE. China is, of course, our
largest bilateral trade deficit, and it increased to $26.2 billion from $22.3
billion in May. 

What We Need: A Weaker Dollar

We need to see the dollar weaken to get the non-oil part of the trade deficit
under control. That will make U.S. goods more competitive abroad, and will also
make imports more expensive. As a result, domestic producers like Ford (NYSE: F)
would take market share from foreign firms like Toyota (NYSE: TM), or as is more
likely, firms like Toyota would move still more of their production to the U.S.
rather than importing cars from Japan. Since oil is priced in dollars, it will
tend to go up in price when the dollar gets weaker, so a weak currency will not
really solve that part of the problem. 

Even though the oil portion of the trade deficit has not been growing as fast as
the non-oil part, it is still a very significant part of the overall picture. It
seems unlikely that we will ever be able to really solve our overall trade
deficit problem if we do not solve our oil addiction. As a country we are like a
drug addict who is constantly selling off the family silver to feed his habit. 

Unless the price of oil were to collapse to the very low levels that prevailed
in the late 1990's, the oil side of the equation is going to be a constant thorn
in the side of the economy. After all, 42.5% of the overall deficit is still a
very significant part of the problem. 

That is probably putting it far too mildly. The trade deficit is more like a
cancer on the economy. It is what leads the U.S. to be indebted to the rest of
the world, not the budget deficit. After all, during WWII, the U.S. ran budget
deficits that were far larger as a share of GDP than what we are running today,
but we financed them internally, through the selling of war bonds. We emerged
from the war as by far the world's largest creditor, not in hock to the rest of
the world. 

Now we owe the rest of the world trillions, and our creditors are not really
countries that have our best interests at heart, like China and the members of
OPEC. Fortunately, the interest rate we have to pay on T-notes is very low right
now, so the cost of carry is relatively low. But still, the interest that we pay
that goes abroad is money that leaves the U.S. economy, rather than in the old
days when it would mostly go to domestic creditors and would be spent here. 

Cutting Back on Oil Use

For the most part, oil is used as a transportation fuel. Very little of it is
used to generate electricity anymore. We need to find a way to cut back on the
amount of oil we use for transportation. One way of doing this would be for us
to move more of our goods by rail rather than by truck. 

Probably the way this would be best accomplished would be for railroads to carry
the goods for the long haul and then have the containers transferred to trucks
for the last 50 miles of so of their journey. Not only are railroads much more
fuel efficient than trucks, but this would also cut down on traffic congestion.
Sitting in traffic jams wastes an enormous amount of oil each year. 

Moving to more efficient cars would be a great help. However, as a nation, we
suffer from Alzheimer's. We have already seemed to have forgotten the pain of
high oil prices two years ago. In July, as Detroit was rebounding from a year
ago, it was sales of pickup trucks and SUVs that were leading the way, while
small fuel efficient cars were languishing on the lots. 

Most cars on the road usually have no, or at most just one, passenger in them.
How much would our standard of living really be worse if people were driving
smaller cars, and cars with four cylinders instead of six or eight? As the BP
(NYSE: BP) disaster in the Gulf has shown, the answer to our imported oil
problem cannot really be "Drill, Baby, Drill," at least not for oil. 

Even with the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. has only 2.1% of the
world's oil reserves. We already produce 8.5% of the world's oil from that
limited reserve base, which makes the U.S the world's third largest oil producer
after Russia and Saudi Arabia. The problem is that we consume 21.7% of the
world's oil. Anyone who thinks that we can solve the problem by increasing our
share of production to match our consumption of 21.7% of the world total on just
2.1% of the worlds reserves is just plain off their rocker. 

In Summation: Bad News

This report was very bad news. I am far more concerned about the trade deficit
than I am about the fiscal deficit, particularly for the short term. At least in
the short term, the fiscal deficit provides stimulus that helps increase GDP
growth. The trade deficit is nothing but a drag on the economy, and a very large
and growing one at that. 

The U.S. simply cannot continue to be the consumer of last resort for the rest
of the world. If we do, it will not be long before the country is bankrupted and
our living standards fall towards those of the developing world. This is a clear
and present danger, but it does not seem to be getting the sort of attention it
deserves.

&lt;p&gt;Despite being widely derided (Microsoft_exec_mocks_iPhone_4_dubs_it_Apple_s_Vista"&gt;even by Microsoft executives), the Vista OS was instrumental in finally bringing to the world a secure version of Windows, at least if a presentation by a Microsoft security expert at the Usenix Security Symposium, being held this week in Washington, D.C, is any indication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was the most widely hated feature of Vista -- User Access Control (UAC) -- that can take the credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was all the users complaining about the annoying UAC pop-up boxes that finally spurred many application developers to rewrite their programs, explained Crispin Cowan, a Microsoft senior program manager for the Windows core security team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These programs were rewritten so that they did not require full administrative privileges to run, which, in turn, cut down on the UAC boxes and allowed users to slowly grow more comfortable running in more limited, but safer, user modes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The purpose of UAC was to move applications away from using administrative privileges. Its job was to spank programs that used administrator that don't need to," Cowan said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UAC, in effect, caused a "massive decimation of the population of ill-behaved [Windows] programs," he said. "The number of programs asking for admin rights dropped precipitously."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cowan's talk was an extended argument on why Windows 7 is as secure as Unix variants such as Linux. And this security parity came about, in his view, in large part thanks to the fact that Windows Vista was the first desktop version of Windows to not, by default, give each user account full administrative privileges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows' reputation for lousy security has been fully deserved, Cowan admitted. Even today, the most widely used version of Windows is Windows XP, which was built in 2001, and lacks most of the security provisions needed for today's environments (though Service Pack 2 added a lot of security features, he said).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early versions of the Windows OS stressed usability over security, as well as interoperability among different programs, Cowan said. As a result, Windows allowed every user to have full control over the machine, in effect giving each user account full administrative control over a machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you are running as administrator, security is fairly hopeless," he said. Unfettered administrative rights is what allowed malware and viruses to take control of computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning in 2002, however, Microsoft started making security an essential part of software development. As a result, the then next version of Windows, Vista, featured a total separation between what a user can do on a machine and what an administrator can do, a separation that has always been enforced on Unix distributions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This separation, enforced by UAC,  limits the damage that a user can do to a machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UAC could be seen as the Windows equivalent to the Unix sudo command, Cowan explained. Sudo allows a user to execute privilege tasks only after supplying an administrator, or root, password. Some Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, do away, at least out of the box, with root accounts altogether, relying entirely on sudo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many users chafed at using UAC, however. Every time a program would require full administrative rights to run, a UAC box would pop up on the screen, asking the user for permission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annoyance of UAC actually proved to be beneficial over the long run, Cowan explained, because it reduced the number of applications that required administrative rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many cases, programs did not need administrative permissions at all. Many Windows programs were designed to write their configuration data to the system registry, when it could as just as easily be stored in user folders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, application developers got the message from all the user complaints. Using anonymous telemetry data, Microsoft estimated that the number of Windows applications that required user access dropped from approximately 900,000 to 180,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Vista got the bad reputation for user-hostility, Windows 7 made UAC more user friendly without relaxing the strict divide between user and administrator. This OS offered auto-elevation, in which a limited number of Microsoft pre-approved programs could get administrative access without the annoying user prompts. It offers a sliding UAC scale, so users can pick the level of restriction for their applications. Windows 7 also established virtual accounts so individual applications could get their own user accounts, Cowan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the talk, one audience member said he agreed that UAC probably did encourage application vendors to rewrite their programs, but wondered if that was really Microsoft's goal in the first place, given the amount of user dissatisfaction it caused. Cowan himself admitted, when discussing browser security, that "Prompts are not purely evil. Prompts in which the answer is almost always 'yes' are evil."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UAC was one of a number of features that, Cowan said, brought Windows to security parity with Unix. The other features include a built-in firewall and the signing of 64-bit kernel drivers. In some cases, he argued, Windows now has security features that aren't even found in most Unix distributions, such as network access protection, memory address randomization, and data execution prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unix had a very large security lead. Since then, Microsoft has closed the gap on every front and in some cases exceeded Unix security," Cowan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joab Jackson covers enterprise software and general technology breaking news for The IDG News Service.

&lt;p&gt; * James Esposito replaces Howard Schiller&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Change is effective immediately&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Esposito previously worked in the company's debt group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHARLOTTE, N.C., Aug 12 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) named James Esposito, who was in the company's debt
capital markets group, as its investment banking unit's new
chief operating officer, according to a memo obtained by
Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Esposito replaces Howard Schiller in the post and will
report to David Solomon and John Weinberg, co-heads of
Goldman's investment banking business. Schiller is retiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Esposito will "oversee the activities related to the
division's key day to day operations," said the memo from
Solomon and Weinberg distributed to Goldman employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Company spokesman Michael DuVally confirmed the memo's
accuracy, and said the change is effective immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's investment banking unit contributed $917 million,
or about 10 percent of the company's $8.8 billion in total net

"the heart and soul of our firm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Esposito had been global head of the team that worked on
debt financing deals for investment-grade borrowers, public
entities and infrastructure projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite taking on the new job, Esposito will "continue to
serve the financing needs of some of our largest global
clients," the memo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Esposito joined Goldman Sachs in 1995 as a salesman for the
emerging markets debt group. He was named a managing director
in 2002, and a partner in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As part of the move, Jonathan Fine, who was managing
director of the U.S. investment-grade syndicate desk, will take
over as head of that desk, which covers a portion -- but not
all -- of Esposito's former responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fine became a managing director in 2007.

&lt;p&gt;  CORONA, CA, Aug 12 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
AVT, Inc. (formerly Automated Vending Technologies), (PINKSHEETS: AVTC)
(www.avtinconline.com) 

    AVT, Inc., one of the nation's leading providers of automated retailing
systems, was recently profiled in two segments on CNN Microcap News.
Company founder Shannon Illingworth and company CEO James Winsor were
interviewed and asked about the company's past, present and future. 

    Winsor commented about his expertise as an aerospace engineer and
experience with companies that include United Airlines and Chase
Manhattan Bank, and said that he was attracted to AVT because it is at
the forefront of an industry that is poised for explosive growth. "We
have moved from manufacturing vending machines that sell snacks and
drinks, to a technology-based company that manufactures systems that
allow businesses and entrepreneurs to sell a variety of products -- from
cell phones and digital cameras, to video games and clothing -- adding
convenience for the customers, along with protection from theft and
real-time online inventory management."

    Winsor also noted that the company has doubled the size of its
headquarters this past year, and nearly doubled the size of their
workforce -- bringing teams of manufacturing, mechanical engineering, and
software development all in-house.

    Company founder Shannon Illingworth talked about the customer experience
and stated that while management is getting ready to move the stock to
the big boards in the near future, they still focus on delivering the
best possible service to their new and existing clients.

    "Our customers are key to our success," he stated. "We accelerate the
growth of small companies and take today's retailing to the next level --
creating larger distribution, additional revenue streams, and protection
from pilferage."

    When asked about the growth potential of AVT, Illingworth noted that the
company has doubled their revenues in the past year, and is on track to
triple revenues next year. 

    The host of the program commented that he thought the stock was
undervalued, perhaps due to the perception that the company is a "mom and
pop vending operator," which couldn't be farther from the truth. 

    In fact, according to Illingworth, AVT has changed the vending industry
by utilizing technology that allows operators to use web based management
systems to track inventory and monitor cash flow, plus earn additional
revenue from highly targeted advertising that can be played on specially
designed LCD monitors integrated into the machines. 

    The company has moved so far from the simple machines that many people
think of, that they have coined a new term for their business category...
AVT is in the "Automated Retailing Industry," which for AVT, is a fast
growing and dynamic industry, indeed.

&lt;p&gt; * Supply to be cut due to Georgian terminals owners row&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Shipments to decline to 100,000 T in September via Georgia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOSCOW, Aug 12 (Reuters) - The Chevron-led Tengizchevroil
venture may cut crude deliveries via Georgia diverting them to
Turkish hub of Ceyhan due to a row between the owners of the
Georgian terminals, industry sources told Reuters on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sources said the shipments of Tengiz crude blend via two
Georgian outlets will be downsized to a three-month low of
100,000 tonnes in September from 165,000 tonnes in August and
198,199 tonnes in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traders said Tengizchevroil could divert the supplies to
Baku-Ceyhan link as early as in September or October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The decision to send the barrels to the Turkish
Mediterranean port of Ceyhan came as the owners of two terminals
in Georgia, Kulevi and Batumi, are quarrelling over priorities
of the supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tengizchevroil stopped using the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan earlier
this year because of disagreements on tariffs. [ID:nLDE61G1GQ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crude and refined oil products from Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan
and Turkmenistan are shipped to Georgia's Black Sea ports of
Batumi, Supsa, Poti and a terminal in Kulevi, which is owned by
the Azeri state energy company SOCAR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some are shipped across the Caspian Sea in small tankers,
unloaded in the Azeri port of Baku and then sent by rail to
Georgian ports for re-export to the Mediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kazakh state energy firm KazMunaiGas [KMG.UL] operates a
terminal in Batumi and wants most of the Tengiz shipments to go
through the terminal, while SOCAR is lobbying for its Kulevi
outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are in talks with the Azeri side, hope to solve the
issue in the nearest future and to restore the volumes to
Baku-Batumi direction," a source in Kazakh Ministry of oil and
gas told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apart from Chevron (CVX.N), Tengizchevroil shareholders are
Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) , Russia's LUKOIL (LKOH.MM) and Kazakh state
energy firm KazMunaiGas [KMG.UL].

&lt;p&gt;Brederode-1 Discovery Continues Recent Exploration and Drilling Success
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) today announced a natural gas discovery in the Exmouth
Plateau area of the Carnarvon Basin offshore Western Australia. The discovery is
located in Australia`s premier hydrocarbon basin, where Chevron is a leading
lease holder. 

The Brederode-1 exploration well is located within the WA-364-P permit area
approximately 217 miles (350 km) northwest of Onslow. Situated in 4,550 feet
(1,387 m) of water, the well was drilled to a depth of 9,022 feet (2,750 m) and
encountered approximately 49 feet (15 m) of net gas pay. 

George Kirkland, vice chairman, Chevron, said, "We are encouraged by the
Brederode-1 exploration success, which is further evidence of the natural gas
potential in the Exmouth Plateau area and the frontier opportunities offshore
northwest Australia." 

Jim Blackwell, president, Chevron Asia Pacific Exploration and Production Co.,
said the Brederode-1 discovery, which follows the 2009 Kentish Knock discovery
in the same area, extends the gas resources farther offshore Australia and
continues to grow our discovered gas portfolio in Australia. 

"This discovery expands the resource potential in the Carnarvon Basin frontier
and demonstrates our long-term commitment to developing Australia`s world-class
natural gas resources," said Blackwell. 

Chevron is the largest holder of undeveloped gas resources in Australia. 

Chevron`s Australian subsidiary is the operator of WA-364-P with 50 percent
interest. Shell Development (Australia) also holds 50 percent interest. 

Chevron is one of the world's leading integrated energy companies, with
subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company's success is driven by
the ingenuity and commitment of its employees and their application of the most
innovative technologies in the world. Chevron is involved in virtually every

solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future, including biofuels.
Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif. More information about Chevron is

8GB, 16GB, 32GB Fuel the Power&#174; 750 Express and Power 755
PRINCETON, N.J.--(Business Wire)--
Dataram Corporation (NASDAQ: DRAM), a worldwide leader in the manufacture of
high-quality computer memory, storage products, software and services, today
announced the immediate availability of cost-effective 8GB, 16GB and 32GB memory
upgrades for IBM`s newest Power 750 and 755 systems featuring POWER7 processors.


Dataram`s DRI750 family of memory upgrades fuel POWER7 processors with up to
512GB of 1066MHz DDR3 DIMMs, enabling greater bandwidth and performance. The use
of DDR3 memory technologies that utilize ECC (error checking and correcting),
Chipkill and Memory Spare provide increased RAS (Reliability, Availability, and
Serviceability). Deploying multiple Power 750 servers fully loaded with 512GB of
Dataram memory is an excellent alternative to the larger more expensive CUoD
(Capacity Upgrade on Demand) servers. 

"Many organizations today are faced with the challenge of making significant
reductions in data center and application expenses while expanding services and
optimizing performance", stated Jeff Goldenbaum, Sr. Product Manager at Dataram.
"Our 43 year track record of providing reliable memory options that provide a
direct, bottom line savings of up to 50% or more over the OEM makes our IBM
compatible memory upgrades very compelling". 

Like other Dataram products, the DRI750 memory upgrades are available for a free
evaluation period. Dataram`s Memory Evaluation Program allows companies to try
out memory in their systems for up to 60 days, so they can experience the
benefits before they buy - with absolutely no cost or obligation. 

The DRI750 is available in three capacities - 8GB, 16GB and 32GB - and each
product consists of two identical DDR3 DIMMs.

&lt;p&gt;Sync Contacts, Calendar, Tasks and Notes between Motorola DROID 2 and Microsoft
Outlook, Palm Desktop, ACT! by Sage, Lotus Notes and More
PORTLAND, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
CompanionLink&#174; Software, Inc., a leading provider of mobile sync solutions for
Google&#174; Android&#8482; devices, announces two-way synchronization with Motorola&#174;

Desktop, and ACT! by Sage. CompanionLink offers two ways to sync with DROID 2 -
direct USB sync and wireless sync using Google.

DejaOffice&#8482;, a mobile contact manager suite with address book, calendar, tasks
and notes apps. Data can sync two-ways between PC and DejaOffice using the USB
cable that comes with DROID 2. 

Wireless sync through Google relies on the built-in integration the DROID 2 has
with Google Contacts and Google Calendar. CompanionLink synchronizes PC
contacts, calendar and tasks to Google, which then synchronizes over-the-air to
the DROID 2. Changes made on DROID 2 will sync back to Google and then to the PC
through CompanionLink.

using Microsoft Exchange," says Rushang Shah, Director of Marketing for
CompanionLink Software, Inc. "With CompanionLink, the DROID 2 becomes an
extension of their PC, allowing professionals to carry their Outlook data in
their hands."

starting at $39.95. More information, including a 14-day free evaluation of the
software, is available at www.companionlink.com/droid2.

&lt;p&gt;Hard on the heels of the breakthrough news about a spinal fluid test that's accurate in diagnosing Alzheimer's comes word of a new generation of DNA tests for colon cancer, says The New York Times. Cancer of the colon is slow-growing and, when caught early, easily removed. But the colonoscopy (did you just wince?)&#160;is such&#160;an invasive procedure that many patients refuse to have one. Doctors say the new DNA tests can detect&#160;cancers that a colonoscopy could miss, as well as pre-cancerous polyps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as we're talking research, here's another interesting revelation--a light sleeper who wakes at every noise has a brain that's different from the person who can happily dream on, even as the house comes down around him.After all the prescriptions and publicity comes the question: Are statins really all that effective? The answer, according to the Los Angeles Times, is mixed. For&#160;people hoping to prevent a second heart attack, the outlook is good. But as a preventative measure, the jury is still out&#160;on drugs&#160;such as&#160;Lipitor, Crestor and Zocor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big business relies on big computers, and mainframes, despite their age, are still in use. (An estimated 10,000 mainframes remain the backbone of 5,000 IBM customers worldwide.) Since teaching mainframe skills doesn't make it into many contemporary tech curricula, older computer-savvy workers are in ever-greater demand by Big Blue.&#160; Feel a midlife crisis nipping at your heels? Avoid the sports car cliche (ditto for the Harley) and hop on that bicycle, says the UK Telegraph.Seems older Americans are hitting the road in a variety of vehicles, including RVs. After a period of stagnation that saw many RV dealerships closing their doors, retirees are driving a boomlet in the sale of homes on wheels.Retirees are smashing to smithereens the hoary myth of the dude on the couch with the remote in his hand and are traveling in record numbers, says The Orange County Register.All the more reason to check out these great tips on how to plan an eco-friendly camping trip.If you're waiting for your kids to call you back, good luck. According to The Washington Post, the under-45 set simply won't use the telephone. Those over 45, meanwhile, tend to prefer the intimacy and immediacy of a live conversation.This isn't to say that baby boomers don't text. Quite the contrary. The parents of Gen X and Gen Y are adopting mobile technologies at a swift pace and make up the fastest-growing group of texters. Needless to say, the free market has noticed your affinity for technology and is now actively figuring out the many ways to woo you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Regulators reviewing Televisa-Nextel bid&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Two of five commissioners no show at Friday's session&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Ruling delayed until next week-source
 (Recasts with vote delay)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Cyntia Barrera Diaz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MEXICO CITY, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Mexico's telecommunications
regulator Cofetel on Friday delayed until next week a
controversial vote on whether to allow leading broadcaster
Televisa entry into the mobile phone business, according to a
source close the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa, together with its partner, wireless operator
Nextel, was the only bidder for a 30 MHz nationwide block in
the 1.7 GHz band of frequency. The deal has to be approved by
regulators before it can move forward for final approval from
Mexico's Communications Ministry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But two of the telecoms watchdog's five commissioners
failed to show up for Friday's session, Cofetel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Today nothing will happen ... not until next week," a
source close to the situation told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite the delay, Cofetel is likely to approve the
Televisa-Nextel bid, two sources with knowledge of the process
told Reuters this week. The sources declined to be named
because they were not authorized to speak to the media about
the deliberations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some politicians have complained that the auction was set
up to allow Televisa and Nextel to low-ball their bid. The
venture has revived criticism that government officials are
beholden to Televisa, which has a 70 percent market share in
broadcast television in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two companies offered about $14 million, a fraction of
the $400 million that rivals America Movil and Telefonica
offered when they bid for another slice of the mobile
spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; America Movil (AMXL.MX) (AMX.N) is Latin America's leading
cell phone service provider and is owned by billionaire Carlos
Slim. Spain's Telefonica (TEF.MC) is second in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The venture of Nextel, a unit of NII Holdings NIHD.O, and
Televisa (TLVACPO.MX) (TV.N), was the only group eligible to
bid for the 30 MHz nationwide block because of rules capping
the amount of spectrum that an operator can own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa has committed to buying 30 percent of wireless
operator Nextel for $1.44 billion if their bid succeeds. They
plan to develop a 3G data services network.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc on Friday said several top company officials, including Chairman and Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, exercised stock options this week and obtained millions of dollars of profits by selling the resulting shares, regulatory filings show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blankfein exercised 90,681 stock options at a strike price of $82.875, and obtained a $6.09 million gross profit by selling the resulting shares on Wednesday at prices between $148.97 to $152.00.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In similar options exercises and sales, President Gary Cohn exercised 73,653 options and had a $4.95 million profit, Chief Financial Officer David Viniar exercised 67,326 options and had a $4.52 million profit, and General Counsel Gregory Palm exercised 47,895 options and had a $3.22 million profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said the options were granted in November 2000 and scheduled to expire this November. It disclosed the transactions in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is Wall Street's most profitable bank.

&lt;p&gt;KENAI, Alaska--(Business Wire)--
On August 12, the Kenai River Estate sold at an absolute real estate auction
event for $1.43 million. The estate was marketed and sold by J. P. King Auction
Company, the nation`s leading real estate auction marketing firm. 

Eight registered bidders from Idaho, Texas and Alaska attended the event. Forty
others arrived to watch the process, while enjoying the salmon, rice and smoked
chicken hors d'oeuvres with live music that are typical of a J. P. King event,
all while also enjoying the spectacular views of the Kenai River and Cook Inlet.


"It was certainly the most professionally-handled auction I`ve ever attended,"
said Fred Braun, a real estate broker with Freedom Realty in Kenai. "I think
this has opened the door for other opportunities in this area as owners have
seen that this is a successful way to sell high-end real estate." 

John McCallam, a rancher in Idaho, bought the property yesterday through a power
of attorney and was "totally overwhelmed" upon learning he was the successful
bidder, said Braun. 

"It was a great day for us," said Craig King, president and CEO of J. P. King.
"We were able to sell a property in our 50th state, and we have a happy seller
and an excited buyer, who has just begun to explore ideas of what to do with his
new home."

parts of the country, individuals may contact J. P. King at 800.558.5464 or

commercial properties. The company has marketed properties in all 50 states and
six countries with recent sales in Texas, Tennessee, Oregon, Wisconsin, Alabama
and Wyoming.

&lt;p&gt; * Regulators reviewing Televisa-Nextel bid&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Voting session proceeds with three of five commissioners
 (Adds details on meeting, commissioners, byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Cyntia Barrera Diaz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MEXICO CITY, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Mexico's telecommunications
regulator Cofetel is expected to rule on Friday on a frequency
auction that would allow leading broadcaster Televisa to move
into the mobile phone business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The telecoms watchdog's five commissioners were due to meet
on Friday to vote on the bid for added capacity, but two of the
commissioners did not attend, Cofetel said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The voting was expected to continue with three of the
commissioners, a source close to the situation told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa, together with its partner, wireless operator
Nextel, submitted the only bid for a 30 MHz nationwide block in
the 1.7 GHz band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies offered about $14 million, a fraction of the
$400 million that rivals America Movil and Telefonica offered
when they bid for another slice of the mobile spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; America Movil (AMXL.MX) (AMX.N) is Latin America's leading
cell phone service provider and is owned by billionaire Carlos
Slim. Spain's Telefonica (TEF.MC) is second in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some politicians complained that the auction was set up to
allow Televisa and Nextel to low-ball their bid, for critics
something else to prove their contention that Mexican
regulators' are cozy with the massive companies controlling
much of the Mexican economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Everything suggests that (Televisa and Nextel's bid) will
get the go-ahead," said the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another source saw no indication that the commissioners
would block Televisa's and Nextel's bid. The sources declined
to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the
media about the deliberations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mexico's Communications Ministry would have to give final
approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The venture of Nextel, a unit of NII Holdings NIHD.O, and
Televisa (TLVACPO.MX) (TV.N), was the only group eligible to
bid for the 30 MHz nationwide block because of rules capping
the amount of spectrum that an operator can own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa has committed to buying 30 percent of wireless
operator Nextel for $1.44 billion if their bid succeeds. They
plan to develop a 3G data services network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The venture has revived criticism that government officials
are beholden to Televisa, which has a 70 percent market share
in broadcast television in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cofetel is also expected to rule on Friday on winning bids
from other players in the 1.7 GHz auction, one of the sources
said.

&lt;p&gt;IBM said Friday it intends to purchase marketing software maker Unica for roughly US$480 million, in a move that will boost Big Blue's capabilities for creating focused marketing campaigns. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unica has more than 1,500 customers, including major retailers like Best Buy and telecoms such as US Cellular, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's announcement follows its recent purchase of Web analytics vendor Coremetrics. Unica's software will work in concert with Coremetrics' technology as well as IBM's WebSphere Commerce platform. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's goal is to help customers generate a "consistent and relevant cross-channel brand experience to promote customer loyalty and satisfaction," according to a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vendors such as Adobe are making similar moves. In support of its "customer experience management" strategy, Adobe has purchased Web analytics provider Omniture and more recently, Web content management vendor Day Software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marketing specialists are "challenged to meet the priorities of the CEO," and need to more effectively understand how their customers are segmented in order to build loyalty among them, said Craig Hayman, general manager of IBM industry solutions, during a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's move to buy Unica will help round out a portfolio of software that captures the "digital transformation" chief marketing officers and service providers face, said Altimeter Group analyst Ray Wang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You start with key assets such as Coremetrics that provide insight, you leverage Unica for marketing automation, and you conduct commerce through Sterling Commerce," another recent IBM acquisition, Wang said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's unlikely that IBM will get into sales force automation capabilities sold by the likes of Salesforce.com, since that segment is largely commoditized and doesn't present much in the way of services revenue, Wang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For his part, Hayman said IBM is focused more on the market for integrating CRM applications with others, evidenced by its recent purchase of data integration vendor Cast Iron Systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Kanaracus covers enterprise software and general technology breaking news for The IDG News Service.

&lt;p&gt;Following a string of recent acquisitions, IBM has announced that it will purchase marketing automation software maker Unica for about $480 million  at a price of $21 a share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past few months, IBM has gobbled up the real-time data compression firm Storwize, network compliance specialist BigFix, business software maker Sterling Commerce, and web analytics firm Coremetrics. The company has said it will spend $20 billion on acquisitions through 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unica buy will strengthen IBMs existing portfolio of software meant to help companies automate, manage, and accelerate core business processes  across marketing, demand generation, sales, order processing and  fulfillment  which includes the aforementioned Sterling Commerce and Coremetrics purchases. It will allow IBM to better help businesses predict and analyze customer tastes and focus their marketing efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Waltham, Mass.-based Unica has more than 1,500 customers worldwide  including Best Buy, eBay, ING, and Monster. Its 500 employees will move to IBMs Software Solutions Group, and its software will bolster IBMs Business Analytics and Optimization Consulting organization  which IBM describes as a  team of 5,000 consultants and a network of analytics solution centers thats backed by $11 billion in acquisition investments made over the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;via Between the Lines

that would allow broadcaster Televisa to move into the mobile

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft on Thursday announced it will release a public beta of Internet Explorer 9 (IE9) on Sept. 15, a little less than five weeks from now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a minority of Windows users will be able to try the beta, however. IE9 will not work on Windows XP, the aged operating system that powers nearly 68% of all PCs running Windows. The new browser requires either Windows Vista or Windows 7 .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday's announcement followed a comment made late last month by Kevin Turner, the company's chief operations officer, that the IE9 beta would show up in September . Until today, Microsoft had declined to set a date or even confirm Turner's statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft first announced IE9 in March , and has released four developer preview builds since then, most recently on Aug. 5 when it said the fourth such preview would be the last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while those previews have trumpeted the new browser's "Chakra" JavaScript engine, graphics processor-powered hardware acceleration, support for the new HTML5, and being more in line with current Web standards, Microsoft hasn't as much as whispered about IE9's look and feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The developer previews have relied on an nearly-nonexistent interface that lacks even the most basic navigational features, such as a back button or even an address bar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most expect that Microsoft will debut IE9's UI (user interface) in the beta next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to reports earlier this year, IE9 was to feature a look copied from Windows Phone 7's "Metro" interface. Today, Neowin.net said sources had told it that Metro is out and a "simplistic UI similar to that of Google's Chrome" is in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If so, it wouldn't be a surprise: Other browser makers, notably second-place Mozilla, have headed in that direction, too, as they follow the lead of Google and its cleaner-composed Chrome. Mozilla's next major upgrade, Firefox 4, will feature tabs on top and will eliminate the traditional Windows menus above the browser's content area, two UI features popularized by Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IE is on a two-month upswing in usage share, according to the most recent data from metric firm Net Applications, and Microsoft has to hope that IE9 will be able to keep that momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, earlier this month Roger Capriotti, a product management lead on the IE team, refused to be drawn into a discussion of Microsoft's goals for IE9, or even whether the company thought the new browser would entice users to come back to the browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vince Vizzaccaro, an executive with Net Applications, had previously pegged IE's increase in usage share to the growth of Windows 7, the Microsoft OS that includes IE8, and to a national television advertising campaign in the U.S. More recently, he had other explanations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[The two-month increase] is more than a blip for IE," said Vizzaccaro in an interview last week. "Something is working for them. Maybe it's related to ongoing privacy concerns on the part of people with Google."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said nothing about a ship date for IE9, though many have speculated on an April 2011 release to coincide with MIX, the company's annual Web conference, slated to run April 12-14, 2011 in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's possible the ship date will be significantly later: Microsoft finalized IE8 a full year after it released the first public beta for that browser. If it maintains the same pace for IE9, the upgrade's final edition might not appear until September 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more about internet in Computerworld's Internet Topic Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe it's related to ongoing privacy concerns on the part of people with Google."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said nothing about a ship date for IE9, though many have speculated on an April 2011 release to coincide with MIX, the company's annual Web conference, slated to run April 12-14, 2011 in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's possible the ship date will be significantly later: Microsoft finalized IE8 a full year after it released the first public beta for that browser. If it maintains the same pace for IE9, the upgrade's final edition might not appear until September 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more about internet in Computerworld's Internet Topic Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) Japan group refiner TonenGeneral Sekiyu KK (5012.T) is considering investing in secondary refining units or cutting its refining capacity to meet government efficiency rules, the firm's managing director W.J. Bogaty said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry's regulation calls for Japan-based refiners to increase their percentage of residue cracking units to crude distillation units (CDUs) by the business year that ends in March 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've been very clear with METI that we think their regulation is ill advised and not good for the country," Bogaty told reporters during the company's first-half earnings announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we understand what we think is METI's motivation, we believe that the focus of the regulation ... is a mistake and that the focus of the regulation should be the overall competitiveness of the industry and of its components."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fuel oil has led declines in Japanese oil sales in recent years as many industries accelerate a shift to cleaner energy sources such as natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By boosting the ratio of residue cracking to 13 percent from 10 percent now, METI aims to strengthen the nation's refining industry at a time of higher demand for lighter oil products and increased production of heavier crude oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if Japan's ratio reaches 13 percent, that still pales in comparison to around 19 percent in Europe, the United States and some Asian countries. It would, however, allow more output of value-added products such as gasoline from heavy oil residues, which would boost the competitiveness of Japanese refiners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REVIEWING ALL OPTIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are undertaking a very deep and very rigorous review of all of our options," Bogaty said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those options extend anywhere from making investments to closing our refinery capacity and to a combination of those things. That analysis is extremely complex and we will take our time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Japan group, which has 836,000 barrels per day of total crude refining capacity, is the second-ranked refiner in Japan and currently has a residue cracking ratio of less than 10 percent, meaning that it would have to improve that ratio by 45 percent by the end of March 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nation's refiners are required to submit their plans for improving the ratio to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry by October 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capacity of cokers, residue fluid catalytic cracking (RFCC) units and residue hydrocracking units (RHCU) that convert residue, a very heavy feedstock, into semi-finished oils that can later be converted into products such as gasoline and distillates will be used to compile the ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Clarence Fernandez)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world`s first freeform data analysis and data visualization component for
Windows Forms and ASP.NET adds Silverlight support and Excel export
MORRISVILLE, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
GrapeCity today announced the availability of ActiveAnalysis 2.0 Beta, formerly
known as Data Dynamics Analysis. The world`s first freeform data analysis
component for Windows Forms, ASP.NET and Silverlight allows developers to
rapidly embed out-of-the-box OLAP, data visualization, and ad hoc business
intelligence (BI) features into their applications. 

Designed for Microsoft Silverlight 4, the latest version supports printing and
the use of context menus within Silverlight. The Silverlight support allows .NET
developers to rapidly embed out-of-the-box interactive, cross-browser data
analysis and visualization features into their applications. 

Another significant feature is the support for exporting the onscreen data to
Microsoft Excel for offline analysis. End users can export the onscreen data,
including encoded values and exports it to a format that allows them to further
analyze or manipulate the data in Excel. 

Major new features include:

* Silverlight based out-of-the-box cross-browser data analysis capabilities 
* Excel export for offline analysis on the desktop 
* Intelligent processing of numeric and date data to display more information in
less space 
* Automatic selection of the correct visual representation based on the data
type 
* Accelerated information discovery and analysis for end users

Commenting on the release, James Johnson, the GrapeCity PowerTools Product
Manager said, "By enabling Silverlight based data analysis combined with Excel
export, the product effectively allows developers to benefit from the
centralized deployment and distribution of their Silverlight based web
application while giving users the rich client experience they get with
traditional desktop tools." 

The release version of GrapeCity ActiveAnalysis 2.0 will be available for
Windows Forms, ASP.NET and Silverlight. Prices start at $999, with site
licensing and annual maintenance available.

&lt;p&gt; * Exxon Japan group considers action to meet govt regulations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Cutting crude refining capacity is also one option -exec
 (Adds context)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOKYO Aug 13 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) Japan group
refiner TonenGeneral Sekiyu KK (5012.T) is considering investing
in secondary refining units or cutting its refining capacity to
meet government efficiency rules, the firm's managing director W.
J. Bogaty said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government regulations would require all oil refiners in
Japan to raise the ratio of residue fluid catalytic cracking
units or cokers to total crude refining capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are undertaking a very deep and very rigorous review of
all of our options," Bogaty told reporters during the company's
first-half earnings announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Those options extend anywhere from making investments to
closing our refinery capacity and to a combination of those
things. That analysis is extremely complex and we will take our
time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Japan group, which has 836,000 barrels per day of total
crude refining capacity, is the second-ranked refiner in Japan
and currently has a residue cracking ratio of less than 10
percent, meaning that it would have to improve that ratio by 45
percent by the end of March 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The nation's refiners are required to submit their plans for
improving the ratio to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry by Oct. 31.

big banking names to join his team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 55-year-old Stott was previously chief operating officer
for JP Morgan's investment bank in Europe, the Middle East and
Africa as well as heading its reputation risk office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He will apply his long and wide-ranging client relationship
and business experience to gaining market share and growing our

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's telecommunications regulator approved a controversial bid by broadcast giant Televisa to enter the mobile phone market on Monday, ratcheting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;up competition on market leader America Movil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cofetel, as the regulator is known, said in a statement it ruled the joint bid by Televisa and partner Nextel was valid despite objections from some politicians who said the bidding process had been rigged to allow Mexico's top broadcaster to present a low-ball bid for wireless spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa and Nextel raised eyebrows after bidding $14 million for its license, a fraction of the $400 million offered by rivals America Movil and Telefonica SA for another slice of the mobile spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics said the government backed down in the face of Televisa, which controls about 70 percent of Mexico's broadcast television market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the government has stood behind the auction arguing it will promote competition in the mobile phone market where Carlos Slim's America Movil is the leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The venture of Nextel, a unit of NII Holdings Inc and Televisa was the only group eligible to bid for the 30 MHz nationwide block because of rules capping the amount of spectrum any one operator can own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cofetel attempted to approve the Televisa bid last Friday but was unable to do so after two of the five commissioners failed to show up for the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board's decision must be approved by Mexico's Communications Ministry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the Cofetel commissioners excused himself from attending the Friday meeting, saying in a letter he has opposed the way Mexico's mobile frequency auction had been structured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa has committed to buying 30 percent of wireless operator Nextel for $1.44 billion if their bid succeeds.

&lt;p&gt; * Frequency auction criticized&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * New entrant may boost competition for America Movil
 (Recasts with bid being approved)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Cyntia Barrera Diaz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MEXICO CITY, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Mexico's telecommunications
regulator approved a controversial bid by broadcast giant
Televisa to enter the mobile phone market on Monday, ratcheting
 up competition on market leader America Movil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cofetel, as the regulator is known, said in a statement it
ruled the joint bid by Televisa TVLACPO.MX (TV.N) and partner
Nextel NIHD.O was valid despite objections from some
politicians who said the bidding process had been rigged to
allow Mexico's top broadcaster to present a low-ball bid for
wireless spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa and Nextel raised eyebrows after bidding $14
million for its license, a fraction of the $400 million offered
by rivals America Movil (AMXL.MX) (AMX.N) and Telefonica SA
(TEF.MC) for another slice of the mobile spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Critics said the government backed down in the face of
Televisa, which controls about 70 percent of Mexico's broadcast
television market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the government has stood behind the auction arguing it
will promote competition in the mobile phone market where
Carlos Slim's America Movil (AMXL.MX) (AMX.N) is the leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The venture of Nextel, a unit of NII Holdings Inc  NIHD.O
and Televisa was the only group eligible to bid for the 30 MHz
nationwide block because of rules capping the amount of
spectrum any one operator can own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cofetel attempted to approve the Televisa bid last Friday
but was unable to do so after two of the five commissioners
failed to show up for the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The board's decision must be approved by Mexico's
Communications Ministry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the Cofetel commissioners excused himself from
attending the Friday meeting, saying in a letter he has opposed
the way Mexico's mobile frequency auction had been structured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa has committed to buying 30 percent of wireless
operator Nextel for $1.44 billion if their bid succeeds. It
plans to develop a 3G data services network, allowing it to
compete directly against America Movil and Telefonica.

&lt;p&gt; * Paulson adds energy giant Exxon to portfolio&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Adds Goldman shares in an ironic Wall Street twist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Raises holding in Beazer Homes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BOSTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager John Paulson,
who has been betting on a strong U.S. economic recovery, added
a top energy company and a Wall Street bank while also raising
his stake in a homebuilder during the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paulson's New York-based Paulson  Co added a new position
to his portfolio when he bought 9.2 million shares in energy
giant Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) in April, May and June, according to
regulatory documents filed on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The firm joined top hedge fund managers like Carl Icahn,
Eric Mindich and Dinakar Singh who all made bets on various
beaten-down energy stocks after the Deepwater Horizon disaster
in the Gulf of Mexico caused the worst-ever oil spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the same time, Paulson, whose investing savvy was
established when he correctly bet the U.S. housing market would
collapse in 2007, clearly expects the economy to come back as
he is sticking with his bets on some of the country's biggest
lenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also picked up one million shares of Goldman Sachs Group
(GS.N) in the second-quarter, which may be some of the most
fitting piece of Wall Street poetry to come out of this latest
round of 13-F filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paulson's fund will forever be linked with Goldman because
it was the hedge fund at the heart of the Securities and
Exchange Commission's civil fraud case against the Wall Street
bank. The SEC, in April, charged Goldman with failing to
disclose that Paulson's hedge fund had a hand in picking
securities for a complex mortgage-related deal that the hedge
fund was betting against.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And although regulators didn't charge Paulson's hedge fund
with any wrongdoing, his investors became so nervous that he
was forced to hold a series of conference calls to explain the
matter over and over. Before the matter was settled, Paulson's
sterling reputation was tarnished a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After making a five million share bet on Beazer Homes USA
(BZH.N) in the first quarter Paulson raised the holding to 5.8
million share in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the end of the second quarter Paulson told his investors
that he is modestly less bullish about the U.S. economy but
still expects it to bounce back.

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

Deutsche Bank Aligns with Craigs

On Wednesday, Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE: DB) and Craigs Investment Partners Limited
of New Zealand announced the completion of their strategic alliance. As per the
terms of the alliance, Deutsche Bank would hold a 49.9% equity interest in
Craigs, while the remaining 50.1% will be held by the existing shareholders of
Craigs Investment. 

When the agreement was first announced in March 2010, it was accepted that
Deutsche Bank's global institutional equities platform and Craigs Investment's
New Zealand institutional equities operations will work together to cater to
clients in New Zealand and beyond. 

Last month, Deutsche Bank reported a second quarter net income of &#8364;1.2 billion
($1.5 billion) or &#8364;1.75 a share, up from &#8364;1.1 billion or &#8364;1.64 per share a year
earlier. While the company experienced a substantial drop in revenues from
investment banking, this was more than mitigated by lower loan loss provisions,
gains realized from the acquisition of commercial banking activities from ABN
AMRO in the Netherlands and a gain on its own debt. 

Deutsche Bank`s results were in line with other investment banks such as Credit
Suisse Group (NYSE: CS), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) and Citigroup Inc.
(NYSE: C), all of whom have reported significant declines in trading revenues in
the second quarter, reflecting hesitance on the part of investors, with the
sovereign debt crisis and regulatory reform related issues looming on the
horizon. 

Cell Therapeutics' Q2 Net Loss Widens

Cell Therapeutics (Nasdaq: CTIC) announced a second quarter 2010 net loss that
increased to $53.6 million or 8 cents per share from a loss of $27.4 million or
6 cents per share last year. The wider loss in the reported quarter was due
primarily to the presence of non-cash expenses, which included $30.2 million in
deemed dividends on preferred stock and $7.6 million in stock-based
compensation. 

Excluding deemed dividends on preferred stock but including stock based
compensation, loss at Cell Therapeutics came in at $23.5 million or
approximately 4 cents per share, against $18.02 million or 4 cents in the year
ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was a loss of 2 cents for the quarter.


Net operating expenses during the reported quarter declined 8% year over year to
approximately $20 million, driven by a 19% reduction in selling, general and
administrative expenses and a 5.5% decline in research and development expenses.

of New Zealand announced the completion of their strategic alliance. As per the
terms of the alliance, Deutsche Bank would hold a 49.9% equity interest in
Craigs, while the remaining 50.1% will be held by the existing shareholders of
Craigs Investment. 

When the agreement was first announced in March 2010, it was accepted that
Deutsche Bank's global institutional equities platform and Craigs Investment's
New Zealand institutional equities operations will work together to cater to
clients in New Zealand and beyond. 

Last month, Deutsche Bank reported a second quarter net income of &#8364;1.2 billion
($1.5 billion) or &#8364;1.75 a share, up from &#8364;1.1 billion or &#8364;1.64 per share a year
earlier. While the company experienced a substantial drop in revenues from
investment banking, this was more than mitigated by lower loan loss provisions,
gains realized from the acquisition of commercial banking activities from ABN
AMRO in the Netherlands and a gain on its own debt. 

Deutsche Bank`s results were in line with other investment banks such as Credit
Suisse Group (NYSE: CS), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) and Citigroup Inc.
(NYSE: C), all of whom have reported significant declines in trading revenues in
the second quarter, reflecting hesitance on the part of investors, with the
sovereign debt crisis and regulatory reform related issues looming on the
horizon. 

Cell Therapeutics' Q2 Net Loss Widens

Cell Therapeutics (Nasdaq: CTIC) announced a second quarter 2010 net loss that
increased to $53.6 million or 8 cents per share from a loss of $27.4 million or
6 cents per share last year. The wider loss in the reported quarter was due
primarily to the presence of non-cash expenses, which included $30.2 million in
deemed dividends on preferred stock and $7.6 million in stock-based
compensation. 

Excluding deemed dividends on preferred stock but including stock based
compensation, loss at Cell Therapeutics came in at $23.5 million or
approximately 4 cents per share, against $18.02 million or 4 cents in the year
ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was a loss of 2 cents for the quarter.


Net operating expenses during the reported quarter declined 8% year over year to
approximately $20 million, driven by a 19% reduction in selling, general and
administrative expenses and a 5.5% decline in research and development expenses.

&lt;p&gt; * Regulators meet again on Monday&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Pending ruling on Televisa-Nextel bid
 (Releads; adds source quote, details on meeting from head of
Cofetel, byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Cyntia Barrera Diaz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MEXICO CITY, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Telecommunications
regulators in Mexico reconvened on Monday to continue
deliberations over broadcasting giant Televisa's bid to enter
the mobile phone business after failing to rule on the issue
last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cofetel, Mexico's telecoms watchdog, was expected to rule
on Friday on whether it would grant Televisa and its partner,
wireless operator Nextel, a 30 megahertz nationwide block that
can be used for mobile phone service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the vote was called off after two of the board's five
commissioners failed to show up, indicating a division about
whether to grant the frequency to Televisa and Nextel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A source familiar with the situation told Reuters a
gathering started Monday morning, but could not say how many
commissioners attended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In recess, after a first round of three and a half hours,"
Cofetel President Mony de Swaan posted on his Twitter account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa and Nextel raised eyebrows with its joint
$14-million bid, only a fraction of the $400 million rivals
America Movil (AMXL.MX) (AMX.N) and Telefonica SA (TEF.MC)
offered when they bid for another slice of the mobile
spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some politicians have complained the auction was set up to
allow Televisa and Nextel to low-ball their bid. The venture
revived criticism that government officials are beholden to
Televisa, which has a 70 percent market share in broadcast
television in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the government has stood behind the auction arguing it
will promote competition in the mobile phone market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the Cofetel commissioners excused himself from
attending the Friday meeting, saying in a letter he has opposed
the way Mexico's mobile frequency auction had been structured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The venture of Nextel, a unit of NII Holdings In  NIHD.O
and Televisa (TLVACPO.MX) (TV.N), was the only group eligible
to bid for the 30 MHz nationwide block because of rules capping
the amount of spectrum any one operator can own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Cofetel could vote on the matter with only three of
its five commissioners, it said last week it wanted to have the
entire board present to rule. The board's decision must be
approved by Mexico's Communications Ministry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa has committed to buying 30 percent of wireless
operator Nextel for $1.44 billion if their bid succeeds. It
plans to develop a 3G data services network, allowing it to
compete directly against America Movil and Telefonica.

&lt;p&gt; * Fund giant ups Exxon stake 48 pct in 2nd quarter-filing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Company lowers stakes in banks, Google&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSTON Aug 16 (Reuters) - Fund giant Fidelity Investments
sharply raised its holdings of oil firm Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) in the
second quarter, a filing showed on Monday, though it reduced other
large positions including stakes in Google Inc (GOOG.O) and banks
like Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fidelity owned 74.9 million shares in Exxon Mobil worth
$4.5 billion as of June 30, according to data from a quarterly
filing by company parent FMR LLC, sorted by edgar-online.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The number of Exxon shares were up 48 percent from
Fidelity's holdings as of March 31. It also raised its stake in
Apple Inc (AAPL.O) by 13 percent, adding 5.8 million shares during
the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Computer maker Apple is Fidelity's largest holding, with a
value of $12.8 billion as of June 30. But Fidelity lowered its
stake in its second-largest holding, Google, by 10 percent to
14.1 million shares, worth $6.9 billion. Fidelity remains
Google's largest single shareholder, controlling 5.7 percent of
the Internet search company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The mixed pattern of buying and selling was typical for the
Boston mutual fund company, which has more than $1.5 trillion
under management. The filing reflects activity across hundreds
of different mutual funds the company offers retail and
institutional investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman said Fidelity would not discuss shares it
bought or sold in individual companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Large investors like Fidelity must report their holdings of
U.S.-listed securities at the end of each quarter, but not
short positions or holdings of other securities such as bonds
and over-the-counter derivatives contracts. Investors may
exclude stocks they are trading or have moved to other funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Along its Exxon Mobil stake, Fidelity bought other energy
company shares including more than doubling its stake in BP Plc
(BP.L) and adding to stakes in Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Royal
Dutch Shell (RDSa.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The selling of Google shares continued a trend a past
Fidelity filing showed in the first quarter. Likewise, it
continued selling shares of San Francisco bank Wells Fargo  Co,
where it now owns 235 million shares, down 9 percent from the past
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the largest positions Fidelity sold completely were
shares in France's Axa SA (AXAF.PA) that were worth $205 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also sold 53 million shares of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O),
or a quarter of its holdings in the world's largest software
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Large companies whose shares Fidelity added during the
quarter included McDonald's Corp (MCD.N), where its stake rose
22 percent, and General Electric Co (GE.N), up 44 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Ross Kerber; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)

&lt;p&gt;Sync Contacts, Calendar, Tasks and Notes between Dell Streak and Microsoft
Outlook, Palm Desktop, ACT! by Sage, Lotus Notes and More Using CompanionLink
PORTLAND, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
CompanionLink&#174; Software, Inc., a leading provider of mobile sync solutions for
Google Android&#8482; devices, announces two-way sync between PC and the
Android-powered Dell&#174; Streak&#8482;. CompanionLink will synchronize contacts,
calendar, tasks and notes between Dell Streak and PC software such as Microsoft&#174;
Outlook&#174;, Outlook Business Contact Manager, IBM&#174; Lotus Notes, Novell&#174; GroupWise,
FrontRange&#174; GoldMine, Palm&#174; Desktop, and ACT! by Sage. CompanionLink offers two
ways to sync with Dell Streak - direct USB sync and wireless sync using Google. 

Direct USB sync with Dell Streak works in tandem with an Android app called
DejaOffice&#8482;, which provides address book, calendar, tasks and notes apps with
features similar to those found in PC contact managers. Data transfers two-ways
between PC and DejaOffice using the USB cable that comes with the Dell Streak. 

Wireless sync through Google relies on the built-in integration the Dell Streak
has with Google Contacts and Google Calendar. CompanionLink synchronizes PC
contacts, calendar and tasks to Google, which then synchronizes over-the-air to
the Dell Streak. Changes made on the Dell Streak will sync back to Google, and
then to the PC using CompanionLink. 

"CompanionLink is proud to announce support for Dell`s Android-based devices,"
says Rushang Shah, Director of Marketing for CompanionLink Software, Inc. "With
CompanionLink, the Dell Streak becomes an extension of people`s PCs, allowing
them to carry PC data right on their devices. CompanionLink extends a critical
life-line to those people using Microsoft Outlook without Microsoft Exchange." 

CompanionLink`s sync solutions for the Dell Streak are available for a one-time
cost starting at $39.95. More information, including a 14-day free evaluation of
the software, is available at www.companionlink.com/streak.

supports families and entrepreneurs through the life-cycle and growth of
an enterprise. Located in Columbia, Maryland, JPBE provides both

&lt;p&gt;  PASADENA, CA, Aug 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Central Desktop, a leading Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) collaboration
platform provider, today announced the availability of its new
cloud-based Microsoft Office collaboration tool, Central Desktop for
Office. This new product delivers seamless, real-time integration between
Microsoft Office and the cloud to radically improve the way people
collaborate on Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents. 

    Once installed, Central Desktop for Office adds a new toolbar in
Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint that allows users to interact with
files stored online without ever having to open a web browser. Using this
toolbar, users can simultaneously co-author Word, Excel and PowerPoint
documents in real-time, as well as open and save files directly into the
cloud. Central Desktop for Office is powered by OffiSync technology and
is compatible with Microsoft Office 2003, 2007 and 2010.

    "As more and more companies adopt online collaboration tools like Central
Desktop, one of the biggest challenges they face is how to make the
transition to working in the cloud as smooth as possible," said Isaac
Garcia, CEO and co-founder of Central Desktop. "Because most people are
accustomed to working with the ubiquitous Microsoft Office suite, we
wanted to develop a way for them to easily engage in web-based
collaboration while remaining in the familiar Word, Excel and PowerPoint
environments. Central Desktop for Office solves this issue by enabling
users to access, edit and co-author files stored in the cloud directly
from within Office." 

    Key Features of Central Desktop for Office


--  Open/Save Files from Office -- Access Microsoft Office files stored
    online in Central Desktop without having to open a web browser. Saving
    any document in Word, Excel or PowerPoint automatically syncs it to
    the cloud so that the most recent version of the document is always
    available both online and on the desktop.
--  Simultaneously Co-Author Files -- Multiple authors can edit the same
    Word, Excel or PowerPoint document at the same time directly from
    Office. When one user saves a change, all other users in the document
    will immediately be prompted to preview and merge the edits into one
    updated version. This feature is particularly powerful for business
    teams with multiple collaborators for documents such as project plans,
    legal agreements, budget forecasts and sales presentations.
--  Comment on Files -- Add file comments directly to any Word, Excel or
    PowerPoint document in order to foster discussion and collaboration.
    The comments are also synced online to Central Desktop.
--  Track Version History -- Each time a file is saved, the updated
    document is automatically added to the online version history in
    Central Desktop, making it easy to revert back to previous versions.
--  Notify and Manage Collaborators -- Add, remove and notify
    collaborators of any document within Office to ensure that the right
    users can access and edit files.
--  File Search -- Search for other Word, Excel and PowerPoint files saved
    in the cloud directly from the Central Desktop for Office toolbar.

    

"The Central Desktop for Office tool brings convenience and
efficiency to a new level," said Alicia McCabe, Manager at Share Our
Strength's Operation Frontline Massachusetts, a non-profit organization
dedicated to providing nutrition education. "The ability to seamlessly
access online files as if they were saved directly on my computer has
changed the way I work." 

    The Leading SharePoint Alternative for SMBs
 The release of Central
Desktop for Office builds upon Central Desktop's reputation of delivering
true enterprise-level functionality at an affordable price. While
Microsoft Office 2010 also includes co-authoring capabilities, Central
Desktop for Office provides the same functionality without requiring the
costly upgrade to the new suite. With its comprehensive set of online
collaboration tools for both internal and external communication, Central
Desktop remains the leading SharePoint alternative for small and
medium-sized businesses. 

    Pricing and Availability
 Central Desktop for Office is now available in
both free and premium versions. The free version is available for all
Central Desktop users and includes the ability to open and save files
from the Central Desktop for Office toolbar. The premium version includes
extended functionality including the co-authoring feature and is
available for $30/user/year.

&lt;p&gt;Acme-1 Discovery Represents Ninth Discovery in 12 Months Offshore Western
Australia
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) today announced further drilling success in the
Carnarvon Basin offshore Western Australia, Australia`s premier hydrocarbon
basin. 

The Acme-1 exploration discovery well is located in the WA-205-P permit area
offshore Western Australia approximately 93 miles (150 km) from Onslow. Drilled
in2,880 feet (878 m) of water to a depth of 15,469 feet (4,715 m), the well
encountered approximately 896 feet (273 m) of net gas pay.

Carnarvon Basin. We expect this discovery to help underpin potential expansion
opportunities at the Wheatstone liquefied natural gas hub. Adding to our
Australian portfolio progresses our long-term plans to build a leading natural
gas business in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region." 

Chevron`s Australian subsidiary is the operator of WA-205-P and holds a combined
67 percent interest, while Shell Development (Australia) holds the remaining
interest.

&lt;p&gt;
Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq:ALGN) today announced the launch of Invisalign(R)
G3, the most significant collection of new features and innovations in the
company's history. Invisalign G3 is engineered to deliver even better clinical
results, with new aligner and software features that make it easier to use
Invisalign with Class II and Class III patients, new SmartForce(TM) features
designed for increased predictability of certain tooth movements, and simpler,
more intuitive software to streamline treatment planning and review.

Invisalign G3 builds on a new and improved feature set introduced to the
Invisalign product line last fall. "The innovations in Invisalign G3 really get
at the heart of what doctors have been asking for from Invisalign treatment,"
said Sheila Tan, Align vice president, marketing and chief marketing officer.
"With technology and tools that are designed to expand the clinical scope of
Invisalign, deliver greater predictability across most clinical situations, and
make treatment planning more efficient -- Invisalign G3 represents a tremendous
leap forward in Invisalign innovation and demonstrates how we leverage our
technology to deliver the clinical outcomes doctors expect."

Features that make it easier to use Invisalign to treat Class II and Class III
patients

The treatment of Class II/III malocclusion often requires the use of interarch
elastics to provide anchorage control. Previously, doctors had to manually cut
the aligners to accommodate the use of elastics, which may have discouraged the
use of Invisalign in these cases. Invisalign G3 addresses this barrier with new
Precision Cuts, which are doctor-prescribed pre-cuts in the aligners that
accommodate the use of elastics. Using a new drag-and-drop interface in
ClinCheck 3.0 software, doctors have the flexibility to specify the placement
and the type of Precision Cuts on the aligners, making it easier for doctors to
use Invisalign.

"I am very excited about the new features and innovations in Invisalign G3,
particularly Precision Cuts," said Dr. Sam Daher, an orthodontist practicing in
Vancouver, BC. "It's a significant enhancement to what I do in the office every
day and will make it even easier to use Invisalign on complex cases."

SmartForce(TM) features for greater predictability of tooth movements

SmartForce features, such as the Optimized Attachments introduced last fall, are
attachments and aligner features that are engineered to deliver the forces
needed to achieve predictable tooth movements. Based on biomechanical
principles, SmartForce features are customized to each tooth using advanced
virtual modeling, and are positioned precisely to deliver the proper forces.

New SmartForce features in Invisalign G3 include an Optimized Rotation
Attachment for bicuspids (previously available only for cuspids), a new Power
Ridge(TM) feature for lower anteriors (previously available only for the upper
arch), and a Lingual Power Ridge feature for upper anteriors. A new variation of
the Optimized Rotation Attachment is also being introduced to address clinical
situations where placement of the attachment may have previously been difficult.

Intuitive features and drag-and-drop interfaces in ClinCheck 3.0 and the
Invisalign Doctor Site streamline treatment planning

In addition to clinical tools and enhancements, Invisalign G3 streamlines the
overall treatment planning process. Specifically, a significant evolution of the
ClinCheck software makes it easier and more intuitive for doctors to create and
modify Invisalign treatment plans. One of the most exciting improvements is the
addition of drag-and-drop interfaces for ordering Precision Cuts and
attachments, providing doctors with new tools designed to make it easier and
more efficient for them to develop and review their treatment plans.

The Invisalign Doctor Site (formerly Virtual Invisalign Practice or "VIP") is a
secure web site where doctors access Invisalign patient records, review and
approve ClinCheck treatment plans, view patient account status, order treatment
supplies, and more. A significant redesign of the site not only makes it simpler
and more intuitive to use, but also consolidates all of a patient's Invisalign
records and treatment tasks together in one location for easy access. The
Invisalign Doctor Site also introduces a new online prescription form that is
integrated with the doctor's clinical preferences.

The improvements and innovations in Invisalign G3 also include new clinical
preferences, improved staging for interproximal reduction (IPR), and the
addition of Compliance Indicators to Invisalign Assist.

Invisalign G3 features will be available at no additional cost to
Invisalign-trained doctors in North America in October, with international
availability in 2011.

About Align Technology, Inc.

Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary
method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign
corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable
appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does
not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign
significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with
braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and teens. Align
Technology was founded in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market
Invisalign in 1998. Today, the Invisalign product family includes Invisalign
Full, Invisalign Teen, Invisalign Assist, Invisalign Express, and Vivera
Retainers.

&lt;p&gt;AMRI Inaugural Winner of API Route Improvement and Innovation Challenge
ALBANY, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
AMRI (NASDAQ: AMRI) announced today that it has been selected as the inaugural
winner of the Pfizer Route Design Innovation Award, beating out 40 companies who
were invited to share innovative ideas for process chemistry and large scale
Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) production. Pfizer will present the
company with the award at the AMRI 2010 Integrated Drug Discovery Symposium to
be held in Albany NY, October 13-14. AMRI will also receive an honorarium for
its win. 

The innovation challenge was initiated by Pfizer Worldwide Research and
Development in late 2009 to identify organizations to discover new and improved
routes of synthesis for the manufacture of chemical intermediates and APIs.
Companies with experience in process chemistry and large scale API production
were invited to contribute approaches that improved the cost effectiveness of a
specific compound of interest to Pfizer. Via this open innovation initiative,
Pfizer harnessed the expertise of a select group of specialists who share
Pfizer`s goal of developing partnerships to solve difficult and complex
scientific challenges. After reviewing the expert proposals from companies who
participated in the challenge, the Pfizer scientific review panel (from the API
Technical Operations group in Pfizer Global Manufacturing) granted AMRI top
honors in the contest. 

"This award stands as testament to the technical expertise and entrepreneurial
spirit of our scientific team, and our ability to generate intellectual property
as a value-added service to our customers," said AMRI Chairman, President and
Chief Executive Officer Thomas E. D`Ambra, Ph.D. 

"Pfizer would like to congratulate AMRI on the high quality of their proposed
solutions submitted in response to our inaugural award program. We look forward
to further collaborating with AMRI to develop this and other programs and
consider AMRI a valued partner in the development of innovative research," said
Richard Connell, Ph.D., Vice President and global head of External Research
Solutions Center of Emphasis at Pfizer.

&lt;p&gt;As it starts transitioning to Microsoft's Bing search engine this week, Yahoo has decided to drop Search Monkey, a developer platform designed to let external coders create applications that enhance Yahoo search results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search Monkey, launched in May 2008, will be shut down on Oct. 1 when its developer tools, application gallery and related material will be taken offline, Yahoo said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a result, third party custom result apps, infobar apps, and data services will no longer appear on Yahoo's search results. For developers who wish to retain their code, please export it using your favorite copy/paste tool before then," wrote Yahoo product manager Natasha Fattedad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo plans to start using Bing's back-end search engine for its U.S. and Canada search sites this week, under terms of a 10-year search partnership announced last year. It is asking webmasters to continue using its Site Explorer service while also becoming acquainted with the Bing Webmaster Center. Both are designed to let webmasters communicate their sites' structure to the Yahoo and Bing Web crawlers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To keep things simple, we will share site information you provide on Site Explorer with Microsoft during this transition period," Neal Sample, Yahoo's vice president of Social, Open,  Publishing Platforms, wrote in a separate blog post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through Search Monkey, results were enhanced on more than 60 percent of Yahoo result pages via images, links and additional information about listings, according to Fattedad. The platform helped users to narrow search results using filters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo will still try to improve search results using structured data, but through a different tack, shifting focus to publishers' sites, Sample said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yahoo Search is continuing to shift  from a model where developers build lightweight apps to install on Yahoo to one where publishers enhance their own site markup to produce similar results. Yahoo Search results pages will continue to show enhanced result templates from websites' page markup and structured data feeds along with Microsoft's organic listings," Sample wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo also plans to turn off the APIs (application programming interfaces) for MyBlogLog, a service that lets Web publishers create communities around sites by giving visitors the option of creating personal badges and identifying themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By the end of the year, these APIs will no longer be available. We encourage you to turn to our well-supported Social APIs. The Yahoo network now relies on this Social platform to power user profiles and social graph, relationships, activity streams, and more," Sample said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still under review are Yahoo's geographical, maps and local APIs, some of which will remain, while others will be discontinued by September, according to Sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the developer programs Yahoo plans to keep are BOSS (Build Your Own Search Service), which lets developers build a custom search engine, and YQL (Yahoo Query Language), a SQL-like language to query and call up structured data on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo and Microsoft announced their search deal in July last year and began the implementation, estimated to take up to two years, in February after getting regulatory clearance in the U.S. and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal calls for Yahoo to rely on Bing for back-end search functions like crawling sites, indexing them and matching results to queries. Microsoft also got licensing rights to integrate some of Yahoo's core search technologies into Bing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will be in charge of self-service sales of pay-per-click text search ads. For the first five years of the deal, Microsoft will get a 12 percent commission of paid clicks on the search sites of Yahoo and of Yahoo Web publisher partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In turn, Yahoo will sell premium guaranteed search ads and handle individual relationships with the biggest advertisers, search marketing firms, resellers and their clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the acquisition of 3Par, Dell is positioning itself against top data center storage providers, including IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Hitachi and even Dell-partner EMC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Brad Anderson, senior vice president of Dell 's Enterprise Product Group, said the 3Par acquisition won't affect its reseller agreement with EMC .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell has had a reseller agreement with EMC for the past decade, offering EMC's entry-level and midrange Clariion storage arrays as well as its Data Domain deduplication appliances. The partnership represents billions in revenue and, for many years, more than 10% of EMC's earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EMC's a very important partner of ours. Our plan is not to change anything. We've always been a company about choice. We're bringing another choice," Anderson said. He added that Dell never resold EMC's high-end Symmetrix line of arrays, so there'll be no overlap or competition in that category of products with the addition of 3Par.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, Dell has increased its line of storage products mainly through reseller partnerships and acquisitions, with offerings such as entry-level to midrange Fibre Channel and iSCSI arrays, network-attached storage (NAS) and data deduplication devices. With Monday's news of its planned purchase of 3Par, Dell is squarely positioning itself in the enterprise-class data center space, and it will be competing with the likes of longtime partner EMC, as well as IBM , HP and Hitachi Data Systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3Par sells storage arrays that can be clustered together to provide petabytes of capacity that can be served up to business units like a utility. The technology is especially well-suited for supporting virtualized server and both private and public cloud computing infrastructures because it can be centrally managed and scales, like building blocks, in capacity and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Duplessie, founder and senior analyst with Enterprise Strategy Group, agrees that the 3Par acquisition doesn't necessarily affect the EMC partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duplessie said 3Par was one of the only independent vendors left that represented serious competition against the likes of EMC's Symmetrix, HDS's Universal Storage Platform (Virtual) and IBM's Enterprise Storage Server high-end storage arrays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"3Par's product line competes with EMC for sure," Duplessie said. "But there's no overlap at all [with the] ... Dell/EMC relationship because of this acquisition. Will it ultimately become a problem? 3Par will compete just like EqualLogic competed with EMC, but somehow their partnership relationship continues to get bigger."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's not a heck of a lot of high-end options, so it will be interesting to see what they end up doing," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell was not the only company interested in purchasing 3Par, according to Duplessie. HP also had its eye on the Fremont, Calif.-based company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Peters, also an analyst with Enterprise Strategy Group, said Dell's buyout of 3Par has less to do with storage and more to do with Dell's wanting to be an end-to-end solutions provider like HP or IBM. "This is about Dell becoming a grownup," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell's Anderson said storage is playing a key role in the company's strategy to provide utility-style products for customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a conference call with the press and analysts Monday, Anderson pointed to the emergence of software-as-a-service, infrastructure-as-a-service, social networking, and public and private cloud computing as examples of architectures that increase the need for storage platforms that scale in both capacity and performance for massive throughput.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're seeing an increasing demand for a new class of storage -- a class that allows storage ... as a utility. As a result of that, we think 3Par is a fantastic addition to the Dell lineup," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anderson listed Dell's acquisition of iSCSI storage company EqualLogic two years ago, its buyout of NAS provider Exanet in February and the purchase of data compression vendor Ocarina Networks last month as part of Dell's strategy to provide best-in-class storage products across all marketplaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"3Par, like EqualLogic, is a peer-scaling architecture ... which is absolutely critical to our customer's needs. It is the utility storage solution chosen by seven of the top 10 revenue-generating managed service providers," Anderson said. "Additionally, 3Par is perfectly aligned with Dell's strategy of open, capable and affordable solutions that really [address] a customer's storage requirements but more importantly total cost of ownership."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anderson said that as a result of 3Par's efficient technology architecture, which includes thin provisioning and data compression algorithms, its storage arrays have the ability to lower administration and management costs by as much as 90% and to reduce capacity, power, cooling and floor space as much as 75%, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3Par CEO David Scott said the company has 600 employees and more than 6,000 customers. With the acquisition, he said his company will have "massive reach" into new worldwide markets via Dell's channel sales as well as being able to cut prices through its supply chain. Once the deal is closed, 3Par will remain a separate company under Dell, with Scott staying on as CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given the significant use of industry standard components within 3Par's offering, we believe there will be significant opportunities for improving our cost competitiveness," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott said 3Par already had a partnership with Exanet and supported it as a NAS gateway, meaning it could serve up data in file or block form. "As such, we have a number of joint existing customers," he said. "The opportunities for a leading unified storage combined NAS and SAN offering, represent a great future potential."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott also pointed to Dell's purchase of Ocarina and its data deduplication and compression technology as complementary to 3Par's thin provisioning technology. "Together, Dell and 3Par will be well-positioned to become a new storage industry powerhouse. Other vendors in the storage industry will be in danger of being left flat-footed with tired product lines and few options."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darren Thomas, Dell's general manager of enterprise storage, said his company will eventually integrate 3Par's thin-provisioning technology into other products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think there's going to be a fantastic opportunity long term to drive a unified Dell storage lineup." he said. "You're going to see technology from 3Par and others, including Ocarina, that we're going to want to drive across our entire storage lineup."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucas Mearian covers storage, disaster recovery and business continuity, financial services infrastructure and health care IT for Computerworld.

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com Analyst Blog features: Elan Corporation Plc. (NYSE: ELN), Transition
Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: TTHI), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), Novartis AG (NYSE:
NVS), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) and Forest Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE: FRX).

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Elan to Move ELND005 to Phase III

Elan Corporation Plc. (NYSE: ELN) and partner Transition Therapeutics Inc.
(Nasdaq: TTHI) recently announced their plans to move their Alzheimer`s disease
pipeline candidate ELND005 into late stage trails. The companies also reported
data from a mid-stage trial on ELND005. The companies presented positive safety
and tolerability data on ELND005 taken twice-daily, for about 18 months.
However, the trial`s cognitive and functional co-primary endpoints failed to
achieve statistical significance. 

The trial (AD201) initially enrolled 351 patients with mild-to-moderate
Alzheimer`s disease at about 65 sites in the US. The study included four
treatment arms: placebo, 250 mg BID, 1000 mg BID and 2000 mg BID. The 1000 mg
BID and 2000 mg BID trials were discontinued in December last year due to
serious adverse events, including mortality. 

Based on these results, Elan and Transition Therapeutics plan to move ELND005
into phase III trials, the details of which are not currently available. We
believe the companies will seek to enter into a partnership deal before
commencing phase III studies. The signing of a lucrative deal would bring in
additional funds, which would help finance the advanced stage development of the
candidate. 

Potential for ELND005

ELND005 received fast track designation from the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) in 2007 for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. According to the
Alzheimer's Association and Alzheimer's Disease International, more than five
million Americans have Alzheimer's disease while more than 26 million people
worldwide suffer from some form of dementia. 

The Alzheimer's disease market consists of players like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE),
Novartis AG (NYSE: NVS), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) and Forest Laboratories,
Inc. (NYSE: FRX). It is estimated that the market is currently worth more than
$5 billion.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights: Triumph (NYSE: TGI) as the Bull of the Day and
Molson Coors (NYSE: TAP) as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity
Research provides analysis on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM), Fifth Third
Bancorp (Nasdaq: FITB) and PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (NYSE: PNC). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

Triumph (NYSE: TGI) has been benefiting from acquisitions and internal
manufacturing, and the recent Vought acquisition was highly accretive to
earnings. The reported EPS of $1.33 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of
$1.08. We also increase our EPS estimate for fiscal 2011 and 2012 after taking
into account the synergy benefits to be accrued within a year. 

Management too has raised their guidance to an EPS estimate of approximately
$6.00. The acquisition is expected to add approximately $1.10 to the earnings
estimate. Moreover, the company's focus on growing its core businesses along
with its strict cost control strategy inspires us to upgrade our recommendation
from Neutral to Outperform. 

Bear of the Day: 

Molson Coors (NYSE: TAP) reported better-than-expected second-quarter 2010
results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.06. The company's healthy
balance sheet and cost saving programs support its investment in brands and
innovation. 

However, the company's susceptibility to the global economic downturn and
predominant operations in mature and low-growth markets, coupled with stiff
competition and seasonality of business, severely undermines the company's
future growth prospects and profitability. 

The recommendation for the stock still remains Underperform as we prefer to wait
until the company starts reaping the benefits of its restructuring initiatives.

U.S. Bank Failures Stretch to 110

U.S. regulators on Friday shuttered Palos Heights, Illinois-based Palos Bank and
Trust Company, pushing up U.S. bank failures to 110 so far in 2010. This
compares with 140 bank failures in 2009, 25 in 2008 and only 3 in 2007. 

Although the economy is showing signs of a gradual recovery with the
stabilization of large financial institutions, small banks continue to be
impacted by tumbling home prices, soaring loan defaults and a high unemployment
rate. 

While we expect the overall economic recovery to gain momentum soon, there
remain lingering concerns in the banking industry. Failure of both residential
and commercial real estate loans as a result of the credit crisis has primarily
hurt banks. 

As the industry absorbs bad loans made during the credit explosion, the trouble
in the banking system goes even deeper, increasing the possibility of more bank
failures. Economic threats related to the European debt crisis further add to
the concerns. 

Palos Bank and Trust Company had total assets of about $493.4 million and total
deposits of about $467.8 million as of June 30. 

This recent failure represents another blow to the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) fund meant for protecting customer accounts, as it has been
appointed receiver for the bank. The FDIC insures deposits in 7,932 banks and
savings associations in the country and promotes the safety and soundness of
these institutions. 

The failure of Washington Mutual in 2008 was the largest in U.S. banking
history. It was acquired by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM). The other major
acquirers of failed institutions since 2008 include Fifth Third Bancorp (Nasdaq:
FITB) and PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (NYSE: PNC).

&lt;p&gt; * Post-bottler acquisition structure outlined in memo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Coke North America to run marketing, franchise relations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * New unit under Cahillane to handle sales, pricing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHICAGO, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) North
America President Sandy Douglas will run marketing and brand
growth of the combined North American business when the
soft-drink maker closes its acquisition of bottler Coke
Enterprises' (CCE.N) assets in the region later this year,
according to a Coke internal memo obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Douglas will also be in charge of emerging brands, manageabout 70 U.S. bottlers, and lead research and development,
according to Coke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A unit called Coca-Cola Refreshments, run by Coke
Enterprises' North America head Steve Cahillane, will handle
sales, pricing and trade, customer care and other activities.
The restructuring was first reported by Beverage Digest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke's deal, announced in February and expected to close in
October, has Coke relinquishing its 34 percent, $3.2 billion
stake in CCE and assuming $8.9 billion in debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CCE will retain its European operations and buy Coke's
Norway and Sweden bottling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke announced its plan to buy CCE's North America business
following a similar deal between rival PepsiCo (PEP.N) and two
of its largest bottlers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke's shares closed 24 cents higher, up 0.4 percent, at
$56.12 on the New York Stock Exchange.

 (Adds emergence of Hong Kong's Li Ka-Shing as would-be
bidder)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Quentin Webb and Greg Roumeliotis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON/AMSTERDAM, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Li Ka-Shing has
emerged as one of the suitors for Britain's only high-speed
rail line, just weeks after the Hong Kong tycoon struck a $9
billion deal to buy the UK's biggest electricity distribution
network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With indicative bids due on Tuesday, Li's Cheung Kong
Infrastructure (CKI) (1038.HK) faced at least three rival
groups: a five-strong bidding group that included Goldman Sachs
and Eurotunnel, a team allied with Morgan Stanley, and a pair
of big Canadian pension funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fierce competition for High Speed 1, which has a
30-year concession to run the railway linking London and the
Channel Tunnel, is a boon for the British government, which is
selling the 109-kilometre (68-mile) line to help cut its budget
deficit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three people familiar with the matter said CKI was among
the groups interested in the line. CKI is 85 percent-owned by
Hutchison Whampoa Ltd (0013.HK), which Li chairs. CKI did not
immediately respond to an emailed request for comment outside
Hong Kong business hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On July 30, the Hong Kong billionaire struck a $9 billion
deal, using CKI and other vehicles, to buy Britain's biggest
electricity distribution network from French power giant EDF
(EDF.PA). [ID:nNN2925276]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HS1 also operates London's St. Pancras International
station and three others on the route, offering bidders the
chance to make unregulated returns through car parking,
advertising and leasing shop space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; High Speed 1 expects revenue of 263 million pounds and
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation
(EBITDA) of 135 million pounds for the year through March 2011,
according to a teaser sale document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People familiar with the matter have previously told
Reuters HS1 could fetch 1.5 billion pounds ($2.3 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EUROTUNNEL GROUP GROWS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the rival bidders, Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Groupe
Eurotunnel have expanded their team, dubbed GB Speedrail, a
consortium spokesman said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The group, already consisting of Eurotunnel (GETP.PA),
Goldman Sachs Infrastructure Partners and MG's Infracapital,
has been joined by two financial backers, Britain's
Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) and the infrastructure
arm of France's Caisse des Depots et Consignations (CDC), he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; USS, which looks after the retirement plans of British
academics, is the country's second-biggest funded pension
scheme. It had 28 billion pounds of assets under management at
the end of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CDC Infrastructure, established this year, holds minority
investments in new and existing infrastructure projects,
including a new high-speed link between Tours and Bordeaux. It
seeks to achieve a 1.5 billion euro portfolio within five

&lt;p&gt;Kroll`s Sam Anson Identified As Chevron Undercover Operative Running Illicit
Program
QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
Chevron CEO John Watson is again on the hot seat after the company`s growing spy
scandal in Ecuador was highlighted on a nationally-syndicated news program only
weeks after he ordered that five shareholders arrested at the company`s annual
meeting for challenging him over the company`s Ecuador contamination. 

Watson, who has long been accused of having a personal conflict of interest
because he oversaw the purchase of Texaco without properly vetting the company
for its $27 billion potential Ecuador liability, is being asked to explain how
his company became embroiled in a corporate espionage scandal involving an
American journalist, Mary Cuddehe. 

Watson has remained silent on the issue since the spy story, written by Cuddehe,
broke last week in The Atlantic. 

In the article and in an interview conducted yesterday with Democracy Now host
Amy Goodman, Cuddehe said she was offered $20,000 to lie about her identity and
gather information for the company under the false pretense of writing a story
about the Ecuador environmental trial. 

Directing investigators to lie about their identity is considered unethical and
potentially illegal under U.S. and Ecuadorian law. In 2006, Hewlett-Packard (HP)
Chairwoman Patricia Dunn was ousted over a similar undercover operation at HP
and later faced criminal charges. 

"It is apparent that Chevron, under Watson`s stewardship, has authorized an
illegal spy operation in Ecuador to undermine the rule of law and it has been
ongoing for at least several months," said Karen Hinton. "Mr. Watson needs to
explain how Chevron signed off on paying for this kind of outrageous misconduct
and disclose which journalists in Ecuador are on Chevron`s payroll." 

It appears Chevron hired Kroll, the world`s largest investigations firm, to
enlist journalists to spy on the plaintiffs in Ecuador, according to Cuddehe,
who first exposed the operation after a Kroll operative identified only as "Sam"
tried to recruit her. 

Cuddehe, an Iowa-born graduate of Columbia University with a degree in
journalism, documented that Kroll has been running an espionage operation in
Ecuador out of neighboring Colombia since at least February of this year. 

Cuddehe wrote in The Atlantic: "Last February, I got an offer from Kroll ... to
go undercover as a journalist-spy in the Ecuadorian Amazon. At first I thought I
was under qualified for the job. But as it turned out I was exactly what they
were looking for: a pawn." 

It turns out that "Sam" is none other than San Anson, a former American
freelance writer who currently heads Kroll`s Latin American operations out of
Miami. Anson has been outted in various blogs on the Internet. His LinkedIn
profile, which matches biographical elements referenced in Cuddehe`s story, was
quickly removed after her article appeared. 

Cuddehe indicated that numerous Kroll employees under Anson were working on the
Ecuador project from a base in neighboring Colombia. With headquarters in New
York, Kroll is considered the largest investigative firm in the world and is
publicly traded. 

"This is disturbing evidence of illicit conduct by Chevron and Kroll, possibly
subjecting Chevron's lawyers to sanctions in the U.S.," said Jonathan Abady, an
American lawyer who represents the plaintiffs. "It is hard to imagine Kroll
engaging in this conduct alone without oversight and direction from Chevron
executives and lawyers. Ultimately, the buck stops with Watson." 

Events described in Cuddehe's article fit with a larger pattern in recent years
of unethical and illegal activity by Chevron in Ecuador, where a trial that
started in 2003 quickly produced evidence that pointed to the company`s
culpability. Lawyers for the plaintiffs have been subjected to death threats and
other forms of intimidation, which in 2006 led the Organization of American
States to order Ecuador`s government to provide them police protection. 

Last year, the Amazonian communities accused Chevron of violating the U.S.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in Ecuador by engaging in a "sting" operation
where a bribe was offered to help remove the trial judge from the case. An
investigation determined that the "sting" operation and bribe offer was made by
a long-time Chevron employee, Diego Borja, who remains on the company`s payroll.


Watson was also under pressure over Ecuador in May of this year when, at his
first annual meeting as CEO, Chevron security officials ordered the arrests of
five proxy holders who had come to challenge him over the company`s human rights
record. 

Chevron has admitted that Texaco deliberately dumped more than 18 billion
gallons of toxic waste into the Amazon when it operated an oil concession from
1964 to 1990, leading to the decimation of indigenous groups and a dramatic
spike in cancer rates. The plaintiffs allege Texaco committed environmental
crimes in Ecuador for years and then tried to cover them up with a fraudulent
clean-up in the mid-1990s. 

Several Ecuadorian government officials and two Chevron lawyers who formerly
worked for Texaco, Ricardo Reis Veiga and Rodrigo Perez Pallares, are currently
under indictment in Ecuador for using a fraudulent laboratory test to induce a
legal release from the government. 

The U.S. law firms employed by Chevron to defend the Ecuador trial are Gibson
Dunn, King &amp; Spalding and Jones Day. One or more of the firms likely is
overseeing Kroll's work, said Abady.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Aug 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
For the second consecutive year, Davis Wright Tremaine LLP has been
selected as one of three recipients of Chevron's Law Firm Diversity
Award. Established in 2005, the award recognizes Chevron's law firm
partners that have distinguished themselves by demonstrating their
commitment to diversity.

    Chevron -- in recognition of Davis Wright's diversity efforts -- will
again make a $5,000 donation in the firm's name to Destination Law
School, a diversity pipeline program with the San Francisco Bar
Association (Destination Law School was also the recipient of the
donation in 2009 as a part of this award). In addition, the firm
announced they will match Chevron's donation of $5,000 to launch a
partnership with the Los Angeles Metro Debate League, a diversity
pipeline program in Los Angeles.

    "Davis Wright's commitment to these programs that help aspiring lawyers
from diverse backgrounds is to be commended," said Josetta Jones,
in-house counsel with Chevron Corporation and chair of the legal
department's Diversity Council. "The firm truly believes in extending
diversity as a core value beyond their walls and into the legal community
as a whole, and these pipeline programs are doing tremendous work."

    Long recognized as a global leader in supporting diversity and fostering
inclusion, Chevron has encouraged its business partners to join it in
promoting principles and practices that allow all individuals to reach
their full potential.

    "One of the things I know Chevron recognizes, and that we embrace as
well, is that you begin to make a difference with partnership and with
engagement," said Karen Russell, Davis Wright's manager of diversity
initiatives. "We partner with our clients and these organizations and our
attorneys actively participate in these programs. The financial
contributions are a part of it, but it's not just a check, and a
handshake, and 'We're done.' We like to follow the money. It's an
investment and a start of a commitment to getting involved."

    Chevron's donation last year to Destination Law School helped, among
other things, pay for 10 students to take bar review courses to help put
them on the path to becoming lawyers. But, as Davis Wright partner Salle
Yoo noted, the true difference came in the direct involvement with the
program and with the students.

    "Recently, Josetta and I spoke to the students about our experiences as
diverse, women attorneys working in different sectors in the law," said
Yoo. "Josetta spoke from the perspective of an in-house lawyer with a
major U.S. corporation and I talked about being a partner of a large Am
Law 100 firm.

    "After the discussion, one of the students approached me and said he was
surprised to see me as the partner from a law firm. You could see that it
made an impression on him and convinced him that opportunities exist in
the legal profession for minorities. These are the interactions that you
strive for, and it happened with the program in San Francisco, and I'm
excited to work with my colleagues who are getting involved with the
program in Los Angeles."

    By adding the program in Los Angeles, Davis Wright now has relationships
with pipeline programs or minority law student scholarship programs in
Northern California, Southern California, Oregon and Washington state.
The firm also provides mentoring and coaching programs for diverse
associates, including an innovative mentoring partnership program it
began last year with client Microsoft.

    "We appreciate the opportunity to partner with Chevron on diversity and
we're honored to receive this award," said Russell. "It reinforces the
importance of diversity and inclusion, and it motivates us to continue to
partner with our clients and the organizations who share that mission.
We're also excited to begin working with the Los Angles Metro Debate
League. These debate leagues in urban schools are creating a diverse
pipeline of talented high-school students who are interested in and
well-prepared for college, law school and legal careers."

solutions, is partnering with IBM to bring large modular, plug and play data
centers to market. Enterprise Modular Data Centers (EMDC) are large modular data
centers designed in smaller, standardized modules with the capability to plug in
additional capacity over time as needed, such as power and cooling. This
approach enables clients to bring new, highly scalable data centers online
three-to-six months sooner than a custom designed version. 

Panduit UPI-based solutions leverage an optimized physical infrastructure as the
foundation to enable convergence across communication, computing, control, power
and security systems. These end-to-end solutions drive operational and financial
advantages across the enterprise, allowing businesses to improve reliability,
reduce costs, heighten agility and support sustainability initiatives. 

Panduit shares IBM`s vision that data centers can be constructed in a flexible
way with the ability to scale on-demand and significantly reduce initial capital
and operating costs. By teaming with IBM on the EMDC initiative, Panduit is
helping enterprises deploy sustainable technology infrastructures that meet
evolving business requirements with a flexible and scalable on-demand data
center solution that defers up to 40 percent of the capital expense and 50
percent of the operational expense until capacity is required. 

"Panduit and IBM share a similar vision to help organizations optimize their
power, cooling, and space needs within the data center environment," said
Vineeth Ram, Panduit VP of Global Strategic Marketing. "By supporting IBM`s
family of data center solutions, such as EMDC, with our own UPI-based solutions
that optimize the physical infrastructure, together we can make that vision a
reality." 

"More than 60% of CIOs around the world are expecting significant change brought
by soaring data volumes, increasingly complex analyses and ever larger
populations of users," said Steven Sams, IBM VP of Global Site and Facilities
Services. "With today`s announcements IBM and partners like Panduit demonstrate
our ability to lead data center innovation to meet changing requirements with a
very flexible plug and play approach, allowing data center capabilities to be
added - and paid for - when and where they are needed." 

Solutions from Panduit`s complete line of High Speed Data Transport (HSDT)
products provided the LAN and SAN infrastructure for the EMDC. Panduit&#174;
QuickNet&#8482; pre-terminated fiber and copper solutions are an ideal fit for the
unique infrastructure requirements of enterprise data center solutions such as
IBM`s EMDC, where highly reliable and scalable cabling infrastructure must
support high density and mission-critical network applications. Providing up to
96 fiber and 48 copper connections in a single rack space, cassette-based
QuickNet assemblies maximize the use of valuable EMDC real estate while allowing
rapid, error-free installation to ensure the highest level of performance.
Panduit&#174; Net-Access&#8482; and new Net-SERV&#8482; cabinet systems house active and passive
IT assets and deliver energy efficiencies through shared thermal and cable
management concepts. When deployed as an integrated solution, Panduit HSDT and
cabinet systems for EMDC applications enable data center managers to optimize
airflow and reduce energy costs by 25% or more. 

"In addition to industry leading cabinet systems technology, Panduit brings the
unique capability to tightly integrate these cabinet systems with cabling, cable
management, pathways, active devices, and related accessories, helping customers
conserve valuable data center real estate while managing extreme heat loads and
optimizing power and cooling efficiencies," said Jack Tison, Panduit CTO.
"Working on the IBM EMDC initiative allows us to apply our high speed data
transport, integrated cabinet systems, and software expertise to optimize the
IBM platform and promote scalable, sustainable UPI-based data center design
practices for these critical applications." 

Panduit has established long-term collaborative relationships with global
industry leaders such as IBM to develop and integrate innovative, holistic
solutions for our customers. We continually invest in relationships and
resources for solving our customers` greatest business challenges. Customers and
partners can learn more about Panduit`s data center solutions at

OpenAmplify, the Semantic Web platform, today announced that Sanjay
Parthasarathy has joined its executive board. Parthasarathy brings over
two decades of experience to the OpenAmplify team, most recently serving
as corporate vice president of the Developer and Platform Evangelism

provider of semantic analysis for companies looking to enhance customer
engagement and improve monetization at scale.

    "Semantics is a must-have for any business looking to monetize their
social initiatives, but the problem today is that many businesses still
have no idea that semantics is their missing link," said Parthasarathy.
"With my background and expertise in growing innovative businesses, I
look forward to helping OpenAmplify execute on its social media and
social network monetization strategy. They certainly have what it takes
to become the leading semantic technology provider in the market."

president of the Developer and Platform Evangelism Group (responsible for
platform strategy and evangelism of the Microsoft platform to developers,
IT professionals, students, and partners), general manager of Worldwide
Customer Systems (helping make Microsoft's website one of the top five

Region. He originally joined the company in 1990 as a product manager in
the Window's multimedia group.

    "Sanjay's appointment is a strong endorsement for OpenAmplify," says Mark
Redgrave, OpenAmplify CEO. "Sanjay is a highly successful and passionate
professional with hands-on experience in everything from launching
start-ups to managing billion dollar P With new customers and

&lt;p&gt;  TORONTO, Aug 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Jatheon Technologies, a world leader in email archiving and management
solutions, today announced that Sceptre Investment Counsel Limited (TSX:
SZ), a leading Canadian independent investment management firm, has
selected Jatheon's email archiving solution to replace its current IBM
email archiving platform.

    After originally purchasing an IBM email archiving system, Sceptre was
forced to look for a replacement email archiving solution that was easier
to install and capable of meeting its demanding email communication and
eDiscovery requirements. After evaluating many different email archiving
options on the market, Sceptre selected Jatheon for its vast feature set,
ease of use, and fast turn-key deployment.

    "Jatheon was selected by Sceptre as the most suitable email system that
could meet our main email archiving objectives; simple to install, easy
to use, and cost effective. The rich feature set and intuitive interface
of the Jatheon appliance is far more superior to our old IBM system,"
said Randy MacFarland with Sceptre Investment Counsel Ltd. "The migration
of our data to the Jatheon system only took 20 minutes and we were up and
running. Locating a single email use to be time and resource intensive;
with Jatheon we can identify a single email using search criteria such as
keyword or phrase and retrieve it in seconds."

    "The selection by Sceptre Investment Counsel is a remarkable validation
of the value of Jatheon as a comprehensive email archiving solution for
eDiscovery, simplified user search, retention and retrieval of mission
critical data," said Kieron Dowling, President at Jatheon Technologies.
"We are pleased to be selected as the best of the archiving solutions
Sceptre evaluated and we look forward to working with them."

&lt;p&gt;RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
With the releases of Windows Vista and Windows 7, Microsoft made a decision that
left wireless device software developers scrambling. They decided to no longer
ship the HyperTerminal application with their operating systems. ClearConnex has
stepped in to fill the void with ClearTerminal, a free Windows compatible
download available at www.clearconnex.com/freedownload. 

ClearTerminal is a terminal application program focused on the needs of wireless
device developers. The free full-featured tool set is the type of terminal
application that used to ship with Microsoft operating systems. ClearTerminal
represents another example of how ClearConnex continues to find new ways to
simplify M2M device software development and speed time to market. 

ClearTerminal fills a void.

Ryan Rangel, CTO of ClearConnex, explains, "Without HyperTerminal, there are no
free downloads to provide the comprehensive tool set that`s necessary for M2M
device software development. Besides ClearTerminal, that is." 

Rangel believes there are many advantages to the HyperTerminal-like tool. "It`s
free, it`s user friendly and it has even more useful features for wireless
developers than the Microsoft Windows version of HyperTerminal ever did. You
can`t get all that with any other free terminal program." 

The future is bright. Right now looks great, too.

Rangel plans big things for future releases of ClearTerminal. "We`re going to
add manufacturing testing features and scripting for device regression testing
as well as integration with our ClearComm test server to help customers develop
with our ClearComm software device platform." 

ClearTerminal supports Microsoft Windows XP, Microsoft Windows Vista and
Microsoft Windows 7. You can download ClearTerminal for free at
www.clearconnex.com/freedownload.

&lt;p&gt;COLOGNE, Germany (Reuters) - Microsoft's motion-sensing game system Kinect will hit European retail stores before Christmas, the company said, as it battles for customers with rivals Sony and Nintendo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kinect, which enables the player to control games with the body, voice and hand gestures, will go on sale in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) from November 10, four days after its U.S. launch, the company said on Tuesday, a day ahead of Gamescom, Europe's largest video game trade show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman said Microsoft would sell the European version of Kinect for 149.99 euros ($192.1), compared with a retail price of $149.99 in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft hopes to steal customers from the rival Nintendo Wii and Sony Playstation 3 as all three big console makers struggle to breathe new life into the ailing console market.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI Aug 17 (Reuters) - Recent visa restrictionsimposed by the United States are not compatible with World TradeOrganisation (WTO) regulations, a senior Indian governmentofficial said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The U.S. Congress passed legislation on Thursday tostrengthen security along the border with Mexico, trying totackle the politically sensitive issue of illegal immigrantsahead of November congressional elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Indian government has protested to Washington againstwhat it called a highly discriminatory U.S. immigration bill thatwill double the cost of work visas for some high-profile Indiancompanies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Funds for the bill will be raised through visa fee hikes thatU.S. Senate aides say would affect India's Tata ConsultancyServices (TCS.BO), Infosys Technologies (INFY.BO), Wipro(WIPR.BO) and Mahindra Satyam SATY.BO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Yes, this is WTO incompatible. I have no doubt about it,"Trade Secretary Rahul Khullar said when asked whether the recentvisa restrictions were incompatible with WTO regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Indian Trade Minister Anand Sharma said that bill would costIndian companies an extra $200 million a year and erode thecompetitiveness of Indian companies that send professionals toundertake projects in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    However, analysts are sceptical about whether India can dragthe United States to the WTO on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We have a case against the US only if we can prove that thevisa restrictions were aimed specifically against India. So wehave to study the law and cannot immediately say it is not WTOcompliant," said an analyst with a Delhi-based think-tank dealingwith trade issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The analyst did not wish to be identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Khullar also said that the export outlook for India remainsuncertain for the next six months but there is no need to changethe 2011 export target as of now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    India's July exports were up more than 13 percent, Khullarsaid. He also told reporters that as of now India's currentaccount deficit is manageable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The deficit INCURA=ECI widened to $13 billion in theJanuary-March quarter, the biggest since 1981, compared to $12.2billion in October-December, official data showed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     (Reporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh, editing by Sugita Katyal)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((rajeshkumar.singh@thomsonreuters.com; +91-11-4178-1056;Reuters Messaging: rajeshkumar.singh.reuters.com@reuters.net))&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((If you have a query or comment on this story, send an email to news.feedback.asia@thomsonreuters.com))Keywords: INDIA ECONOMY/TRADESECRETARY &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2010.

&lt;p&gt;Kinect f&#252;r Xbox 360 bringt ab dem 10. November 2010 controllerfreie Unterhaltung
nach Europa
K&#214;LN, Deutschland--(Business Wire)--
Die Xbox wird in diesem Jahr f&#252;r ein neuartiges Unterhaltungserlebnis zuhause
und unterwegs sorgen, wenn Kinect f&#252;r Xbox 360 am 10. November in Europa, Nahost
und Afrika1 offiziell auf den Markt kommt und den Nutzern eine neue Welt von
controllerfreiem Spielspa&#223; und Xbox Live-Erfahrungen er&#246;ffnet. Dar&#252;ber hinaus
steht der Marktauftritt von Xbox LIVE und einer Reihe von Blockbuster-Spielen
f&#252;r Windows Phone 7 in der kommenden Weihnachtssaison an und Microsoft hat eine
neue Palette von LIVE-f&#228;higen Titeln f&#252;r den PC angek&#252;ndigt. 

Die europ&#228;ische Premiere von Kinect f&#252;r Xbox 360 findet auf der Gamescom 2010
statt und wird Millionen weitere Menschen mit der intuitiven Freiheit des
Spielens ohne Controller bekannt machen. Auf der Fachmesse werden neue Spiele
und Erfahrungen vorgestellt, welche den Besuchern die Tiefe und die Breite des
Startsortiments von &#252;ber 15 exklusiven Kinect-Titeln vor Augen f&#252;hren, darunter
nie zuvor gesehene Levels, neue Umgebungen, Aufgaben und Charaktere f&#252;r &#8222;Kinect
Sports", &#8222;Kinect Adventures", &#8222;Kinectimals" und &#8222;Kinect Joyride". Au&#223;erdem
werden MTV Games und Harmonix neue erstklassige Dancetracks f&#252;r das mit Spannung
erwartete &#8222;Dance Central" pr&#228;sentieren. 

Im Vorfeld der Messe sagte Chris Lewis, Vice President, Interactive
Entertainment Business, Microsoft Europe: &#8222;Wir bringen die Kinect-Erfahrung auf
der Gamescom zum ersten Mal nach Europa, denn sie ist die gr&#246;&#223;te Messe der
Region und da uns ihre kritische Rolle f&#252;r den globalen Erfolg der Xbox bewusst
ist, setzen wir unsere Investitionen in Europa entschlossen fort. Wenn Kinect am
10. November auf den Markt kommt, ist dies nicht nur ein Wendepunkt f&#252;r unser
Gesch&#228;ft sondern auch f&#252;r die Art und Weise, auf die Unterhaltungsangebote
genutzt werden. Sie selbst werden der Controller und k&#246;nnen entscheiden, wie Sie
und Ihre Freunde durch Unterhaltungs- und Spielerlebnisse navigieren. Wir sehen
bereits einen hohen Grad von Vorfreude in Europa, wo die Ums&#228;tze der
Kinect-bereiten Xbox 360 250GB den w&#246;chentlichen Marktanteil2 auf ein neues
Rekordniveau gehoben haben." 

&#8222;Dies ist au&#223;erdem das Jahr der Expansion f&#252;r die Xbox 360 im Hinblick auf neue
Publikumssegmente sowie neue M&#228;rkte f&#252;r Xbox LIVE und verschiedene Plattformen.
Mit Xbox LIVE auf Windows Phone 7 liefern wir den Gamern unterwegs die Qualit&#228;t,
die Best&#228;ndigkeit und die Community, welche die Xbox-Erfahrung auszeichnen. Mit
&#8218;Age of Empires Online`, &#8218;Fable III` und noch in der Entwicklung befindlichen
neuen Spielen bringen wir dar&#252;ber hinaus sozial vernetzte Spielerlebnisse zu
allen Publikumsgruppen am PC. Angesichts unserer diesj&#228;hrigen Neuerscheinungen
mit dem Zauber von Kinect und unserem Lineup von Blockbuster-Spielen, darunter
der gr&#246;&#223;te Titel des Jahres 2010: &#8218;Halo: Reach` sind wir zuversichtlich, dass
die Xbox 360 der gesamten Familie etwas zu bieten hat und die Spiel- und
Unterhaltungskonsole des Jahres 2010 und dar&#252;ber hinaus wird." 

Noch mehr Spa&#223; mit Kinect

Die neuen Kinect-Spielerfahrungen, die auf der Gamescom enth&#252;llt werden,
offenbaren eine noch nie zuvor gesehene Tiefe von controllerfreien Spielen, die
den gelegentlichen Nutzer wie auch Hardcore-Gamer stundenlang unterhalten wird.
Auf der Messe wird der Kart-Racing-Klassiker &#8222;Kinect Joy Ride" mit neuen Modi zu
sehen sein, welche das Spielerlebnis frisch und spannend halten, egal ob man es
allein oder zusammen mit Freunden spielt, sowie aufregende neue Abenteuer an
exotischen Orten auf der Jagd nach Sch&#228;tzen und Belohnungen in &#8222;Kinect
Adventures". Eine Reihe von s&#252;&#223;en neuen vierbeinigen Freunden, die Ihnen auf
einer Entdeckungsreise durch die Welt der &#8222;Kinectimals" zur Seite stehen und
drei neue Events in &#8222;Kinect Sports" welche die Familie garantiert vom Sofa
rei&#223;en, werden au&#223;erdem erstmals auf der Messe vorgestellt. 

Die Blockbuster werden gr&#246;&#223;er

Im Jahr 2010 sind alle Blockbuster auf der Xbox 360 erh&#228;ltlich und das
unfassbare Sortiment von Drittanbietern beweist erneut, dass die Xbox 360 die
beste Spieleplattform ist. Dazu geh&#246;ren die mit Spannung erwarteten Hit-Titel
&#8222;Halo:Reach" und &#8222;Fable III" mit erweitertem Funktionsumfang, die auf der
Gamescom zu sehen sein werden. 

Ein neues Zeitalter f&#252;r mobiles Gaming

Auf der Gamescom 2010 wird auch die erste Welle von Xbox LIVE-Spielen enth&#252;llt,
die in dieser Weihnachtssaison auf Windows Phone 7 erh&#228;ltlich sein werden. Im
Anschluss an die Pionierarbeit, die Microsoft mit der Xbox 360 geleistet hat,
wird das Handybetriebssystem Windows Phone 7 ein erstklassiges und immer gr&#246;&#223;er
werdendes Portfolio von Xbox LIVE-Titeln beherbergen, die von den kreativsten
K&#246;pfen in der Spieleentwicklung, wie den Microsoft Games Studios, geschaffen
wurden. Von Avatars zu Abenteuern, Freunden und noch viel mehr gibt Ihnen
Windows Phone 7 die Leistungsst&#228;rke von Xbox LIVE direkt in die Hand. 

Neuauftritt klassischer PC-Titel

Microsoft wird au&#223;erdem den neuesten Zugang zu seinen &#252;beraus erfolgreichen &#8222;Age
of Empires"-Titeln pr&#228;sentieren: &#8222;Age of Empires Online". Indem es modernste
Online-Funktionen mit dem klassischen Spielkonzept verbindet, wird &#8222;Age of
Empires Online" sowohl langj&#228;hrige Fans als auch Anf&#228;nger &#252;berzeugen, sowie
alle, die dazwischen liegen. Microsoft gibt auch die Entwicklung eines neuen
Spiels bekannt, das an die altbew&#228;hrte &#8222;Flight Simulator"-Marke ankn&#252;pft. Diese
neuen Titel von Microsoft Game Studios sowie das zuvor angek&#252;ndigte &#8222;Fable III"

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today announced that the next version of Office for the Mac will include a pair of key features that debuted in the Windows edition of Office 2010 earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Office for Mac 2011, which is slated for an October launch, will offer "Sparklines," cell-sized Excel charts, and in-app image editing tools, two features that first appeared in Office 2010, the more popular Windows edition that hit the retail market last May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft touted the new features as part of its attempt to boost compatibility between the Mac and Windows versions of the suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we've been able to do in Office for Mac 2011 is to bring a lot of power to bear to produce a professional-looking document that's still compatible with Office for Windows," said Kurt Schmucker, an evangelist with Microsoft's Mac team, in a video the group released Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sparklines, which Computerworld reviewer Preston Gralla called the "most useful" among the changes to Excel 2010 on Windows, lets users drop in bite-sized charts or graphs into individual cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft pitched Sparklines and improvements to Excel's PivotTables as compatibility wins for Mac users who need to share spreadsheet documents with co-workers running the Windows version of Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, Microsoft has made much of the debut of a ribbon-style interface in Office for Mac 2011, another feature borrowed from the Windows edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office for Mac 2011 will go on sale at the end of October; Microsoft has not yet set a definite date. however. Customers who purchase Office for Mac 2008 through Nov. 30 will be able to download a free copy of 2011 when it's available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;Despite Microsoft Office's still strong grip on the corporate world, there is a subtle shift at play: More companies are complementing Office with lower-cost and Web-based alternatives, according to a new report from Forrester Research. In other words, they're taking a mix and match instead of either/or approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office file formats from Google, Zoho and ThinkFree are improving, notes the report, called "The Next Wave of Office Productivity." Also, the transition to technologies such as mobile, cloud, social networking and collaboration presents an opportunity for IT departments to move parts of a workforce to cloud-based productivity tools, according to the report by Forrester analysts Sheri McLeish, Matthew Brown and Joseph Dang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a Forrester survey of 115 SMB and enterprise IT decision-makers, 57 percent see Office alternatives as "complementary apps provisioned alongside Microsoft Office" and 49 percent see them as "specialized apps provisioned to specific workforce segments to meet a business need."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our research shows that most information workers are not regularly creating content or using advanced features ... and that upwards of 75 percent of employees could get by with an alternative," writes McLeish in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether a company is willing to use Office alternatives such as Google Apps, OpenOffice.org, ThinkFree or Zoho Apps depends on their willingness to switch from a one-size-fits-all model, where a company uses enterprise-wide licensing to run Exchange, SharePoint and Office, to a fit-to-purpose model, where a company selects a mix of Office and Web apps based on user need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fit-to-purpose approach requires a deeper understanding of workforce needs, but can lead to significant savings by reducing license fees and vendor lock-in, writes McLeish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The big challenge often comes from users who may resist transitioning to a new tool. So it is important to understand your organization's culture, get senior-level buy-in, and develop a transition plan that ensures no disruption to business productivity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you fall into the fit-to-purpose camp, Forrester offers three best practices for mixing and matching with Microsoft Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use Web Apps to Reduce Storage Needs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you consider that most Office documents are largely static, then a wise approach is to let this content stay in its current form or convert to PDF for archiving and retrieval. With online apps available as a complement to Office, new content will then be created with the Web-based tools and the need to store and archive files will diminish over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many companies create a lot of Office documents and never get rid of them," says McLeish. "Using online apps for people who don't need the full Office suite will ultimately save on storage costs and improve search."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segment Your Workforce, Lower E-mail Costs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lowering e-mail costs is often a compelling reason for companies to move to online apps, says Forrester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand which users do not require the full features and functions of Office, particularly e-mail, firms need to segment their workforce, Forrester advises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A company can then provision these segments according to actual use and need for certain Office tools. In this scenario, it's important to fully evaluate the consequences of an information worker not having Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understand How Content Creation Is Changing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Office documents remain widely used, Forrester sees erosion from two sides. First, online "collaboration" tools for content generation such as wikis and blogs do not rely on Office docs. Two emerging examples here are Acrobat.com and IBM's LotusLive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the other end of the spectrum, writes McLeish, companies can now find specialized content management systems for areas like HR and customer communications that use authoring tools that look and feel like Microsoft Word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are more and more content creation tools that use e-forms or online documents," says McLeish. "This is more of long-term threat to Office, but it's an area for companies to consider when figuring out who needs Office and who doesn't."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shane O'Neill covers Microsoft, Windows, Operating Systems, Productivity Apps and Online Services for CIO.com.

well for future operating performance. 

Accordingly, we upgrade our long-term recommendation on FEMSA to Outperform from
Neutral as we anticipate it to perform well above the broader market. 

Bear of the Day: 

PetMed Express, Inc. (Nasdaq: PETS) reported first-quarter fiscal 2011 EPS of
$0.32, way below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.38 and the year-ago
quarter's $0.36. The company witnessed a decline in revenues due to a lack of
television remnant space availability at affordable rates. 

Moreover, both gross and operating margins declined during the quarter driven by
increase in higher product costs and higher advertising cost to acquire a new
customer. 

Economic uncertainty is taking a toll on the company, forcing consumers to
switch to cheaper alternatives. We do no expect the situation to improve
significantly in the near future. On account of these factors we have lowered
our estimates and downgraded the stock to Underperform.

&lt;p&gt;Social Media Center App Coming to Multiple Devices This Fall 
HONG KONG--(Business Wire)--
Today, Jon Niermann, former President of The Walt Disney Company Asia, and Liam
McCallum, former Director of Online Technology for Electronic Arts Asia,
announced the creation of a new entertainment software studio - QVIVO. With its
headquarters in Hong Kong, QVIVO will focus on building a social media center
app, allowing users to easily purchase, play and stream their movies, music and
more; all whilst interacting with their friends via Facebook. 

Leading the Asian Digital Distribution businesses for Electronic Arts, Liam
McCallum brings a deep understanding of digital entertainment. "We`re excited to
be at the forefront of the digital entertainment industry; not just enabling
users to purchase content online, but helping them build, organize and stream
their existing collections," explained McCallum, co-founder and Executive
Producer of QVIVO. "QVIVO will be a free download for the PC and Mac, and
extremely affordable for other entertainment and mobile devices. You can enjoy
the same experience and the same content no matter where you have a QVIVO app
running." 

With 14 years combined experience at EA, the duo`s knowledge of the gaming
industry will highly influence their new venture. "We`re bringing a lot of best
practices from the games industry," says McCallum. "We`re treating QVIVO like a
triple-a game. The simple user experience of a console game has been the driving
factor in our design. From the easy-to-use interface, the automatic retrieval of
artwork, trailers and more to the zero-setup streaming between devices running
QVIVO... everything just works." 

"We`ve experienced a tremendous shift from physical delivery of entertainment to
digital delivery, so offering a product that enables users to purchase, manage
and stream their digital collections across any device running a QVIVO app makes
a lot of sense," added Jon Niermann who is no stranger to the media industry.
Prior to Electronic Arts, Niermann led the Walt Disney Company as President for
Asia and recently formed FarWest Entertainment, a multi-platform content
production company. 

According to Niermann, QVIVO was designed to be social from the ground up.
"Enjoying media has always an incredibly social activity. We believe QVIVO will
transform the way people interact with their media and share their experiences
with friends."

&lt;p&gt; * Kosmos Energy says agreement has been terminated &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Kosmos says production targets for field on track&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Ghana's state oil co says still keen on stake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Adds Ghana government reaction, paragraphs 9-10)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Kwasi Kpodo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ACCRA, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Oil firm Kosmos Energy announced
on Wednesday it had cancelled a deal to sell its stakes in
Ghana's Jubilee oilfield to ExxonMobil (XOM.N), an accord that
met fierce resistance within the West African state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ghana National Petroleum Corp, the state oil company which
opposed the sale to the U.S. major, said it remained keen to up
its own holding in a field due to produce first oil later this
year and see output rise to 120,000 barrels per day by mid-2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will continue to work with our block partners and the
Government of Ghana to develop these resources," Kosmos Chief
Operating Officer Brian Maxted said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are very encouraged by our recent exploration results,
other discoveries we are appraising, and additional developments
being planned," he added in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kosmos Energy is the operator of the West Cape Three Points
Block in which it holds a 30.875 percent interest. The company
also holds an 18 percent interest in the Deepwater Tano block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our focus is to ensure that Kosmos is well-positioned
operationally and financially to fulfil its roles as operator of
the West Cape Three Points Block, technical operator for
development of the Jubilee Field, and partner in the Deepwater
Tano Block," Maxted added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kosmos, backed by private equity firms Warburg Pincus
[WP.UL] and Blackstone Group LP (BX.N), agreed last year to sell
its interests in the field to ExxonMobil for $4 billion, sources
close to the deal had said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UNNERVED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That enraged Ghanaian officials who alleged it breached a
confidential accord requiring partners in Jubilee to give Ghana
prior notice of any dealings with an interested third party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ghana's government said it welcomed Kosmos' decision to
abandon the sale, and added it hoped the company would obey the
country's rules if it chooses to stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The government is not forcing Kosmos to leave the field, so
if it decides to stay and improve its stake, so be it, as long
as they do it within the laws as provided in the petroleum
agreement," said Edward Bawa, an energy ministry spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The wrangle has unnerved some investors who fear it is a
sign of government interference in private sector dealings, but
the government of President John Atta Mills has said its main
priority is to ensure Ghanaians get the benefit of the oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GNPC said last month it had formally rejected a request by
Kosmos to sell its stake to ExxonMobil. Mills subsequently set
up a committee to consider a Kosmos request for approval that
was made directly to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The committee has since submitted its recommendation to
Mills and a source close to the committee said it had found that
the ExxonMobil deal would not be in the national interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GNPC welcomed the termination of the deal and reaffirmed its
desire to boost its holdings in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We welcome Kosmos to stay, its their right to stay as
rightful partners," GNPC spokesman Ntow Amoah said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He added: "We will always position ourselves to take
advantage of any opportunity to increase our stake, wherever
that opportunity exists."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ghana's prospects of becoming a major oil player were
enhanced last month when Britain's Tullow Oil (TLW.L) announced
it had found a new field off its coast with qualities similar to
that of Jubilee, of which it is also the operator.

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Foundation Program Matches Employee Donations 3:1

* More than $1.9 million donated to Auburn University, Tuskegee University and
the University of Alabama over the last ten years 
* Institutions encouraged to direct portion to science and math programs

MOBILE, Ala.--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil and its employees donated more than $429,000 to three Alabama
universities through the ExxonMobil Foundation`s 2009 Educational Matching Gift
Program. 

ExxonMobil employees and retirees contributed more than $109,000 to the three
institutions of higher education in 2009. The ExxonMobil Foundation matched
those donations with more than $320,000 in unrestricted educational grants. 

The ExxonMobil Educational Matching Gift Program is one of the most generous of
its kind in the United States. The program matches donations made to affiliated
higher education institutions by employees and retirees on a 3-to-1 basis. 

"These generous donations demonstrate the commitment of ExxonMobil Foundation,
ExxonMobil employees and retirees to institutions of higher education," said
Russ Spahr, ExxonMobil Mobile Bay Operations Superintendent. "These much needed
dollars will enable the three universities to enhance their educational programs
for the benefit of the students, the state and the country." 

In the last ten years, the three Alabama universities have received more than
$1.9 million through ExxonMobil Foundation`s Educational Matching Gift Program. 

ExxonMobil and the ExxonMobil Foundation fund math and science programs to
respond to the nation`s growing need to produce more engineers and scientists
and to develop more highly qualified math and science teachers. To aid this
effort, the Foundation encourages college and university presidents to direct a
portion of the matching funds to programs that provide math and science teachers
with professional development, attract more young people to teach math and
science and support science and engineering programs aimed at women and
minorities. 

In addition to the Educational Matching Gift Program, ExxonMobil develops and
supports other math and science programs aimed at students and teachers
including the National Math and Science Initiative, ExxonMobil Bernard Harris
Summer Science Camps, Mickelson ExxonMobil Teachers Academy and Introduce a Girl
to Engineering Day, among others. Significant emphasis is also placed on
increasing student involvement in the welfare of their communities through the
Community Summer Jobs Program and the Green Team. 

ExxonMobil has operated in Mobile, Alabama for over 20 years, producing natural
gas from deep beneath Mobile Bay. About 200 employees and contractors work at
these facilities that help meet the energy needs in Alabama and other states
along the eastern section of the United States. 

NOTES TO EDITORS

* Auburn University received approximately $209,690, Tuskegee University $62,625
and the University of Alabama $47,826 from the ExxonMobil Foundation. 
* Through the 2009 Educational Matching Gift Program, 911 U.S. institutions of
higher education collectively received more than $36.1 million from ExxonMobil,
its employees and retirees. 
* Since its inception in 1962, the program has provided $423 million to higher
education institutions in the United States. Each calendar year, eligible donors
may pledge up to $7,500 per year to colleges or universities with which they are
affiliated, the American Indian College Foundation, the Hispanic Scholarship
Foundation and the United Negro College Fund.

&lt;p&gt;Unified Contact Center for the Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2
platform. 
OTTAWA, Ontario--(Business Wire)--
prairieFyre Software today announced the general availability of the prairieFyre
Contact Center for Microsoft Communications Server, a modular, integrated
software suite that provides sophisticated multi-channel contact center
functionality for the Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2 platform.
Developed on the Voice-over-IP and Unified Communications architecture of Office
Communications Server 2007 R2, prairieFyre Contact Center is ideal for those
organizations that wish to leverage the advanced enterprise voice features of
the Microsoft unified communications platform and require a comprehensive
contact center solution. 

Microsoft Corp.`s unified communications (UC) applications enable real-time
collaboration and information flows by combining presence-aware telephony,
conferencing, messaging, and mobility functionality in an easy-to-use Microsoft
Office Communicator 2007 R2 interface. The prairieFyre Contact Center leverages
these capabilities and combines them with a full-featured Automatic Call
Distributor (ACD), enabling agents to provide superior customer service through
instant access to key subject matter experts, support teams, and business
intelligence across the enterprise. 

"prairieFyre expects Microsoft`s leadership in unified communications to be a
major factor in transforming the enterprise voice market. Our Contact Center,
with direct integration to Microsoft Exchange Server, Microsoft Active Directory
and Office Communications Server 2007 R2, provides an advanced, scalable
solution without the need for proprietary infrastructure and call control.
Customers will appreciate its ease of installation, short learning curve and
quality of management utilities," said Malcolm Teasdale, Executive Vice
President, prairieFyre Software. 

prairieFyre Agent Communicator combines an ACD soft phone, enterprise presence
and rich Microsoft Silverlight tabs with real-time contact center information in
a familiar Office Communicator 2007 R2 client. From Agent Communicator, agents
can login to queues and control their availability with user-defined reason
codes. Agent states are fully synchronized with the enterprise presence
capability of Office Communications Server 2007 R2. prairieFyre Agent
Communicator also supports the headsets and desktop sets "optimized for"
Microsoft Office Communicator. prairieFyre Contact Center automates management
reporting, forecasting and scheduling allowing supervisors to focus on their Key
Performance Indicators and continually improve operational effectiveness.
Reports can be run on-demand or scheduled to be automatically generated and
emailed at specific times. Supervisors can chose from 140 report templates or
use the Flexible Reporting module to create their own custom reports. Powerful
Forecasting and Scheduling modules allow supervisors to create and publish agent
shift schedules and ensure service levels are met through real-time adherence
alarms. All reports and schedules are rendered from the Microsoft SQL Server
database in preformatted Microsoft Excel or Adobe PDF formats. The suite is
designed to work on a single Microsoft server platform with Windows 7 on the
user desktop. 

"The prairieFyre Contact Center for Microsoft Communications Server represents a
dramatic departure from traditional contact center solutions," said B.J.
Haberkorn, senior product manager, of Communications Server at Microsoft Corp.
"It takes advantage of familiar Microsoft applications such as Outlook and
Communicator to lower agent training costs and uses existing customer
investments in Exchange and Communications Server to eliminate the need for
specialized hardware." 

With its broad functionality and modular design, prairieFyre Contact Center for
Microsoft Communication Server can be tailored to exactly fit businesses of any
size or industry in departmental, standalone, or geographically dispersed
deployments. 

prairieFyre Software has deployed contact center solutions to over 7,000
customers in over 60 countries worldwide. They have leveraged this experience to
create an affordable yet feature-rich solution that is ideal for enterprises
looking for a contact center designed to run with Office Communications Server

&lt;p&gt;PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) and the United States Government, acting
through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), today announced
that USAID will provide an initial contribution of $1 million to the Haiti Hope
Project, a public-private initiative that aims to develop a sustainable mango
industry in Haiti. 

In March 2010, The Coca-Cola Company launched the Haiti Hope Project with the
introduction of its Odwalla Haiti Hope Mango Lime-Aid, whose profits directly
support the Project. Total investment in the Haiti Hope Project now reaches $7.5
million, with $3.5 million from The Coca-Cola Company, $3 million from the
Inter-American Development Bank`s Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF) and $1
million from the United States Government. TechnoServe will be implementing the
Project on the ground. The Clinton Bush Haiti Fund recently announced that it
will contribute over $500,000 to support the formation and financing of mango
producer groups, nurseries and collection centers to benefit farmers. 

With more than 60 percent of the Haitian population deriving revenue from
agriculture, the Haiti Hope Project focuses on improving local mango farming
capacity, thereby helping to promote economic growth and sustainable
development. The Project aims to empower 25,000 Haitian farmers by doubling
their farm income. This initiative builds on a similar collaboration between The
Coca-Cola Company and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to improve mango and
passion fruit value chains in Kenya and Uganda. The goals of the Haiti Hope
Project are to contribute to the long-term development of Haiti by doubling farm
income and improving the standard of living of farmers and their families, with
a particular focus on women farmers. 

Muhtar Kent, Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company stated, "The Coca-Cola
Company and the U.S. Government, through the Department of State and USAID, have
worked successfully together on projects around the world that have made a
significant difference in communities. We welcome the opportunity to partner
with USAID in Haiti and to augment the sustainable agriculture work they already
are undertaking in the country. Together, we are committed to the long-term
economic development and revitalization of Haiti." 

The United States Government publicly announced their financial support of the
Project in coordination with the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission meeting held
on August 17 in Haiti. "Haiti`s agricultural sector is critical to the country`s
long-term economic growth. That`s why we are focusing so much of our
reconstruction efforts in this area," said USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah. "This
effort complements other public-private partnerships that we`ve launched in
Haiti since the earthquake to unlock innovative, locally-driven approaches to
meeting urgent development challenges. We are pleased to contribute $1 million
in USAID funding to this effort and look forward to working with our project
partners to maximize the benefits of this project and help sustainably advance
Haiti`s long-term recovery." 

"Empowering the people of Haiti and embracing their entrepreneurial spirit,
while working in alignment with the Government of Haiti`s priorities, will be
critical in helping Haiti build back better," said U.S. Ambassador to Haiti
Kenneth Merten. 

As the Project activities continue throughout the year, efforts will focus on
enabling mango farmers to organize into small groups to increase production and
improve supply linkages. Skill assessment and technical training will be
facilitated by experts on the ground in Haiti to help farmers diversify their
income and stabilize their revenues in the face of food insecurity.

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - Oil exploration and production company Kosmos Energy said its agreement with ExxonMobil (XOM.N) to sell its Ghana business has been terminated, frustrating Exxon's hopes of entering Ghana's offshore oil sector for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kosmos' deal to sell its stake in the Jubilee oilfield has faced objections from many quarters recently, including from Ghana National Petroleum Corp, the state oil company that wanted to buy the stake itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kosmos, backed by private equity firms Warburg Pincus WP.UL and Blackstone Group LP (BX.N), agreed last year to sell its interests in the field to ExxonMobil for $4 billion, sources close to the deal had said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil production from the Jubilee Field phase one development is on schedule to begin in the late fourth quarter and is expected to rise to 120,000 barrels of oil per day during the first half of 2011, Kosmos said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kosmos owns the field with UK-based oil explorer Tullow Oil (TLW.L) and Houston-based Anadarko Petroleum (APC.N). It put its interest in the field on the market last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anurag Kotoky in Bangalore; Editing by Hans Peters)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the second straight year Microsoft &#160;won't bother showcasing its primary virtualization technology at VMworld, because it believes the conference's sponsor and exhibitor agreement prevents vendors from demonstrating products that compete against VMware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft appears to be the only major vendor taking this stance, as even its partner Citrix has decided to step up its presence at VMworld and will showcase XenDesktop, which competes directly against VMware's desktop virtualization software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft: VMware customers are 'Windows customers first'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've got the biggest little booth at VMworld, is the way I'm thinking about it," says Microsoft spokesman Patrick O'Rourke, noting that Microsoft will be limited to a 10-by-10-foot booth on the show floor because it's not a member of VMware's partner program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft won't exhibit the Hyper-V virtualization software, it will demonstrate Windows Azure, because it says VMware does not operate a cloud platform that competes directly against the online application-building service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMware last year added language to its sponsor and exhibitor agreement that says: "Sponsors and exhibitors must market or demonstrate products on the exhibition floor and in the sessions which are complementary to VMware products and technologies." VMware claimed the language is standard in the industry and clarified that "competing vendors are allowed to exhibit, including exhibiting competing products."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft and Citrix last year both decided not to exhibit competing products, and did not sponsor the show because VMware required sponsors to join its Technology Alliance Partner Program. Citrix has softened its stance this time around and joined VMware's partner program, allowing it to sponsor VMworld and have a larger booth at the show, but Microsoft is not following suit. The latest VMworld will be in San Francisco from Aug. 30 to Sept. 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The contract says 'don't show competing products,'" O'Rourke says in explaining Microsoft's decision not to demonstrate Hyper-V at VMworld. "It's the same stuff as last year that was very well documented."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Microsoft will exhibit other products which it believes do not compete directly against VMware, and will discuss case studies regarding specific customers who have either switched from VMware to Microsoft or added Hyper-V to an existing VMware virtualization deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will show off Windows Azure, and a self-service portal toolkit that helps customers build private clouds (the product is known as System Center Virtual Machine Manager Self-Service Portal and will be generally available by the end of October).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Rourke says the private cloud building tool is complementary, rather than competitive, to VMware because it can work with the VMware ESX hypervisor. Microsoft will also show off a lab management feature in Visual Studio 2010 that can work both with Hyper-V and VMware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of Azure, O'Rourke says, "Windows Azure is not a competitive product since VMware does not have a public cloud offering like Azure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The week of VMworld is probably the biggest all year in terms of virtualization vendors issuing press releases for new products. Even Citrix, one of VMware's top rivals, unveils brand-new technology at VMworld, but Microsoft typically abstains. The Visual Studio lab management feature will become generally available the week of VMworld but it was already announced weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll be talking about that [at VMworld] because it's a complementary technology," O'Rourke says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stance is slightly changed from last year, when Microsoft said it would not showcase System Center Virtual Machine Manager "or any other products" at VMworld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Microsoft works with VMware on technical support for customers, and uses a VMware API to integrate management software with ESX, Microsoft has still not joined VMware's official partner program. "We considered it but haven't really found an opportunity that makes sense to do so," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, he says, because of Microsoft's other collaborations with VMware the company could still be considered an "ISV partner" to VMware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow Jon Brodkin on Twitter: www.twitter.com/jbrodkin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more about data center in Network World's Data Center section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;CHARLOTTE, N.C./NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp, the largest U.S. consumer bank, and Visa Inc, the world's largest payment processor, plan to begin a test program next month that lets customers use smartphones to pay for purchases in stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program, to run from September through the end of the year in the New York area, is the biggest step yet by the two companies toward creating a "digital wallet" with a host of financial capabilities built into the latest, most sophisticated mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major U.S. banks, technology companies and cellphone providers are jockeying for the lead in the technology, which some say could become a primary means of everyday purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa also plans to conduct a similar test program with US Bancorp this year, a company spokeswoman said. A US Bancorp spokeswoman confirmed that it would begin its pilot in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While mobile payments have been used for years in countries such as Japan, the United States has been much slower to adopt the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We see this as a critical capability given the increasing acceptance and adoption of bank services on the phone," Laurie Readhead, Bank of America's head of electronic commerce, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program will allow select New York-area employees and customers to install small chips, supplied by Visa and its technology vendors, in their smartphones that emit radio signals over very short distances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers would then "bump" their phones with point-of-sale devices in stores -- actually they need only wave the phones near the devices -- and their bank account data would be collected and their purchases completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America declined to say how many people would be involved in the pilot, and a company spokeswoman declined to comment on Visa's involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa spokeswoman Elvira Swanson said the Bank of America pilot was not larger than the company's other mobile trials, but she said it could have a more powerful impact on the market than some previous pilots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a way to accelerate mobile contactless payments in the U.S. market," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa said in February that it planned to start testing technology that would allow customers to make in-store payments using smartphones. At the time, Visa did not say which banks would conduct the tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competition is increasing from outside the banking world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verizon Wireless, ATT, T-Mobile USA and Discover Financial Services are working on forming a joint venture aimed at offering mobile payments services, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, which introduced mobile banking in 2007, has more than 5 million customers conducting $15 billion in transactions via their phones -- primarily bill payments and account transfers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The numbers are small compared with the bank's 29 million online banking customers, who conduct 1.5 billion transactions electronically, Readhead said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those services, bank executives said, will expand as sophisticated mobile phones, like Apple Inc's iPhone and Research In Motion Ltd's Blackberry, become increasingly common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second quarter, 42 percent of all consumer handsets sold were smartphones, up from 2 percent in the second quarter of 2009, according to NPD Group Inc, a market research firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America shares closed down on Thursday 2.25 percent on the New York Stock Exchange at $13.02. Visa closed down 1.7 percent at $71.63, but their shares rose slightly in aftermarket trading on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joe Rauch in Charlotte and Maria Aspan in New York; Additional reporting by Sinead Carew in New York; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co. is planning to sell a $484.6 million commercial mortgage-backed security backed by real estate owned by Centro Properties Group CNP.AX, according to a report on Thursday by Realpoint, a rating company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue is based on a single JPMorgan loan collateralized by 72 retail properties in 20 states, with tenants including The Kroger Co., Kmart, Burlington Coat Factory and Big Lots, Realpoint said. The borrower is Centro NP LLC, a unit of Centro Properties Group, a U.S. and Australian mall owner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CMBS issuance is accelerating slowly as the market recovers from the financial crisis. The market is an important source of credit for borrowers facing more than $1 trillion in maturing loans in coming years, but tight underwriting standards may keep many properties from qualifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Realpoint said the issue has a loan-to-value ratio of 78.7 percent, based on the "loan cut-off balance" and an aggregate property value of $616.3 million. Its debt service coverage ratio would be 1.64 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Al Yoon; Editing by Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

a record-breaking 36 million unique visitors in July, beating the previous

participation from guests, including Disney`s "U Rock" user-generated music
video promotion and the launch of the Create portal`s new Group Wall feature, an

pieces of art 
* Unique visitors in July represent a 16% increase from the prior month

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights: Union Pacific Corp (NYSE: UNP) as the Bull of
the Day and Walgreen Company (NYSE: WAG) as the Bear of the Day. In addition,
Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM),
General Motors (OTC: MTLQQ) and Toyota Motors` (NYSE: TM). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

We upgrade our recommendation for Union Pacific Corp (NYSE: UNP) to Outperform,
following its second quarter 2010 financial results, far ahead of the Zacks
Consensus Estimates. The company generated record profit. This excellent
performance was achieved through best-ever operating ratio, massive growth in
business volume, cost control, and pricing gains. 

An improving U.S. economy, massive surge in automotive shipments, and a sharp
rebound in many of the company's end markets are expected to fuel future growth
of Union Pacific. As the U.S. economy continues to grow gradually, demand for
carriage also becomes robust and the momentum is expected to sustain in the
long-run. 

According to our view, Union pacific is better insulated against economic
uncertainty as approximately 37.0% of its revenues are tied to less cyclical
freight like agriculture and coal. 

Bear of the Day: 

Walgreen Company (NYSE: WAG) posted third quarter fiscal 2010 earnings per share
of $0.47, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.57 and year-ago
quarter's $0.53. Walgreen's strategy of store expansion coupled with operating
acumen has made the company a leader in the retail drug store industry. 

However, we are concerned about the competitive pressures faced by the company
due to prescription reimbursement issues and slow introduction of new generic
products. Moreover, our apprehensions are further bolstered by factors like
higher SG expenses, a shift towards the low-margin pharmacy business as well
as gross margins reflecting a downward trend. 

Based on these factors, we have lowered our estimates for fiscal 2011 and
downgrade the stock to Underperform with a target price of $26.00.

Chase Bank Hires 200 in San Antonio

According to a report from the San Antonio Business Journal, Chase Bank, the
principal banking subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM), recruited 200
employees in San Antonio at a job fair on Tuesday. 

At the job fair, Chase appointed employees to the departments of claims,
collections and other customer-support for the Chase Operations Center located
at 20855 Stone Oak Parkway. 

GM Recalls 250,000 Crossovers

General Motors (OTC: MTLQQ) plans to recall about 250,000 crossover globally in
order to inspect and fix their second-row seat belts. The recall involves
2009-2010 models of the Chevrolet Traverse, Buick Enclave, GMC Acadia and Saturn
Outlook. These vehicles are sold in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and elsewhere. 

The automaker noticed that there are chances of the seat-belt buckle getting
damaged when the seats are pushed back to their normal position. As a result,
this could cause the buckle to appear to be latched when it isn`t. However, GM
is unaware of any cases where the second-row seat belts failed to perform
correctly in a crash. 

Since the beginning of the year, GM has recalled about 3 million vehicles in the
U.S., Canada, Mexico and South Korea. Among these, the largest recall was made
in June, involving 1.5 million vehicles. This was done in order to fix a problem
with a heated windshield wiper fluid system that has been causing fire in the
vehicles. 

The June recall affected 2006 to 2009 model years of Buick Lucerne, Cadillac
DTS, and Hummer H2; 2008-2009 Buick Enclave and Cadillac CTS; 2007-2009 Cadillac
Escalade, Escalade ESV and Escalade EXT; 2007-2009 Chevrolet Avalanche,
Silverado, Suburban and Tahoe; 2007-2009 GMC Acadia, Sierra, Yukon and Yukon XL;
2007-2009 Saturn Outlook; and 2009 Chevrolet Traverse. 

This is GM`s second recall over the same issue in two years. In August 2008, the
automaker recalled 900,000 vehicles due to a heated washer fluid system on the
back of a short circuit on the circuit board that overheated the ground wire in
the vehicles. 

Automotive safety recalls have become the talk of the town after Toyota Motors`
(NYSE: TM) announcement of the largest-ever global recall of more than 8.5
million vehicles since October last year. The Japanese automaker`s recall was
related to problems such as faulty accelerator gas pedals and slipping floor
mats as well as defective braking systems.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Aug 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Intermedia, the world's largest Microsoft Exchange hosting provider,
today made Microsoft Outlook 2010 and SharePoint 2010 available in over

collaboration platform widely used for company and team-wide document
management.

    Both products are available from Intermedia as part of its ecosystem of
business communication offerings, including hosted Exchange 2010, hosted
PBX, mobility, secure instant messaging and more. 

    Customers manage hosted Outlook 2010 and SharePoint 2010, as well as
their other Intermedia hosted solutions, through Intermedia's proprietary
HostPilot(R) Control Panel. Intermedia enables these organizations to
move to the cloud at their own pace with a proprietary tool to
synchronize user passwords across hosted applications and those that
remain on-premise.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N) has sued French investment bank Natixis (CNAT.PA) in London's High Court over three credit derivative transactions, Natixis's law firm, Stephenson Harwood, said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dispute centers around whether French investment bank Natixis can cancel a deal on three credit default swaps with Goldman, which is claiming damages for breach of contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman said on Thursday it had no comment to make on the situation, while Stephenson Harwood said Natixis would defend itself vigorously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are preparing our defense. We are surprised that Goldman is suing us," a spokesman for Stephenson Harwood said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natixis is the investment banking arm of BPCE, France's second-biggest retail bank which owns over 70 percent of Natixis's share capital. Earlier this month, Natixis posted a forecast-beating second-quarter profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natixis shares were up 0.3 percent at 4.39 euros in mid-morning trade, well below the 19.55 euros price at which Natixis listed on the Paris bourse in December 2006 but up around 23 percent since the start of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shares closed at $149.20 on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Dan Lalor)&lt;/p&gt;

comment to make on the situation, while Stephenson Harwood said
Natixis would defend itself vigorously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are preparing our defence. We are surprised that Goldman
is suing us," a spokesman for Stephenson Harwood said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Natixis is the investment banking arm of BPCE, France's
second-biggest retail bank which owns over 70 percent of
Natixis's share capital. Earlier this month, Natixis posted a
forecast-beating second-quarter profit. [ID:nLDE6741A3]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Natixis shares were up 0.3 percent at 4.39 euros in
mid-morning trade, well below the 19.55 euros price at which
Natixis listed on the Paris bourse in December 2006 but up
around 23 percent since the start of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs shares closed at $149.20 on Wednesday.

&lt;p&gt; Shares in Adecco (ADEN.VX) drop 2 percent as Goldman Sachs
downgrades the world's largest staffing company to "sell" from
"neutral", and adds the firm to its pan-European conviction sell
list, citing risks to the firm's top-line growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In a review of the staffing sector, the broker says top-line
growth at both Adecco and Dutch staffing firm Randstad (RAND.AS)
could plateau this quarter as suggested by recent temp numbers
in the U.S. and France and by Adecco's second-quarter exit rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Furthermore, 2011 forecasts could come under pressure from
lower economic growth," Goldman Sachs analysts write in a note. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The broker cuts Adecco's price target to 45 Swiss francs
from 58.8, and lowers Randstad's price target to 31 euros from
33 euros with a "sell" rating on the stock. Randstad adds 0.4
percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The broker upgrades its recommendation to "buy" from
"neutral" for Hays (HAYS.L) and Robert Walters (RWA.L) and to
"buy" from "sell" for Michael Page (MPI.L) as it expects the
firms to benefit from late cycle improvement in specialist
staffing markets and from their developing market exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Page rises 4.3 percent, Hays adds 2.8 percent and
Robert Walters is up 1.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters Messaging rm://harpreet.bhal.reuters.com@reuters.net&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offering aid to quality assurance labs, Microsoft this week began offering Visual Studio Lab Management for Visual Studio 2010 users, enabling automation of the build-deploy-test process for software development while maintaining visibility into the process itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing a quality assurance lab can be challenging, said S. Somasegar, senior vice president of the Microsoft Developer Division, in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Get the scoop on Visual Studio 2010 in the InfoWorld Test Center review. | Keep up with app dev issues and trends with InfoWorld's Fatal Exception blog and Developer Central newsletter. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A dizzying number of machines need to be set up, torn down, or restored to a particular snapshot so the software team can work at maximum efficiency. Daily builds need to be available on schedule. Multiple virtual machine environments need to be managed. Managing a lab efficiently can be a significant task," Somasegar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visual Studio Lab Management leverages Microsoft Hyper-V virtualization, enabling an integrated Hyper-V-based test lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Getting an environment configured correctly just to reproduce a bug can take significant time and effort," Somasegar said. "Lab Management allows testers to provide a link to a virtual machine snapshot directly in a bug report so developers can see exactly what testers see. Developers can spend more time debugging and less time installing, configuring, and deploying."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users can store, manage, and deploy to known configurations and test environments using Microsoft's System Center Virtual Machine Manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A preconfigured VHD (Virtual Hard Disk) of Visual Studio 2010 Lab Management is available at Microsoft's website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visual Studio Lab Management is offered for MSDN-based customers of Visual Studio Test Professional 2010 and Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article, "Microsoft Visual Studio users get lab management," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

interested in the Polish energy market and was in contention to
take Enea (ENEA.ST), Poland's third-largest electricity provider.

&lt;p&gt;   (Adds comment from Gilead 3rd paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Aug 22 (Reuters) - An extract of the kudzu vine

addiction, researchers at Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) reported
on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tests on rats showed the drug could stop them from giving

aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 inhibitor or ALDH2i. It carries the

&lt;p&gt;Access to various Microsoft hosted software products for businesses in North America was affected due to a performance issue with its data center in the region on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem lasted more than two hours, between 8:30 a.m. and 10:45 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time, and impacted "some customers in North America" who experienced "intermittent access to our data center," Microsoft said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The outage was caused by a network issue that is now fully resolved, and service has returned to normal. During the duration of the issue, customers were updated regularly via our normal communication channels. We sincerely apologize to our customers for any inconvenience this incident may have caused them," reads the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier, Microsoft alerted potentially affected customers with a notice distributed via a syndicated feed, which stated that customers could experience "timeouts" with a number of hosted services, including Business Productivity Online Suite (BPOS), Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, Office Live Meeting and Office Communications Online. Also among the services impacted were the Administration Center, Sign-In application, My Company Portal and Customer Portal of Microsoft Online Services, according to the alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are investigating a performance issue which may impact connectivity to the North American data center. Users may experience timeouts with multiple services," the notice read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problems didn't go unnoticed among users, some of whom commented about the situation in the official Microsoft Online Services discussion forums. Some of those posting on the forums complained about other recent outages and performance problems, as well as about sluggish communication about the issues from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BPOS Standard software suite is intended for enterprise collaboration and communication and is hosted by Microsoft and sold with partners. It includes Exchange Online, Office SharePoint Online, Office Communications Online and Office Live Meeting, all of which come with a 99.9 percent uptime guarantee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As more companies consider and implement "cloud" software hosted in vendor premises and accessed via the Internet, the issue of the performance, availability and reliability of these applications remains a concern. This is primarily because IT departments have little or no control whenever this type of vendor-hosted software becomes partially or completely unavailable due to slowdowns or outages in external data centers. With their hands tied, IT departments must still field complaints from their frustrated users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the downsides, the popularity of cloud software continues to rise, because it allows IT departments to hand over to vendors the often tedious work of maintaining and troubleshooting the software, and lets companies cut down on hardware costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAGO AGRIO, Ecuador (Reuters) - A run-down court building that also houses the local casino in this Amazon jungle town is the unlikely venue for the largest environmental damages lawsuit ever tried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first floor, people play for pennies in The Mirage bingo and slot machine parlor. Three stories up, in Sucumbios provincial court, the stakes are $27 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's what local farmers and indigenous tribes want from U.S. oil giant Chevron Corp (CVX.N) to fund cleanup of areas they say were polluted with faulty drilling practices in the 1970s and '80s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paint is cracked and peeling in the judge's fourth-storey offices overlooking Lago Agrio, a poor and violent northern Ecuador town near the Colombian border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power failures often stop the building's air conditioners, leaving gamblers and court officials to swelter as judge Leonardo Ordonez pours through thousands of pages of evidence. He says a verdict could be reached in 2011 after 18 years of litigation in U.S. and Ecuadorean courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the ruling looms, each side accuses the other of presenting fraudulent evidence while a slew of related legal actions are played out in the United States and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors and the petroleum industry are watching to see if Chevron will have to pay massive damages, setting a precedent that could fuel other big lawsuits against oil companies accused of polluting countries around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecuador's President Rafael Correa has sided publicly with the plaintiffs. Both sides expect Ordonez to rule against Chevron. The company -- charging government interference in the case -- vows to appeal any adverse decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs say Texaco wrecked wide areas of Ecuador's jungle by dumping drilling waste into unlined pits and leaving them to fester, an accusation that the company denies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron inherited the case when it bought Texaco in 2001. It says the company cleaned up all pits it was responsible for before turning them over to Ecuador's state-owned oil firm, Petroecuador, which still operates around Lago Agrio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If there is pollution in this area, it is the sole responsibility of the state, which in 1998 released Texaco of further liability," said Chevron spokesman James Craig, pointing toward one of the waste pools cleaned up by Texaco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texaco built and operated more than 330 wells in Ecuador, all of which had at least one reserve pool nearby. The dirt just under the surface of some former waste pits still has a black sheen and carries the eye-watering stench of oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit names 46 people who claim to represent all area residents who may have suffered from contamination. They are not seeking individual awards but money to fund environment cleanup, as well as health and clean water projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want the money to go toward a permanent solution," said Carmen Perez, whose small corn farm is near a series of drilling waste pits that still smell of petroleum and, she says, cause her to have chronic headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMAZON CHERNOBYL?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say the case could have wide implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Chevron loses this case, it could set a precedent for similar cases in other countries against not only Chevron but other international oil companies" said Fadel Gheit, managing direct of oil and gas research at Oppenheimer  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It could open the floodgates for similar claims, starting in Nigeria where Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) is being blamed for environmental damage," he said from his office in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ecuador legal saga began in 1993 when a suit was filed against Texaco in a U.S. federal court. The case was tossed out on appeal in 2002 on condition that Texaco agree to Ecuadorean jurisdiction if sued there. A suit was filed in Lago Agrio the next year, this time against Texaco's new owner Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 200,000 pages of documents and 64,000 chemical samples are in evidence while the intrigues of the case have come to resemble something from a Hollywood suspense drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A previous judge stepped down from hearing the suit last year after he was recorded discussing the case with a couple of shadowy figures who secretly video-taped him with cameras stuck inside a wristwatch and a pen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the two men who taped the meeting, a former Chevron contractor, was whisked out of Ecuador by the company. The plaintiffs say the secret taping was an attempt by Chevron to delay judgment, a charge the company denies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cottage industry has meanwhile sprung up around the case, with plaintiffs providing reporters with thick folders full of information pointing the finger at Texaco/Chevron for what they call the "Chernobyl of the Amazon". They offer excursions to Ecuador's northern jungles known as "the toxic tour".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron also arranges trips for journalists, dubbed "the non-toxic tour", showing pits that were cleaned up by Texaco. The company offers slickly-produced desk guides describing the suit as based on false claims driven by lawyers motivated more by greed than concern for the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the environment is certainly the top worry for farmer Jose Briceno, who lives near Lago Agrio and says he can't keep livestock because it gets sick and dies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The problem now is water quality," he said, looking over his empty farmyard. "They never really cleaned up this area."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Kieran Murray)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAGO AGRIO, Ecuador (Reuters) - U.S.-based Chevron Corp (CVX.N) faces a $27 billion environmental damages lawsuit in Ecuador, a case that has already dragged on for years and could last many more if it gets bogged down in appeals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount in requested damages, assessed by an Ecuadorean court appointee, makes it the biggest case of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An initial decision is expected in the months ahead, though there is no fixed timetable for a ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the judge hearing the suit in the provincial court of Sucumbios rules against Chevron, the company vows to appeal rather than pay out what would be an unprecedented award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors and the world petroleum industry are watching the case closely to see what precedent could be set for other mega-lawsuits against oil companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some facts on the case:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE ACCUSATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents of Ecuador's Amazon region say that Texaco, which was bought by Chevron in 2001, wrecked wide areas of the jungle with faulty drilling practices in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say the company also dumped contaminated water in the area, creating a health hazard. Rather than cleaning up oil waste pits, plaintiffs say the company left them open or simply spread dirt on top of the areas, allowing contamination to seep into the ground and ruin the local water supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Rafael Correa, who has a troubled relationship with foreign investors, has said he hopes the plaintiffs win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE DEFENSE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron denies the accusations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It says that Texaco did not pollute the jungle and that it properly cleaned up all the pits that it was responsible for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is any pollution in the area, the company says it is the responsibility of the Ecuadorean state, which in 1998 released Texaco of liability, a legal point disputed by the plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HISTORY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texaco first struck oil in Ecuador in 1967 and started pumping in 1972 as part of a consortium with the state. The company operated in Ecuador until 1990. Soon after, it turned its share of the consortium over to the Ecuadorean government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State oil company Petroecuador has continued drilling in the area over the last 20 years since Texaco pulled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legal saga began in 1993 when a suit was filed against Texaco in a U.S. federal court.

&lt;p&gt;LAGO AGRIO, Ecuador Aug 24 (Reuters) - U.S.-based Chevron
Corp (CVX.N) faces a $27 billion environmental damages lawsuit
in Ecuador, a case that has already dragged on for years and
could last many more if it gets bogged down in appeals.
[ID:nN23244474]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The amount in requested damages, assessed by an Ecuadorean
court appointee, makes it the biggest case of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An initial decision is expected in the months ahead, though
there is no fixed timetable for a ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the judge hearing the suit in the provincial court of
Sucumbios rules against Chevron, the company vows to appeal
rather than pay out what would be an unprecedented award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors and the world petroleum industry are watching the
case closely to see what precedent could be set for other
mega-lawsuits against oil companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here are some facts on the case:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE ACCUSATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Residents of Ecuador's Amazon region say that Texaco, which
was bought by Chevron in 2001, wrecked wide areas of the jungle
with faulty drilling practices in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They say the company also dumped contaminated water in the
area, creating a health hazard. Rather than cleaning up oil
waste pits, plaintiffs say the company left them open or simply
spread dirt on top of the areas, allowing contamination to seep
into the ground and ruin the local water supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; President Rafael Correa, who has a troubled relationship
with foreign investors, has said he hopes the plaintiffs win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE DEFENSE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron denies the accusations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It says that Texaco did not pollute the jungle and that it
properly cleaned up all the pits that it was responsible for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If there is any pollution in the area, the company says it
is the responsibility of the Ecuadorean state, which in 1998
released Texaco of liability, a legal point disputed by the
plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HISTORY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Texaco first struck oil in Ecuador in 1967 and started
pumping in 1972 as part of a consortium with the state. The
company operated in Ecuador until 1990. Soon after, it turned
its share of the consortium over to the Ecuadorean government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; State oil company Petroecuador has continued drilling in
the area over the last 20 years since Texaco pulled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The legal saga began in 1993 when a suit was filed against
Texaco in a U.S. federal court. The case was tossed out on
appeal in 2002 on condition that Texaco agree to Ecuadorean
jurisdiction if sued there. A suit was filed in Lago Agrio the
next year, this time against new owner Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case has been filled with intrigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A previous judge stepped down from hearing the suit last
year after he was recorded discussing the case with a couple of
shadowy figures who video-taped him with secret cameras stuck
inside a wristwatch and a pen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the men who taped the meeting, a former Chevron
contractor, was whisked out of Ecuador by the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GOING FORWARD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the judge rules against the company -- as is widely
expected in political, diplomatic and industry circles -- the
first level of appeal available to Chevron would be the full
provincial court in Sucumbios province, which has three judges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If that panel upholds the ruling, Chevron's next stop would
be Ecuador's Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron says Correa has interfered in the case by publicly
siding with the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs say Correa has done
nothing more than U.S. President Barack Obama has done to
defend victims of the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also says it has been robbed of its right to a
fair trial in part by Ecuadorean geologist Richard Cabrera, a
court-appointed expert who came up with the $27 billion damages
figure. Chevron says he colluded with the plaintiffs' lawyers
and technical consultants to develop a fraudulent assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plaintiffs say that Texaco and Chevron submitted
fraudulent testing samples to U.S. and Ecuadorean courts, and
that the company's criticism of Cabrera is an attempt to
distract attention from its own misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's complaints could end up before Ecuador's
Constitutional Court as part of the appeals process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plaintiffs would meanwhile likely seek enforcement by
going to courts around the world where Chevron has seizable
assets in a bid to collect damages, widening the legal battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MULTIPLE CASES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case in Lago Agrio has spawned an array of legal
actions in the United States and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron last year filed an arbitration complaint in The
Hague saying that Ecuador violated an investment treaty through
government interference in the case. The complaint also says
Ecuador failed to live up to contracts signed with Texaco
Petroleum to clean up its share of oil-impacted areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron this year filed nine petitions in federal courts
across the United States in which it claims it has discovered
evidence of misconduct and fraud by the plaintiffs' lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Attorneys for the plaintiffs dismiss the allegation,
charging that Chevron is "forum shopping" and wants to distract
attention from evidence against it of illegal contamination.

&lt;p&gt; * Amazon court widely expected to rule against Chevron

 * Company vows to appeal, case could drag for years

 * Chevron says Ecuador gov't responsible for any pollution

 By Hugh Bronstein

 LAGO AGRIO, Ecuador, Aug 24 (Reuters) - A run-down court
building that also houses the local casino in this Amazon
jungle town is the unlikely venue for the largest environmental
damages lawsuit ever tried.

 On the first floor, people play for pennies in The Mirage
bingo and slot machine parlor. Three stories up, in Sucumbios
provincial court, the stakes are $27 billion.

 That's what local farmers and indigenous tribes want from
U.S. oil giant Chevron Corp (CVX.N) to fund cleanup of areas
they say were polluted with faulty drilling practices in the
1970s and '80s.

 The paint is cracked and peeling in the judge's
fourth-storey offices overlooking Lago Agrio, a poor and
violent northern Ecuador town near the Colombian border.

 Power failures often stop the building's air conditioners,
leaving gamblers and court officials to swelter as judge
Leonardo Ordonez pours through thousands of pages of evidence.
He says a verdict could be reached in 2011 after 18 years of
litigation in U.S. and Ecuadorean courts. [ID:nN30196631]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 As the ruling looms, each side accuses the other of
presenting fraudulent evidence while a slew of related legal
actions are played out in the United States and Europe.
[ID:nN05169269]

 Investors and the petroleum industry are watching to see if
Chevron will have to pay massive damages, setting a precedent
that could fuel other big lawsuits against oil companies
accused of polluting countries around the world.

 Ecuador's President Rafael Correa has sided publicly with
the plaintiffs. Both sides expect Ordonez to rule against
Chevron. The company -- charging government interference in the
case -- vows to appeal any adverse decision.

 Plaintiffs say Texaco wrecked wide areas of Ecuador's
jungle by dumping drilling waste into unlined pits and leaving
them to fester, an accusation that the company denies.

 Chevron inherited the case when it bought Texaco in 2001.
It says the company cleaned up all pits it was responsible for
before turning them over to Ecuador's state-owned oil firm,
Petroecuador, which still operates around Lago Agrio.

 "If there is pollution in this area, it is the sole
responsibility of the state, which in 1998 released Texaco of
further liability," said Chevron spokesman James Craig,
pointing toward one of the waste pools cleaned up by Texaco.

 Texaco built and operated more than 330 wells in Ecuador,
all of which had at least one reserve pool nearby. The dirt
just under the surface of some former waste pits still has a
black sheen and carries the eye-watering stench of oil.

 The suit names 46 people who claim to represent all area
residents who may have suffered from contamination. They are
not seeking individual awards but money to fund environment
cleanup, as well as health and clean water projects.

 "We want the money to go toward a permanent solution," said
Carmen Perez, whose small corn farm is near a series of
drilling waste pits that still smell of petroleum and, she
says, cause her to have chronic headaches.

 AMAZON CHERNOBYL?

 Analysts say the case could have wide implications.

 "If Chevron loses this case, it could set a precedent for
similar cases in other countries against not only Chevron but
other international oil companies" said Fadel Gheit, managing
direct of oil and gas research at Oppenheimer  Co.

 "It could open the floodgates for similar claims, starting
in Nigeria where Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) is being blamed for
environmental damage," he said from his office in New York.

 The Ecuador legal saga began in 1993 when a suit was filed
against Texaco in a U.S. federal court. The case was tossed out
on appeal in 2002 on condition that Texaco agree to Ecuadorean
jurisdiction if sued there. A suit was filed in Lago Agrio the
next year, this time against Texaco's new owner Chevron.

 About 200,000 pages of documents and 64,000 chemical
samples are in evidence while the intrigues of the case have
come to resemble something from a Hollywood suspense drama.

 A previous judge stepped down from hearing the suit last
year after he was recorded discussing the case with a couple of
shadowy figures who secretly video-taped him with cameras stuck
inside a wristwatch and a pen.

 One of the two men who taped the meeting, a former Chevron
contractor, was whisked out of Ecuador by the company. The
plaintiffs say the secret taping was an attempt by Chevron to
delay judgment, a charge the company denies.

 A cottage industry has meanwhile sprung up around the case,
with plaintiffs providing reporters with thick folders full of
information pointing the finger at Texaco/Chevron for what they
call the "Chernobyl of the Amazon". They offer excursions to
Ecuador's northern jungles known as "the toxic tour".

 Chevron also arranges trips for journalists, dubbed "the
non-toxic tour", showing pits that were cleaned up by Texaco.
The company offers slickly-produced desk guides describing the
suit as based on false claims driven by lawyers motivated more
by greed than concern for the environment.

 But the environment is certainly the top worry for farmer
Jose Briceno, who lives near Lago Agrio and says he can't keep
livestock because it gets sick and dies.

 "The problem now is water quality," he said, looking over
his empty farmyard. "They never really cleaned up this area."

history, with over $1.3 billion in revenue representing more than 20 percent
growth over the past year. The SharePoint Best Practices Conference gives over
500 business and IT professionals access to leading experts who will share
insights into avoiding pitfalls, cutting costs and gaining a competitive edge
with SharePoint. 

In "Real World SharePoint: Case Study From the Trenches" (Tuesday, August 24 at
3 pm, Room Regency A), Miller will facilitate a discussion on what can be done
with SharePoint when business users think outside the box. Miller will present a
range of solutions built by typical business users, including a SharePoint

SharePoint, but also exposes external videos while appearing to remain within
the SharePoint interface. 

"Best Practices for Building a Community in SharePoint" (Wednesday, August 25 at
4:30 pm, Room Regency B) will explore the techniques and resources Miller,
founder and editor of EndUsersSharePoint.com, used for making the site one of
the largest SharePoint Community sites in the world in less than two years.
He'll share why he built the site, how the community developed, how he attracted
world-class authors, and what SharePoint users can do to develop their own
community of internal SharePoint users - and generate an audience they didn`t
even know existed.

&lt;p&gt;The Windows Phone Developer Tools have been downloaded more than 300,000 times, Microsoft said, as the company prepares to offer a new application store and mobile operating system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is finalizing the timeline for the launch of its new phone platform, Windows Phone 7. It plans to release the final version of the Windows Phone Developer Tools on Sept. 16, wrote Brandon Watson, who heads the developer experience for Windows Phone 7, in a blog post on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, developers should finish their applications using the existing beta version of the tools, Watson said. They will have time after the final release of the tools to update their applications before products can be uploaded to the store in early October. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has said that it expects the first phones to become available in October. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With 300,000 downloads of the developer tools, Microsoft could have a relatively strong application store at launch. When Microsoft launched its first app marketplace with Windows Mobile 6.5, its current operating system, it had just a couple hundred applications in the store. Apple continues to hold a wide lead in terms of number of applications, with more than 225,000 in the iPhone App Store. Research In Motion's App World has around 9,500 apps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will also be testing the process for uploading applications to the store. "Ask any mobile developers about their biggest headaches and you are likely to hear about an opaque or nonexistent app store ingestion process," Watson wrote. Microsoft plans to conduct a limited test of its app submission certification process "in the coming weeks," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been working with a variety of companies "to ensure that Windows Phone 7 customers have the applications they expect," he said. Those companies include eBay, LeFigaro, Open Table, Photobucket, Realtor.com, Seesmic and the Associated Press. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Microsoft announced that about 60 game titles from studios including Gameloft, Namco Bandai, PopCap and THQ would be available for the phones, which will be integrated with Xbox Live. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gartner recently reported that Windows Mobile had 5 percent market share, slipping from 9.3 percent last year. The platform has stagnated as new entrants like Apple and Google impress mobile users with slick user interfaces and strong application stores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nancy Gohring covers mobile phones and cloud computing for The IDG News Service.

&lt;p&gt;   * No improvement in overall survival vs Tarceva alone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Pfizer plans to analyze data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Aug 23 (Reuters) - A Phase 3 trial has shown
that Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) Sutent in combination with Tarceva
improved the amount of time lung cancer patients lived without
their disease worsening, compared with treatment with Tarceva
alone, the company said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Pfizer also said the trial failed to meet its main
goal, which was to show that the two-drug combination would
significantly improve overall survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tarceva, or erlotinib, is marketed by OSI Pharmaceuticals
Inc OSIPR.PK and Roche Holding AG DNA.N. It is approved as
a treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer and
pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said no new or unexpected types of adverse events
were observed in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Over the next few months, we will conduct an in-depth
analysis to gain further insight into these results and
determine whether we can identify one or more subgroups of
non-small cell lung cancer patients for a future trial in
either previously untreated or recurrent disease," Dr. Mace
Rothenberg, head of clinical development and medical affairs at
Pfizer's oncology unit, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sutent, also known as sunitinib, is currently approved for
treatment of kidney cancer and gastrointestinal stromal
tumors.

&lt;p&gt;MIcrosoft has told a researcher that it won't patch a problem that has left scores of Windows applications open to attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a growing number of reports, crucial Windows functionality has been misused by countless developers, including Microsoft's, leaving a large number of Windows programs vulnerable to attack because of the way they load components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue first surfaced last week when HD Moore, chief security officer of Rapid7 and creator of the open-source Metasploit hacking toolkit, said he had found 40 vulnerable applications , including the Windows shell. A day later, Slovenian security firm Acros announced its homegrown tool had uncovered more than 200 flawed Windows programs in an investigation that began in November 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, Taeho Kwon, a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at the University of California Davis, stepped forward to cite his research, which he published in a February 2010 paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these researchers have pointed out that many Windows programs can be exploited by hackers who trick users into visiting malicious Web sites because of the way the software loads code libraries -- dubbed "dynamic-link library" in Windows, which marks them with the ".dll" extension -- as well as executable ".exe" and ".com" files. If hackers can plant disguised malware in one of the directories an application searches when it looks for a .dll, .exe or .com file, they can hijack the PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Kwon said that he reported 19 serious vulnerabilities to Microsoft in August 2009 after finding flaws in nearly 30 Windows programs, including Office 2007, Adobe Reader and all the major browsers .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the back-and-forth between Kwon and engineers in the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) about the remotely-executable bugs, the latter told Kwon that the company won't ship a security bulletin, but instead will address the problem in upcoming Windows and Office service packs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Kwon, Microsoft declined to deliver a patch because "the root causes [of the vulnerabilities] are in other vendors' products." Microsoft also told Kwon it intended to work with the companies whose software contained flaws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an e-mail today to Computerworld, Kwon quoted a statement he said he received from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the two specific vulnerabilities that have been identified in this paper Microsoft has agreed to work with these vendors on behalf of the authors through the MSVR (Microsoft Vulnerability Research) program," Microsoft said. "As there are application compatibility concerns in changing the way 'Loadlibrary' and 'SetDllDirectory' work currently, Microsoft intends to address the underlying issue in a Service Pack or next version of Office products."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's decision won't come as a surprise to the researchers who have publicized the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, for example, Moore said it was unlikely Microsoft could come up with a fix. "There may be work-arounds available, but the core issue is with the application itself, not Windows," he said at the time. "There may be fixes that can be applied at the OS level, but these are likely to break existing applications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kwon said much the same today, but was optimistic that changes to Windows in a service pack -- the irregularly-released major updates to Windows -- could help. "I believe that some Windows-level patches, such as the service packs mentioned by Microsoft, can mitigate this issue," he said. "However, it may not completely solve this problem because of backward compatibility concerns."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The component-loading problem that Kwon, Moore and Acros Security have referred to since late last week is not new, but goes back at least a decade to a bug report filed in 2000. The attention the issue is getting now, said Kwon, is due in part to an uptick in attacks that rely on a combination of vulnerabilities, or lean heavily on social engineering tricks to get users to click on malicious links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old or new, the problem is systemic, said Mitja Kolsek, CEO of Acros Security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Judging from our research results ... we can safely say that all Windows users can at this moment be attacked via at least one remote binary planting vulnerability," Kolsek said in a post to a blog the Slovenian firm kicked off Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did not immediately reply to a request seeking comment on Kwon's claims that the company will not -- or cannot -- deliver a fix by patching Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings affirms all classes of JPMorgan Auto Receivables Trust 2008-A
asset-backed notes and revises the Rating Outlook as detailed below: 

-- Class A-3 asset-backed notes at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable; 

-- Class A-4 asset-backed notes at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable; 

-- Class B asset-backed notes at 'AAsf', Outlook Positive; 

-- Class C asset-backed notes at 'Asf', Outlook Positive; 

-- Class D asset-backed notes at 'BBBsf', Outlook Positive; 

-- Class E asset-backed notes at 'BBsf', Outlook Positive. 

The collateral is performing slightly worse than Fitch's initial expectations.
However, the credit enhancement structure currently provides stressed loss
coverage consistent with each of the current rating categories while still
making full payments of interest and principal in accordance with the term of
the documents. The Positive Rating Outlook on the subordinate notes reflects the
expectation that the structure's coverage of expected losses will continue to
increase and could lead to positive rating actions within the next year. 

As before, the ratings of the securities reflect the high quality of the
underlying retail installment sales contracts, available credit enhancement, the
sound legal and cash flow structure, and strength of System &amp; Services
Technologies, Inc. (SST) as the receivables servicer and JPMorgan as master
servicer.

Once the dominant technology company in the world, it has fallen behind -- even far behind -- in the market's biggest growth areas: the Internet and mobile devices. True, it remains dominant on the desktop and in office suites, but that's not where the growth is these days." date="2010-08-23T18:28:53+0000" url="http://www.reuters.com/article/idgSmallBusiness/idUS229399245720100823"><headline>How Microsoft can save itself</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the Internet, it trails far behind Google. And when it comes to mobile devices, it has fallen far behind both Apple with the iPhone and iPod, and Google with Android-based phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, a milestone was passed back in May, when Apple overtook Microsoft in total valuation. Soon, it is expected to pass Microsoft in revenue as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should Microsoft simply give up, and accept that its glory days are over?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certainly not. The technology market changes quickly, and companies can leapfrog competitors, even seemingly entrenched ones, with the right mix of strategy and products. Here is my modest proposal for two steps Microsoft can take to try and regain its technology dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step #1: Tear down the walls&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has become large and unwieldy, bedeviled by red tape, bureaucracy and political infighting. In my last column, I showed how infighting and bureaucracy at Microsoft led to the Kin mobile phone disaster, while Google, using technology from the same engineer who had developed the guts of the Kin, rushed ahead and succeeded with Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's far from the only instance of these kinds of problems. The Web-based version of Microsoft Office, for example, was not able to make use of the superb Windows Live Sync technology at its launch, even though it would have given the product a feature that Google couldn't match. Why wasn't Windows Live Sync included? The development cycles of Office and Windows Live Sync didn't match. Microsoft could easily have incorporated the then-existing version of Windows Live Sync into Office. Instead, it has to wait until the development cycle of Windows Live Sync proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft should turn its engineers, designers and product managers loose, and make them entrepreneurial. If they need to step on the toes of other Microsoft products and technologies, or even filch them for their own use, so be it. That's the only way Microsoft will be able to develop technologies its competitors can't match. The company has some of the best engineers in the world. Microsoft should use them to their fullest capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step #2: Kill the Windows brand&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's vast wealth and success is built on top of Windows. But Windows is also holding the company back when it comes to the future, both in the eyes of consumers, and in the company's own product development. Microsoft should continue to develop Window as an operating system, and should still call it Windows. But it shouldn't force its other important products to carry the Windows name or even necessarily use Windows technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Windows Live brand is a perfect example. It's not at all clear what the "Windows Live" brand is supposed to mean. It's an unrelated set of Web services and downloadable software, most of which have nothing to do with Windows. What does Windows Live Hotmail, for example, have to do with Windows? Not a thing, given that you can use it with other operating systems, such as Mac OS X. Giving it the Windows name only confuses consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same holds true for the Windows Phone. In the past, forcing its mobile operating system to be Windows-like has hurt Microsoft; it's one of the reasons the iPhone and Android both leapfrogged Microsoft in smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft should reconsider forcing almost everything it does to use the Windows brand and fit into the Windows ecosystem. Dropping that framework would give it a fresh chance with consumers, and allow its designers and developers to take a fresh look at the products they create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preston Gralla is a contributing editor for Computerworld.com and the author of more than 35 books, including How the Internet Works (Que, 2006).&lt;/p&gt;

Washington Convention Center, Washington D.C.`s premier convention center, has
deployed a VBrick Digital Signage solution to combine video streaming and
digital signage into one fully integrated solution. 

Responding to feedback from its visitors, the convention center decided it
needed a more advanced communications technology to attract world class events
and attendees from around the world. They are using VBrick to stream digital
signage content to 150 displays, including 60 high-definition flat panels
located throughout the convention center. This optimizes on-location
communications for the hundreds of events, conferences, and exhibitions spanning
a variety of vertical industries and associations held in the space. The
convention center is making full use of VBrick Systems` H.264 encoding products
to enable immediate, end-to-end streaming of video without compromising image
quality or network bandwidth. 

EYETrans Media Communications, a top integrator of interactive solutions based
in Silver Spring, MD, engineered and integrated the VBrick Digital Signage
solution for the convention center. 

Digital Signage Powers Microsoft`s Partner Conference

The convention center`s new digital signage solution proved overwhelmingly
successful in keeping thousands of people attending the recent Microsoft Global
Partners conference abreast of breaking schedule and venue changes. With only
two weeks between purchasing the VBrick Digital Signage solution and the opening
day of the conference, VBrick Systems and EYETrans Media Communications worked
feverishly to install, test and bring the digital signs online. The system
proved to be a hit with conference attendees, all of whom simultaneously
critiqued the event-and offered numerous suggestions for the next iteration of
the conference-by sending and reading thousands of Tweets via the Digital
Signage solution throughout the conference. 

"After a comprehensive review of all major digital signage solutions on the
market we ultimately selected VBrick Systems because it stood alone in providing
high quality, interactive digital signage across our convention center," said
Michael Waxer, Chief Technology Officer, Washington Convention Center.
"Moreover, because VBrick Systems` solution allows digital signage content to be
delivered as one video stream over our network, we`ve realized tremendous cost
efficiencies with the deployment." 

"Adding the Walter E. Washington Convention Center as a customer is very
exciting for us because the center is recognized as one of the most technically
advanced and modern convention centers in the world," said John Shaw, Chief
Operating Officer, VBrick. "We look forward to working closely with the center
as it continues its mission to keep thousands of yearly visitors apprised of all
the center has to offer, using the most sophisticated digital signage solutions
available today."

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has known since at least February that dozens of Windows applications, including many of its own, harbor bugs that hackers can exploit to seize control of computers, an academic researcher said Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 19 of the bugs can be exploited remotely, Taeho Kwon, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California Davis, said in a paper he published in February and presented last month at an international conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kwon added his voice to a growing chorus of researchers who claim that a large number of Windows programs are vulnerable to attack because of the way they load components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, U.S. researcher HD Moore said he had found at least 40 vulnerable applications , including the Windows shell. The next day, Slovenian security firm Acros announced its homegrown tool had uncovered more than 200 flawed Windows programs in an investigation that began four months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Moore, Acros and now Kwon, many Windows programs can be exploited by hackers who trick users into visiting malicious Web sites because of the way the software loads code libraries -- dubbed "dynamic-link library" in Windows, which marks them with the ".dll" extension. If hackers can plant malware disguised as a .dll in one of the directories an application searches when it looks for the library, they can hijack the PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Kwon claimed his work preceded Moore's and Acros'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the paper he presented last month at the International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA), Kwon said that he had submitted a bug report to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[MSRC] is working with us to develop necessary patches," said Kwon in the paper, which also carried the name of his advisor, Zhendong Su, an associate professor in the school's computer science department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kwon's paper detailed the systemic problem in Windows applications' loading of .dlls, listed 28 programs that collectively contained over 1,700 separate bugs, and spelled out how hackers could exploit those vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also developed a tool to detect unsafe .dll loads, then ran it on several popular programs. But unlike Acros, which used its own tool to do the same, Kwon named the software that failed the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Kwon, all the major applications in Microsoft's Office 2007 suite are vulnerable, as are Internet Explorer 8 (IE8), Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Safari browsers; PDF viewers including Adobe Reader and Foxit; instant messaging clients such as Windows Live Messenger, Skype and Yahoo Messenger; and multimedia players like QuickTime, Windows Media Player and Winamp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many cases, the applications he tested have been superseded by newer versions that may have been patched in the interim. For example, Kwon tested Mozilla's Firefox 3.0, which has been retired in favor of Firefox 3.5 and Firefox 3.6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kwon did not immediately respond to a second round of questions Sunday, including when he tested the applications for the .dll loading vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the UC Davis researcher, who classified the vulnerabilities as "resolution failure" and "resolution hijacking" bugs, noted that the flaws are not new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The problem of unsafe dynamic loading had been known for a while, but it had not been considered a serious threat because its exploitation requires local file system access on the victim host," Kwon wrote. "[But] the problem has started to receive more attention due to recently discovered remote code execution attacks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue appears to have been first reported a decade ago by researcher Georgi Guninski. Yet Microsoft didn't take a stab at patching it until last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 2009, Microsoft issued MS09-015 , a Windows update designed to boost the operating system's defense against such attacks. But even that fix was long in coming, complained Israeli security researcher Aviv Raff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft declined fixing the bug in Windows until I found a way to automatically exploit Internet Explorer via Safari," Raff said Saturday in an instant message. "They said it would be very problematic to fix the whole thing, and would break a lot of third-party Windows applications. But eventually they fixed IE and updated the OS as well by changing the .dll loading patch search order."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raff had originally reported the IE bugs in late 2006, and repeated his warnings in 2008 after another researcher revealed a flaw in Apple's Safari browser that could be used to "carpet bomb" Windows machines with malicious desktop shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kwon did not speculate on how Microsoft might try to patch the problem. But others have said they believe it will be difficult or even impossible to fix Windows without crippling a large number of applications. Still, something has to be done, Kwon argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our results show that unsafe DLL loadings are prevalent, and some can lead to serious security threats," Kwon stated. "More specifically, we found more than 1,700 unsafe dynamic component loadings with the administrative privilege and 19 vulnerabilities that can easily cause remote code execution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, Microsoft has only acknowledged that it is investigating Moore's reports, but has not said whether, and if so, when it might release a patch. It might need to do so quickly; Moore promised that on Monday he would release a toolkit that "audits the local system and generates PoCs," or proof-of-concept attack code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kwon's paper, titled "Automatic Detection of Vulnerable Dynamic Component Loadings," can be obtained from the UC Davis Web site ( download PDF ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An extract of the kudzu vine being developed to treat alcoholism may also help treat cocaine addiction, researchers at Gilead Sciences Inc reported on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests on rats showed the drug could stop them from giving themselves cocaine, the Gilead team reported in the journal Nature Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gilead inherited the experimental drug last year when it acquired CV Therapeutics Inc. A spokesman for the company said it was working to try to bring the drug to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no effective treatment for cocaine addiction despite extensive knowledge of the neurobiology of drug addiction," wrote Lina Yao, Ivan Diamond and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kudzu is an old remedy for alcoholism. The vine, native to Asia, has spread across much of the U.S. Southeast after being imported to control soil erosion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CV Therapeutics made a synthetic extract called selective aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 inhibitor or ALDH2i. It carries the experimental name CVT-10216.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tests on rats showed it could stop them from giving themselves cocaine. It can also prevent relapse after rats are weaned off cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found how it works -- by raising levels of a compound called tetrahydropapaveroline or THP. Cocaine cravings make levels of a brain chemical called dopamine soar and THP interferes with this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We propose that a safe, selective, reversible ALDH-2 inhibitor such as ALDH2i may have the potential to attenuate human cocaine addiction and prevent relapse," the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Maggie Fox; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NV, Aug 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
BA-Insight, the global leader in Microsoft based information access
technology, joins Microsoft at the International Legal Technical
Association's 2010 Conference in Las Vegas, as a key Microsoft partner
for SharePoint Search and FAST Search for SharePoint.

    The theme of ILTA 2010 is strategic unity. BA-Insight assists Microsoft
in the strategic unification of information for enterprise search in
Legal with a suite of SharePoint Connectors for search.

    "The ease of use with BA-Insight Search Connectors to integrate into our
other systems, SharePoint, Interwoven, and West KM; the quick turnaround
to get a solution in place; the end result of a preview pane and the
speed of search; better yet, the speed of indexing 4.5 million documents.
These were all major factors why we chose BA-Insight," explains Wade
Goldt, Director of IT, MNAT LLP.

    For increased collaboration and productivity, leading law firms turn to
BA-Insight to implement and deploy a world-class enterprise search
solution built on Microsoft SharePoint and BA-Insight Longitude to
centralize information firm-wide in SharePoint Search.

    "This type of integration is really about the speed. To be able to give
our attorneys the speed of searching an entire document management system
as well as any documents that are in West KM within less than 2 seconds;
get that data and be able to filter based on metadata; they can find what
they're looking for in less than 30 seconds total. And that includes
previewing and scanning through the information, all because of the
preview window. It's amazing. The attorneys love it to the point where
they're begging me to add their secretaries," Goldt continues.

24, 9am. Visit BA-Insight in the Microsoft booth August 23-25, and

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Aug 24 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said a gas
compressor on an unidentified unit was being restarted on
Tuesday night and normal operations were expected shortly at
its 279,000 barrel per day (bpd) El Segundo, California,
refinery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The compressor malfunctioned on Monday night and triggered
buying on in West Coast refined products markets which lifted
wholesale gasoline prices 4 cents per gallon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This problem has no impact on our ability to deliver
products to our customers in the Southern California region,"
said Chevron spokesman Rod Spackman in a statement.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed its ratings for JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM) as follows:


--Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA-'; 

--Short-term IDR at 'F1+'; 

--Individual rating at 'B'. 

Fitch has also affirmed JPM's other existing ratings at current levels. The
Rating Outlook is Stable. A full rating list is shown below. 

JPM not only survived the financial crisis without direct extraordinary
assistance but was able to expand opportunistically during the worst of times
(e.g. Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual). It has consistently made capital and
liquidity a priority, resources that help mitigate concerns about some of the
company's businesses that continue to face strong economic or regulatory
headwinds and/or are inherently more volatile contributors to earnings. JPM's
capital ratios are well above current required minimums, and each of its
businesses is capitalized to compare well with peers, providing the company
substantial cushion against the potential effects of a continued weak economy
and expected higher future capital requirements from pending regulatory reforms.


Loan quality exhibited considerable deterioration during the past few years,
although it remained manageable in light of JPM's ability to absorb losses
through earnings. As of mid 2010, some portfolios were exhibiting signs of
improvement which prompted JPM to reduce its reserve coverage. Nevertheless, the
level of troubled loans and credit losses within the consumer and corporate loan
portfolios continues to compare favorably to peer banks globally, and the loan
loss reserve remains very strong by historical standards. Fitch anticipates that
JPM will continue to reduce its loan loss reserves if favorable trends in losses
and delinquencies continue. Of note, however, is the risk that JPM and other
U.S. banks might reduce reserves too much or too quickly. 

JPM's investment bank (IB) now has a dominant, global franchise, and this
business has been the single most significant contributor to consolidated
earnings in recent periods, particularly as some of JPM's consumer business
results have been dampened by high levels of credit loss provisions. Earnings
from the IB are inherently subject to market volatility, and material swings can
and do disproportionately sway IB results and, because of its proportional
importance, consolidated financial results. Regulatory reform (especially the
Dodd-Frank Act) is likely to place constraints on some aspects of this business,
which could have a meaningful deleterious effect on the scope of activities in
the future. Fitch considers this a moderate risk, while nevertheless noting that
considerable uncertainty remains pending the adoption of specific regulations to
implement the Act which may take several years. 

JPM also faces many additional challenges. The CARD act and other pending
regulatory reforms have or will reduce a number of revenue sources, particularly
in several of the company's consumer businesses. Because it is one of the
largest mortgage servicers, JPM has been experiencing higher levels of
repurchase requests. JPM has set aside more than $2.3 billion in reserves for
reps and warranties (approximately 79% of pending requests), a level that is
more than double that of the other large banks. Still, charges associated with
future requests could be meaningful. Throughout its various businesses, JPM
faces considerable litigation risk. While it has set aside reserves for
litigation, including a special $2.3 billion provision in the first half of
2010, this risk remains significant. Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, JPM
faces reputation risk. Much of its success during the past several years can be
attributed to having avoided some of the more problematic activities leading to
the financial crisis and thus became the institution to which customers flocked
when there was a flight to quality. Anything that tarnishes JPM's image would
likely result in a diminution of this competitive advantage. 

Ratings could be negatively affected if the challenges facing JPM, as outlined
in the above paragraph, result in material reductions in profitability,
resulting in meaningful deterioration in capital or liquidity strength. Ratings
could also be negatively affected if improving asset quality trends reverse,
which is not expected, at least in the near term. 

Potential factors that could drive positive implications for JPM's ratings are
more difficult to envision, given the relative importance of the IB business,
the nature of which is inherently market sensitive, and the high level of
current ratings. 

JPM, following both organic growth and the acquisition of Bear Stearns, has
risen to become a dominant investment bank and securities underwriter.
Importantly, JPM is also a major global provider of custody, clearing and other
securities services. Through its Chase-branded businesses, JPM also operates one
of the largest retail banks in the U.S. in terms of total deposits, loans,
branches, mortgage originations/servicing and credit card issuance. JPM also has
a substantial presence across the commercial and corporate banking spectrum,
including small and middle market business, and provides a full array of
products and services to these customer segments.

&lt;p&gt;http://www.zacks.com/
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Research Equity Strategist, Dirk Van Dijk says that S 500 earnings are
continuing to show red ink. He tracks companies on the Zacks.com web site,
naming names, while forecasting trends for the months ahead. 

Finishing Strong

Regardless of some of the technical timing issues, it means that earnings will
have fully recovered by mid-2011, and that full-year 2011 earnings will be 9.0%
above full-year 2007 earnings (before the Great Recession started). 

That is years before we are likely to see a full recovery in the job market.
Collectively, the 500 firms in the S 500 earned $548.5 billion in "2009," and
that is going to grow to $776.8 billion this year and $892.3 billion in 2011.
Translated into "EPS" for the index, earnings are expected to rise from $57.83
in 2009 to $82.11 in 2010 and $94.35 in 2011. 

In other words, then, the S 500 is selling for 18.6x 2009 earnings, but just
13.1x 2010 and 11.4x 2011 earnings. By historical standards, that is quite
cheap. Normally, when interest rates and inflation are low, P/E ratios are
higher than average. Well we currently have some of the lowest rates of
inflation in decades and interest rates are at near record lows. 

It only costs the government 2.57% to borrow for 10 years. It is not hard to
find good solid blue chip companies that are providing dividend yields of more
than that, and not just a bunch of electric utilities, either. 

One thing is certain, the coupon on a 10-year T-note will not increase over the
next 10 years. The odds of the likes of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), 3.68%,
Chevron (NYSE: CVX), 3.84% or DuPont (NYSE: DD), 4.07% increasing their dividend
in the next 10 years is pretty high. Currently 149 S 500 stocks yield over
2.57%, and 98 of those have payout ratios of less than 60%. Earnings that are
not paid out in dividends are reinvested for future growth, or are used to buy
back stock, which also lifts earnings per share. Based on this year`s earnings,
the earnings yield is 7.63%, and based on next year it is 8.77%.

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Jazz Pharma Faces Setback

Jazz Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq: JAZZ) recently announced that the US Food and
Drug Administration`s (FDA) joint advisory committee voted against the approval
of the company`s fibromyalgia treatment, JZP-6. The agency`s Arthritis Advisory
Committee and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee voted 20-2
against the drug, saying that the risks of JZP-6 outweighed its benefits. 

The FDA advisory committee also asked Jazz Pharma to review the Risk Evaluation
Mitigation Strategy for JZP-6. Although the agency is not required to do so, it
usually follows the advice of its advisory panels. Given the negative feedback
from the FDA`s advisory committees, we believe the FDA will most likely delay
approval of the product. A response from the agency is due by October 11. Jazz
Pharma intends to work closely with the FDA during the review process. 

The company has an agreement with UCB Pharmaceuticals (OTC: UCBJF) under which
UCB Pharma has the right to market JZP-6 as a fibromyalgia treatment in 54
countries outside the United States. 

We currently have a Neutral recommendation on Jazz Pharma, which is supported by
a Zacks #3 Rank (short-term Hold rating). Jazz Pharma has two products on the
market, Xyrem for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy in
patients with narcolepsy and Luvox CR for the treatment of obsessive compulsive
disorder and social anxiety disorder. Xyrem, the sales of which have been
accelerating since the last few quarter, is the main revenue generator for Jazz
Pharma with fiscal 2009 sales of $31.6 million, accounting for 83% of total
revenue. 

The company also has several other candidates in its pipeline, which are being
developed for indications as diverse as restless leg syndrome, seizures,
epilepsy and bipolar disorder. However, we note that these candidates are still
several years away from commercialization. 

A delay in the approval of JZP-6 would be a disappointment for the company and
even if the drug is approved, we believe it will face stiff competition from
players such as Pfizer Inc.'s (NYSE: PFE) Lyrica, Eli Lilly and Co.'s (NYSE:
LLY) Cymbalta and Forest Laboratories Inc.'s (NYSE: FRX) Savella, for the
treatment of fibromyalgia.

Markets Quiet as CVX, XOM And WMT Trade Higher

The markets are trading in normal late August fashion with most stocks flat to
lower on extremely light volume. There are a few standouts today that are higher
and can be given the credit for keeping the markets flat instead of
substantially negative. Just for reference sake, please be aware there is an in
spirit of bear flag on the intra day S 500 chart. While normally this pattern
has a high probability of playing out to the downside, the light volume snooze
fest today makes it more of a 50/50. 

The three standouts today are clearly Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX), Exxon
Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT). These are
three of the thirty components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and likely
the reason why the index is actually flat on the day instead of lower. 

Walmart is the leader, up 2.3% on the day. Often times Walmart can be looked at
as a bearish signal for the economy as it is a lower end retailer. Should
Walmart start to do better, it would show a shift in thinking of the consumer to
saving money. Consumer spending fuels the U.S. economy. Chevron and Exxon are
both up nicely as well even though oil is weaker.

&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) announced today that it has withdrawn and will
refile its notification and report form filed with the Federal Trade Commission
(FTC) in order to provide the FTC additional time to review the Company's
proposal to acquire Coca-Cola Enterprises' (CCE) North American bottling
business. 

The Coca-Cola Company originally filed its required notification with the FTC on
June 30. Following discussions with the U.S. competition authorities, the
Company withdrew its notifications and report form on July 30 and refiled it on
Aug. 2, in order to allow more time for the competition authorities to review
the proposed transaction. Similarly, the withdrawal today and the planned
refiling on Aug. 26 will allow the authorities additional time to review the
proposed transaction. These actions are normal parts of the approval process of
major proposed transactions. 

Upon refiling of the notification and report form, the FTC will have a 30-day
period in which to determine whether to issue a Request for Additional
Information or close its investigation. 

The Coca-Cola Company remains committed to working cooperatively with the FTC as
the commission conducts its review of the proposed transactions and continues to
expect completion of the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2010, in line with
the timeline originally provided. 

About The Coca-Cola Company and CCE Transaction

In February, The Coca-Cola Company and CCE announced that they entered into
definitive agreements enabling the Company to acquire CCE's North American
bottling business, and for CCE to acquire the Company's bottling operations in
Norway and Sweden. Additionally, CCE will have the right to acquire The
Coca-Cola Company's majority interest in its German bottler. At the close of the
acquisition of CCE`s North American bottling business, Coca-Cola Refreshments
USA, Inc. will integrate four business components into a 21st-century bottling
and customer service operation in both the U.S. and Canada. The four components
are: (1) CCE North America; (2) CCNA Foodservice; (3) the Minute-Maid/Odwalla
Juice business; and (4) CCNA Supply Chain Operations. Also, following the
closing, a newly reshaped Coca-Cola North America will provide franchise
leadership and consumer marketing for the Company`s flagship operation. For more

&lt;p&gt;  FREMONT, CA, Aug 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Network Equipment Technologies, Inc. ("NET") (NASDAQ: NWK), today
announced that Hempel Group is deploying NET's VX Series to extend the
capabilities of Hempel's VoIP-enabled, multi-branch environment. Hempel
is a global enterprise delivering advanced paint and coating technologies
for marine shipping container applications. NET teamed with Inceptio A/S,
a software and services development company, using NET's VX Series to
deliver integration between Hempel's existing Cisco handsets and its
Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 (OCS) environment.

    NET's VX Series, which is qualified for Microsoft OCS 2007, is a fully
integrated multi-service voice switch that provides high-performance VoIP
communications for enterprise OCS deployments. The VX Series
interoperates with all leading PBX and IP-PBX vendor protocols, offering
rapid deployment and easy installation, with minimal maintenance.

    A critical component of the solution was ensuring Hempel's global voice
network would be always up and running. The solution was initially
deployed in Hempel's headquarters and within six months was rolled out
into branch offices from Greece to Poland and the US, enabling more than
1,000 users to obtain the benefits of Microsoft OCS without the need to
replace existing telecom equipment. Hempel expects to continue adding
branch locations throughout the year.

    "The flexibility to integrate a new voice solution with our existing
equipment was key to our decision to move forward. We feel confident that
our remote locations will have continued communications services in the
event of any outage. In addition, we have already begun saving costs on
domestic and international calls," said Mike Sutton, Global IT Project
Manager at Hempel A/S. "We are truly pleased with the solution, service
and follow through that were provided by NET and Inceptio A/S." 

    "NET has been leading the way with the development of networking
equipment tailored for unified communications solutions. Their products
are enabling enterprises to deploy software powered voice with more
interoperability and collaboration," said Dennis Lundtoft Thomsen,
Technical Evangelist at Inceptio Learning Solutions A/S. "NET's VX Series
delivers high availability with exceptional voice quality and was able to
meet all of our technical requirements. In addition, NET provided
exceptional training and other critical resources for a successful
deployment. We see NET as a partner that will be in the forefront of the
UC movement."

    "Our ability to easily integrate new VoIP technologies into existing
voice networks in any environment in any location is critical to our
success. Teaming with Inceptio, we were able to rapidly deploy a proof of
concept and put the solution into production right away," said Matt
Krueger, VP of Corporate Marketing for NET. "The UC implementation was
conducted smoothly and efficiently as a result of Inceptio's expertise in
Microsoft Unified Communications solutions."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK u. LONDON--(Business Wire)--
W&#228;hrend die weltweite Transaktionsaktivit&#228;t bei Verm&#246;gensverwaltern in der
ersten Jahresh&#228;lfte 2010 abgesackt ist, sollte sich im Zeitraum der n&#228;chsten 12
bis 18 Monate ein zunehmender Nachholbedarf bemerkbar machen, der insbesondere
von unabh&#228;ngigen Verk&#228;ufern angeregt wird, welche nach einer Zeit des Abwartens
seit dem Beginn der Finanzkrise nun auf der Suche nach Liquidit&#228;t sind. So die
Beschreibung der Sachlage der Financial Institutions Group von Jefferies. 

&#8222;F&#252;r die zweite Jahresh&#228;lfte 2010 und das n&#228;chste Jahr erwarten wir, dass
insbesondere unabh&#228;ngige potenzielle Verk&#228;ufer zunehmend gewillt sind, mit
K&#228;ufern in ernsthafte Transaktionsverhandlungen zu treten", erkl&#228;rte Aaron Dorr,
Managing Director der Financial Institutions Group von Jefferies in New York.
&#8222;Die Ertr&#228;ge sollten sich verbessern und st&#228;rkere Bewertungen mit sich bringen
sowie eine gr&#246;&#223;ere Bereitschaft der Verk&#228;ufer, Angebote anzunehmen. Allerdings
wird die Unsicherheit bez&#252;glich der Erholung der weltweiten Wirtschaftslage
weiter anhalten, so dass hoch strukturierte Transaktionen erforderlich sein
werden." 

W&#228;hrend 2009 trotz einer r&#252;ckl&#228;ufgen Anzahl von Transaktionen verwaltete
Verm&#246;genswerte (AUM) in Rekordh&#246;he den Besitzer wechselten, war die
Transaktionsaktivit&#228;t in den ersten sechs Monaten 2010 um einiges gem&#228;&#223;igter.
Mit 437 Millarden US-Dollar waren die gesamten AUM-Transaktionen im ersten
Halbjahr auf derselben H&#246;he wie 2001, als in einem Zw&#246;lfmonatszeitraum
AUM-Transaktionen im Wert von knapp unter 900 Millarden durchgef&#252;hrt wurden. Sie
lagen damit weit unterhalb der in den Jahren 2006 bis 2009 verbuchten Werte von
2 Billionen US-Dollar und mehr. 2010 wies mit 51 in der ersten Jahresh&#228;lfte
abgeschlossenen Transaktionen ebenfalls eine gr&#246;&#223;ere &#196;hnlichkeit mit dem Beginn
dieses Jahrzehnts auf, als im Durchschnitt ca. 100 Vertr&#228;ge pro Jahr gemeldet
wurden. Bei der weltweiten M&#228;t wurde in allen Industriesektoren in der
ersten Jahresh&#228;lfte 2010 im Vergleich zum ersten Halbjahr 2009 ein Anstieg von 4
Prozent verzeichnet bzw. 9 Prozent gemessen am Transaktionswert. 

In &#8222;Turning Tides", einer von Jefferies ver&#246;ffentlichten &#220;bersicht &#252;ber die
M&#228;t in der weltweiten Verm&#246;gensverwaltung im ersten Halbjahr 2010,
wird vermerkt, dass die Transaktionsumgebung in den kommenden Monaten einen
&#8222;neuen Normalstand" finden werde, wenn die Verm&#246;gensverwaltungsbranche sich an
die Bedingungen nach der Rezession gew&#246;hnt. Die ersten Anzeichen daf&#252;r seien
bereits sichtbar, und Jefferies gehe davon aus, dass die folgenden Trends wie in
&#8222;Turning Tides" dargelegt in den n&#228;chsten 12 Monaten zum Tragen kommen werden:

* Das Gesch&#228;ftsvolumen sollte insgesamt ansteigen, wenn strategisch motivierte
Transaktionen das durch das Absacken der Ver&#228;u&#223;erungsaktivit&#228;t entstandene Loch
in der Gesch&#228;ftst&#228;tigkeit auff&#252;llen und die Aktivit&#228;t ankurbeln. Zwar werde die
Ver&#228;u&#223;erungsaktivit&#228;t voraussichtlich weiter anhalten, da gro&#223;e
Finanzinstitutionen ihre strategische Richtung &#252;berpr&#252;fen und sich auf ihr
Kerngesch&#228;ft konzentrieren, aber derartige Entflechtungen werden einen
geringeren Anteil der Gesch&#228;ftst&#228;tigkeit ausmachen. 
* Unabh&#228;ngige Verm&#246;gensverwalter werden allm&#228;hlich in die Transaktionslandschaft
zur&#252;ckkehren. Wenn die Verk&#228;ufer ihren durch die Finanzkrise ausgel&#246;sten
bisherigen Fokus auf Gesch&#228;ftserhaltung nun weiter in Richtung auf die
Verwirklichung ihrer strategischen Pl&#228;ne verschieben, dann brauchen sie
Gesch&#228;ftspartner, die ihrem Wachstum dienlich sind. Da seit Beginn der
Finanzkrise nunmehr fast drei Jahre vergangen sind, habe sich zudem die Liste
einzelner Besitzer, die sich um Ruhestands- und Nachlassplanung k&#252;mmern m&#252;ssen,
verl&#228;ngert. Und wenn dann strategisch motivierte Transaktionen in den
Vordergrund treten, seien die K&#228;ufer voraussichtlich eher gewillt, einen
strategischen Aufpreis zu bezahlen, womit sie letztendlich die Verk&#228;ufer an den
Verhandlungstisch locken. 
* Investoren werden weiterhin zunehmend Mittel f&#252;r globale bzw. internationale
Portfolios und herk&#246;mmliche festverzinsliche Werte bereitstellen, so dass
Anlagen mit diesen F&#228;higkeiten bei K&#228;ufern, die ihre Produktsuites auff&#252;llen
m&#246;chten, zu den beliebtesten z&#228;hlen werden. Manager, die sich auf
Investmentstrategien in Schwellenm&#228;rkten spezialisieren, insbesondere jene mit
lokaler Pr&#228;senz in ihren Investmentm&#228;rkten, sollten bei den K&#228;ufern auf
besonders ausgepr&#228;gtes Interesse sto&#223;en. 
* K&#228;ufer aus den asiatischen und Schwellenm&#228;rkten werden zusammen mit reinen
Verm&#246;gensverwaltern in den USA und Gro&#223;britannien als vorherrschende K&#228;ufer in
Verm&#246;gensverwaltungsgesch&#228;ften auftreten. Das Wirtschaftswachstum in ihren
eigenen M&#228;rkten habe die Entschlossenheit der K&#228;ufer aus Asien und den
Schwellenl&#228;ndern gest&#228;rkt und ihre Kassen gef&#252;llt, so dass diese sowohl ihre
Produktlinien &#252;ber ihre Expertise mit lokalen Produkten hinaus ausdehnen und
ihre Vertriebspr&#228;senz &#252;ber ihre einheimischen M&#228;rkte hinaus erweitern m&#246;chten. 
* Infolge der bevorstehenden Konjunkturerholung und einer erhofften R&#252;ckkehr zu
weniger volatilen Aktienm&#228;rkten werden sich gro&#223;e Verm&#246;gensverwalter den
Aktienm&#228;rkten zuwenden, um Liquidit&#228;t zu sichern und gleichzeitig die Kontrolle
&#252;ber ihr Gesch&#228;ft zu behalten. Vorausgesetzt, die weltweiten Aktienm&#228;rkte zeigen
sich kooperativ, wird die IPO-Aktivit&#228;t in den kommenden Monaten voraussichtlich
historische Vorgaben &#252;bertreffen, wenn mehr Firmen angesichts eines engeren
Kreises von Verm&#246;gensverwaltungsk&#228;ufern auf den &#246;ffentlichen M&#228;rkten aktiv
werden.

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NV, Aug 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
ILTA Conference -- Informative Graphics Corporation (IGC), a leader in
viewing, collaboration and redaction technology, today announced the
release of Redact-It(R) for IBM eDiscovery Manager. IBM's eDiscovery
software complements core information management capabilities and
provides a strategic, in-house approach to globally address discovery,
privacy and retention requirements more efficiently. Tightly integrated
with IBM eDiscovery Manager, Redact-It performs automated redaction on
documents during the export phase, allowing organizations to process
large volumes of documents in-house.

    Redact-It automatically applies "Privilege" or "Privacy" scripts and
creates a new PDF or TIFF rendition of the redacted file(s), leaving the
source file(s) untouched. The redacted rendition contains no hidden text
or metadata; the content is completely removed, so there is no risk of
inadvertent disclosure through improper redaction. Redact-It also offers
the ability to export source files to PDF or TIFF from eDiscovery Manager
in addition to IBM's traditional EDRM-XML and Native format options. 

    Attorney and eDiscovery expert, Tom O'Connor, says, "Effective redaction
is an extremely important part of the eDiscovery process. Unfortunately,
sometimes people don't understand redaction technology, and they don't
buy a good product like Redact-It. They think they are effectively
redacting some privileged information, and instead they inadvertently
send it to opposing counsel as part of their production. If lawyers have
not protected privilege within documents, for which they have a duty to
the client, they may be exposing themselves to a malpractice case. Firms
must take the steps necessary to protect a case, and that includes proper
redaction."

    "IBM eDiscovery Manager helps companies do more in-house and control
eDiscovery costs. Adding Redact-It is a natural fit to further that goal,
bringing automation to this historically time-consuming step in the
eDiscovery process and providing significant time savings," said Gary
Heath, President and CEO of IGC. "IBM's API for eDiscovery Manager
provided us with the ability to create a truly useful and unique
integration that really benefits our mutual customers."

&lt;p&gt;Second Major Integration with Microsoft Applications Delivers More Effective
Business Development and Client Service
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
LexisNexis&#174;, a leading global provider of content-enabled workflow solutions,
today announced InterAction&#174; 6.0 for Microsoft Outlook at the 2010 International
Legal Technology Association`s annual meeting in Las Vegas. InterAction 6.0
software embeds features and functions of InterAction&#174;, a leading Customer
Relationship Management (CRM) application for professional services, directly
within Microsoft Outlook. Today`s announcement marks the company`s second major
collaboration with Microsoft this year and is part of a broader effort to
deliver valuable LexisNexis&#174; tools and resources via popular Microsoft Office
desktop applications. 

InterAction 6.0 users will be able to view and access firm-wide InterAction
content including contact details, mutual connections, upcoming meetings,
information updates and personal notes using only Microsoft Outlook - making it
easier for lawyers and other professional services firms to build stronger
client relationships and drive business development efforts as part of their
natural workflow. 

"By providing access to InterAction resources directly within Outlook,
InterAction 6.0 will proactively equip users with information to strengthen
their relationships and drive greater participation in CRM efforts across the
law firm without requiring users to launch and learn a new application," said
Brad Sidwell, vice president and general manager, LexisNexis. 

InterAction is the award winning CRM solution preferred by 80 percent of the
AmLaw 100 firms in the U.S. To develop InterAction 6.0, LexisNexis involved more
than one hundred law firm partners and associates to understand how they use
Outlook and to address their need for more efficient, timely and effective
client interaction. 

"InterAction 6.0 for Microsoft Outlook represents the most recent achievement in
our efforts to collaborate more closely with our customers to create innovative
tools that match the way they work," said Mike Walsh, CEO for LexisNexis U.S.
Legal Markets. "Both InterAction 6.0 and Lexis for Microsoft Office, which we
launched earlier this year, integrate valuable legal content and services from
LexisNexis and other resources into the Microsoft Office desktop applications
legal professionals use every day." 

How InterAction 6.0 Works

Users will have access to their firm`s InterAction CRM data directly within the
e-mail, calendar and contact functions inside Outlook. Key benefits include:

* Saves time. An InterAction toolbar will appear inside a new panel displayed
within Outlook that enables users to hover their mouse over a toolbar to surface
contact information, identify mutual relationships, see upcoming meetings or
activities, view organization or information changes and browse notes
summarizing previous interactions with any recipients of the e-mail. Because
each of these functions is performed within Outlook, users avoid the time
consuming need to go back and forth between Outlook and InterAction. 
* Easy searching. The search field function enables users to quickly search for
contact details about clients and prospects shared by others across the firm
without leaving one`s e-mail inbox. 
* A more complete understanding of client interactions. The "Add
Activities"feature allows users to log contact "events" (emails, notes, calendar
items etc.) directly from within Outlook to the InterAction database where that
information can be seen and accessed by colleagues via their own Microsoft
Outlook account. This feature gives others in the firm a more complete and
up-to-date understanding of firm-wide interactions with a given contact to
ensure coordination of efforts and help avoid potentially embarrassing
situations. 
* Valuable insights. When researching a contact, the "Mutual Connections"
feature enables users to see who among their firm already knows and has
interacted with that contact before - all from within Outlook. This gives the
user valuable insight into who might be able to make an introduction or provide
additional background information on the contact.

InterAction 6.0 for Microsoft Outlook will launch in December 2010.

&lt;p&gt;LAGO AGRIO, Ecuador Aug 24 (Reuters) - U.S.-based Chevron
Corp (CVX.N) faces a $27 billion environmental damages lawsuit
in Ecuador, a case that has already dragged on for years and
could last many more if it gets bogged down in appeals.
[ID:nN23244474]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The amount in requested damages, assessed by an Ecuadorean
court appointee, makes it the biggest case of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An initial decision is expected in the months ahead, though
there is no fixed timetable for a ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the judge hearing the suit in the provincial court of
Sucumbios rules against Chevron, the company vows to appeal
rather than pay out what would be an unprecedented award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors and the world petroleum industry are watching the
case closely to see what precedent could be set for other
mega-lawsuits against oil companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here are some facts on the case:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE ACCUSATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Residents of Ecuador's Amazon region say that Texaco, which
was bought by Chevron in 2001, wrecked wide areas of the jungle
with faulty drilling practices in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They say the company also dumped contaminated water in the
area, creating a health hazard. Rather than cleaning up oil
waste pits, plaintiffs say the company left them open or simply
spread dirt on top of the areas, allowing contamination to seep
into the ground and ruin the local water supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; President Rafael Correa, who has a troubled relationship
with foreign investors, has said he hopes the plaintiffs win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE DEFENSE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron denies the accusations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It says that Texaco did not pollute the jungle and that it
properly cleaned up all the pits that it was responsible for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If there is any pollution in the area, the company says it
is the responsibility of the Ecuadorean state, which in 1998
released Texaco of liability, a legal point disputed by the
plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HISTORY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Texaco first struck oil in Ecuador in 1967 and started
pumping in 1972 as part of a consortium with the state. The
company operated in Ecuador until 1990. Soon after, it turned
its share of the consortium over to the Ecuadorean government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; State oil company Petroecuador has continued drilling in
the area over the last 20 years since Texaco pulled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The legal saga began in 1993 when a suit was filed against
Texaco in a U.S. federal court. The case was tossed out on
appeal in 2002 on condition that Texaco agree to Ecuadorean
jurisdiction if sued there. A suit was filed in Lago Agrio the
next year, this time against new owner Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case has been filled with intrigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A previous judge stepped down from hearing the suit last
year after he was recorded discussing the case with a couple of
shadowy figures who video-taped him with secret cameras stuck
inside a wristwatch and a pen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the men who taped the meeting, a former Chevron
contractor, was whisked out of Ecuador by the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GOING FORWARD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the judge rules against the company -- as is widely
expected in political, diplomatic and industry circles -- the
first level of appeal available to Chevron would be the full
provincial court in Sucumbios province, which has three judges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If that panel upholds the ruling, Chevron's next stop would
be Ecuador's Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron says Correa has interfered in the case by publicly
siding with the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs say Correa has done
nothing more than U.S. President Barack Obama has done to
defend victims of the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also says it has been robbed of its right to a
fair trial in part by Ecuadorean geologist Richard Cabrera, a
court-appointed expert who came up with the $27 billion damages
figure. Chevron says he colluded with the plaintiffs' lawyers
and technical consultants to develop a fraudulent assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plaintiffs say that Texaco and Chevron submitted
fraudulent testing samples to U.S. and Ecuadorean courts, and
that the company's criticism of Cabrera is an attempt to
distract attention from its own misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's complaints could end up before Ecuador's
Constitutional Court as part of the appeals process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plaintiffs would meanwhile likely seek enforcement by
going to courts around the world where Chevron has seizable
assets in a bid to collect damages, widening the legal battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MULTIPLE CASES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case in Lago Agrio has spawned an array of legal
actions in the United States and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron last year filed an arbitration complaint in The
Hague saying that Ecuador violated an investment treaty through
government interference in the case. The complaint also says
Ecuador failed to live up to contracts signed with Texaco
Petroleum to clean up its share of oil-impacted areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron this year filed nine petitions in federal courts
across the United States in which it claims it has discovered
evidence of misconduct and fraud by the plaintiffs' lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Attorneys for the plaintiffs dismiss the allegation,
charging that Chevron is "forum shopping" and wants to distract
attention from evidence against it of illegal contamination.

&lt;p&gt; * Amazon court widely expected to rule against Chevron

 * Company vows to appeal, case could drag for years

 * Chevron says Ecuador gov't responsible for any pollution

 By Hugh Bronstein

 LAGO AGRIO, Ecuador, Aug 24 (Reuters) - A run-down court
building that also houses the local casino in this Amazon
jungle town is the unlikely venue for the largest environmental
damages lawsuit ever tried.

 On the first floor, people play for pennies in The Mirage
bingo and slot machine parlor. Three stories up, in Sucumbios
provincial court, the stakes are $27 billion.

 That's what local farmers and indigenous tribes want from
U.S. oil giant Chevron Corp (CVX.N) to fund cleanup of areas
they say were polluted with faulty drilling practices in the
1970s and '80s.

 The paint is cracked and peeling in the judge's
fourth-storey offices overlooking Lago Agrio, a poor and
violent northern Ecuador town near the Colombian border.

 Power failures often stop the building's air conditioners,
leaving gamblers and court officials to swelter as judge
Leonardo Ordonez pours through thousands of pages of evidence.
He says a verdict could be reached in 2011 after 18 years of
litigation in U.S. and Ecuadorean courts. [ID:nN30196631]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 As the ruling looms, each side accuses the other of
presenting fraudulent evidence while a slew of related legal
actions are played out in the United States and Europe.
[ID:nN05169269]

 Investors and the petroleum industry are watching to see if
Chevron will have to pay massive damages, setting a precedent
that could fuel other big lawsuits against oil companies
accused of polluting countries around the world.

 Ecuador's President Rafael Correa has sided publicly with
the plaintiffs. Both sides expect Ordonez to rule against
Chevron. The company -- charging government interference in the
case -- vows to appeal any adverse decision.

 Plaintiffs say Texaco wrecked wide areas of Ecuador's
jungle by dumping drilling waste into unlined pits and leaving
them to fester, an accusation that the company denies.

 Chevron inherited the case when it bought Texaco in 2001.
It says the company cleaned up all pits it was responsible for
before turning them over to Ecuador's state-owned oil firm,
Petroecuador, which still operates around Lago Agrio.

 "If there is pollution in this area, it is the sole
responsibility of the state, which in 1998 released Texaco of
further liability," said Chevron spokesman James Craig,
pointing toward one of the waste pools cleaned up by Texaco.

 Texaco built and operated more than 330 wells in Ecuador,
all of which had at least one reserve pool nearby. The dirt
just under the surface of some former waste pits still has a
black sheen and carries the eye-watering stench of oil.

 The suit names 46 people who claim to represent all area
residents who may have suffered from contamination. They are
not seeking individual awards but money to fund environment
cleanup, as well as health and clean water projects.

 "We want the money to go toward a permanent solution," said
Carmen Perez, whose small corn farm is near a series of
drilling waste pits that still smell of petroleum and, she
says, cause her to have chronic headaches.

 AMAZON CHERNOBYL?

 Analysts say the case could have wide implications.

 "If Chevron loses this case, it could set a precedent for
similar cases in other countries against not only Chevron but
other international oil companies" said Fadel Gheit, managing
direct of oil and gas research at Oppenheimer  Co.

 "It could open the floodgates for similar claims, starting
in Nigeria where Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) is being blamed for
environmental damage," he said from his office in New York.

 The Ecuador legal saga began in 1993 when a suit was filed
against Texaco in a U.S. federal court. The case was tossed out
on appeal in 2002 on condition that Texaco agree to Ecuadorean
jurisdiction if sued there. A suit was filed in Lago Agrio the
next year, this time against Texaco's new owner Chevron.

 About 200,000 pages of documents and 64,000 chemical
samples are in evidence while the intrigues of the case have
come to resemble something from a Hollywood suspense drama.

 A previous judge stepped down from hearing the suit last
year after he was recorded discussing the case with a couple of
shadowy figures who secretly video-taped him with cameras stuck
inside a wristwatch and a pen.

 One of the two men who taped the meeting, a former Chevron
contractor, was whisked out of Ecuador by the company. The
plaintiffs say the secret taping was an attempt by Chevron to
delay judgment, a charge the company denies.

 A cottage industry has meanwhile sprung up around the case,
with plaintiffs providing reporters with thick folders full of
information pointing the finger at Texaco/Chevron for what they
call the "Chernobyl of the Amazon". They offer excursions to
Ecuador's northern jungles known as "the toxic tour".

 Chevron also arranges trips for journalists, dubbed "the
non-toxic tour", showing pits that were cleaned up by Texaco.
The company offers slickly-produced desk guides describing the
suit as based on false claims driven by lawyers motivated more
by greed than concern for the environment.

 But the environment is certainly the top worry for farmer
Jose Briceno, who lives near Lago Agrio and says he can't keep
livestock because it gets sick and dies.

 "The problem now is water quality," he said, looking over
his empty farmyard. "They never really cleaned up this area."

&lt;p&gt;  CINCINNATI, OH, Aug 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Software and services provider Cincom Systems, an IBM Premier Business
Partner, announces a collaboration with IBM Business Analytics and
Optimization (BAO) to leverage IBM's Real-Time Analytics Matching
Platform (RAMP) and improve customer experience in call centers. 

    "A good customer experience begins with matching a customer with an agent
who has the best possibility for delivering a valued conversation," said
Randy Saunders, program director, Cincom Synchrony Customer Experience
Management. "RAMP's sophisticated applied analytics connects the right
customer to the right agent. Then, Cincom Synchrony guides that agent to
deliver the designed experience for the best performance and outcomes.
Success-based call routing using RAMP is a critical first step in
delivering a better customer experience and makes a powerful partner with
Synchrony."

    Assurant Solutions (NYSE: AIZ) has been using RAMP to increase call
center profitability and enhance the customer experience in its call
centers for more than seven years. Retention revenue grew by 37% and
sales revenue by 29% within the first year of implementation. This
success contributed to lowering agent attrition by 25%, simply by
exploiting the untapped potential of analytics. 

    While users are already saving millions of dollars a year, RAMP has the
potential to improve those savings as the underlying analytic models
mature. When combined with Cincom Synchrony's intelligent agent guidance
and unified desktop, the probability for successful outcomes grows
significantly.

    Representatives from Cincom and Assurant Solutions will be presenting at
Contact Centres World Africa 2010 in Johannesburg, South Africa August 23
- 27.

Three stories up, in Sucumbios provincial court, the stakes are $27 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's what local farmers and indigenous tribes want from U.S. oil giant Chevron Corp to fund cleanup of areas they say were polluted with faulty drilling practices in the 1970s and '80s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paint is cracked and peeling in the judge's fourth-storey offices overlooking Lago Agrio, a poor and violent northern Ecuador town near the Colombian border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power failures often stop the building's air conditioners, leaving gamblers and court officials to swelter as judge Leonardo Ordonez pours through thousands of pages of evidence. He says a verdict could be reached in 2011 after 18 years of litigation in U.S. and Ecuadorean courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the ruling looms, each side accuses the other of presenting fraudulent evidence while a slew of related legal actions are played out in the United States and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors and the petroleum industry are watching to see if Chevron will have to pay massive damages, setting a precedent that could fuel other big lawsuits against oil companies accused of polluting countries around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecuador's President Rafael Correa has sided publicly with the plaintiffs. Both sides expect Ordonez to rule against Chevron. The company -- charging government interference in the case -- vows to appeal any adverse decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs say Texaco wrecked wide areas of Ecuador's jungle by dumping drilling waste into unlined pits and leaving them to fester, an accusation that the company denies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron inherited the case when it bought Texaco in 2001. It says the company cleaned up all pits it was responsible for before turning them over to Ecuador's state-owned oil firm, Petroecuador, which still operates around Lago Agrio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If there is pollution in this area, it is the sole responsibility of the state, which in 1998 released Texaco of further liability," said Chevron spokesman James Craig, pointing toward one of the waste pools cleaned up by Texaco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texaco built and operated more than 330 wells in Ecuador, all of which had at least one reserve pool nearby. The dirt just under the surface of some former waste pits still has a black sheen and carries the eye-watering stench of oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit names 46 people who claim to represent all area residents who may have suffered from contamination. They are not seeking individual awards but money to fund environment cleanup, as well as health and clean water projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want the money to go toward a permanent solution," said Carmen Perez, whose small corn farm is near a series of drilling waste pits that still smell of petroleum and, she says, cause her to have chronic headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMAZON CHERNOBYL?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say the case could have wide implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Chevron loses this case, it could set a precedent for similar cases in other countries against not only Chevron but other international oil companies" said Fadel Gheit, managing direct of oil and gas research at Oppenheimer  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It could open the floodgates for similar claims, starting in Nigeria where Royal Dutch Shell is being blamed for environmental damage," he said from his office in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ecuador legal saga began in 1993 when a suit was filed against Texaco in a U.S. federal court. The case was tossed out on appeal in 2002 on condition that Texaco agree to Ecuadorean jurisdiction if sued there. A suit was filed in Lago Agrio the next year, this time against Texaco's new owner Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 200,000 pages of documents and 64,000 chemical samples are in evidence while the intrigues of the case have come to resemble something from a Hollywood suspense drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A previous judge stepped down from hearing the suit last year after he was recorded discussing the case with a couple of shadowy figures who secretly video-taped him with cameras stuck inside a wristwatch and a pen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the two men who taped the meeting, a former Chevron contractor, was whisked out of Ecuador by the company. The plaintiffs say the secret taping was an attempt by Chevron to delay judgment, a charge the company denies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cottage industry has meanwhile sprung up around the case, with plaintiffs providing reporters with thick folders full of information pointing the finger at Texaco/Chevron for what they call the "Chernobyl of the Amazon". They offer excursions to Ecuador's northern jungles known as "the toxic tour".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron also arranges trips for journalists, dubbed "the non-toxic tour", showing pits that were cleaned up by Texaco. The company offers slickly-produced desk guides describing the suit as based on false claims driven by lawyers motivated more by greed than concern for the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the environment is certainly the top worry for farmer Jose Briceno, who lives near Lago Agrio and says he can't keep livestock because it gets sick and dies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The problem now is water quality," he said, looking over his empty farmyard. "They never really cleaned up this area."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Kieran Murray)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAGO AGRIO, Ecuador (Reuters) - U.S.-based Chevron Corp faces a $27 billion environmental damages lawsuit in Ecuador, a case that has already dragged on for years and could last many more if it gets bogged down in appeals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount in requested damages, assessed by an Ecuadorean court appointee, makes it the biggest case of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An initial decision is expected in the months ahead, though there is no fixed timetable for a ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the judge hearing the suit in the provincial court of Sucumbios rules against Chevron, the company vows to appeal rather than pay out what would be an unprecedented award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors and the world petroleum industry are watching the case closely to see what precedent could be set for other mega-lawsuits against oil companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some facts on the case:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE ACCUSATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents of Ecuador's Amazon region say that Texaco, which was bought by Chevron in 2001, wrecked wide areas of the jungle with faulty drilling practices in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say the company also dumped contaminated water in the area, creating a health hazard. Rather than cleaning up oil waste pits, plaintiffs say the company left them open or simply spread dirt on top of the areas, allowing contamination to seep into the ground and ruin the local water supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Rafael Correa, who has a troubled relationship with foreign investors, has said he hopes the plaintiffs win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE DEFENSE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron denies the accusations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It says that Texaco did not pollute the jungle and that it properly cleaned up all the pits that it was responsible for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is any pollution in the area, the company says it is the responsibility of the Ecuadorean state, which in 1998 released Texaco of liability, a legal point disputed by the plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HISTORY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texaco first struck oil in Ecuador in 1967 and started pumping in 1972 as part of a consortium with the state. The company operated in Ecuador until 1990. Soon after, it turned its share of the consortium over to the Ecuadorean government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State oil company Petroecuador has continued drilling in the area over the last 20 years since Texaco pulled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legal saga began in 1993 when a suit was filed against Texaco in a U.S. federal court. The case was tossed out on appeal in 2002 on condition that Texaco agree to Ecuadorean jurisdiction if sued there. A suit was filed in Lago Agrio the next year, this time against new owner Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case has been filled with intrigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A previous judge stepped down from hearing the suit last year after he was recorded discussing the case with a couple of shadowy figures who video-taped him with secret cameras stuck inside a wristwatch and a pen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the men who taped the meeting, a former Chevron contractor, was whisked out of Ecuador by the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOING FORWARD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the judge rules against the company -- as is widely expected in political, diplomatic and industry circles -- the first level of appeal available to Chevron would be the full provincial court in Sucumbios province, which has three judges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that panel upholds the ruling, Chevron's next stop would be Ecuador's Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron says Correa has interfered in the case by publicly siding with the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs say Correa has done nothing more than U.S. President Barack Obama has done to defend victims of the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also says it has been robbed of its right to a fair trial in part by Ecuadorean geologist Richard Cabrera, a court-appointed expert who came up with the $27 billion damages figure. Chevron says he colluded with the plaintiffs' lawyers and technical consultants to develop a fraudulent assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs say that Texaco and Chevron submitted fraudulent testing samples to U.S. and Ecuadorean courts, and that the company's criticism of Cabrera is an attempt to distract attention from its own misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's complaints could end up before Ecuador's Constitutional Court as part of the appeals process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs would meanwhile likely seek enforcement by going to courts around the world where Chevron has sizable assets in a bid to collect damages, widening the legal battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MULTIPLE CASES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case in Lago Agrio has spawned an array of legal actions in the United States and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron last year filed an arbitration complaint in The Hague saying that Ecuador violated an investment treaty through government interference in the case. The complaint also says Ecuador failed to live up to contracts signed with Texaco Petroleum to clean up its share of oil-impacted areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron this year filed nine petitions in federal courts across the United States in which it claims it has discovered evidence of misconduct and fraud by the plaintiffs' lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorneys for the plaintiffs dismiss the allegation, charging that Chevron is "forum shopping" and wants to distract attention from evidence against it of illegal contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Kieran Murray)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft on Monday responded to reports of potential zero-day attacks against a large number of Windows programs by publishing a tool it said would block known exploits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the company declined to confirm whether any of its own applications are vulnerable, saying that it is currently investigating Microsoft-made software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday's security advisory was its first public reaction to a wave of reports from researchers that developers have left a large number of Windows programs open to attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Windows applications don't call code libraries -- dubbed "dynamic-link library," or "DLL" -- using the full pathname, but instead use only the filename, giving hackers wiggle room. Criminals can exploit that by tricking the application into loading a malicious file with the same name as the required DLL. The result: Hackers can hijack the PC and plant malware on the machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HD Moore, chief security officer at Rapid7 and the creator of the Metasploit penetration testing toolkit, was the first to reveal the potential attacks when he announced last week that he'd found 40 vulnerable Windows applications . Moore was followed by other researchers who claimed different numbers of at-risk programs, ranging from over 200 to fewer than 30 .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft went to lengths today to tell users that the flaw isn't in Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not talking about a vulnerability in a Microsoft product," said Christopher Budd, a senior communications manager with the company's MSRC, or Microsoft Security Response Center. "This is an attack vector that tricks an application into loading an untrusted library."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because application developers, not Windows, are to blame, Microsoft can't patch the operating system without crippling an unknown number of programs that run on the platform. Instead, Microsoft and third-party developers must sniff out which of their programs are vulnerable, then patch each separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ward off attacks until then, Microsoft has, as expected, released a tool that blocks the loading of DLLs from remote directories, such as those on USB drives, Web sites and an organization's network, all possible vectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The tool restricts the loading of remote libraries on a per app [basis] or in a blanket implementation," said Budd. The tool can be downloaded using Windows version-specific links in a just-published support document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's tool targets enterprises, not consumers, said Budd, and won't be pushed to customers automatically through the company's Automatic Updates service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the advisory, Microsoft listed other workarounds customers could take, including blocking outbound SMB (Server Message Block) traffic at the firewall and disabling Windows' built-in Web client. Last week, Moore had recommended users do both, based on his preliminary work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Budd also argued that the possible exploits spelled out by Moore and others represent a new attack vector, a claim that some researchers rejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This [has been] known since 2000, and I also reported it in 2006," said Israeli researcher Aviv Raff on Twitter Monday. Aviv had revealed a DLL load hijacking bug in Internet Explorer 7 (IE7) in December 2006. Microsoft waited until April 2009 to patch Raff's IE vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today refused to say whether any of its applications include the programming flaw that would make them vulnerable. "We're going through [our products] and researching," said Budd. "If there are vulnerabilities, we'll address them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, several outside security researchers said they would be interested to know whether any Microsoft software is at risk, which would mean that Microsoft's developers had not followed the company's advice to third-party programmers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Budd said he couldn't immediately confirm that Microsoft has known of the DLL load hijacking vulnerabilities since at least August 2009, when University of California Davis researcher Taeho Kwon said he contacted the company. Today, Budd said that he understood that Microsoft had been working the problem only for the "past couple of weeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Kwon's timeline is accurate, Microsoft's inability to name which of its products, if any, are vulnerable will likely seem especially odd to researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MSRC engineering team also published some technical information about the attack vector and the blocking tool on Microsoft's "Security Research  Defense" blog Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Internet firm Yahoo Inc said it has completed the transition of its U.S. and Canadian English-language search capabilities to Microsoft Corp's Bing platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Yahoo web, image, and video search experiences on both desktop and mobile devices are now powered by the Microsoft platform in the U.S. and Canada, with more markets to come," Shashi Seth, senior vice president of Yahoo search products, said in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Satya Nadella, senior vice president of Microsoft's Online Services Division, said the company is now working on the migration to adCenter -- a pay-per-click advertising platform -- and is optimistic about completing this phase later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Bing and Yahoo lag behind market leader Google Inc in the Internet search business. They have formed a partnership to increase their combined market share to win more ad search dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2009, Yahoo and Microsoft signed a 10-year deal that calls for Microsoft to provide the back-end technology powering search on Yahoo's websites, in a bid to create a strong Number 2 search entity to compete with Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sakthi Prasad in Bangalore; Editing by Dhara Ranasinghe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Russian Web site today revealed details about the new Internet Explorer 9 (IE9) user interface, touting new features such as quick-release tabs and a Chrome-like address-cum-search bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the company has issued several developer previews of IE9 since March, those builds have lacked any user interface (UI), and instead have presented the rendering and JavaScript engines in a wrapper that lacks even the most basic navigational aids, such as a Back button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IE9's user interface will look a lot like Google's Chrome if Microsoft Russia's site is accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until today, Microsoft had kept quiet about IE9's look and feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Russia's press site published a screenshot of and additional information about IE9. The page has since been pulled, but as of noon today, remained available in Bing.com's cache .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ZDNet blogger Mary Jo Foley reported on the IE9 details earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IE9 interface shown in the screenshot sported a Firefox-esque design to the Back/Forward buttons -- the former is larger than the latter -- dispensed with traditional menus, put tabs atop the browser window and combined the address and search bars, a move taken from Chrome's playbook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the far right, IE9 displays a trio of icons -- one is clearly Home -- that likely lead to more menus and the browser's bookmark manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The text on the page supported the hints provided by the screenshot that Microsoft will "Chromify" IE9's interface by mimicking that browser's UI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your browser is not overloaded with navigation elements, and compared with other browsers leaves more space for the site," a machine translation of the promotional copy read. "Now the user sees only what is necessary for navigation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes shouldn't come as a surprise. Other browser makers, notably No. 2 Mozilla, have headed in that direction, too, as they follow the lead of Google and its cleaner-composed Chrome. Mozilla's next major upgrade, Firefox 4, will feature tabs on top and will eliminate the traditional Windows menus above the browser's content area, two features popularized by Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IE9's marketing material also described a way to pin sites to the taskbar -- much like a local application -- by dragging a tab to the Windows taskbar. Those sites can then be accessed with a single click without first having to open IE9. "Anchored sites are seamlessly integrated into [the] navigation system [of] Windows 7," the copy said. "Thus, the work of such sites [is] as simple and familiar as with other Windows applications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IE9 will also leverage the Aero UI of Vista and Windows 7 with a feature dubbed "quick release tabs." By dragging IE9's window to the side of the screen, Aero's "Snap" feature will automatically display two tabs in equally-sized, side-by-side frames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new browser will run only on Vista and Windows 7, not the much more popular Windows XP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined to confirm the details leaked by its Russian press site or comment on its IE9 interface plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IE9's first beta will be available for download on Sept. 15 , when Microsoft will host a launch event in San Francisco. The company has not revealed a final ship date, although some have speculated that an April 2011 release is likely. That would coincide with MIX, Microsoft's annual Web conference, slated for April 12-14, 2011, in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Yahoo Grabs Search Market Share

Yahoo`s(Nasdaq: YHOO) share in the Web-search market grew nearly half a
percentage point in July, but Google Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG), despite losing the
ground to Yahoo, maintained its dominance in the U.S. search engine market, as
shown by figures released by Internet market research company comScore Inc. 

Search engines make money when users click on the text ads placed beside search
results. Web queries are an important element in helping search engine
optimization and web advertising firms decide where to put their money. New
York-based eMarketer estimates that the U.S. search advertising market will
expand 16% in 2010. This year, the overall online advertising market is expected
to grow 11%, eMarketer estimates. 

Yahoo, which saw its search advertising revenue fall 8% in the most recent
quarter, has been working on increasing the interactive elements in its search
results in order to attract traffic. Although the share gain is encouraging, the
company`s ability to grow traffic even as its search business goes through a
transition could be challenging for Yahoo going forward. 

Yahoo, with nearly 17.1% of the "explicit" web searches in July, versus June`s
16.7% share, grabbed the 0.4% advance from Google, which saw its share of
searches dipping to 65.8% in July from June`s 66.2%. Bing, owned by Microsoft
(Nasdaq: MSFT), maintained its perch at the No. 3 spot with 11% of all searches
in the U.S., unchanged from June. In all, there were 15.6 billion searches in
July, comScore said. 

After a controversy over how it defines web searches, comScore changed the way
it measures monthly search engine figures and introduced the concept of
"explicit core searches" alongside the contextual searches that include slide
show searches and artificial pop ups that may not be of users` perceived
interests. Explicit core searches exclude slide show features and reflect intent
on part of the users to conduct a search. 

To challenge Google`s dominance of the online search market, Yahoo and Microsoft
had announced a ten-year Internet search partnership agreement in July 2009 that
would give Yahoo 88% of the revenue from web search ads appearing on its network
of both owned and operated as well as its affiliated sites. Microsoft had said
it would provide its Bing search engine to power searches on Yahoo sites. 

Continuing that relationship, Yahoo and Microsoft announced recently that they
would begin gradually transitioning searches conducted by users on Yahoo`s site
to Microsoft`s Bing. The companies said users in the U.S. and Canada would see a
"Powered by Bing" tag at the bottom of the Yahoo search page. However, it
remains to be seen if a pre-holiday transition is possible. 

We have a Zacks #3 Rank (short-term Hold recommendation) on Yahoo`s shares. 

Rig Count Hits Another Yearly High

In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services company Baker Hughes Inc.
(NYSE: BHI) reported a rise in the U.S. rig count (number of rigs searching for
oil and gas in the country), reflecting an increase in the land rig count. 

Rigs exploring and producing in the U.S. totaled 1,651 for the week ended August
20, 2010. This is up by 11 from the previous week`s rig count and represents the
highest level achieved this year. The current nation-wide rig count is 88%
higher from the 2009 low of 876 (set in the week ended June 12, 2009) and
significantly exceeds the prior-year level of 985. It rose to a 22-year high in
2008, peaking at 2,031 in the weeks ending August 29 and September 12. 

Rigs engaged in land operations climbed by 8 to 1,616, inland waters activity
increased by 2 to 14, while offshore drilling expanded by one to 21 rigs. 

Natural Gas Rig Count

The natural gas rig count decreased for just the second time in the last 8 weeks
to 985 (a loss of 7 from the previous week). Last week, the number of
gas-directed rigs hit 992, an 18-month high. The U.S. gas drilling rig count has
rebounded strongly after bottoming out to a 7-year low of 665 on July 17, 2009.
Still, the rig count remains 39% lower than its peak of 1,606 in late summer
2008. In the year-ago period, there were 695 active natural gas rigs. 

Oil Rig Count

The oil rig count was up by 19 to 655, the fifth consecutive weekly rise and the
highest level since December 14, 1990. The current tally is considerably higher
than the previous year`s rig count of 280. It has recovered nicely from a low of
179 in June 2009, nearly quadrupling in number. 

AutoNation Upgraded to Outperform

We have upgraded our long-term recommendation (6+ months) on the shares of
AutoNation Inc. (NYSE: AN) from Neutral to Outperform. This is based on its
improved results and recent acquisitions. 

In the second quarter of 2010, AutoNation posted a 36% increase in profits
(adjusted) to $62 million or 38 cents per share from $50 million or 28 cents per
share in the prior-year quarter. With this, the automotive retailer has inched
past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 36 cents per share. 

Revenues in the quarter escalated 19% to $3.1 billion, driven by a marked 25%
improvement in the new and used vehicle revenues. It was close to the Zacks
Consensus Estimate of $3 billion. Operating income increased to $125.9 million
from $100.9 million a year ago. 

The company continues to surpass the industry in terms of growth in new vehicle
unit sales. The increase in new vehicle unit sales was higher than the industry
sales increase by 4 percentage points and 8 percentage points in the first
quarter and second quarter of the year, respectively. 

We appreciate the company`s aggressive share repurchase policy. In 2009, the
company repurchased 7.7 million shares for $136.1 million, up from $54.1 million
worth of shares repurchased in the prior year.

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Credit Card Rules: Boon or Bane?

The final provisions of the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and
Disclosure (CARD) Act that came into effect last Sunday could have longer term
repercussions. Though the new rules will protect credit card users from
unreasonable late payment fees, interest rate hikes and other penalty fees,
these could prove to be more difficult to card holders than before. 

On May 22, 2009, President Barack Obama signed the CARD Act into law. The Act
aims at protecting the average consumer. However, this law threatens the
profitability of major card issuers including Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C), Bank of
America Corp. (NYSE BAC), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE JPM), Capital One Financial
Corp. (NYSE COF) and Discover Financial Services (NYSE DFS), since issuing
credit at a rate suited to a customer`s risk is a complex process now. 

So how could the new rules help, and how might they pinch? Here`s a quick look: 

Rate Hikes:

Advantage: For some consumers, credit card rate could even decrease under the
new regulations. If a customer`s credit card interest rate has been increased
since January 2009, the new rules require the credit card company to go back and
evaluate whether the reasons for the rate hike have changed under the new
regulations. If yes, the issuer must reduce the rate. Issuers must also review
the rate every six months for accounts that receive a rate hike. 

Drawback: If an issuer finds that the rate hikes are not necessary, the rate
reduction may not restore the old rate. A review could result in a lower
reduction than the increase. Also, the evaluations of rate hikes are not
applicable for variable rate cards. 

Late Payment and Other Penalty Fees:

Advantage: According to the new rules, late payment and other penalty fees must
be assessed by the card issuers in a way that costs less to cardholders. Issuers
are also banned from charging multiple penalty fees for a single event or
transaction that violates the cardholder agreement. Additionally, the late fees
must not exceed the customer`s monthly minimum required payment or $25,
whichever is lower. 

Drawback: If one of the last six payments has been late, issuers can charge up
to $35. Also, if the cost incurred by the issuer due to the late payments
justifies a higher fee, they are allowed to charge it. 

Also, there are no caps on other charges including fees for balance transfers,
foreign transactions and cash advances. 

Gift Cards:

Advantage: According to the new rules, gift card balances cannot expire for at
least five years from the date of purchase. If the card expires physically, the
customer can transfer the balance to a new card at no charge. Also, if a gift
card holder adds new funds to his/her new card, the total balance of the gift
card would be safe for at least another five years. 

Drawback: If the gift card holder does not use the card for twelve months,
he/she will be charged a fee per month. 

The Bigger Picture

Following the enactment of the CARD Act, card issuers are reducing the amount of
credit they provide to borrowers. The average credit limit on a new card is now
about $3,900, down 11% from about $4,400 a year ago. Though this will force card
holders to tighten their purse strings, the lack of spending will restrict the
pace of economic recovery. We believe less spending along with the flaws of the
CARD Act will cost consumers more than before.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/07785d/chemicals) has announced the
addition of the "Chemicals" report to their offering. 

The US chemicals industry includes about 11,000 companies with combined annual
revenue of about $700 billion. Major companies include Dow, DuPont, Eastman
Chemical, ExxonMobil Chemical, and Huntsman. The industry is concentrated: the
50 largest firms generate more than half of industry revenue. 

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE 

Because chemicals are used to make a wide variety of industrial and consumer
products, demand is driven by the overall health of the US economy. The
profitability of individual companies is closely tied to efficient operations.
Big companies have large economies of scale in production. Small companies can
compete effectively by producing specialty products, of which there are a large
number, or by operating a single plant highly efficiently. The industry is
capital-intensive: average annual revenue per employee is more than $900,000. 

PRODUCTS, OPERATIONS &amp; TECHNOLOGY 

Basic chemicals include petrochemicals, industrial gases, dyes and pigments,
alkalies and chlorine, alcohols, and various other organic (based on the
chemistry of carbon and oxygen) and inorganic chemicals. These basic chemicals
are made from mined materials like crude oil, natural gas, and minerals, or from
crops and other natural substances. The raw materials are called feedstocks.
Chemicals companies use basic chemicals to produce intermediate products like
polyethylene; polyethylene oxide (PO); ethylene oxide (EO); and ethylene glycol,
or final products like phosphate and nitrogen agricultural fertilizers.

&lt;p&gt;Global Visa Prepaid Platform Facilitates Innovation Across a Growing Range of
Applications
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) has introduced the world`s first Visa Prepaid card that
combines general purpose payment, transit fare acceptance and event ticketing
features all in one card. 

The Visa Prepaid card`s functions include the ability to make purchases at Visa
merchants, and pay for trips on Singapore`s public transportation system. The
cards will also be used as the means for entry to the Singapore 2010 Youth
Olympic Games (YOG) closing ceremonies on August 26, and were used for admission
to the opening ceremony on August 14 

The all-in-one card is the latest example of the Visa Prepaid platform`s ability
to deliver innovation by working with its partners to combine payments with
additional applications. In addition to transit and ticketing, Visa Prepaid
programs around the world can combine Visa acceptance with applications such as
identification, building access, healthcare benefits, government disbursement,
medical and school discounts, and money transfer, among others. Visa Prepaid
cards can also be designed with multiple "purses" enabling funds from different
sources on the same card. 

"The inaugural Youth Olympic Games provides an ideal platform to showcase Visa`s
innovation in delivering the convenience and security of a Visa payment card,
combined with additional applications to enhance this one-of-a-kind experience
for the more than 320,000 fans, athletes and officials expected to attend the
Games," said Brian Triplett, head of global prepaid products, Visa Inc. "This
first-of-its-kind multi-application Visa Prepaid card reflects the growing
popularity of prepaid payments, the flexibility of Visa`s Prepaid platform and
Visa`s commitment to supporting its financial institution clients and
sponsorship partners with innovative products and programs that make their
consumer engagement efforts more compelling." 

Visa is collaborating with the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games Organizing
Committee, local banking partner DBS Bank and public transport system EZ-Link to
bring the various applications together onto one card. Attendees who were
awarded tickets to the opening and closing ceremonies in The Singapore Youth
Olympic Games Organising Committee`s April ballot received the card. The
cardholders can load value onto the prepaid card at all DBS ATM kiosks, through
DBS`s online banking website and at AXS1 stations across Singapore. 

In addition to the all-in-one card, Visa and DBS have introduced three
additional Visa Prepaid cards for YOG combining transit and payment:

* A reloadable Companion Card will be issued with YOG competition tickets. This
card combines payment and transit functionality. It allows cardholders to make
purchases at places that accept Visa cards, and comes with a contactless EZ-link
transit function that enables cardholders to enjoy free public transportation to
competition venues on event days. This card can be used as a regular transit
card after the Games. 
* A Mascots Edition Visa Prepaid Card which features the official mascots of the
Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games (Singapore 2010) - Lyo and Merly. The card
will be preloaded with S$5 and can be used for transit in Singapore and to make
payment at places that accept Visa cards, during and after the Games. The card
can be purchased from all DBS and POSB branches, online via DBS` website, AXS
stations and Singapore Post branches. 
* A limited edition Champions Edition Prepaid Card Commemorative Card set will
be made available to selected DBS clients and members of the public. Similar to
the Mascots Edition, these cards come preloaded with S$5 and can be used for
transit in Singapore and for payment at places that accept Visa cards, during
and after the Games. A limited quantity of 5,000 sets will be produced.

Visa collaborates with financial institution clients and partners around the
globe to develop innovative programs that combine payment and additional
functionality, including:

* The University of Sydney offers a combination student ID card and Visa prepaid
card - the first of its kind in Australia. The card recently won the Australian
Banking &amp; Finance award for Innovative Card and Payment Product of the Year 
* U.S. Bank introduced the Visa Pay ID Card, allowing cardholders to use a
single card for traditional magnetic stripe purchases, Visa payWave(R)
transactions, and the ability to gain access to secure buildings. 
* The Moscow Social Card in Russia offers pensioners a convenient way to ride
the subway, access healthcare benefits and pay for their everyday expenses. 
* In the U.S., healthcare benefit providers can offer Visa prepaid cards that
serve as both insurance identification and payment cards, as well as offer
access to multiple benefits in different "purses" on the card.

More than 320,000 people including spectators, athletes and officials are
expected in Singapore for the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games. 

As the worldwide sponsor of the Olympic Games, Visa is the only card accepted at
all official Olympic and Paralympic venues.

&lt;p&gt;Orion Energy Systems Receives Coca-Cola Enterprises' First Ever Supplier of the
Year Award

Coca-Cola Enterprises (NYSE:CCE) on Monday honored Orion Energy Systems Inc.
(NYSE Amex:OESX) with its first ever 2009 Supplier Excellence Award for
Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability.

The award recognizes a CCE supplier that "has consistently demonstrated the
values and commitment to excellence that we as an organization (and our
customers) demand as we strive to produce and distribute the highest quality
products available in the beverage industry," according to CCE.

Orion Energy Systems is a leading power technology enterprise that designs,
manufactures and deploys energy management systems, consisting primarily of
high-intensity fluorescent and LED high-bay lighting systems, dynamic sensor and
control technologies, direct renewable solar light pipes and photovoltaic
generation technology.

"We are honored to be recognized by the world's top brand," said Orion Chairman
and CEO Neal Verfuerth. "By deploying our technology at 350 facilities since
2005, we're helping CCE save $22.1 million every year by reducing their energy
use by 128 million kilowatt-hours. And now that we've rolled out our entire
suite of technology at CCE's Coachella, Calif., facility, we look forward to the
opportunity to deliver dramatic savings to its other facilities."

CCE is leading the way in corporate responsibility and sustainability. By
deploying Orion's energy-saving technology, CCE is preventing more than 125,000
tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere every year. That's the
air-scrubbing equivalent of a 25,500-acre forest, like removing nearly 21,000
cars from the road, or like saving 10.5 million gallons of gas a year.

In addition to installing Orion's Compact Modular(TM) high-bay lighting, several
CCE facilities have deployed Orion's InteLite control technology, Apollo solar
light pipes and Solyndra photovoltaic solar panels.

At CCE's Coachella, Calif., facility, the company has deployed Orion's entire
suite of energy-saving lighting technology, and Orion's solar panels, which
generate more energy than what's consumed at the sales center during certain
times of the day. The installation of Orion's technology has helped the
60,000-square-foot facility earn LEED certification. It's the first CCE
facility, and first in the city of Coachella to obtain the LEED rating.

In addition to the efficiencies deployed at CCE's Coachella facility, a
distribution center in Milwaukee, Wis., has reported its electric lights were
off for up to 10 hours a day, instead using the light delivered by Orion's
Apollo solar light pipes.

"We are certainly excited to associate ourselves with a company that has the
same passion that we do for corporate responsibility and sustainability," said
David Bondi, director of supply chain procurement for CCE. "It's been a pleasure
being associated with Orion Energy Systems, which is significantly improving the
lighting for our employees in their environment."

Orion has deployed its energy management systems in 5,870 facilities across
North America, including 123 of the Fortune 500 companies. Since 2001, Orion
technology has displaced more than 551 megawatts, saving customers more than
$935 million and reducing indirect carbon dioxide emissions by 8 million tons.

Orion Energy Systems Inc. (NYSE Amex:OESX) is a leading power technology
enterprise that designs, manufactures and deploys energy management systems,
consisting primarily of high-performance, energy-efficient lighting platforms,
intelligent wireless control systems and direct renewable solar technology for
commercial and industrial customers without compromising their operations. For

&lt;p&gt;Data from AVERROES Trial of Investigational Drug Apixaban Will Be Presented
During a Hot Line Session at Upcoming European Society of Cardiology Meeting
PRINCETON, N.J. &amp; NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) report that
preliminary results from the Phase 3 AVERROES clinical trial of the
investigational drug apixaban compared with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, or
aspirin) in patients with atrial fibrillation expected to be or demonstrated to
be unsuitable for warfarin therapy will be presented at the European Society of
Cardiology Congress 2010. The results will be presented during the "Hot Line"
session on August 31, 2010, in Stockholm, Sweden. 

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common serious chronic arrhythmia,
affecting about 4.5 million people in Europe and 2.2 million people in the
United States.1 Patients with AF are at five times greater risk for stroke
compared with the general population.2 Fifteen percent of all strokes are
attributable to AF, and one quarter of all strokes in persons older than 80
years are attributable to AF.1

In addition to treatments for heart rate and rhythm, treatment guidelines
recommend that AF patients at moderate to high risk of stroke receive
anticoagulation therapy with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), such as warfarin.1
However, surveys of practice patterns in developed countries demonstrate that 40
percent to 50 percent of patients with AF who are at moderate or high risk for
stroke do not receive VKA.1 The most common reason for not treating AF patients
with a VKA appears to be concern about bleeding.1 Difficulties managing and
maintaining therapeutic warfarin dosing, as well as the use of other
prescription drugs that interfere with warfarin therapy are additional
concerns.1 Currently, guidelines for the management of patients with AF
recommend the use of aspirin for those who cannot take oral anticoagulants.3

About the Bristol-Myers Squibb/Pfizer Collaboration

In 2007, Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb entered into a worldwide collaboration
to develop and commercialize apixaban, an investigational oral anticoagulant
discovered by Bristol-Myers Squibb. This global alliance combines Bristol-Myers
Squibb's long-standing strengths in cardiovascular drug development and
commercialization with Pfizer`s global scale and expertise in this field.

statements contained in this release as the result of new information or future
events or developments. This release contains forward-looking information about
a product candidate, apixaban, including its potential benefits, that involves

other things, the uncertainties inherent in research and development; decisions
by regulatory authorities regarding whether and when to approve any drug
applications that may be filed for apixaban as well as their decisions regarding
labeling and other matters that could affect its availability or commercial
potential; and competitive developments. 

A further description of risks and uncertainties can be found in Pfizer`s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 and in its

SAN DIEGO--(Business Wire)--
Somaxon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:SOMX) today announced that Somaxon and
Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) have entered into a co-promotion agreement for
Silenor (doxepin), a newly-approved treatment for insomnia characterized by
difficulty with sleep maintenance. 

Under the terms of the agreement, Somaxon and Procter &amp; Gamble will co-promote
Silenor with a combined 215 sales representatives in the U.S. market. Procter &amp;
Gamble`s professional health care sales force will promote Silenor to targeted
primary care and other high-prescribing physicians. Somaxon`s focus will be on
specialists and other top-decile physicians who treat insomnia. In addition,
Procter &amp; Gamble will promote Silenor to targeted pharmacies and will provide
supplemental managed care support services for Silenor. Somaxon has also granted
Procter &amp; Gamble a right of first negotiation relating to rights to develop and
market Silenor as an over-the-counter medication in the U.S. 

"We are extremely excited to add Procter &amp; Gamble`s highly regarded and tenured
professional sales force to our commercialization effort for Silenor," said
Richard W. Pascoe, Somaxon`s President and Chief Executive Officer. "With the
combined effort of both sales forces, we will target 35,000 of the highest
prescribers of insomnia products as well as 25,000 pharmacies, which we believe
will allow us to be highly competitive in the insomnia market. In addition, we
are excited about the potential to partner with Procter &amp; Gamble for the OTC
rights to Silenor as a future life cycle management opportunity." 

"We are thrilled to partner with Somaxon to co-promote Silenor," said Thomas M.
Finn, President, Global Health Care at Procter &amp; Gamble. "This opportunity is an
excellent fit with P Health Care`s current and future business interests, and
we are confident P`s professional sales force will help Silenor deliver both
for patients and in the marketplace." 

Somaxon will record all sales of Silenor and will pay Procter &amp; Gamble a
combination of fixed fees and a royalty based on U.S. net sales. Each party will
be responsible for the costs of maintaining and operating its own sales force,
and Somaxon is responsible for all other costs pertaining to the
commercialization of Silenor. The term of the agreement runs through December
31, 2012, renewable thereafter, and Somaxon will pay Procter &amp; Gamble a reduced
royalty based on U.S. net sales of Silenor for one year after the expiration of
the agreement or its earlier termination under certain circumstances. Governance
of the collaboration will occur through a joint commercialization committee. 

Conference Call Information and Forward-Looking Statements

On Wednesday, August 25, 2010, Somaxon will conduct a conference call with
interested parties beginning at 9:00 a.m. ET (6:00 a.m. PT) to discuss the
contents of this press release. The conference call will be available to

Discussion during the conference call may include forward-looking statements
regarding such topics as, but not limited to, commercialization plans for
Silenor, Somaxon`s financial status and performance and any comments Somaxon may
make about its future plans or prospects in response to questions from
participants on the conference call. 

About Silenor

Silenor is a low-dose (3 mg, 6 mg) oral tablet formulation of doxepin that is
patent protected for use in insomnia. The Silenor NDA was approved in March 2010
for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep
maintenance. The NDA included all of the data from the company`s development
program, including data from Somaxon`s clinical trial program that evaluated
1,017 subjects exposed to Silenor from 12 studies. 

Important Safety Information

A doctor should be consulted if insomnia worsens or is not better within 7 to 10
days. This may mean that there is another condition causing the sleep problem. 

Patients should be sure that they are able to devote 7 to 8 hours to sleep
before being active again. Silenor should be taken within 30 minutes of bedtime.
Patients should not take Silenor with alcohol or with other medicines that can
cause drowsiness. Silenor should not be taken with or within two weeks after
taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). Patients should not take Silenor if
they have untreated narrow angle glaucoma, if they have severe urinary
retention, if they have severe sleep apnea or if they are allergic to any of the
ingredients in Silenor. Until patients know how they will react to Silenor, they
should not drive or operate machinery at night after taking Silenor, and they
should be careful in performing such activities during the day following taking
Silenor. Before taking Silenor, patients should tell their doctors if they have
a history of depression, mental illness or suicidal thoughts. Patients should
call their doctors right away if after taking Silenor they walk, drive, eat or
engage in other activities while asleep. Drowsiness was the most common adverse
event observed in clinical trials.

potential to license over-the-counter rights to Silenor to Procter &amp; Gamble, and
Somaxon`s operating expense guidance are forward-looking statements.The
inclusion of forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a
representation by Somaxon that its plans will be achieved.Actual results may
differ materially from those set forth in this release due to the risks and
uncertainties inherent in Somaxon`s business, including, without limitation,

and continued supply of Silenor to successfully launch commercial sales or meet

and other intellectual property rights for Silenor; whether the approved label
for Silenor is sufficiently consistent with such patent protection to provide
exclusivity for Silenor; Somaxon`s ability to operate its business without
infringing the intellectual property rights of others; the market potential for
insomnia treatments, and Somaxon`s ability to compete within that market;
inadequate therapeutic efficacy or unexpected adverse side effects relating to
Silenor that could delay or prevent commercialization, or that could result in
recalls or product liability claims; other difficulties or delays in
development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of Silenor; the timing and
results of post-approval regulatory requirements for Silenor, and the FDA`s
agreement with Somaxon`s interpretation of such results; Somaxon`s ability to

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is still refusing to showcase Hyper-V at VMworld in protest of VMware rules that Microsoft believes are designed to limit competition, but that doesn't mean the Microsoft hype machine will abstain from anti-VMware marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In advance of next week's VMworld, Microsoft is touting a customer that is implementing a long-term plan to replace VMware with Microsoft and claims the move will provide savings of $3.2 million in the next three to five years. The customer, CH2M Hill, is ranked just outside the Fortune 500 at No. 520 and has corporate headquarters in Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft vs. VMware: Who's better at disaster recovery?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMware doesn't deny that the price of its virtualization software is higher than the competition's. But VMware has long argued that vSphere, its primary virtualization platform, and the related management tools are so efficient that the total cost of ownership is actually the best in the industry when measured on a per-virtual machine basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is becoming harder for VMware to make that argument as competitors Citrix and Microsoft are acknowledged by analysts to be closing much of the gap in features and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMware notes that every company in the Fortune 100 uses VMware, but the growing viability of alternative platforms has made it easier for customers to choose less expensive virtualization software. In many cases, they only do this for a subset of their virtualization deployment, and leave their most important virtualized applications on VMware-based hosts. That is precisely why Microsoft is touting the CH2M Hill story -- the customer is planning to dump VMware entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not seeing a problem putting anything we have on ESX into our Hyper-V deployment," CH2M Hill's Greg Barton, a senior analyst in charge of the company's virtualization project, says in an interview with Network World. Especially with new Hyper-V memory oversubscription features CH2M Hill is testing, Barton says "we're not seeing a huge difference in either product."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But CH2M Hill's move from Hyper-V to VMware is not exactly as cut and dry as Microsoft's public relations department would like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of existing software licenses and maintenance contracts with VMware, and CH2M Hill's strategy to lease servers on a 3- to 4-year basis, Hill says the plan to switch from VMware to Hyper-V will take between three and five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have an investment with ESX. We're not going to just dump it right now. But we're going to augment and eventually move toward Hyper-V," with the end goal of getting rid of VMware entirely, Barton says. The main driver is cost: "This last couple of years haven't been great for the IT budget," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, the project's extended time span could let CH2M Hill officials change their minds and scale back their Hyper-V plans. But Hill says VMware would have to make a pretty "compelling" move to make up for the difference in price, now that "the [Hyper-V] functionality is on par." Hyper-V is available either as a free stand-alone product or as part of Windows Server 2008 R2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CH2M Hill used VMware to set up 350 virtual machines in its corporate data center on about a dozen physical Dell servers, and deployed another 100 VMware virtual machines in regional offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hyper-V deployment is limited to just six physical boxes so far but Barton says they'll expand that within the data center and deploy Hyper-V clusters in as many as 40 branch offices across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barton acknowledges that the Hyper-V deployment is fairly limited at the moment, but says the project will produce significant savings as CH2M Hill rolls virtualization out to the regional offices, which would have been more expensive with VMware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're right in the beginning of it," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CH2M Hill and Microsoft estimate that the customer will save $280,000 by avoiding further VMware licensing fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Plus, we can now afford to tackle our 600 field servers and are aiming to virtualize 20 percent of these computers each year," Barton is quoted as saying in the Microsoft press release. "At $5,000 a server, that's a savings of $3 million over the next three to five years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barton expects management to be simplified by switching from VMware to Microsoft because CH2M Hill was already a Microsoft shop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The folks out in the field, they're all used to the look and feel of a Microsoft server," Barton said in his interview with Network World. "It's easier for them to get up to speed," and easier to set up a Hyper-V cluster from scratch.Applications slated to be placed in Hyper-V hosts include SharePoint, databases running SQL Server 2008, and Exchange Server 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It has to be a very needy machine to not go into virtualization at all," Barton says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barton won't be making the trip to VMworld in San Francisco, but Microsoft executives will be there in hopes of convincing more VMware customers to switch vendors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow Jon Brodkin on Twitter: www.twitter.com/jbrodkin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more about data center in Network World's Data Center section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;Looking to broaden access to its security practices for software development, Microsoft plans to shift the licensing for its Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) documentation to the more accessible Creative Commons License, the company said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SDL is Microsoft's blueprint for incorporating security into applications. It has been available under an exclusive Microsoft license.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Microsoft in June began offering SDL guidance for its Windows Azure cloud platform. | Keep up with app dev issues and trends with InfoWorld's Fatal Exception blog and Developer World newsletter. ] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With this more flexible copyright model, developers can now copy, distribute, and transmit SDL documentation to others in the industry, which they were unable to do before. Microsoft hopes this more open licensing will encourage developers to build upon the SDL and incorporate security and privacy throughout software development lifecycle," said David Ladd, Microsoft principal security program, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft license has required express, written consent from Microsoft to share, copy, or transmit SDL content or processes. Based on feedback from several organizations, Microsoft found that honoring the license prevented embedding of elements of the SDL process and guidance in internal secure development process documents. This made it harder to adopt SDL, Microsoft said. The Creative Commons license offers more favorable licensing terms, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the next few weeks, English versions of the company's "Simplified Implementation of the Microsoft SDL" and "Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) - Version 5.0" documentation will undergo license conversion. Other SDL content will be analyzed and relicensed as appropriate, Microsoft said. The company's SDL tools, however, will remain under the standard Microsoft license.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will take time for Microsoft to relicense other SDL documentation, but the company will keep developers up to date on its progress," Ladd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article, "Microsoft boosts access to secure development guidelines," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan authorities found four tonnes of cocaine buried on a ranch on Thursday after stopping a plane presumably on its way from Mexico to pick up the illegal drug haul, state media said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is the biggest haul in the last few years in Venezuela," Interior Minister Tareck El Aissami said. He added that soldiers were still searching the area in central Guarico state to see if more cocaine was stashed there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two Venezuelan air force F-16 fighter jets intercepted a King-200 commercial aircraft late on Wednesday, forcing it to land near the ranch, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crew fled, but belongings in the plane indicated they were Mexican, state media said. The cocaine was later found on the property, leading authorities to conclude Mexican traffickers were en route to pick it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One person was arrested during the operation at the ranch, but the detainee's nationality was not given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela is a major transit route to Europe and the United States for Colombian-produced cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accused by critics of leniency in the drug fight and collusion with Colombian rebels who depend on smuggling for financing, the government of President Hugo Chavez counters it has stepped up efforts against producers and traffickers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Aissami said Venezuela had captured nearly 47 tonnes of drugs so far this year, compared to 60 tonnes throughout 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half of last year's total haul was cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caracas says anti-narcotics operations have actually improved since cooperation ended with the United States in 2005 as bilateral relations deteriorated. U.S. officials dispute that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chavez, Latin America's leading critic of Washington, frequently says consumption in the United States and Europe is the main factor driving the illegal drug trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Diego Ore; Writing by Andrew Cawthorne; Editing by Eric Beech)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When CEO Steve Ballmer gave a quick peek at an HP Slate running Windows 7 at CES in January, Microsoft seemed prepared for battle against the iPad, which, at the time, had not even been announced yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But since then, Microsoft's Windows 7 tablet strategy has largely been to spin its wheels as iPad sales surge and Android-based tablets gain increasing momentum, industry analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month at Microsoft's Worldwide Partner Conference, Ballmer said that there will be Windows 7 slates out in time for the holidays, but no firm release dates have been announced yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there are any Windows 7 slates ready to launch this fall, writes veteran Microsoft watcher and ZDNet blogger Mary Jo Foley, expect them to be "business-focused devices that do not have the long battery life, touch-centric user interfaces or built-in app store capabilities" of consumer slates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, not an iPad competitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the iPad train rolls on. In late June, Apple announced that in the three months the iPad has been available in stores, it has sold three million units. The iPad is also starting to make inroads at enterprises, according to a recent Wall Street Journal article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MSI WindPad running Windows 7 has been pushed from a holiday 2010 release to a 2011 release. It sports a 10-inch screen, Intel's latest power-saving CPU platform, 8 hours of battery power and multi-touch control. MSI is also developing an Android WindPad slate that is set to ship before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also taking the wind out of Microsoft's sails: Hewlett-Packard's $1.2 billion acquisition of Palm in April. Last week, HP announced it will be using Palm's WebOS in a consumer tablet PC set for early next year. But HP is still set to use Windows 7 for its business-oriented line of tablets, though it has not specified timing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft must also contend with the many non-iPad tablets running Google's Android mobile OS, which continues to win over more consumers through the popular Droid smartphones. One of the most anticipated Android devices is Samsung's Galaxy Tab, which is smaller than the iPad with a 7-inch screen, but has standout features such as front and rear-facing cameras, video chat and support for Adobe Flash. It's expected to ship this fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Android-based tablets available now or on the horizon include Cisco's Cius Tablet for businesses, Dell's 5-inch Streak, Toshiba's 10-inch SmartPad and ViewSonic's 10-inch ViewPad device, which can boot either Windows or Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, it's a long shot that any tablet PCs, Windows or Android, can compete with iPad momentum, says Tim Bajarin, principal strategist at tech consulting firm Creative Strategies, who believes that Microsoft should not even bother to rush Windows 7 tablets for the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tablets are still in their infancy and Apple has sewed up this space through the end of this year," says Bajarin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its part, Microsoft has been beating the drum about upcoming Windows 7 slates from big-name vendors like Dell, Samsung and Sony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ For complete coverage on Microsoft's new Windows 7 operating system -- including hands-on reviews, video tutorials and advice on enterprise rollouts -- see CIO.com's Windows 7 Bible. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over the next several months you will see Windows 7-based slates that I think you'll find quite impressive," said Ballmer at WPC in July. "This is a terribly important area for us. We are hardcore about this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft does have a few Windows 7 tablet PCs available now at different prices and form factors, such as the Archos 9 Tablet, Asus T91mt Eee PC and Toshiba Portege M780-S7220. An MSI WindPad tablet running Windows 7 was planned for the 2010 holidays but was pushed into early 2011. MSI is also developing an Android WindPad slate that is set to ship before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Microsoft may be "hardcore" about tablet PCs, it has to worry about more than just meeting a holiday or early 2011 deadline, says veteran tech analyst Roger Kay. Kay believes that Microsoft had years to innovate with tablets, but failed to do so quickly enough and did not design Windows 7 with tablets in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ For complete coverage on Microsoft's SharePoint collaboration software -- including enterprise and cloud adoption trends and reviews of SharePoint 2010 -- see CIO.com's SharePoint Bible. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Windows 7 is too heavyweight to meet the battery and responsiveness requirements of tablets," says Kay. "At this point, Microsoft has conceded the field to Apple and the Google camp, and its best play is to sit this holiday out and prepare something for next year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be true that the 2010 holiday season belongs to the iPad for tablets and that laptop-minded customers are not ready yet for tablet PCs. But 2011 will be the year when the tablet wars begin in earnest, says Bajarin, and Microsoft can't afford to be late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Microsoft wants to be as serious player in this area it needs to be out with Windows-driven tablets by the second quarter," he says. "By the 2011 holiday season tablets will be one of the hottest segments of the mobile computing market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shane O'Neill covers Microsoft, Windows, Operating Systems, Productivity Apps and Online Services for CIO.com.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Could Investors Shake Boardrooms?

Among the deficiencies that led to the global financial crisis, weak strategies
of corporate boards have been a major one. This could probably have been
avoided, had more investors been allowed to place their director nominees. 

In an effort to address the flaws of managing companies by having more efficient
corporate boards, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is going to
decide today whether to make shareholders the kingmakers by giving them greater
power to nominate corporate board directors. This was reported by Reuters
earlier today. 

Proposing director nominees by shareholders on the corporate proxy statement has
been a must since the financial tsunami of 2008. This regulation was primarily a
fallout of the protests of shareholders, who wanted their preferred
representatives to oversee their investments prudently. 

Following the U.S. Treasury`s $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP),
which was created to rescue the nation`s financial industry, the demand for such
proxy access significantly increased as billions of dollars in taxpayer funds
were used to bail out financial giants including American International Group
(NYSE: AIG), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), JPMorgan
Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC), etc. 

Many of these bailed-out financial institutions have substantial overseas
operations. As a result, the rescue funds indirectly helped many big foreign
financial institutions based in France, Germany, Canada, Britain and
Switzerland. Though the U.S. government failed to provide clarity about whom the
money was actually bailing out besides the U.S. companies, the boards of these
U.S. companies could have protected the taxpayers` funds. With proper
information from the boards of these big companies, the government might have
been able to claim some of the cost-sharing from those countries. 

For companies still shouldering TARP debts and the consequent governmental
interference, the decision-making ability remains restricted. As per banking
regulators, if the government withdraws its support from banks before giving
them sufficient time to restore their financial health, the sector will face
another collapse.

&lt;p&gt;MONTERREY, Mexico--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed its ratings for Grupo Televisa, S.A.B. (Televisa) as
follows: 

--Foreign currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+'; 

--Local currency IDR at 'BBB+'; 

--National long-term rating at 'AAA(mex)'; 

--Outstanding balance of US$72 million of 8% senior notes due 2011 (originally
US$300 million) at 'BBB+'; 

--US$500 million 6% senior unsecured notes due 2018 at 'BBB+'; 

--US$600 million 6.625% senior unsecured notes due 2025 at 'BBB+'; 

--US$300 million 8.5% senior unsecured notes due 2032 at 'BBB+'; 

--MXN4.5 billion 8.49% senior unsecured notes due 2037 at 'BBB+/AAA(mex)'; 

--US$600 million 6.625% senior unsecured notes due 2040 at 'BBB+'. 

The Rating Outlook is Stable. 

Televisa's ratings reflect the company's leading business position, strong free
cash flow generation, extended maturity profile and solid liquidity. Televisa is
the largest terrestrial television broadcaster company in Mexico and holds
majority stakes in leading pay television companies; in addition, the company
maintains a stable market share in the Mexican advertising industry, as
television continues to be the most attractive mass media. This leading business
position is underpinned by Televisa's high quality in-house content production
focused on audience interests which is distributed worldwide. 

Televisa's diversified media and telecom business portfolio has allowed it to
maintain stable operating and financial performance, despite economic downturns,
both nationally and globally. For the latest twelve months (LTM) ended June 30,
2010, television Broadcasting segment represented 41% of consolidated revenues
and 51% of EBITDA (defined by Fitch as operating income plus depreciation and
amortization), compared to 51% and 59% registered in 2007, respectively.
Increased contributions to revenue and EBITDA from the cable &amp; telecom segment
and Direct-to-Home satellite provider Innova (Sky) have resulted in lower
business risk. These segments' participation increased to 39% of consolidated
revenues and 39% of EBITDA for the LTM ended in June 2010, from 27% and 28% in
2007, respectively. Fitch expects Televisa will continue investing in these
segments in order to increase network coverage and capabilities. 

Televisa's growth strategy continues to be focused on the Mexican
telecommunications market and on content distribution in the U.S. In line with
this, the company announced an investment in Comunicaciones Nextel de Mexico,
S.A. de C.V. (Nextel Mexico), for a total amount of US$1.4 billion. The initial
cash payment will be US$1.1 billion once the authorities ratify the spectrum
auction results, and the remaining balance will be disbursed in equal
installments over the next three years. This transaction will strengthen
Televisa's competitive position by bringing additional services to the company's
telecommunications portfolio and creating a new distribution channel for its
content. Further commercial, operating and infrastructure synergies could be
captured in the future as well. 

Televisa's credit metrics are strong compared to its relevant global peers. For
the LTM ended June 30, 2010, EBITDA coverage of interest expense was 6.3 times
(x), similar to 6.4x and 6.9x observed at year-end of 2009 and 2008,
respectively. Total Debt to EBITDA for LTM at June 2010 was 2.1x, compared to
2.3x and 1.7x in the same period, while net debt / EBITDA was 0.5x, 0.3x and
-0.1x respectively. Assuming the Nextel Mexico investment is completed and
disbursed in 2010, Fitch expects Net Debt to EBITDA at year-end would not change
significantly from current levels. 

Televisa's cash generation will be sufficient to maintain capex investments
going forward. In 2009 the company's capex was approximately US$500 million and
is estimated at US$970 million for 2010, mainly in the cable and telecom
segments, sky and television broadcasting. Fitch expects Free Cash Flow (FCF)
will be further supported by lower dividend payments in 2010 and 2011. 

The company's debt structure is characterized by an extended and manageable
maturity profile and liquidity continues to be ample. At June 30, 2010 total
debt including satellite related leases was MXN43.1 billion, with short-term
debt of only 2.6%. Cash and temporary investments at the same date was MXN38.4
billion (not including held-to-maturity and available-for-sale investments of
MXN3.9 billion registered as non-current assets).

&lt;p&gt;Micro Focus this week announced the 2010 releases of SilkTest and SilkCentral Test Manager, which boast integration between the former Borland application lifecycle management (ALM) products and development platforms from Microsoft and Eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SilkTest 2010, for automated testing, features Silk4Net, a UI option that extends SilkTest by plugging directly into Microsoft's Visual Studio 2010 IDE. Another UI, Silk4J, plugs into Eclipse environments.nbsp; The UIs enable .Net and Java developers to build automated tests in their native programming language, Micro Focus said.

&lt;p&gt;VIZCATAN, Peru (Reuters) - With the sudden burst of a fireball and a blast of heat, another clandestine cocaine lab in a remote jungle valley on the front line of Peru's drug war went up in flames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minutes earlier, drug runners fled the makeshift cocaine kitchen when they heard the phwap-phwap-phwap of the police helicopter arriving. They ran away before finishing their lunch -- rice and beans in blue plastic bowls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With one drug lab torched, Captain Acero, whose nom de guerre means Captain Steel, yelled orders to his team of 15 to hurry on to raid the next camp. Moving quickly, they doused another cache of coca and chemicals in kerosene and set it alight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peru's anti-drug police are locked in an ongoing game of cat-and-mouse in the Ene and Apurimac River Valleys against drug runners, many of whom are aligned with a remnant band of about 200 leftist Shining Path guerrillas. But the government appears to be losing the battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, the United Nations said that Peru has overtaken Colombia -- which has received billions of dollars in U.S. aid to fight drugs -- as the world's No. 1 coca producer, the main ingredient for cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fallout has put additional pressure on Peruvian President Alan Garcia to ramp up efforts to seize more drugs, but the inhospitable valleys have dealt the army and police repeated setbacks. They are frequently ambushed in the middle of the night by hit-and-run traffickers armed with grenades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VRAE, as the mountainous jungles are known, has 42,000 acres of coca farms and its expansion, combined with other coca planting areas in Peru, has occurred despite a decade of booming growth in the economy and jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug trade, fueled by consumers in the United States and Europe, is so lucrative that coffee and cocoa planters in the VRAE say they cannot find enough people to pick their crops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On any given day, police torch up to 20 drug labs, usually built along the banks of creeks and rivers. When helicopters are not available, reaching the labs requires slogging through thick forest on foot for hours at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'SACRED LEAF'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To locate the labs and Shining Path rebels, police rely on a network of informants who sometimes double-cross them. Villagers view police skeptically as they often rely on planting coca to make ends meet in a world of wooden shacks, dusty streets and pit toilets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local mayors, widely suspected of collaborating with drug runners, build statues in town squares honoring the "sacred leaf" of coca, which has been used in the Andes as a food and religious symbol for centuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the Shining Path's leaders were captured in the early 1990s and the group no longer poses a threat to the stability of the government, Peru's army and police consider the VRAE a conflict zone and say they have yet to "pacify" it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents in the village of Canayre have long felt abandoned by the government and still weep about the terrifying day in 1989 when Shining Path fighters massacred some 40 people in the town with machetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maribel Herrera, 30, whose tanned face is aged and wrinkled beyond her years, lost her father in the killing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has spotted Shining Path rebels near her house in recent months and holds little hope they will abandon the drug trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For farmers, coca provides a new crop every three months, whereas alternative crops that the government promotes -- like coffee and cocoa -- usually one provide one harvest a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milquiades Ayala, 61, says he is aware that part of the coca raised on her farm probably ends up being made into cocaine, but says he has no other options and needs to $250 he gets four times a year by selling coca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These alternative crops like cocoa, coffee and sesame, give us only one crop a year," he said. "They aren't like coca, which gives you a constant yield."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Patricia Velez; Editing by Terry Wade and Jackie Frank)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Government losing battle against drug runners&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Farmers say other crops cannot touch coca's value&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Drug runners aligned with Shining Path guerrillas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Patricia Velez&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VIZCATAN, Peru, Aug 26 (Reuters) - With the sudden burst of

beyond her years, lost her father in the killing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She has spotted Shining Path rebels near her house in
recent months and holds little hope they will abandon the drug
trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For farmers, coca provides a new crop every three months,
whereas alternative crops that the government promotes -- like
coffee and cocoa -- usually one provide one harvest a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Milquiades Ayala, 61, says he is aware that part of the
coca raised on her farm probably ends up being made into
cocaine, but says he has no other options and needs to $250 he
gets four times a year by selling coca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These alternative crops like cocoa, coffee and sesame,
give us only one crop a year," he said. "They aren't like coca,
which gives you a constant yield."

CALGARY--(Business Wire)--
Walton International Group Inc. and Walton Ontario Land L.P. 1 (the
"Partnership") announced today the Partnership`s results for the second quarter
ended June 30, 20101. 

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

The Partnership was established on October 2, 2009 for the purpose of maximizing
returns to its limited partners through the acquisition, management, concept
planning and eventual sale of two properties consisting of an aggregate of 455
acres of undeveloped land in southern Ontario (the "Properties"). The land
located near the Toronto area in Alliston, Ontario consists of two parcels of
land comprised of 155 acres. The land located in the southwest quadrant of the
City of Ottawa consists of 300 acres. The Partnership is managed by Walton
International Group Inc. ("WIGI").

It is the current intention of the Partnership to hold its interest in the
Properties as an investment and to eventually dispose of its interest prior to
the physical development of the Properties. Should the partners of the
Partnership determine that the Partnership should participate in the development
of the Properties (other than pre-development concept planning), the activities
of the Partnership may also include the partial or full development of the
Properties prior to the sale of the Properties. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND PERFORMANCE

The Partnership's material activities for the second quarter were the completion
of the private placement offering (the "Private Placement") which had commenced
in March, and the acquisition of the interest in the Properties. 

On June 10, 2010 the Partnership closed the Private Placement. The Private
Placement raised an aggregate of $17,244,500, resulting in the issuance of
1,724,450 units, the maximum offering placement. The gross proceeds raised under
both the Private Placement and the Partnership`s initial public offering ("IPO")
totaled $35,800,000. 

As projected in the Partnership`s IPO Prospectus, on June 15, 2010 the
Partnership used $26,885,835 of the net proceeds from the IPO and Private
Placement to acquire a 100% interest in the Properties, under a land option
agreement dated January 27, 2010 between the Partnership and WIGI. The remaining
cash of $6,408,165 was established to pay for ongoing operational,
administrative, land management and concept planning expenses (the "Refundable
Expense Reserve"). The remaining gross proceeds were used as described in the
Prospectus under the maximum offering.

&lt;p&gt;With Microsoft and Yahoo officially teaming up in the search market this week, it's time to wait and see if this move could eat into Google 's hearty lead over its top opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Yahoo announced Tuesday that Bing is totally fueling Yahoo search results in the U.S. and Canada. The search integration comes more than a year after both companies announced that they were joining forces to better take on Google, the goliath of the search industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be a while before there are any numbers to show how the pair is fairing against Google , said Hadley Reynolds, an analyst at market research firm IDC. However he said the launch was a positive start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's important for Microsoft and Yahoo that the shift from Yahoo search to Bing for organic results took place smoothly this week -- apparently without any technical breakdowns," Reynolds said. "These transitions are dicey in any software environment, and the fact that Yahoo and Bing pulled off the project successfully should build confidence among search marketers and advertisers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the 10-year deal, Yahoo gave up its own longstanding search technology in lieu of using Microsoft's fairly new Bing search engine to power all searches on the various Yahoo sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission approved the search agreement earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week's announcement marks a first step in putting the agreement into action. Satya Nadella, a senior vice president at Microsoft, noted in a blog post that at this point, Bing is only powering results in English in the U.S. and Canada. The setup is expected to expand into other languages and regions in coming months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo users should expect to see few, if any, differences in their searches. What could change is the level of competition that Google faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With Yahoo's moving their volume of search users to Bing, it makes it a much more level playing field for Bing vs. Google ," said Dan Olds, an analyst at Gabriel Consulting Group. "While the combined Microsoft and Yahoo search traffic is still significantly lower than what Google drives, it's much larger than the two had on their own. This gives Bing better numbers to show advertisers and a chance to cut into Google's lead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither Bing nor Yahoo separately has had any luck cutting into Google's lead in the search market. Google captured 65.8% of the search market in July, according to market research company ComScore. Yahoo had 17.1% and Bing had 11%, ComScore reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan, then was for Bing and Yahoo to hitch their teams together and to make a reinforced assault on Google's gates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This probably saved Yahoo, who, without the removal of the cost related to search and the influx of Microsoft revenue, would likely be gone by now," said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at Enderle Group. "For Microsoft, it puts them in the search game but by creating a stronger competitor.... The onslaught against Google began when Microsoft basically wrote a blank check to Yahoo to fund the battle. But this [week's integration] will represent the biggest win Microsoft ever got in one move."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olds said Google should look over its shoulder and pick up the pace on search innovation if it wants to maintain its expansive lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now that Microsoft and Yahoo's teaming up on search has become a reality, it's definitely something that Google will take notice of and react to," he added. "Both Microsoft and Yahoo have moved from also-ran status to a credible threat in terms of their traffic and technology."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olds also noted that Microsoft has deep pockets and probably can afford to invest in the search competition for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For Google, search is the cash cow that supports everything else they do," Olds noted. "Microsoft's situation and perspective is different. They have their existing software franchises to generate money. This will put more pressure on Google's profitability over time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharon Gaudin covers the Internet and Web 2.0, emerging technologies, and desktop and laptop chips for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;  DALLAS, TX, Aug 26 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Evolution Fuels, Inc. (PINKSHEETS: EVFN) (the "Company") today announced
that Willie's Place at Carl's Corner Truck stop has executed a new
branding agreement with Exxon, and a fuel supply agreement with
CarterEnergy.

    The state-of-the-art truck stop, of which the Company owns a membership
interest, features 12 diesel/biodiesel fueling lanes for tractor-trailers
plus a wide load island. There is a separate fueling island for cars and
trucks. In addition to the truck stop fueling facilities, "Willie's Place
at Carl's Corner" features two restaurants, a convenience store, a
saloon, a gift shop featuring official Willie Nelson merchandise and
memorabilia, and the 500 seat "Night Life" theater that features regular
live music performances.

    Under the terms of the agreements, the truck stop's auto fuel island will
carry the "Exxon" brand image, and CarterEnergy will supply Exxon-branded
fuel to the auto island. The imaging of the fuel island has already
commenced, and work is expected to be completed by the end of this month.

    CarterEnergy Corporation, a fuel services company for over 50 years
headquartered in Overland Park, Kansas, provides fuel distribution, site
development, and fuel transportation services to its customers.

    About Evolution Fuels, Inc.

    Evolution Fuels, Inc. endeavors to market renewable transportation fuels
at retail fuel stations that will provide superior quality fuels to
competing fuel stations by virtue of the blending capability within the
fuel dispensers at its stations and offering the blends at competitive
prices. The stations will offer ethanol/gasoline blends of fuel including
10% ethanol/90% gasoline (E10), 20% ethanol/80% gasoline (E20), 30%
ethanol/70% gasoline (E30), and 85% ethanol/15% gasoline (E85). The
latter three blends are intended for flex-fuel vehicles, although recent
studies have shown that many legacy vehicles on the road today may use
E20 and E30 blends without incurring damage to the engines or fuel
systems. The Company's plan calls for the development of a chain of
renewable fuel stations in the southwestern and southeastern United
States that will be a combination of "Evolution Fuels"-branded fuel
stations/convenience stores and western-motif truck stops modeled after
Willie's Place Truck Stop in Carl's Corner, TX. The Company's Web site is
www.evolution-fuels.com.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Aug 26 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Computer Generated Solutions, Inc. (CGS) is pleased to announce that
medical supplies, services, and support leader Byram Healthcare (Byram)
has successfully implemented the Microsoft Dynamics GP financial
management software solution at its White Plains, NY offices. Following a
short 90-day implementation process led by CGS, the new system went live
in 2010 with accounts payable (AP), fixed asset (FA) and general ledger
(GL) capabilities to replace the company's legacy accounting software
system. The new system has been integrated with payroll and banking
software at Byram to streamline and improve cash management.

    Backed by Microsoft, the Dynamics GP solution has enabled Byram to
quickly import their Excel(R)-based budget information to generate highly
accurate budget-to-actual comparison reports using the system's reporting
module. The integrated FRx for Microsoft Dynamics financial reporting and
analysis software allowed Byram to quickly and efficiently recreate
existing reports in the new software. The SmartList Builder provided a
simple, effective means of exporting system inquiry data to Excel or
Word(R). CGS also used Mekorma Software's magnetic ink character
recognition (MICR) technology and MICR Check Printing tools to format and
enable generation of printed, signed and bank approved checks in the
Byram system. The built-in Integration Manager tool enables Byram to
effectively integrate with external systems such as ADP(R) and various
banking tools for both import and export of payroll and other financial
information.

    Byram Healthcare Controller Margo Mattice commented that Byram is pleased
with the support that CGS provided to ensure an on-time implementation
and go-live schedule. "The easy-to-use Microsoft functionality enabled
our team to transition quickly to the new system and see a steady
increase in productivity. Microsoft(R) Dynamics has enabled us to easily
integrate with our banking partners and take advantage of electronic
transaction capabilities." 

    The Microsoft Dynamics GP solution provides Byram with a number of new or
enhanced capabilities over Byram's previous accounting software. Key
among these capabilities are the integrated eBanking tools that enable
Byram to benefit from Safe Pay (Positive Pay), electronic fund transfers
and bank reconciliation features available from our banking partners.

    According to CGS Vice President Dynamics Consulting Mathilde Sanson, "We
salute Byram Healthcare on their successful implementation and
accelerated speed-to-benefit with Microsoft Dynamics GP. Byram will
continue to increase their benefits from this highly productive, easy to
use solution for many years to come. With all the improvements they have
realized in just 90-days, we believe that they can serve as inspiration
for the many other businesses that are limited by systems that lack
today's important features and integration capabilities."

    CGS has deep domain experience in the healthcare service industry with
more than 15 customers running their financials on Microsoft Dynamics.
Microsoft Dynamics GP has proven itself as a flexible, powerful business
management solution with more than 40,000 customers in a wide range of
industries.

Robert Walters (RWA.L) returned to profit in its first-half
as activity picked-up in the jobs market and said it was well
placed for the second half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The firm, which has 38 offices spanning operations in
Europe, Asia-Pacific, the United States and South Africa, on
Thursday said it made a pretax profit of 5.1 million pounds
($7.86 million) in the six months to June 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That compares with a loss of 2.6 million pounds in the same
period last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net fee income, or gross profit, rose 45 percent to 72.3
million pounds, with recruitment activity accelerating markedly
in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Highlights were a doubling of fee income in the Asia Pacific

of activity were most notable in the financial services sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Walters, which ended the period with net cash of 12.9
million pounds, maintained its interim dividend at 1.4 pence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Whilst economic uncertainty currently exists across some of

percent over the last three months, closed Wednesday at 230
pence, valuing the business at 177 million pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by James Davey; editing by Rhys Jones)

&lt;p&gt;Google has overtaken Microsoft to secure the top spot in a major Japanese survey of corporate brand perception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company has been growing in Japan and easily attracts more traffic each month than competing Microsoft Web sites, but Microsoft's long history in Japan and deep ties with Japanese IT vendors had given it an advantage until this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google scored 782 points in the survey, a single point ahead of Microsoft, which was ranked in second place. The latest ranking reverses last year's top spots and puts the two U.S. tech giants almost equal. Last year Google was 25 points behind Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual survey is carried out online by Nikkei Research and this year received responses from 33,033 consumers and 14,184 business people. It asks respondents how they perceive major brands and the experiences they gain from using a company's products or services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo Japan, Google's biggest competitor in Japan and operator of the country's most popular Web portal, managed to climb a couple of positions to fourth place. That put it behind Sony, which kept hold of its number-three position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other IT companies in the top 20 were Canon, ranked sixth, Panasonic at position eight, Casio at nine, and Sharp at position 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martyn Williams covers Japan and general technology breaking news for The IDG News Service.

H&#220;NENBERG, Schweiz--(Business Wire)--
Der unabh&#228;ngige Verwaltungsratsausschuss (&#171;IDC&#187;) von Alcon nimmt Kenntnis vom
Vollzug der &#220;bernahme des noch bestehenden Anteils der Nestl&#233; AG (&#171;Nestl&#233;&#187;) an
der Alcon, Inc. (&#171;Alcon&#187;) durch die Novartis AG (&#171;Novartis&#187;). Die Transaktion,
durch die der Anteil von Novartis an Alcon auf rund 77 Prozent erh&#246;ht wird,
erfolgte gem&#228;ss dem &#171;Purchase and Option Agreement&#187; zwischen Nestl&#233; und Novartis
vom 6. April 2008. Der Vollzug der Transaktion zwischen Nestl&#233; und Novartis war
angek&#252;ndigt und hat keinen Einfluss auf die Position des IDC im Hinblick auf den
Fusionsvorschlag von Novartis an die Minderheitsaktion&#228;re. 

Thomas G. Plaskett, Vorsitzender des IDC, erkl&#228;rt dazu: &#171;Wir sind bereit, einen
fairen Deal f&#252;r die Alcon-Minderheitsaktion&#228;re auszuhandeln. Eine Transaktion im
gegenseitigen Einvernehmen liegt im Interesse aller Beteiligten und ist
zweifellos vorteilhafter als ein langwieriger Rechtsstreit, der wichtige
Schritte im Integrationsprozess verz&#246;gern w&#252;rde. Wir sind jedoch bereit, die
Rechte von Alcon und seiner Minderheitsaktion&#228;re zu verteidigen, falls Novartis
sich weigern sollte, ein faires Gesch&#228;ft auszuhandeln.&#187; 

Der Vollzug der Nestl&#233;/Novartis-Transaktion erf&#252;llt die aufschiebende Bedingung,
unter der die f&#252;nf Novartis-Vertreter an der Generalversammlung vom 16. August -
trotz &#252;berw&#228;ltigender Ablehnung durch die Minderheitsaktion&#228;re - in den
Verwaltungsrat von Alcon gew&#228;hlt worden waren. Die Novartis-Vertreter haben
einen klaren Interessenkonflikt in Bezug auf alle Entscheide im Zusammenhang mit
dem Fusionsvorschlag von Novartis an die Minderheitsaktion&#228;re. Wie das IDC
bereits fr&#252;her bekannt gab und der Schweizer Professor und f&#252;hrende
Corporate-Governance-Spezialist Hans Caspar von der Crone in einem
Rechtsgutachten best&#228;tigt, ist die Rolle der Verwaltungsr&#228;te ohne
Interessenkonflikte bei Gesch&#228;ften mit verbundenen Personen im schweizerischen
Recht und im Organisationsreglement von Alcon klar geregelt. Namentlich
erfordern alle Gesch&#228;fte zwischen Alcon und Novartis als verbundenen Personen,
insbesondere auch der Fusionsvorschlag, die Zustimmung durch das IDC, wobei die
Befugnisse und Pflichten des IDC nur mit Zustimmung des IDC ge&#228;ndert werden
k&#246;nnen. 

Greenhill &amp; Co., Sullivan &amp; Cromwell LLP und Pestalozzi, Z&#252;rich, sind weiterhin
als Berater f&#252;r den unabh&#228;ngigen Verwaltungsratsausschuss t&#228;tig. 

Wichtige Informationen zum Angebot werden weiterhin auf der Webseite des
Ausschusses ver&#246;ffentlicht: www.transactioninfo.com/alcon.

&lt;p&gt;Offering Windows developers an alternative to Microsoft's rival Silverlight rich Internet technology, SapphireSteel Software on Monday is releasing an IDE providing Adobe Flash capabilities for Microsoft's Visual Studio software development platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be formally launched Monday, Amethyst is an IDE with Flex, Flash, and ActionScript development capabilities for Visual Studio 2008 and 2010. Microsoft-based developers can design, code, and debug Flash applications and Flex applications without being forced to use an unfamiliar IDE, SapphireSteel said. Adobe AIR (Adobe Integrated Runtime) capabilities are offered as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Microsoft is positioning its Script Junkie site as a hub for Web development. | Keep up with app dev issues and trends with InfoWorld's Fatal Exception blog and Developer World newsletter. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Amethyst, Visual Studio users can leverage the more-established Flash platform instead of Microsoft's rival Silverlight, stressed Huw Collingbourne, director of technology at SapphireSteel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Flash Platform is arguably the most widely used software platform bar none," Collingbourn said. "Adobe claims that over 99 percent of Internet-connected computers have the Flash Player installed. Clearly, in order to reach the widest user base, any Web-based application that requires the sort of interactive features provided by Silverlight would, in principle, be able to reach a larger audience if that front end were implemented using Flash."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to Amethyst, tools for Flash development in Visual Studio "just weren't there," Collingbourne said. "Now, Visual Studio users have a real choice," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amethyst is visual, with developers able to drag components from the Visual Studio toolbox and drop them onto the Amethyst Designer for building Flash user interfaces. The product works like C# and Visual Basic environments, SapphireSteel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Projects can be imported to Amethyst from Adobe tools, including Flex Builder, Flash Builder, or the Flash IDE. The Amethyst Cylon debugger supports simple and conditional breakpoints and "break on hit count," SapphireSteel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amethyst Professional costs $249. A free 60-day trial is available. After the trial period, the software upgrades to the Amethyst Personal free, limited version of the software unless a license is purchased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article, "Microsoft Visual Studio users get Flash development capabilities," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

TiVo Beats But Loss Widens

A leading provider of advanced television services, TiVo Inc. (Nasdaq: TIVO)
reported better-than-expected second quarter of fiscal 2011 results. A loss per
share of 13 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents, but decreased
from year-ago quarter`s loss of 3 cents per share. 

The year-over-year decline was mainly due to weak revenue growth, lower
subscriber additions and increasing operating expenses based on higher
litigation expense. 

Net loss for the quarter came in at $15.3 million compared with a net loss of
$2.7 million in the year-ago quarter. This was better than management`s guidance
of a loss of $17.0 million to $19.0 million. 

Revenue

Net revenues decreased 10.4% year over year to $51.6 million and was well below
Zacks Consensus Estimate of $56.0 million. The decline was primarily to lower
revenues from service and technology, partially offset by strong hardware
revenues. 

Service revenues decreased 14.0% year over year to $35.7 million. Technology
revenues fell 12.3% year over year to $6.4 million. On a combined basis, Service
and Technology revenue slashed 13.7% year over year to $42.1 million as compared
with $48.8 million in the prior year quarter. Hardware revenue increased 8.0%
year over year to $9.5 million. 

Gross margin slightly dropped to 50.2% from 50.3% in the year-ago quarter.
Operating expenses increased 29.8% year over year, leading to a higher loss from
operations. 

Adjusted EBITDA of a negative $6.5 million was better than management`s guidance
of negative $9.0 million to $11.0 million. However, this was down from a
positive adjusted EDITDA of $5.5 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The
decline in adjusted EBITDA was driven by higher legal expenses, increased
research &amp; development (R) spending related to new products and higher
distribution cost. 

TiVo-owned subscription gross additions for the quarter were 32,000, compared
with 31,000 gross additions in the year-ago quarter. Churn decreased to 1.9% in
the quarter. On a net basis, TiVo-owned subscriptions decreased by 48,000 in the
first quarter and the TiVo-owned subscriber base ended the quarter at
approximately 1.4 million. Subscription acquisition costs plummeted 27.7% year
over year to $119,000. 

At the end of the second quarter, cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments were $242.7 million versus $255.5 million at the end of first
quarter 2011. The company had no debt at quarter end. 

Guidance

The company provided conservative guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2011.
The guidance reflects increased litigation expense, higher R costs due to
increased product development and distribution efforts. TiVo anticipates service
and technology revenues to be between $40.0 million and $42.0 million.
Management expects a higher net loss in the range of $19.0 million to $21.0
million in the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between ($11.0)
million and ($13.0) million. 

Other Initiatives

During the quarter, TiVo inked a partnership with Suddenlink Communications, the
seventh largest U.S. operator, currently with 1.3 million subscribers.
Suddenlink will offer its customers TiVo Premiere DVRs. Suddenlink will also
provide non-DVR set-top boxes with TiVo software to its customers. 

TiVo signed a major partnership with Cox Communications in the second quarter,
under which Cox will promote TiVo Premiere to its customers and integrate its
on-demand service into TiVo Premiere. 

TiVo also signed a deal with ONO, the largest cable operator in Spain. Under the
terms of the agreement, TiVo will be the exclusive software provider for all DVR
and non-DVR set-top boxes deployed by ONO. 

Update on EchoStar Lawsuit

As previously granted by the Federal appeals court, the en banc process
continues in the TiVo EchoStar Communications Corp. (Nasdaq: SATS) lawsuit.
Recently, EchoStar and neutral amicus have filed their briefs with the court.
TiVo is scheduled to file just after Labor Day. 

We believe the patent infringement case against EchoStar remains an overhang on
TiVo`s results, and any negative outcome from the ongoing review may impede
TiVo`s prospects considerably. 

Currently, TiVo has a Zacks #4 Rank, which implies Sell rating on a short-term
basis as intense competition from Comcast Corp. (Nasdaq: CMCSA), Microsoft Corp.
(Nasdaq: MSFT) and Sony Corp. (NYSE: SNE) is posing a threat to its DVR
business. As a result, TiVo has been increasing its R spending to stay ahead
of the competition, which is hurting its profitability.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Chase Tops 900,000 Modifications

JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.`s (NYSE: JPM) U.S. consumer and commercial banking arm
Chase said on Wednesday that it has offered more than 900,000 mortgage
modifications since the beginning of 2009. 

Chase continues to proceed swiftly with its extensive and incessant use of the
federal Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) along with its other
modification programs in an attempt to reduce the number of foreclosed homes
across the U.S. 

Of the total modifications offered, more than 270,000 have been approved for
permanent modifications and Chase has completed more than 214,500 permanent
modifications. 

Chase offered a total of 263,553 modifications under HAMP, 346,642 under its own
modification programs and 303,114 under agencies since the beginning of its
mortgage modifications. 

Over the last three months, Chase has set on more than 61,000 aged HAMP trial
modifications and has made decisions for more than 80% of the customers with
remaining aged trials. 

Chase is the first major mortgage servicer to provide face-to-face counseling in
the hardest-hit areas. The company has met 140,000 homeowners in face-to-face
counseling sessions. Also, over the last 18 months, Chase has appointed 8,000
staffs including mortgage counselors to work for struggling homeowners. 

Chase has also donated or sold at a substantial discount more than 900 homes to
non-profit organizations. 

During 2009, JPMorgan Chase reviewed its residential real estate portfolio to
identify homeowners who need assistance the most. Consequently, it started
opening new regional counseling centers and hiring additional loan counselors. 

Apart from JPMorgan Chase, the other companies that are actively engaged in HAMP
and other modification programs to prevent foreclosures include Bank of America
Corp. (NYSE: BAC), Wells Fargo &amp; Co. (NYSE: WFC), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) and
USB Bancorp (NYSE: USB). 

The participating banks receive incentive payments under the mortgage
modification program for altering the interest rates and payments for distressed
homeowners. Following a trial modification for three months, qualifying
homeowners` mortgage burdens are expected to permanently reduce. 

At a time when the pace of economic recovery is slow, JPMorgan Chase is
exploring all options to prevent a foreclosure. Though foreclosure prevention
does not benefit the company`s financials to a great extent, it hopes to restore
investor and customer confidence through this initiative. 

JPMorgan Chase currently retains its Zacks #3 Rank (short-term Hold rating),
implying that the stock is expected to perform in line with the broader U.S.
equity market in the near term. While we anticipate continued synergies from the
company`s diversified operations and a strong capital position, a pressured
credit quality and reduced levels of client activity will drag future earnings. 

However, we are impressed to see some improvement in credit quality in the last
three quarters. Therefore, we maintain our long-term Neutral recommendation on
the stock.

&lt;p&gt;TORONTO (Reuters) - When Microsoft (MSFT.O) called to discuss a potential sales partnership, small Canadian software company i4i was all ears. Ten years later the startup wishes it had never answered the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ensuing meeting was the catalyst for a costly patent war over text-manipulation software between i4i (www.i4i.com) and the world's No. 1 software seller that has entangled i4i in endless legal proceedings for the past three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft sat in meetings with us where we explained how it works and we believed if you've got a patent, a patent is full disclosure and in return you guys have to respect that and that is the law," said i4i co-founder Michel Vulpe, whose software patent was approved by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2004 Vulpe became suspicious that the software giant was using their technology, without permission, in its popular Word software. In 2007, when Microsoft began touting its XML capabilities, i4i got serious and launched their patent infringement lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, Vulpe said the reaction from friends was a mixture of laughter and horror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some friends took up a collection for large white coats with really long sleeves," he joked about the legal battle that has cost i4i more than $15 million and has contributed to a downsizing of the business over the last decade from a peak of about 140 employees to its current staff of around 30. "As part of the process of essentially having phones disappear, we had to try to figure out how we were going to regroup and keep the company going."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LEGAL FIGHT CONTINUES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lengthy, and at times nasty, process culminated with last year's decision by a Texas federal court that Microsoft had willfully infringed the i4i patent and awarded the Toronto-based company $290 million in damages. Microsoft was also ordered to stop selling versions of Word containing the disputed technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has unsuccessfully tried to appeal the verdict several times; the last one coming a month ago when the USPTO confirmed the validity of the i4i patent. The software giant's only remaining avenue is to appeal to the Supreme Court, but it faced an August 27 end-of-the-day filing deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft refused to comment on whether it intends to continue the fight, but company spokesman Kevin Kutz previously stated "there still remain important matters of patent law at stake."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patent lawyer Mark Walters, who works for Seattle-based law firm Frommer Lawrence  Haug LLP, said the chances of the Supreme Court accepting the case were slim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's traditionally very hard to get the Supreme Court interested in patent issues," said Walters, who felt the case held significance for other small companies that want to enforce their patents. "It keeps bigger companies that have the balance of power in their camp from abusing patent rights, because now they may be forced to stop."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stanford law professor Mark Lemley, a patent lawyer for San Francisco firm Durie Tangri, was not willing to count Microsoft out just yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's late innings, but it's not quite done,' insisted Lemley, pointing to Microsoft's successful appeals of Lucent's $1.5-billion award and another against ATT. If Microsoft is able to get this in before the Supreme Court, it may force a settlement. "If i4i offered them a significant discount because they were afraid the court would take this case, maybe it would make sense to settle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN IT FOR THE LONG HAUL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I4i chairman and CEO Loudon Owen bristled when asked why they don't just settle and move on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why should we settle? Why don't they simply stop selling the technology?" Owen exclaimed during an interview at the Toronto headquarters of his venture firm McLean Watson Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owen, who first invested in i4i more than 14 years ago, said before larger corporations such as Microsoft, Intel and Cisco began buying up smaller players, entrepreneurs such as Vulpe had a more level playing field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the good old days everybody used to get out and fight and build their companies and they would go to war," he said, adding i4i's technology addresses a market 10 times the size of Microsoft's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically Vulpe developed a technology that enables applications such as Word and thought one day he might be sitting next to Bill Gates reminiscing about how their innovations changed the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately 10 years later we're not talking to each other and it's a very different circumstance for a whole bunch of obvious reasons."&lt;/p&gt;

Notes That General Electric Is Also Exploring Hydrophobic Nano-Engineered Surfaces</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;  LITTLE FALLS, NJ, Aug 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
mPhase Technologies, Inc. (OTCBB: XDSL) today announced that it has
noted, with enthusiasm, the recent announcement by General Electric that
as part of its push into high-tech products that it will explore
hydrophobic nano-engineered surfaces to improve the performance of other
industrial products. Such surfaces can repel a wide range of liquids but
be made to temporarily lose their liquid repelling properties using a
technique known as "electrowetting." The research will be conducted in
the Nanocoatings Subscale Lab at General Electric's Research Center in
Niskayuna, New York.

    General Electric joins a number of companies in its research and
development of hydrophobic surface spaces including mPhase Technologies,
Inc. mPhase has recently received a United States patent for the concept
of a porous membrane made from silicon that is capable of controlling the
flow of a wide range of liquids, including electrolytes, used in both
primary and rechargeable batteries. The concepts behind the porous
membrane are being used in the development of the Smart NanoBattery to
create a new type of reserve battery that has a very long shelf life and
can be activated or triggered on command based upon an external event.

    mPhase CEO Ron Durando said, "Smaller companies like mPhase do a lot of
the initial development of various technologies, and when these new
technologies reach the cusp of commercialization, companies such as GE
step into the market to leverage their deep pockets and research
capacities -- following the trail mPhase and others have blazed. We
believe that GE's interest in hydrophobic nano-engineering surfaces is
another great validation of our research and adds value to our portfolio
of intellectual property."

    About mPhase Technologies, Inc.

    mPhase Technologies is introducing a revolutionary Smart Surface
technology enabled by breakthroughs in nanotechnology, MEMS processing
and microfluidics. Our Smart Surface technology has potential
applications within drug delivery systems, lab-on-a-chip analytic
systems, self-cleaning systems, liquid and chemical sensor systems, and
filtration systems. mPhase has pioneered its first Smart Surface enabled
product, the mPhase Smart NanoBattery.

    In addition to the Smart Surface technology, mPhase recently introduced
its first product, the mPower Emergency Illuminator, an award-winning
product designed by Porsche Design Studio.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft with its Script Junkie Web site seeks to enable developers to better navigate Web technologies such as HTML, JavaSCript, and CSS, a Microsoft official said in a blog on Thursday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Script Junkie is Microsoft's newest developer hub on MSDN, said S. Somasegar, senior vice president of the Microsoftnbsp; Developer Division. Billed as a site for "Serious Web development," it is intended to serve as a resource for the latest in Web development techniques, providing solutions-based articles from JavaScript luminaries such as Christian Heilman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Also on InfoWorld.com: Microsoft is seeking to expand use of its Security  Development Lifecycle guidelines. | Discover what's new in business applications  with InfoWorld's  Technology: Applications newsletter.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"MSDN's goal has always been to help the developer get their job done more efficiently, and Script Junkie brings that assistance to Web-based coding," Somasegar said. "Script Junkie is the start of a new generation of centers on MSDN focused on offering the best of Microsoft and non-Microsoft resources to address real-life and practical end-to-end developer scenarios."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site also features a forum for readers to participate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somasegar recalled that earlier this year, he cited "The Web as a Platform" as one of several key software development trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Browser-based applications such as Mugtug show the increasing flexibility and power of Web technologies.nbsp; New and experienced developers alike are anxious to learn everything they can about how to take advantage of the Web to deliver experiences to their audience," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more about developer world in InfoWorld's Developer World Channel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.infoworld.com/node/135506&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India summoned China's ambassador Friday to protest against the refusal of a visa to an Indian general from the disputed Kashmir region, the latest spat between two Asian giants jostling for global influence and resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A defense ministry source and some local media said defense ties, so far been limited to visits by military officials and the occasional exercises, were suspended, but the Indian government did not confirm this. Defense Minister A.K. Antony said "ties with China will continue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, India protested against a Chinese embassy policy of issuing different visas to residents of Indian Kashmir. New Delhi bristles at any hint that Kashmir, where a separatist insurgency has raged for two decades, is not part of India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we value our exchanges with China, there must be sensitivity to each others' concerns," an Indian foreign ministry spokesman said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underlining fresh tensions, India summoned Chinese ambassador Zhang Yan to complain about the denial of visa to the army general, according to senior foreign ministry officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of mistrust, China is now India's biggest trade partner and the current spat, one of several over the last few years, is unlikely to snowball. The value of bilateral deals was expected to pass $60 billion this year, a 30-fold increase since 2000, raising the stakes in maintaining peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distrust between the two economic powerhouses dates back to a 1962 border war, partly over the northeastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh that China claims in full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's support for India's arch-enemy Pakistan, which backs the Kashmir separatists and also claims the region in full, has not helped defuse tensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India is also unhappy with China's economic and political ties with Pakistan and says Chinese involvement in Pakistan-held Kashmir is intended to undermine it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China defeated India in the 1962 war, but they still spar over their disputed 3,500 km (2,170 mile) border and the presence of exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, in India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"TIES HEATING UP"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the Indian media reported on Chinese incursions along the border, incidents the India government shrugged off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But tension has simmered, particularly over Chinese development projects in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Delhi is also angry at talks to encourage Chinese university research on Indian Kashmir after a meeting between a Kashmiri separatist leader and Chinese officials this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time a Chinese action has irritated India this year, New Delhi has responded by upping its engagement with the Dalai Lama, including a meeting between Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the Tibetan leader this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All this is an indication of bilateral ties heating up because India sees this as interference in its sovereignty," said Srikanth Kondapalli, professor at India's Jawaharlal Nehru University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India holds 45 percent of the disputed Himalayan region while Pakistan controls a third. China holds the remainder of Kashmir, an icy desert plateau known as Aksai China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China and Pakistan's close military and political ties are underpinned by long-standing wariness of common neighbor, India, and a desire to hedge against U.S. influence in South Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India and Pakistan, which claim Kashmir in full, have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir since their independence from Britain in 1947.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India has very limited military ties with China, mainly focused on visits by respective military chiefs and government officials and occasional war exercises agreed on in May 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But both Indian and Chinese analysts agree the latest row is unlikely to affect the two country's broader relations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Security and military ties are among the weakest aspects of the China-India relationship," Zhang Li, professor of South Asian politics at Sichuan University, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But because security and military ties are under-developed to begin with this won't have a big impact on the overall relationship."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Bappa Majumdar in New Delhi and Chris Buckley in China; Editing by Alistair Scrutton and Alex Richardson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Adds quotes, details, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Raushan Nurshayeva&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ASTANA, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan may exceed its oil
output target this year on the back of higher oil production
from a Chevron-led (CVX.N) venture, the head of Kazakh state
firm said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think oil production in Kazakhstan may exceed 80 million
tonnes (1.6 million barrels per day) this year and reach 82-83
million, mainly thanks to TengizChevroil," said Kairgeldy
Kabyldin, chief of KazMunaiGas [KMG.UL].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Oil production at Tengiz will be 25 million tonnes," he
added. The venture had previously planned to produce 23.5
million tonnes this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apart from Chevron and KazMunaiGas, Tengiz's shareholders
are Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Russia's LUKOIL (LKOH.MM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kazakhstan has doubled its oil output over the past decade
to become the second-biggest producer in the region after
Russia, as output grew at production sharing agreements with
foreign majors, such as Tengiz or Karachaganak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The country wants to further increase production, doubling
current levels when another foreign group led by Italy's ENI
(ENI.MI) launches its huge Kashagan oil field on the Caspian
Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kashagan has been hit by repeated delays because of cost
overruns and as Kazakhstan became increasingly assertive with
foreign investors and sought to win bigger stakes in foreign
ventures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kabyldin said KazMunaiGas would increase oil output to 24
million tonnes by 2014 from the current 20 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The company's strategic goal, set by the board, is to join
the list of 30 leading global oil companies... The level of
reserves will reach 790 million tonnes by 2014," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Raushan Nurshayeva, writing by Dmitry

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Socialite, celebrity TV and Web site favorite Paris Hilton has been released by Las Vegas police after her arrest for possessing cocaine on Friday night, her lawyer said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Paris Hilton was released this morning on her own recognizance.

She was detained after a World Cup soccer match in South Africa in July on suspicion of marijuana possession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hilton was swiftly released without charge after South African police said the marijuana was in the possession of a friend accompanying Hilton to the soccer match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Las Vegas incident, Hilton was reportedly a passenger in the car. The driver, said to be her boyfriend, nightclub manager Cy Waits, was charged with driving under the influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After her release from jail, Hilton sent a message on her Twitter account saying she was going to bed, but not mentioning the arrest. Hilton's publicist did not return calls for comment on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TMZ.com, citing sources close to Hilton, said she is saying that the purse in which police say they found the cocaine does not belong to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hilton, the great-granddaughter of Hilton hotels founder Conrad Hilton, has worked as a model, singer, actress, fashion designer and reality TV star.

last 4 to 5 weeks, the source, who declined to be identified,
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The project will not change the capacity of the refinery, an
executive from Exxon Mobil's chemical unit said last year. He
had expected the project to come online by 2012. [ID:nL694614]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Reem Shamseddine; Editing by John Stonestreet)

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Paris Hilton was charged on Monday with cocaine possession after a high-profile arrest in Las Vegas during the weekend, but the socialite is unlikely to do a second stint behind bars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hilton, 29, faces up to four years in a Nevada prison if convicted of the felony charge of possessing 0.8 grams of "powder cocaine" in a purse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Los Angeles Times, quoting a legal expert, said Hilton was more likely to be sentenced to a diversion program if prosecutors are able to prove their case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hilton and her boyfriend, Cy Waits, were stopped just before midnight on Friday after police said they smelled marijuana smoke coming from their vehicle. When a crowd formed, they were taken to the nearby Wynn Hotel for some privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The police report details that when Hilton asked to get some lip balm from her purse, an officer saw "a small bindle of what I believed to be cocaine in a clear baggy" and the bindle fell from the purse into the officer's hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hilton told police she had borrowed the purse from a friend, and she thought the cocaine was gum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Los Angeles Times quoted Dmitry Gorin, a former Los Angeles County prosecutor and noted defense attorney, as saying that prosecutors would need to prove that it was Hilton's purse and also have to overcome any doubts that the marijuana smell came from her vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar arrests are often made on the Las Vegas Strip, and most end up in some kind of diversion program unless the person has a lengthy prior record, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hilton has had dust-ups with the law, but she is not quite a hardened criminal. She spent three weeks in a Los Angeles jail in 2007 for violating probation on a reckless driving charge. In July, she was detained on suspicion of possessing marijuana in South Africa following a World Cup soccer match, but was released by police and not charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After her latest arrest, her lawyers issued a statement encouraging people "not to rush to judgment until all of the facts have been dealt with in a court of law." There was no further statement from the lawyers on Monday, and court officials in Las Vegas also declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Dean Goodman)&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

Buffett Gets 20% of Munger`s Wesco

Yesterday, Warren Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
(NYSE: BRK.B) announced its intention to buy 20% of Wesco Financial Corp. (NYSE:
WSC), a company run and controlled by Charles T. Munger. 

Following approval by shareholders` of both the companies, the Wesco deal will
be financed by a combination of cash and Class-B shares (Buffett uses Class-B
shares for acquisitions) based on the book value to the acquiring company. As
per book value of $353 per share at the end of June 30, 2010, the deal will cost
$514 million to Buffett. 

Pasadena, California-based Wesco is 80.1% owned by Blue Chip Stamps (Blue Chip),
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Berkshire since 1973. Thus, Wesco and its
subsidiaries are controlled by Blue Chip and Berkshire. All of these companies
may also be deemed to be under the control of Buffett, who owns of 24.3% of
Wesco`s stock. 

Munger is also the vice chairman of Berkshire and consults with Buffett on
Wesco`s investment decisions, major capital allocations and the selection of
chief executives to head each of its operating businesses. 

Wesco`s activities fall into three business segments - insurance, furniture
rental and industrial. The insurance segment consists of the operations of
Wesco-Financial Insurance Co. and Kansas Bankers Surety Co. The furniture rental
segment consists of the operations of CORT Business Services Corp. The
industrial segment comprises Precision Steel`s service center and industrial
supply operations. Wesco also holds shares in some of the same companies as
Berkshire, like Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE: PG), and Wells
Fargo (NYSE: WFC). 

Wesco continues to have a strong consolidated balance sheet, with high liquidity
and relatively little debt. Its equity investments are in strong, well-known
companies. Wesco reported a 1.8% year-over-year increase in 2009 revenues to
reach $813.3 million. 

Buffett intends to convert Wesco into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Berkshire, to
deploy enormous cash of approximately $28 billion at Berkshire and also to
simplify operations at Wesco. Besides Munger is already 86 and would not carry
on with the role of its chairman for long. 

Berkshire houses a diverse array of over 80 businesses which are categorized
into - Insurance, Regulated Utility, Manufacturing, Service &amp; Retail and Finance
&amp; Financial Products. Some of the companies, which run these businesses are 100%
owned, some are owned up to 80% while other positions merely involves big blocks
of stocks.

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

NetFlix App for Apple Devices

A leading provider of online movie rental and Web video subscription services,
Netflix Inc. (Nasdaq: NFLX) announced the release of its application to Apple
Inc.`s (Nasdaq: AAPL) iPod and iPhone Touch handheld devices. The application
will allow streaming of movies and TV shows via both Wi-Fi and 3G networks for
free. 

The Neflix application (app) is used for intuitive viewing of movies and TV
shows and requires a Netflix membership. Netflix subscribers who are already
using its service for $8.99 per month will be able to view their selected TV
episodes and movies from Netflix to their iPhone and iPod touch. 

Netflix is already delivering first-run movies on a broad range of devices,
which subscribers can access through different platforms such as Apple`s iPad,
personal computers, laptops, mobile phones and game consoles such as Microsoft
Corp.`s (Nasdaq: MSFT) Xbox 360, Sony Corp.`s (Nasdaq: SNE) PS3 and Nintendo`s
Wii. 

Netflix is broadening its footprint in the mobile market. In our view, the
Netflix app for iPhone and iPod device will allow the company to increase its
market share in the mobile segment as well as expand its subscriber base and
open up new avenues for top-line growth over the long term. 

The Netflix app will support any iPhone or iPod touch device running on the iOS
version 3.13 or later and will be available from any App Store, the company
said. 

Netflix`s members can choose movies or TV episodes from a wide range of lists
available and can instantly view the chosen program with the help of the
multi-touch user interface. It also contains add-on features such as
fast-forward, rewind, saving or stopping the video stream at any time.
Additionally, Netflix allows users to manage their movie queue on the screen
even on different devices capable of streaming from Netflix. 

Fred`s Meets, Affirms Outlook

Fred 's Inc. (Nasdaq: FRED) posted EPS of 14 cents in its second quarter of
fiscal 2010, which matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate and came in ahead of 13
cents reported in the year-ago quarter. Comparable store sales growth, increased
traffic driven by Fred`s sales and profit-driving initiatives resulted in the
earnings outperformance. 

Including the effect of higher income taxes, EPS in the quarter came in at 13
cents compared to 11 cents in the year-ago quarter, an 18% rise. 

Total sales increased 4% year-over-year to $449.5 million, missing the Zacks
Consensus Estimate of $452.0 million. The revenue growth also fell short of the
company`s guided range of 5% to 7%. Comparable store sales for the quarter
increased 2.5% compared with a decrease of 1.3% in the year-ago quarter.
Same-store sales were near the lower end of the company`s expectations of 2% to
4% for the quarter. 

On a monthly basis, comparable store sales increased 3.5%, 1.7% and 2.7% in May,
June and July, respectively. Comparable store sales, in all the three months,
were boosted by increased traffic, improved sales mix, solid comparable script
growth in the pharmacy department and strong Core 5 department results. 

May comparable store sales particularly benefited from a strong finish before
the Memorial Day holiday, driven by advertising circulars and success of new
sales-driving initiatives put in place. In July, the comparable sales were
somewhat negatively affected by 75 basis points due to a shift in the retail
calendar that eliminated the first-of-the-month sales benefit for July.
Notwithstanding, the pharmacy department continued to post positive script
gains.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/bc4bea/computer_manufactu) has
announced the addition of the "Computer Manufacture" report to their offering. 

The US computer manufacturing industry includes about 1,200 companies with
combined annual revenue of about $65 billion. Major companies include Dell,
Hewlett-Packard, and IBM. The industry is highly concentrated: the top 50
companies generate about 90 percent of revenue. 

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE 

Demand is tied to consumer and business income. The profitability of individual
computer companies depends on purchasing and production efficiencies, and on
technological expertise. Large companies have economies of scale in purchasing
and production. Small companies can compete successfully by specializing in
certain products or by developing superior technology. The industry is
capital-intensive: annual revenue per employee is about $400,000. 

PRODUCTS, OPERATIONS &amp; TECHNOLOGY 

Major products include PCs, printers, monitors, mainframes, servers, and disk
drives. Computers, mainframes, and servers account for 65 percent of industry
revenue. Input/output devices (including monitors, printers, keyboards, and
mice) make up 20 percent of revenue; storage devices, about 10 percent. 

The manufacturing process for PCs consists of integrating circuit boards, disk
drives, and input/output devices into a final product. Companies typically
assemble PCs from components bought from other manufacturers. Key components
like "motherboards" are specially made for a particular product, while disk
drives and other components may be off-the-shelf parts. Despite automation
gains, some assembly work is still labor-intensive. Manufacturers of specialized
devices like printers, monitors, and disk drives may also buy some components
from outside vendors. The manufacture of some products requires highly
sophisticated machinery.

</body></entry><entry author="Bill Rigby" date="2010-08-30T16:16:39+0000" url="http://www.reuters.com/article/americasPrivateEquityNews/idUSTRE67T3QI20100830"><headline>Analysis: Hedge funds see Microsoft as a bargain</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Top hedge fund managers like Dinakar Singh and David Einhorn scooped up Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) shares in the second quarter, taking advantage of historically low price-to-earnings multiples for the world's largest software company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft -- whose systems run more than 90 percent of the world's personal computers -- saw its shares fall sharply last quarter, even as Wall Street analysts forecast rising profits in the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decline means the stock is now trading around 10 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, close to its lowest multiple on record and a 70 percent discount to peers, according to StarMine data. And taking into account Microsoft's $37 billion of cash, the true multiple is more like 8, some investors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's insanely cheap for a company of this caliber and market position," said Whitney Tilson, managing partner of T2 Partners LLC and the Tilson Mutual Funds, who bought Microsoft shares in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most investors seem to have concluded that the growth days of the stock are over, a growing faction of savvy hedge funds -- including Singh's TPG Axon, Einhorn's Greenlight Capital, John Griffin's Blue Ridge and Thomas Claugus's GMT Capital -- see an undervalued opportunity in the huge and increasing profits delivered by the Windows 7 operating system and Office franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interest from such fund managers helped make Microsoft one of the largest additions in the second quarter Smart Money survey, compiled by Thomson Reuters, of the portfolios of 30 of the biggest fundamentally-oriented hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For a chart showing Microsoft's P/E ratio relative to its peers, and comparing net profit to its share price, see link.reuters.com/xeb37n.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE APPLE PROBLEM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company took a hit to its prestige in May when old rival Apple Inc (AAPL.O) surged past it in market value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple is much less profitable than Microsoft, but it is rewarded with a higher multiple by investors excited by a stream of innovative products like the iPhone and iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of Microsoft's value is overlooked in comparison, said Patrick Becker Jr at Becker Capital Management, also a holder of the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a perception issue with them (Microsoft). For whatever reason, if you do well with the consumer, you get a higher multiple on your stock," he said. "Microsoft doesn't get very much credit for what they do on the business side and the dominant share they have there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some Microsoft problems are more than perception. Despite its seemingly unassailable dominance in the business software sector, some investors worry the company has no response to the iPad, which threatens to wean consumers off netbooks and may work its way into corporate life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its new phone software -- due to debut in the next few months -- needs to make up a lot of lost ground, and its money-losing Bing search engine has not made any great inroads on Google (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock is suffering under the weight of those doubts, some investors say, falling 21 percent in the second quarter, compared to a 12 percent fall in the Standard  Poor's 500 index. Some hedge funds, including Appaloosa Management, Chilton Investment Co and Pennant Capital Management, took the opportunity to trim their holdings in Microsoft last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tablets -- the iPad in particular -- and the smartphone market are major overhangs and discounted heavily in the stock," said Ken Allen at Baltimore-based portfolio manager T. Rowe Price, whose Science and Technology Fund has Microsoft as a major holding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORE VALUE, LESS GROWTH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consensus view appears to be that Microsoft is now more of a value investment than a growth opportunity. The company has played its part in that, introducing a dividend in 2003 and paying a special dividend of $3 per share the following year. It is expected to increase its quarterly dividend next month from the 13 cents per share it has paid out for the last eight quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a record of them returning excess cash to shareholders," said Becker. "I don't think you'll see a special (dividend) out of them, but they will continue to raise the regular dividend and do share buybacks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's value momentum -- which can signal that a stock may soon revert to historical valuation levels -- is now greater than 83 percent of U.S. companies, according to StarMine data. That view is shared by some investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The stock is unsustainably cheap here," said Allen at T. Rowe Price. "Their medium-term growth outlook is really strong. The market is saying the company's growth phase is over and it has these secular concerns. I'm saying the growth phase is continuing and I feel better than the market does about their progress."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others are betting only that Microsoft is a winner in the medium term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google Apps and other competitive threats may well come true -- we're simply betting that they don't come true in the next six to 18 months," said Tilson. "There are a lot of big-cap blue chips that are very cheap, and we own a number of them. But this one is particularly compelling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; editing by Aaron Pressman and John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

And taking into account Microsoft's$37 billion of cash, the true multiple is more like 8, someinvestors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "That's insanely cheap for a company of this caliber andmarket position," said Whitney Tilson, managing partner of T2Partners LLC and the Tilson Mutual Funds, who bought Microsoftshares in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    While most investors seem to have concluded that the growthdays of the stock are over, a growing faction of savvy hedgefunds -- including Singh's TPG Axon, Einhorn's GreenlightCapital, John Griffin's Blue Ridge and Thomas Claugus's GMTCapital -- see an undervalued opportunity in the huge andincreasing profits delivered by the Windows 7 operating systemand Office franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Interest from such fund managers helped make Microsoft oneof the largest additions in the second quarter Smart Moneysurvey, compiled by Thomson Reuters, of the portfolios of 30 ofthe biggest fundamentally-oriented hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    (For a chart showing Microsoft's P/E ratio relative to itspeers, and comparing net profit to its share price, seelink.reuters.com/xeb37n.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    THE APPLE PROBLEM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Redmond, Washington-based company took a hit to itsprestige in May when old rival Apple Inc (AAPL.O) surged pastit in market value. [ID:nLDE64Q0CG]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Apple is much less profitable than Microsoft, but it isrewarded with a higher multiple by investors excited by astream of innovative products like the iPhone and iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A lot of Microsoft's value is overlooked in comparison,said Patrick Becker Jr at Becker Capital Management, also aholder of the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It's a perception issue with them (Microsoft). Forwhatever reason, if you do well with the consumer, you get ahigher multiple on your stock," he said. "Microsoft doesn't getvery much credit for what they do on the business side and thedominant share they have there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But some Microsoft problems are more than perception.Despite its seemingly unassailable dominance in the businesssoftware sector, some investors worry the company has noresponse to the iPad, which threatens to wean consumers offnetbooks and may work its way into corporate life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Its new phone software -- due to debut in the next fewmonths -- needs to make up a lot of lost ground, and itsmoney-losing Bing search engine has not made any great inroadson Google (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The stock is suffering under the weight of those doubts,some investors say, falling 21 percent in the second quarter,compared to a 12 percent fall in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500index. Some hedge funds, including Appaloosa Management,Chilton Investment Co and Pennant Capital Management, took theopportunity to trim their holdings in Microsoft last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Tablets -- the iPad in particular -- and the smartphonemarket are major overhangs and discounted heavily in thestock," said Ken Allen at Baltimore-based portfolio manager T.Rowe Price, whose Science and Technology Fund has Microsoft asa major holding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    MORE VALUE, LESS GROWTH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The consensus view appears to be that Microsoft is now moreof a value investment than a growth opportunity.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Socialite, celebrity TV and Web site favorite Paris Hilton has been released by Las Vegas police after her arrest for possessing cocaine on Friday night, her lawyer said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Paris Hilton was released this morning on her own recognizance. This matter will be dealt with in the courts, not in the media and I encourage people not to rush to judgment until all of the facts have been dealt with in a court of law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There will be no interviews and no more comments at this time," lawyer David Chernoff said in a statement posted on the celebrity website TMZ.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hilton, 29, a reality TV star and a staple of celebrity red carpets, was arrested in Las Vegas after a traffic stop during which police said they found an undisclosed amount of cocaine was in her purse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photographers snapped pictures of police arresting Hilton on the busy Las Vegas strip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the second drug-related incident for Hilton in two months. She was detained after a World Cup soccer match in South Africa in July on suspicion of marijuana possession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hilton was swiftly released without charge after South African police said the marijuana was in the possession of a friend accompanying Hilton to the soccer match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Las Vegas incident, Hilton was reportedly a passenger in the car. The driver, said to be her boyfriend, nightclub manager Cy Waits, was charged with driving under the influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After her release from jail, Hilton sent a message on her Twitter account saying she was going to bed, but not mentioning the arrest. Hilton's publicist did not return calls for comment on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TMZ.com, citing sources close to Hilton, said she is saying that the purse in which police say they found the cocaine does not belong to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hilton, the great-granddaughter of Hilton hotels founder Conrad Hilton, has worked as a model, singer, actress, fashion designer and reality TV star. She runs multimillion-dollar businesses based on her name including clothing lines, fragrances and wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She famously spent three weeks in a Los Angeles jail in 2007 for violating her probation in an earlier reckless driving charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Eric Beech, Jill Serjeant and Jim Christie; editing by Eric Walsh and Todd Eastham)&lt;/p&gt;

document signing solution that complements any green initiative. This
application is available now and can be downloaded from @Ware at
www.edottedline.com. 

"The release of @Ware`s eDottedLine further extends the capabilities of the
DocuSign electronic signature platform within the Microsoft Office environment.

eDottedLine is a software add-in that extends DocuSign`s electronic signature
technology to Microsoft Outlook. This powerful application increases
productivity by bringing the convenience of DocuSign`s electronic signature
process into Outlook. DocuSign`s collaborative model is integrated into this
workflow, creating an intuitive and precise end-to-end experience. With
eDottedLine, the electronic signature experience leverages key Outlook
functionality and content:

* An easy-to-follow wizard guides the user through one of three possible
DocuSign processes: free form signing, browser-based tagging and full template
support. All predefined template settings are back-filled into the Outlook
e-mail message to create a complete record of each electronic signature
transaction. 
* Transaction receipts are created as Outlook Tasks with due dates set to the
expiration dates of the corresponding DocuSign envelopes. 
* By synchronizing Outlook Tasks, the completion status of each envelope is
updated. For each completed transaction, a final PDF document copy is downloaded
and archived automatically as a task attachment. These task receipts provide a
dashboard view of the user`s electronic signature transactions and allow the
user to benefit from Outlook notifications. 
* Outlook Contacts can be synchronized within the DocuSign Address Book with
just a single mouse-click. Specific Outlook Contact folders and/or Contact items
can be included or excluded giving the user complete control and flexibility.
Outlook recipients are mapped to DocuSign users and Outlook`s rich address
resolution is extended to the DocuSign transaction.

@Ware`s plug-and-play architecture allows electronic signature transactions to
be recorded within other third-party Web services. A broadcasting agent allows
the same documents to be sent to many recipients with just a single email
message, which includes distribution list support. 

"DocuSign has ascended rapidly as the global gold standard for electronic
signature technology," said James Harvey, president and chief executive officer
of @Ware. "Outlook has been the gold standard for desktop communication for the
past 16 years. The synergistic benefits of bringing these two technologies

&lt;p&gt;MONROVIA Aug 30 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) has signed
a deal with Liberia to explore for oil and gas in three
deepwater blocks off the West African country's coast, an
official in the president's office said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The exploratory work, which has been submitted to parliament
for approval, is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of this
year and will last three years, the official said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Liberia is slowly recovering from nearly 15 years of
conflict that only ended in 2003. Prospects for tapping into oil
were boosted last year when a consortium led by Anadarko
Petroleum Corp (APC.N) made a find in Sierra Leone, near
Liberia's border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are delighted to welcome Chevron as a partner for
Liberia to explore out oil and gas assets," Liberian
presidential press secretary Cyrus Badio said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Along with its involvement, Chevron will bring the latest
technologies, best practices in transparency and efficiencies
and an excellent record of community and social responsibility."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No further details were given on the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The gradual return to peace has led to mining and
agriculture companies launching projects worth billions of
dollars in Liberia, but its development remains fragile and
elections are due next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who came to power in 2006,
is likely to stand for re-election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She has been praised for restoring stability and encouraging
investors, which include ArcelorMittal (ISPA.AS) and the world's
biggest miner BHP Billiton (BHP.AX) (BLT.L), though critics say
she has failed to crack down on corruption.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING--(Business Wire)--
Diversified industrial manufacturer Eaton Corporation today announced the
formation of an alliance to accelerate the deployment of electric vehicles in
cities across China. NESTIA, the New Energy Sustainable Transportation
International Alliance, includes Eaton, AECOM, IBM, vehicle manufacturer Beiqi
Foton Motor Co., lithium ion battery manufacturer MGL and electric motor
provider Broad Ocean. The announcement took place at the Third Annual China
Green Energy Auto Development Summit Forum hosted by Foton. 

NESTIA`s first project is to design and deploy electric buses that will utilize
advanced components from Eaton, Broad Ocean and MGL. 

"Bringing together the leading experts in city planning and smart grid
infrastructures with Eaton`s hybrid and electric vehicle technology will offer
energy saving solutions to cities wishing to accelerate the adoption of clean
energy vehicles and has the potential to rapidly advance the adoption of new
technology in China," said Joe-Tao Zhou, president of Eaton in China. 

NESTIA is part of a broader new global alliance between Eaton, AECOM and IBM to
advance the adoption of clean energy vehicles, from plug-in to full electric
across public and private transportation sectors in key markets worldwide. The
group will place special focus on deployment of clean energy vehicles in taxi,
bus, refuse and sanitation fleets, along with the accompanying charging
infrastructure. 

The new alliances combine expertise to address areas needed to accelerate the
deployment of electric vehicles, including:

* Preparation of a master plan for public and private electric vehicle battery
swapping and charging station networks to leverage the deployment of electric
vehicle networks as a catalyst for improved mobility, land use and economic
growth; 
* Design and development of plug-in and electric vehicles and electric vehicle
service equipment utilizing a global and local supply chain; 
* Implementation of a public electric vehicle charging station network
infrastructure that includes associated procurement and construction management
services; 
* Review of a utility company`s grid infrastructure for its ability to support
the new load requirements and a smart meter infrastructure and systems for
utility companies; and 
* Assistance for utility companies in preparing a portfolio of business
applications for enhancement and integration to electric vehicle-specific
systems.

"This type of solution offering is a great example of how AECOM can leverage our
expertise in integrated sustainable transportation, planning and design to offer
unique value to cities that are looking to support electric vehicles," said Sean
Chiao, executive vice president for AECOM China. "AECOM's continued success
reflects our commitment to be the best at what we do globally - and to serving
the best interests of our clients around the world." 

"IBM understands the demands and challenges organizations, businesses and
communities face when they begin the adoption of electric vehicles into their
transportation mix," said Brad Gammons, IBM Vice President of Energy and
Utilities. "Working within the partnership we will provide systems integration
and implementations tools that can help to create a robust business and
technical EV infrastructure."

&lt;p&gt;http://www.zacks.com/
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Research Equity Strategist, Dirk Van Dijk says that S 500 earnings are
continuing to show red ink. He tracks companies on the Zacks.com web site,
naming names, while forecasting trends for the months ahead. 

Earnings to Recover by 2011

Earnings will have fully recovered by mid-2011, and that full-year 2011 earnings
will be 8.6% above full-year 2007 earnings (before the Great Recession started).
That is years before we are likely to see a full recovery in the job market.
Collectively the 500 firms in the S 500 earned $548.8 billion in "2009," and
that is going to grow to $778.5 billion this year and $895.1 billion in 2011.
Translated into "EPS" for the index, earnings are expected to rise from $57.85
in 2009 to $81.81 in 2010 and $94.34 in 2011. 

In other words, then, the S 500 is selling for 18.4 x 2009 earnings, but just
12.8x 2010 and 11.1x 2011 earnings. By historical standards that is quite cheap.
Normally, when interest rates and inflation are low, P/E ratios are higher than
average. Well we currently have some of the lowest rates of inflation in decades
and interest rates are at near record lows. It only costs the government 2.48%
to borrow for 10 years. (These numbers are based on Thursday 8/26; stocks moved
sharply higher on 8/27, as did t-note yields). It is not hard to find good solid
blue chip companies that are providing dividend yields of more than that, and
not just a bunch of electric utilities either. 

One thing is certain: the coupon on a 10 year t-note will not increase over the
next 10 years. The odds of the likes of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) 3.70%,
Chevron (NYSE: CVX) 3.90%, or DuPont (NYSE: DD) 4.10%, increasing their dividend
in the next 10 years is pretty high. Currently 159 S 500 stocks yield over
2.48%, and 107 of those have payout ratios of less than 60%. 

Earnings that are not paid out in dividends are reinvested for future growth, or
are used to buy back stock, which also lifts earnings per share. Based on this
year`s earnings, the earnings yield is 7.81% and based on next year it is 9.01%.

Featured Post

Financial Stocks Continue to Struggle

This morning the large major financial institutions continue to struggle.
Recently, all the financial stocks have traded down towards or at new lows for
the year, and today the weakness remains. Stocks such as Bank of America Corp
(NYSE: BAC), J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. (NYSE:
WFC) remain at or near the lows for 2010. Financial stocks such as Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (NYSE: GS), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) are both still trading
above their July lows. However, while these two stocks are categorized as bank
holding companies they are still basically giant hedge funds. 

The financial stocks are still the most important sector in the market. Remember
this is the sector that was saved by the Toxic Asset Relief Program (TARP) by
the U.S. Treasury in 2008. These stocks have had huge amounts of liquidity
pumped into them since that time. They can still borrow money from the Federal
Reserve Bank at basically zero percent today and buy U.S. Treasuries to make
money. These financial institutions can maintain their credit card business and
make money. Essentially, they no longer need to lend money to make money.
Therefore, if these stocks continue to decline it could be signaling bigger
problems are ahead. 

When the financial stocks fail to rally for more than a day or so it is a sign
of market weakness. Many economists are now beginning to call for more stimulus
by the government. If the first stimulus plan only worked for a year how long
would another stimulus package work? Recently the European Union bailed out its
banks with a $1 trillion injection into the financial stocks. So far the
European Union remains off it's recent lows, however, it still remains weak.
This week we may just drift sideways. However, once volume comes back into the
market after the Labor Day holiday these financial stock must be watched with a
microscope.

broader financial reform law that limits the extent to which
banks can bet with their own capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), for example, is looking at
turning its proprietary equity trading unit into a hedge fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks have time to comply with the law, but many are eager
to figure out how to deal with the business soon, before antsy
traders jump to hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's commodities proprietary trading desk has fewer
than 20 traders, with one based in the United States and the
rest in the United Kingdom, the source said. The U.K.-based
traders were informed last week that their jobs may be in
jeopardy, in compliance with British law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bloomberg, which first reported the story, said that
traders will be given a chance to apply for jobs elsewhere in
the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan declined to comment.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 31 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase and Co (JPM.N)
is shutting down its proprietary trading desks as new U.S. laws
limit the ability of banks to trade their own money, Bloomberg
reported on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan told commodities traders that bet for the bank's
account that their desk was going to be shut down, the news
wire reported, citing a person briefed on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Proprietary trading in fixed-income and equities will be
shut down later, Bloomberg reported, citing the person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The commodities proprietary trading desk has fewer than 20

&lt;p&gt;Green VLP RDIMM Sets Server Threshold for Lower Memory Power Use and Extremely
Compact Design
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
In the first graph, the product name should read: IBM HS22V blade server (sted
IBM H22V blade server). 

The corrected release reads: 

SAMSUNG UNVEILS FIRST 16GB `VERY LOW PROFILE` MODULEIN IBM`S NEWEST BLADE SERVER

Green VLP RDIMM Sets Server Threshold for Lower Memory Power Use and Extremely
Compact Design

Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., the world leader in advanced memory technology,
announced today that it will demonstrate for the first time a 16-Gigabyte (GB),
very low profile (VLP) memory module at VMworld 2010 in an IBM HS22V blade
server, running on Intel Xeon 5600-series processors. 

Based on 4-gigabit (Gb), 40 nanometer (nm)-class* DDR3, the new modules use 18
4Gb dual-die packaged (DDP) chips, and operate on 1.35 volts of electrical
current. The 16GB 40nm-class DDR3 memory provides a powerful green solution,
consuming 70 percent less power than four 4GB DDR3 modules and over 40 percent
less than two 8GB modules, in setting a new "standard" for lower power
consumption in servers. The module`s very low profile (18.75 mm high) allows it
to be used in extremely compact blade servers. 

High-density, 40nm-class DDR3 will benefit data center mangers, IT directors and
server farm managers who need to work with large data sets at significantly
faster speeds than those offered by most servers on the market today. 

"We are informing the market that not only are higher density, low-voltage
memory modules going to be in greater demand very soon, but that they are
already being readied for market in the latest blade servers from IBM," said Jim
Elliott, vice president, memory marketing and product planning, Samsung
Semiconductor, Inc. 

"High density, low-profile memory can allow for increased performance on
database applications and offer advantages when it comes to power usage and
savings. Samsung's module is helping us deliver up to 50% more total memory
capacity on our IBM BladeCenter Servers, enabling support for more virtual
machines," said Brian Sanders, director of marketing, System x, IBM. IBM is
offering the module in its HS22 and HS22V blade servers. 

The module consumes up to20 percent less power than a 1.5V DDR3 and over 80
percent less than a 1.8V DDR2. Each IBM HS22V offers up to 288GBs with Samsung`s
DDR3 16GB DIMMs (dual in-line memory modules), while the HS22 provides up to
192GBs.

&lt;p&gt;Green VLP RDIMM Sets Server Threshold for Lower Memory Power Use and Extremely
Compact Design
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., the world leader in advanced memory technology,
announced today that it will demonstrate for the first time a 16-Gigabyte (GB),
very low profile (VLP) memory module at the VM World 2010 in an IBM H22V blade
server, running on Intel Xeon 5600-series processors. 

Based on 4-gigabit (Gb), 40 nanometer (nm)-class* DDR3, the new modules use 18
4Gb dual-die packaged (DDP) chips, and operate on 1.35 volts of electrical
current. The 16GB 40nm-class DDR3 memory provides a powerful green solution,
consuming 70 percent less power than four 4GB DDR3 modules and over 40 percent
less than two 8GB modules, in setting a new "standard" for lower power
consumption in servers. The module`s very low profile (18.75 mm high) allows it
to be used in extremely compact blade servers. 

High-density, 40nm-class DDR3 will benefit data center mangers, IT directors and
server farm managers who need to work with large data sets at significantly
faster speeds than those offered by most servers on the market today. 

"We are informing the market that not only are higher density, low-voltage
memory modules going to be in greater demand very soon, but that they are
already being readied for market in the latest blade servers from IBM," said Jim
Elliott, vice president, memory marketing and product planning, Samsung
Semiconductor, Inc. 

"High density, low-profile memory can allow for increased performance on
database applications and offer advantages when it comes to power usage and
savings. Samsung's module is helping us deliver up to 50% more total memory
capacity on our IBM BladeCenter Servers, enabling support for more virtual
machines," said Brian Sanders, director of marketing, System x, IBM. IBM is
offering the module in its HS22 and HS22V blade servers. 

The module consumes up to20 percent less power than a 1.5V DDR3 and over 80
percent less than a 1.8V DDR2. Each IBM HS22V offers up to 288GBs with Samsung`s
DDR3 16GB DIMMs (dual in-line memory modules), while the HS22 provides up to
192GBs.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Aug 31 (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) has filled the
newly created role of global head of commodities strategy
following the takeover of RBS Sempra, a spokesman for the bank
said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Colin Fenton, previously chief executive officer at
investment advisory firm Curium Capital Advisors started work on
Monday, the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The hire forms part of a broader reshuffle following the
purchase of RBS Sempra Commodities' non-U.S. business, completed
in July. Trade sources said last month that the bank cut between
40-50 positions in its commodities business. [ID:nLDE66L0WL]

&lt;p&gt;Evidence of Chevron`s "Stunning Hypocrisy" and Lies to U.S. Federal Courts
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
A U.S. Federal Court has been presented with two separate audits conducted at
Chevron`s request that show "clear and convincing evidence" that the oil giant
knowingly dumped billions of gallons of toxic waste directly into the Amazon and
subsequently lied to cover it up, according to a legal brief by the 30,000
Ecuadorian rainforest residents suing the company for the illegal dumping. 

The two separate audits, commissioned by Chevron`s predecessor company Texaco as
it was wrapping up operations in Ecuador from 1990-92, found that the oil
contamination "require[d] remediation at all production facilities." The audits
also demonstrate deliberate contamination by Texaco, noting that the company
failed to protect surface water quality and intentionally dumped untreated toxic
waste directly into the streams and rivers of the jungle. 

The findings of the audits - presented for the first time in a U.S. federal
court as part of a battle over various discovery requests related to the Ecuador
litigation - stand in stark contrast to Chevron&#180;s numerous sworn statements that
there is "no evidence that Chevron is responsible for any environmental damage"
in Ecuador, made in multiple filings in recent weeks in several different
federal courts. 

Chevron`s public denials of damage to the region given the extraordinary
findings in its audits are "shocking and cynical," according to Ilann Maazel, an
attorney for the Amazon residents. "These audits definitively prove that Chevron
is guilty of contaminating Ecuador&#180;s rainforest and that the company is now
shamelessly lying about that undisputed fact to U.S. courts," he said. 

"It is incredible that Chevron lawyers make sworn statements that there is no
damage in the region even while their own audits unequivocally state the exact
opposite," said Maazel. "Chevron has consistently and intentionally made such
false statements to federal judges in a cynical attempt to hide the extent of
the contamination caused by its operations." 

Some of the shocking findings of the audits, which were conducted by two Chevron
sub-contractors and paid for by the company, are:

* "All twenty-two production stations are currently, or have at some time,
discharged oily produced water to the environment and flared excess gas. The
stations have produced a total of approximately 1.4 billion barrels of oil, 250
million cubic feet of gas and 375 million barrels of produced water during the
period 1964 to 1990." 
* "The audit identified hydrocarbon contamination requiring remediation at all
production facilities and a majority of the drill sites." 
* "Produced water (which contains carcinogens and toxic heavy metals) is being
discharged to the environment in all cases." 
* "Produced waste is then passed through a series of open, unlined pits. The
remaining oil emulsion and produced water is discharged into a local creek or
river or in some instances directly into the jungle...Produced water has
historically not been tested prior to disposal&#8230;" 
* "Contamination of soil and water was observed at well sites, production
stations and along roadways, flowlines and secondary pipelines." 
* "Workover, completion wastes, salt solutions and oil/water emulsions have
historically been disposed of into well site pits. &#8230; Little maintenance has
reportedly been done on any of the pits at the well sites."

* "[Texaco`s] operation included the intentional burning of crude oil from
spills and contained in pits. This operation usually created large amounts of
black smoke and soot that can potentially impair the environment and human
health."

Both audits were relied upon by a court-ordered damages assessment that found
that Chevron could be responsible for up to $27.3 billion in environmental
damages and remediation costs. Chevron&#180;s lawyers have called the report
"scientifically bankrupt" but thus far have refused to comment on their own
audits, which were conducted in the early 1990s as the company was winding down
its operations in Ecuador. 

The audits were conducted by HBT Agra and Fugro McClelland, two Chevron
sub-contractors. They are part of the evidence in the Ecuador trial. 

Chevron, through its predecessor company Texaco, operated in Ecuador from
1964-1990. The lawsuit, originally filed by 30,000 Ecuadorians in New York in
1993, was transferred to Ecuador at Chevron`s request. Since the trial began in
Ecuador, more than 64,000 scientific sampling results and a 200,000-page trial
record, has created a mountain of evidence demonstrating Chevron`s
responsibility for the environmental devastation in the region, said Maazel.

Gulf Coast Tourism Declines Sharply from May to June Following Oil Spill
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
A new report Tourism Outlook: USA from Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) indicates the tourism
industry has begun to rebound during the first six months of 2010. From Jan. 1 -
June 30, 2010, spending by international visitors to the U.S. on their
Visa-branded payment cards was up 20 percent over 2009 levels. At the same time,
Americans are spending at higher levels when traveling internationally: spending
by U.S. travelers abroad on Visa cards was up 9.3 percent in the first quarter
of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. 

"The United States continues to be a major source market for international
tourism and a popular destination for travelers around the globe. The growth in
inbound spending in early 2010, particularly from source markets such as China
and Brazil, reinforces how Asia-Pacific and South America are seemingly the
first to emerge and rebound from the challenging environment that defined 2008
and 2009," said Bill Sheedy, president, North America, Visa Inc. 

In 2009, spending by international visitors declined 12 percent from $32.9
billion in 2008 to $28.9 billion based on a challenging socio-economic
environment. Top source countries for inbound tourism to the U.S. during
calendar year 2009 and the first two quarters of 2010 (Jan. 1 - June 30, 2010)
are detailed below.

Tourism Impact: The Gulf Region Oil Spill

Visa is actively working with tourism operators and organizations across the
Gulf region to provide spending data and insights that will help them evaluate
the short-and long-term impacts of the recent oil spill crisis. 

While the oil spill did not result in an immediate impact in the weeks following
the spill - May Visa transaction data reveals tourism spending was up over 2009
levels - tourism sharply declined in June 2010. June spending decreased 42
percent compared to May 2010, and also declined 9 percent year-over-year. All
four states along the Gulf Coast saw declines in tourism spending from May to
June: Alabama (8 percent), Florida (35 percent), Louisiana (65 percent) and
Mississippi (65 percent). 

Lodging and oil and gas are the two merchant segments hardest hit by the crisis.
Visa transaction volume in the lodging segment decreased 50 percent, while the
oil and gas segment was down 42 percent. According to a recent survey by the
Knowland Group survey of hotel properties, 35 percent said that the oil spill
has prompted guests to cancel their future reservations and 42 percent said the
spill has hurt their ability to book future events.1

As the U.S. tourism industry works to continue the upward trajectory seen during
the first six months of 2010 and navigate challenges such as the recent oil
spill, Visa is committed to supporting the growth of its industry and government
partners by providing a secure and reliable digital currency for cross-border
transactions and access to millions of cardholders globally. For more

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - No client is too small for Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) these days, even a company with no revenue that's owned by a hedge fund specializing in penny stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a move that surprised some observers, Goldman earlier this month emerged as the co-lead manager on an initial public offering for PetroAlgae PALG.OB, a development-stage company that is trying to create oil from algae.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Florida-based PetroAlgae, which plans to raise up to $200 million in the offering, has lost $58 million over the past three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The renewable energy technology it is trying to develop is innovative, and other start-ups are trying to capitalize on it as well. But PetroAlgae is by no means a leader in the field. And unlike one of its rivals, it doesn't have dollars flowing its way from Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), which is expecting to pump $600 million into the emerging industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather, PetroAlgae's main backer is an $800 million New York hedge fund, Laurus Capital Management, run by brothers Eugene and David Grin, who are best known for investing in private placements of cash-strapped micro-cap companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IPO could help the brothers and their investors to monetize one of their funds' 94 percent equity stake in PetroAlgae.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In years past, this is the kind of deal that Goldman might have turned up its nose at, letting some second-tier bank take the job. But as the economy stumbles and financial reform laws squeeze banks' profits, Goldman appears more willing to underwrite smaller deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman isn't the only "bulge bracket" firm leading the offering. Others include Citigroup (C.N) and UBS (UBSN.VX).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But to some observers, underwriting such a small, speculative deal seems like an odd step for Goldman, given that the bank has long prided itself on being No. 1 among the white shoe firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It reminds me of the dot.com era again where Goldman was a player, but not the player," said Cornelius Hurley, a professor and director of Boston University's Morin Center for Banking and Financial Law. "It does seem rather downmarket for them to be involved in this just out of the gate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IPO STATS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the financial crisis, Wall Street banks have gone further down market as they look to collect fees and stay competitive in the league tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IPOs that Goldman has helped underwrite this year have raised an average of $225 million, compared with $685 million a decade ago, according to data complied by Thomson Reuters. Citi has seen a similar drop, to $220 million from $655 million, as have many other Wall Street banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change in the IPO marketplace is a boon to companies like PetroAlgae, which has no revenue and three years of widening losses. Ten years ago, the company likely would have struggled to secure such a top-tier group of underwriters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PICKING UP THE PIECES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is in the process of picking up the pieces after more than a year of negative publicity following the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank spent a large chunk of 2010 reassuring clients after it was charged with civil fraud by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, stemming from its marketing and packaging of a subprime mortgage security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman settled the charges in July by agreeing to pay $550 million. People close to the bank say it is now trying to assess how much business it lost during the controversy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and PetroAlgae declined to comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's involvement in a company backed by the Grin brothers makes for an unusual pairing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Grins have been successful largely because of their strategy of investing in so-called PIPEs, or private investments in public equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PIPEs are a type of financing that has been popular with cash-starved companies. In a typical deal, a company raises cash by either selling shares at a discount or a bond that can convert into stock at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main investors in PIPEs are hedge funds. The strategy has long drawn scrutiny from securities regulators worried about the potential for manipulating a company's share price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside the world of penny stocks, the Grins got a degree of fame in New York City real estate a few years ago when their Laurus funds foreclosed on a $24 million loan and took title to a mansion owned by former Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione. The Upper East Side townhouse, one of the largest in Manhattan, was later purchased by hedge fund billionaire Phil Falcone, manager of Harbinger Capital Partners, for $49 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SOMETHING NEW, SOMETHING GREEN"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PetroAlgae notified regulators of its plans to launch an IPO on August 11, but it has offered no timetable, meaning it could be months or even years before it goes to market. The company's IPO is unusual because its shares already trade on the OTC Bulletin Board, where razor-thin volumes cause massive swings in share prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shares closed on Friday at $10 after opening the week at $19.99, with only 1,100 shares changing hands. The shares have traded in a wide range over the past four months, hitting a high of $26.75 on Aril 6 and a low of $6 on June 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because PetroAlgae is already traded, it will be brought into broader public circulation through a complex reverse merger, which will amount to an IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not looking for this to be any kind of good offering," said David Menlow, president of IPOfinancial.com. He said it is highly unusual for a company like PetroAlgae to be embraced by investment banking heavyweights like Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Something new, something green, doesn't always translate in the investment community," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, members of PetroAlgae's leadership team created TyraTech, (TYR.L) a company that makes environmentally friendly insecticides and which went public in 2007. The shares began trading at 505 pence on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange, but they now trade at just 22.50 pence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A "FOOTHOLD"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, Goldman and other investment banks in the heyday of the dot.com boom were quick to take to market any company that had a website and a semblance of a business plan. Remember eToys?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in jumping on the PetroAlgae deal, analysts in the cleantech industry say Goldman could merely be trying to secure a foothold in the sector and put down a marker for bigger and better alternative energy deals to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should the PetroAlgae IPO succeed, Goldman could be well positioned to take part in others, said Ian Horowitz, an analyst with boutique investment bank Rafferty Capital Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Goldman goes in and gets it done, maybe they see a large pipeline of next-generation biotechnology centers coming through," Horowitz said. "These banks see this could be a good opportunity to do more than just this one."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A day after PetroAlgae said it would launch its IPO, Gevo Inc, an Englewood, Colorado-based bio-fuel developer, said it would go public in a $150 million offering. Goldman and UBS are among the underwriters of the Gevo IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The excitement over fuel made from algae got a boost a year ago when Exxon announced it would make a $600 million investment to help develop the technology. Exxon signed on for a partnership with Synthetic Genomics, a PetroAlgae rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its part, PetroAlgae last November announced it had signed a memorandum of understanding to enter an agreement to license its proprietary technology to Indian Oil Corp, India's largest company by sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But PetroAlgae did not get any of the ExxonMobil money -- and continues to scrape by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Reuters a year ago, director and chairman John Scott said the company would see initial revenues by the end of 2009. He said a consortium of Chinese interests would pay for the company's first license agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those revenues never arrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

volumes cause massive swings in share prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The shares closed on Friday at $10 after opening the week
at $19.99, with only 1,100 shares changing hands. The shares
have traded in a wide range over the past four months, hitting
a high of $26.75 on Aril 6 and a low of $6 on June 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Because PetroAlgae is already traded, it will be brought
into broader public circulation through a complex reverse
merger, which will amount to an IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'm not looking for this to be any kind of good offering,"
said David Menlow, president of IPOfinancial.com. He said it is
highly unusual for a company like PetroAlgae to be embraced by
investment banking heavyweights like Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Something new, something green, doesn't always translate
in the investment community," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, members of PetroAlgae's leadership team created
TyraTech, (TYR.L) a company that makes environmentally friendly
insecticides and which went public in 2007. The shares began
trading at 505 pence on the Alternative Investment Market of
the London Stock Exchange, but they now trade at just 22.50
pence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A "FOOTHOLD"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To be sure, Goldman and other investment banks in the
heyday of the dot.com boom were quick to take to market any
company that had a website and a semblance of a business plan.
Remember eToys?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And in jumping on the PetroAlgae deal, analysts in the
cleantech industry say Goldman could merely be trying to secure
a foothold in the sector and put down a marker for bigger and
better alternative energy deals to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Should the PetroAlgae IPO succeed, Goldman could be well
positioned to take part in others, said Ian Horowitz, an
analyst with boutique investment bank Rafferty Capital
Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If Goldman goes in and gets it done, maybe they see a
large pipeline of next-generation biotechnology centers coming
through," Horowitz said. "These banks see this could be a good
opportunity to do more than just this one."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A day after PetroAlgae said it would launch its IPO, Gevo
Inc, an Englewood, Colorado-based bio-fuel developer, said it
would go public in a $150 million offering. Goldman and UBS are
among the underwriters of the Gevo IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The excitement over fuel made from algae got a boost a year
ago when Exxon announced it would make a $600 million
investment to help develop the technology. Exxon signed on for
a partnership with Synthetic Genomics, a PetroAlgae rival.
[ID:nN14161812]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For its part, PetroAlgae last November announced it had
signed a memorandum of understanding to enter an agreement to
license its proprietary technology to Indian Oil Corp, India's
largest company by sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But PetroAlgae did not get any of the ExxonMobil money --
and continues to scrape by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an interview with Reuters a year ago, director and
chairman John Scott said the company would see initial revenues
by the end of 2009. He said a consortium of Chinese interests
would pay for the company's first license agreement.
[ID:nN13257252]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those revenues never arrived.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Top hedge fund managers like Dinakar Singh and David Einhorn scooped up Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) shares in the second quarter, taking advantage of historically low price-to-earnings multiples for the world's largest software company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft -- whose systems run more than 90 percent of the world's personal computers -- saw its shares fall sharply last quarter, even as Wall Street analysts forecast rising profits in the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decline means the stock is now trading around 10 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, close to its lowest multiple on record and a 70 percent discount to peers, according to StarMine data. And taking into account Microsoft's $37 billion of cash, the true multiple is more like 8, some investors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's insanely cheap for a company of this caliber and market position," said Whitney Tilson, managing partner of T2 Partners LLC and the Tilson Mutual Funds, who bought Microsoft shares in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most investors seem to have concluded that the growth days of the stock are over, a growing faction of savvy hedge funds -- including Singh's TPG Axon, Einhorn's Greenlight Capital, John Griffin's Blue Ridge and Thomas Claugus's GMT Capital -- see an undervalued opportunity in the huge and increasing profits delivered by the Windows 7 operating system and Office franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interest from such fund managers helped make Microsoft one of the largest additions in the second quarter Smart Money survey, compiled by Thomson Reuters, of the portfolios of 30 of the biggest fundamentally-oriented hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For a chart showing Microsoft's P/E ratio relative to its peers, and comparing net profit to its share price, see link.reuters.com/xeb37n.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE APPLE PROBLEM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company took a hit to its prestige in May when old rival Apple Inc (AAPL.O) surged past it in market value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple is much less profitable than Microsoft, but it is rewarded with a higher multiple by investors excited by a stream of innovative products like the iPhone and iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of Microsoft's value is overlooked in comparison, said Patrick Becker Jr at Becker Capital Management, also a holder of the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a perception issue with them (Microsoft). For whatever reason, if you do well with the consumer, you get a higher multiple on your stock," he said. "Microsoft doesn't get very much credit for what they do on the business side and the dominant share they have there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some Microsoft problems are more than perception. Despite its seemingly unassailable dominance in the business software sector, some investors worry the company has no response to the iPad, which threatens to wean consumers off netbooks and may work its way into corporate life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its new phone software -- due to debut in the next few months -- needs to make up a lot of lost ground, and its money-losing Bing search engine has not made any great inroads on Google (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock is suffering under the weight of those doubts, some investors say, falling 21 percent in the second quarter, compared to a 12 percent fall in the Standard  Poor's 500 index. Some hedge funds, including Appaloosa Management, Chilton Investment Co and Pennant Capital Management, took the opportunity to trim their holdings in Microsoft last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tablets -- the iPad in particular -- and the smartphone market are major overhangs and discounted heavily in the stock," said Ken Allen at Baltimore-based portfolio manager T. Rowe Price, whose Science and Technology Fund has Microsoft as a major holding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORE VALUE, LESS GROWTH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consensus view appears to be that Microsoft is now more of a value investment than a growth opportunity. The company has played its part in that, introducing a dividend in 2003 and paying a special dividend of $3 per share the following year. It is expected to increase its quarterly dividend next month from the 13 cents per share it has paid out for the last eight quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a record of them returning excess cash to shareholders," said Becker. "I don't think you'll see a special (dividend) out of them, but they will continue to raise the regular dividend and do share buybacks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's value momentum -- which can signal that a stock may soon revert to historical valuation levels -- is now greater than 83 percent of U.S. companies, according to StarMine data. That view is shared by some investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The stock is unsustainably cheap here," said Allen at T. Rowe Price. "Their medium-term growth outlook is really strong. The market is saying the company's growth phase is over and it has these secular concerns. I'm saying the growth phase is continuing and I feel better than the market does about their progress."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others are betting only that Microsoft is a winner in the medium term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Hollywood Reporter) - While the war of words seems over in carriage fee negotiations between industry giants Disney and Time Warner Cable, the war for subscribers isn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The University of Southern California opens its season against Hawaii on Thursday night, and Verizon's FiOS TV service has recently warned football fans in Los Angeles that they must sign up -- and drop their TWC subscription -- if they want to be 100 percent sure that they can watch the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aggressive ad campaign in markets where FiOS overlaps with TW Cable, such as in L.A., has appeared in newspapers and on TV and radio, including, of all places, Disney's ESPN Radio. It's a sign of how heated the competition between TV distributors is these days and how contentious carriage fee talks with content providers have become.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, FiOS may be running out of luck as Disney and TWC seem to have averted what would have been the year's biggest TV carriage dispute. With their contract expiring Thursday morning right after midnight, the companies have agreed on the framework of a new deal and cooled off what had been a heated public relations battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the new TV season and the kickoff of the NFL season looming, the talks had the potential to be particularly disruptive, and ESPN boss George Bodenheimer was recently recalled from his vacation to return to the bargaining table and help hammer out a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notices on two websites maintained by the companies to keep their customers informed on the talks have been updated to say: "The Walt Disney Co. and Time Warner Cable have made significant progress in our negotiations for continued distribution of ABC, Disney and ESPN networks and services. We are now focusing all our attention on a successful conclusion of these efforts prior to the September 2 deadline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such updates typically mean that a TV network operator and a distributor have agreed on the outlines of a deal and are putting legal and other finishing touches on it. One source said if a final deal is not reached and announced by end of day Wednesday or early Thursday, the companies could complete it shortly thereafter without programing disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always, executives on both sides are reluctant to discuss terms of the likely deal. Both are powerful firms, but some have argued that Disney has somewhat of a negotiating edge. Gimme Credit analyst Dave Novosel in a report last week put it more aggressively than most, saying a deal will "in all likelihood be bad for TWC, although how bad is not entirely clear."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, Disney's ESPN is not only must-have content, but it's by far the most expensive network, costing distributors $4.40 per subscriber per month this year, up from $3.30 in 2006, with only the new ESPN 3D coming close at an estimated $2.55, according to SNL Kagan estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Disney Channel also makes the top five channels, costing distributors 91 cents as No. 4, and Disney is believed to have pushed for a big increase. Disney is believed to have been pushing TWC for 5 percent-10 percent price increases across its networks, in line with recent years' average programing expense growth of cable and satellite TV operators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observers are particularly curious to find out if any details will leak on three key issues of a final agreement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- Will TWC, which has 12.7 million video subscribers and is the second-largest cable firm behind Comcast, drop smaller Disney networks, such as Disney XD or Disney Jr. (the new preschool service that is replacing SoapNet), so that the cable firm can offset higher costs for other networks?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janney Montgomery Scott analyst Tony Wible estimates that high single-digit percentage increases in fees from TWC could boost Disney's annual profit by 2 cents-3 cents per share. But TWC already reported $4 billion in video programing costs for 2009, up 6.5 percent over 2008, with its cost per video subscriber amounting to $25.60 a month."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TWC expects that its video programing costs as a percentage of video revenue will continue to increase as increases in programing costs outpace growth in video revenue," the company warned this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On its consumer outreach website about Disney-TWC and other disputes -- dubbed RollOverOrGetTough.com -- TWC similarly explains to consumers that 40 percent of its billings goes straight to content providers, 54 percent to expenses to operate the rest of the business, and only 6 percent to the company's profit line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe, as SNL Kagan analyst Derek Baine highlighted, the direct financial comparison tells the story best: "Disney cable network margins have been expanding faster than TWC margins, showing programmers have been doing better in these negotiations," he told The Hollywood Reporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- How much will TWC pay in retransmission consent fees for Disney-owned ABC stations in five markets, including the nation's two top media markets, New York and L.A., where the company owns WABC-TV and KABC?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the first time that Disney has asked for retrans payments from TWC, as those kind of fees weren't assessed when they struck their previous arrangement. Wible estimates that TWC will pay 40 cents-60 cents per subscribers per month. Other analysts have used a similar 50 cents estimate -- in line with what other broadcasters have fetched. Given TWC's 3.8 million customers in ABC station markets, that would amount to about $23 million a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- Will TWC pay Disney for online sports service ESPN3.com (market chatter had centered on a 10 cents per broadband user per month fee), or will the content company have to directly charge consumers? (The cable firm would prefer the latter, as whoever bills people tends to get blamed for the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comcast, Cox and other distributors are already paying Disney for the site, the only one that gets payments from distributors, but TWC wants to keep its growing broadband business more profitable by avoiding fees. The Disney-TWC situation has been closely watched by the industry in a year that has seen a slew of contentious carriage renewal talks go down to the wire. The year began with a slightly delayed agreement between News Corp./Fox and TWC, followed by a Disney/ABC clash with Cablevision that left some viewers without the start of the Academy Awards broadcast. Cablevision also didn't renew an arrangement with Scripps Networks Interactive until well into the new year, and Versus went missing from DirecTV for months. Plus, ATT U-verse has been in a war of words with Crown Media's Hallmark Channels over an extension to a carriage deal that expires at the end of the day Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all the traditional challenges of carriage deals weren't enough, evolving business models in the digital age have added even more dynamite. Access to TV shows on Hulu.com, Disney's talks with Apple for 99 cents TV show rentals for a 48-hour window and others all play into the equation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are far more moving pieces than there have ever been, so there is more brinkmanship," cable industry veteran and consultant Steve Effros said. "And in a weak (housing market and) economy, everybody is trying to hold out for the last penny."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's also why FiOS is trying to keep consumers aware that it is an alternative, even though analysts say only extended carriage disputes tend to bring major defections to another TV distributor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, satellite TV giants DirecTV and Dish Network have been quiet amid the showdown. "There is an evident interest in some semblance of a united front against very high (content) charges," Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan suggested as the reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dish also may want to tread carefully as it faces a big year-end carriage showdown with News Corp./Fox, which is also renegotiating a retrans deal with Cablevision that comes up in October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI Aug 31 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs has downgraded
Housing Development Finance Corp (HDFC.BO) to "sell" from
"neutral" and retained the price target of 595 rupees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The stock has outperformed the benchmark BSE index .BSESN
and the upside in the stock has already been priced in, Goldman
Sachs said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are no near-term catalysts for the stock as
intensifying competition limits ability to raise lending rates
and rising wholesale borrowing costs from low levels exerts
pressure on spreads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At 9:40 a.m. shares were up 0.27 percent at 629.70 rupees.
