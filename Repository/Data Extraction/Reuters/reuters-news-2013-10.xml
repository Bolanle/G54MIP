&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Three of the top 20 investors in Microsoft Corp are lobbying the board to press for Bill Gates to step down as chairman of the software company he co-founded 38 years ago, according to people familiar with matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer has been under pressure for years to improve the company's performance and share price, this appears to be the first time that major shareholders are taking aim at Gates, who remains one of the most respected and influential figures in technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A representative for Microsoft declined to comment on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no indication that Microsoft's board would heed the wishes of the three investors, who collectively hold more than 5 percent of the company's stock, according to the sources. They requested the identity of the investors be kept anonymous because the discussions were private.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates owns about 4.5 percent of the $277 billion company and is its largest individual shareholder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three investors are concerned that Gates' role as chairman effectively blocks the adoption of new strategies and would limit the power of a new chief executive to make substantial changes. In particular, they point to Gates' role on the special committee searching for Ballmer's successor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are also worried that Gates - who spends most of his time on his philanthropic foundation - wields power out of proportion to his declining shareholding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates, who owned 49 percent of Microsoft before it went public in 1986, sells about 80 million Microsoft shares a year under a pre-set plan, which if continued would leave him with no financial stake in the company by 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He lowered his profile at Microsoft after he handed the CEO role to Ballmer in 2000, giving up his day-to-day work there in 2008 to focus on the $38 billion Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August, Ballmer said he would retire within 12 months, amid pressure from activist fund manager ValueAct Capital Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is now looking for a new CEO, though its board has said Ballmer's strategy will go forward. He has focused on making devices, such as the Surface tablet and Xbox gaming console, and turning key software into services provided over the Internet. Some investors say that a new chief should not be bound by that strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News that some investors were pushing for Gates' ouster as chairman provoked mixed reactions from other shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is long overdue," said Todd Lowenstein, a portfolio manager at HighMark Capital Management, which owns Microsoft shares. "Replacing the old guard with some fresh eyes can provide the oxygen needed to properly evaluate their corporate strategy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Caughey Forrest, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, suggested now was not the time for Microsoft to ditch Gates, and that he could even play a larger role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've thought that the company has been missing a technology visionary," she said. "Bill (Gates) would fit the bill."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is still one of the world's most valuable technology companies, making a net profit of $22 billion last fiscal year. But its core Windows computing operating system, and to a lesser extent the Office software suite, are under pressure from the decline in personal computers as smartphones and tablets grow more popular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft have been essentially static for a decade, and the company has lost ground to Apple Inc and Google Inc in the move toward mobile computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the sources said Gates was one of the technology industry's greatest pioneers, but the investors felt he was more effective as chief executive than as chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Stephen Coates)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - A Brazilian federal judge on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit against No. 2 U.S. oil company Chevron Corp after approving a negotiated settlement, a decision that closes a nearly two-year legal battle over an oil spill in November 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian prosecutors sought 40 billion reais ($18 billion) in damages from Chevron and offshore drilling contractor Transocean Ltd for a 3,600-barrel leak in the Frade offshore oil field Chevron operates northeast of Rio de Janeiro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors also filed criminal charges against the companies and 17 of their employees. A judge rejected those charges, but prosecutors are appealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dismissal came after Judge Raffaele Felice Pirro of the federal court in Rio de Janeiro accepted an "adjustment of conduct" deal with Chevron that commits the company to spending about 300 million reais ($135 million) in compensatory activities. Chevron and the government agencies that signed the accord said Transocean had no responsibility for the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case, the largest-ever environmental lawsuit in Brazilian history, raised questions about the cost of doing business in the nation's high-risk oil business and the ability of prosecutors to assess proper penalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the spill caused no discernible environmental damage, was dispersed within days, never came within 100 kilometers (62 miles) of shore and resulted in no injuries, Chevron and its partners had to stop producing for about a year and a half. Brazilian petroleum regulator ANP fined Chevron for failing to follow drilling plans, but absolved the company of negligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The damages sought were many times larger than those U.S. courts awarded plaintiffs against operator BP Plc in the much larger 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill, which fouled beaches, damaged fisheries and killed 11 people in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron owns 52 percent of Frade and is the field operator. Brazil's state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA owns 30 percent and Frade Jap&#227;o, a joint venture between Japanese trading companies Sojitz Corp and Inpex Corp, owns 18 percent. Petrobras, Sojitz and Inpex were never named in the civil or criminal lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Chevron and Transocean welcomed the decision in short statements from their press offices. Chevron added that 95.2 million reais, or about a third of the initial settlement value, will be spent on social and environmental programs approved by prosecutors, the ANP and environmental protection agency Ibama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron will still have expenses for additional safety equipment such as service boats in the Frade field. It will need to monitor and trap small oil seepages from the sea-floor, some of which might have nothing to do with the initial spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frade produced 12,645 barrels of oil and equivalent natural gas per day in August, 36 percent less than in July, and less than a fifth of 72,000 boepd at its peak just before the spill, the ANP said in its monthly report on Tuesday. Chevron's average August share was 8,921 boepd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares fell 0.15 percent to close at $121.32 on the New York Stock Exchange, its lowest since September 6. Transocean rose 1.08 percent to $44.98, the stock's biggest one-day gain in three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 2.22 Brazilian reais)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jeb Blount; Editing by Gerald E.

the 2007 synthetic collateralized debt obligation Abacus
2007-AC1, by concealing how hedge fund billionaire John Paulson
helped construct the transaction and bet it would fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was also held liable for misleading ACA Capital Holdings

      efforts for single-family, multi-family and mixed-use sites on the 
      Property, the Partnership was completing improvements to 215th 
      Street in Edmonton in Phase 1 of the development of the Property rather 
      than in Phase 2 as provided in the Property's original development plan. 
      At that time, the Partnership announced that it had increased the loan 
      the Partnership had from an affiliate of Walton Global Investments Ltd. 
      by an additional $900,000 to pay a portion of the expenses related to 
      the 215th Street improvements, and that a further $9.4 
      million would have to be borrowed from the Phase 1 Lender.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today's announcement confirms that the Partnership has now entered into 
      an agreement with the Phase 1 Lender to borrow such funds in the amount 
      of $9.35 million and to extend the maturity date of the Phase 1 Facility 
      until November 1, 2014. The funding of the additional amount of the loan 
      to finance the 215th Street improvements is subject to a 
      number of conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With this amendment, the Phase 1 Facility consists of a $23.0 million 
      non-revolving construction loan facility (including the $9.35 million 
      facility to fund the costs of the 215th Street improvements) 
      and a $4.994 million letter of credit facility. As at September 26, 
      2013, the balance of the loan under the Phase 1 Facility was $7.933 
      million and $4.994 million in letters of credit have been issued to the 
      City of Edmonton of which none have been drawn on. The Phase 1 Loan 
      Facility is secured by, among other things, a first priority mortgage on 
      the Property.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Launched in 2010, the Partnership owns a 136.5-acre residential project 
      in northwest Edmonton, Alberta. The project is being developed in three 
      phases and marketed under the name &#8220;Hawk&#8217;s Ridge at Big Lake.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;By Reynolds Holding
The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have managed to get at least one job split right. Neither bank will cleave the chairman and chief executive roles, but they&#8217;ve figured out that allowing the general counsel to also run regulatory compliance invites trouble. Interpreting the rules and ensuring they&#8217;re followed too often conflict. Rival financial institutions &#8211; and companies in other industries, too &#8211; should follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, one individual could safely preside over corporate lawsuits, contract negotiations and standards of conduct. Medicare rules, Sarbanes-Oxley financial reforms and other state and federal regulations, however, quickly overloaded top legal officers with complexity and competing interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tenet Healthcare&#8217;s general counsel, for example, was forced to resign in 2003 over her conflicting roles as the company&#8217;s defender and watchdog in a Medicare fraud probe. Investigations of WellCare for Medicaid cheating and Pfizer for marketing scams prompted the companies to split their respective legal and compliance departments. In 2010, new federal sentencing guidelines gave a break to wrongdoers with compliance officers who reported directly to the board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and JPMorgan say best practices prompted them to create independent legal and compliance departments. While Goldman did so in 2004, JPMorgan waited until earlier this year, after regulators started scrutinizing the $6.2 billion London Whale trading losses and other matters. British banks HSBC and Barclays also have split legal and compliance in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the impetus, the policy makes sense. Defending a company against regulators is different from making sure it meets their standards. Keeping the jobs separate allows one to act as a check on the other while also showing that a company takes compliance seriously. Yet 41 percent of companies tuck the task into the legal department, while only 8 percent have an independent compliance officer reporting directly to the board, according to a 2011 survey by Compliance Week and PricewaterhouseCoopers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There can be no guarantee, of course, that a more independent officer would have, say, curbed certain practices at JPMorgan, just as separating the chairman and CEO positions doesn&#8217;t ensure missteps won&#8217;t happen. The aim, however, is to put a company in the best position to avoid trouble. In either context, two heads are better than one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The journey of anti-hero Walter White came to a dark end on Sunday when fans of "Breaking Bad" finally learned the fate of the chemistry teacher turned drug kingpin, as AMC's cult drug drama concluded after a five-season run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emmy-winning "Breaking Bad" has captured audiences with its gritty plot about Walter, played by Bryan Cranston, a cancer-stricken chemistry teacher who turns to cooking methamphetamine with ex-student Jesse Pinkman, played by Aaron Paul, in order to make money for his family. Walt's chemistry skills allow him to create the purest meth available, which becomes known as "blue sky." Its popularity in the market leads Walt to eventually becoming a drug kingpin known as Heisenberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunday's 75-minute finale, entitled "Felina," saw Walt return to his deserted family home, retrieve a vial of ricin he hid in the wall, and embark on his final mission to tie up the loose ends left by his crumbled drug empire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walt visits the gang of white supremacists he had once contracted to kill Jesse, but who instead stole his drug money earnings and kidnapped Jesse to cook the 'blue sky' meth. Walt sets up an automatic rifle in his car that discharges when he goes into the white supremacist compound, killing the gang and freeing Jesse from captivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walt takes a bullet but stays alive long enough to call meth dealer Lydia, the last remaining link to his drug empire, to tell her he poisoned her with ricin. Walt watches Jesse drive away a free man, and draws his last breaths in the meth lab at the compound as the police finally catch up with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walt's death was one of the probable endings that audiences predicted ahead of the finale, especially as his cancer had returned in the fifth season and his path into darkness saw him lose the support of the people closest to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one poignant scene where Walt sees his wife Skyler for the last time, he finally reveals his reasons for taking the dark path into the meth empire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I did it for me. I liked it. I was good at it. And I was really, I was alive," Walt tells Skyler, after he gives her coordinates to the site where his police officer brother-in-law Hank was buried in the desert after being shot in the head by Walt's contracted neo-Nazi gang in an earlier episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Breaking Bad" become the hot topic on Twitter on Sunday, with the hashtag #GoodbyeBreakingBad trending throughout the day. As Walt's journey came in an end, the majority of fan reactions were positive, with many calling the ending "perfect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We needed to dot all the Is and cross all the Ts ... we needed a resolution," Vince Gilligan, creator of "Breaking Bad," said in AMC's post-finale show "Talking Bad."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul added: "What I thought was great was that Walt died protecting Jesse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'EVERYONE IS CAPABLE OF GOOD AND BAD'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walt's journey from a mild-mannered school teacher into a manipulative drug lord saw him descend the circles of hell as he loses his family and identity to become the cold, calculating Heisenberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In looking into this character and what happens to him and the transformation, I really believe that everybody is capable of good or bad," Cranston, who won three best actor Emmys for his portrayal of Walt, said at last month's Television Critics Association panels in Beverly Hills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think, if given the right set of circumstances, dire situations, any one of us can become dangerous," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMC, owned by AMC Networks Inc., split the final season of "Breaking Bad" in two, the first half airing in 2012 and the second in 2013. The second half of the final season, which began in August, saw an average of 5.2 million viewers tuning in to see the conclusion of Walt's saga, more than double last year's audience for the show, according to AMC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online streaming site Netflix is credited with helping boost viewership for "Breaking Bad," giving audiences a chance to binge-watch earlier seasons to quickly catch up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, Paul hosted a viewing party of the final episode at the Hollywood Forever cemetery in Los Angeles. Paul joined cast members including RJ Mitte, who plays Walt Jr., driving onto the stage in the rusty RV that Walt and Jesse first cooked meth in, and emerged wearing yellow Hazmat suits, welcomed by hundreds of excited fans, attendee Terri Schwartz told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event raised more than $2 million for charity, and Paul surprised fans by posing for pictures ahead of the screening. Many of the show's celebrity fans, including actor Ewan McGregor and comedian Jimmy Kimmel, attended the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's the final night of 'Breaking Bad.' It's devastating, I know. I can't thank you enough for coming out," Paul said, before enthusiastically kicking off the screening of the finale with Jesse's trademark phrase "Yeah, bitch!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Piya Sinha-Roy; Editing by Stacey Joyce)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate made a last-ditch bid late on Monday to save a program granting visas to Iraqis who risked their lives working for the American military, but a similar effort in the House of Representatives fell victim to bickering over government spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the program granting the visas expired at midnight, visa application processing was halted for some 2,000 Iraqis who worked as interpreters or in other capacities for U.S. forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The civilians - and their families - remain stranded in their homeland, many with their lives at risk because some see them as traitors for working for U.S. troops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate passed a three-month extension of the plan by unanimous consent shortly before midnight, when the fiscal year ended and the federal government partially shut down because lawmakers could not agree on an emergency government funding bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the Republican-controlled House included an extension of the program in their versions of the emergency spending bill. But they wrapped it in with language to defund or delay President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law, so the bill died in the Democratic-controlled Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aides said some House members were trying to persuade House leaders to allow a vote on a standalone bill that would extend the Special Iraqi Visa program, but there was no immediate word on whether they would do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Mohammad Zargham)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      CA Technologies (NASDAQ:CA) today announced &#8220;Day One&#8221; support for IBM 
      DB2 v11 for z/OS.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Customers who have installed CA 
      Database Management Solutions for DB2 for z/OS version 17.0 (DB2 
      Tools 17.0), a suite of interoperable solutions to improve database 
      administration, are able to take advantage of the capabilities of IBM 
      DB2 v11 to boost efficiency and reliability of data backup and recovery, 
      and achieve higher service levels, data availability and application 
      responsiveness.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This is important to global banks and other large companies that rely on 
      the mainframe as a cornerstone of the modern IT environment. For many 
      companies it is vital to remain current with the latest capabilities of 
      IBM System 
      z, the most advanced commercial computer available. System z 
      combines high speed and secure transaction processing with 
      state-of-the-art application facilities, integrated analytics and cloud 
      computing, and is central to keeping businesses up and running 24/7.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our day-one support is an example of our unwavering commitment to 
      supporting IBM System z advancements,&#8221; said Michael Madden, general 
      manager, Mainframe, CA Technologies. &#8220;As IBM increases the value of its 
      offerings to customers with DB2, we realize the need to be in lock-step 
      with them so our customers can reap the full benefits.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With each IBM DB2 release, CA Technologies keeps customers up to date, 
      maximizing the value of their IT investments. This is critical to making 
      customers&#8217; data centers dynamic, so they can respond quickly to business 
      needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;IBM DB2 v11, along with CA Database Management for DB2 for z/OS, is a 
      solid solution which provides us with the support we need to be sure our

      eG, a M&#252;nster, Germany-based company specializing in banking IT.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In order to achieve same-day support, CA Technologies has tested many 
      products and components on behalf of customers and IBM. This investment 
      in development and testing underscores the company&#8217;s commitment to its 
      customers and its partnership with IBM.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the most important DB2 11 features supported by CA Technologies 
      is Extended Logging, which is designed to reduce the risk of outages, 
      therefore helping customers to achieve higher availability of their IT 
      services.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Rates J.P. Morgan Securities LLC CP Programs 'F1'
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'F1' rating to J.P. Morgan Securities 
      LLC's (JPMS) 3(a)(3) and 4(a)(2) commercial paper programs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings primarily reflect Fitch's view that JPMS is a 'core' 
      subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and thus the ratings of JPMS 
      are equalized with those of JPM. Fitch believes that JPMS's business is 
      integral to the overall group strategy, its revenue, and is highly 
      integrated within the JPM business. JPMS has benefited from and 
      continues to benefit from financial support from JPM in the form of 
      direct capital and funding. Fitch believes this support from JPM will 
      continue and is a key rating driver.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings of JPMS are based on its close affiliation with its parent 
      JPMorgan Chase  Co, and as such, any rating actions at JPM would result 
      in rating actions at JPMS.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has assigned the following rating:

			Goodwin 
      Procter, a national Am Law 50 firm, today announced the release of PTAB 
      Post Grant Proceedings: A Tactical Guide for Practitioners, a 
      definitive guide for patent holders and practitioners engaging in new 
      trial proceedings under the America Invents Act (&#8220;AIA&#8221;). Visitors can 
      view the table 
      of contents for PTAB Post Grant Proceedings: A Tactical Guide for 
      Practitioners and request 
      a copy of the guide online.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The 2012 Act, which provides four new procedures to challenge the 
      validity of patents, has markedly shifted the landscape of patent 
      litigation, setting the Patent Trial  Appeal Board (&#8220;Board&#8221;) as an 
      uncharted front in a series of prominent patent disputes. With more than 
      540 petitions filed with the Board this year, companies including Apple, 
      Google, Oracle and Microsoft will face untested procedures implemented 
      under AIA&#8217;s provisions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Implementation of the America Invents Act marks a profound shift in 
      America&#8217;s treatment of intellectual property, and the Patent Trial  
      Appeal Board will be the site of much of this change,&#8221; said Douglas 
      Kline, partner and chairman of Goodwin Procter&#8217;s Intellectual 
      Property Litigation Practice. &#8220;Cases heard before the Board over the 
      coming months will likely prove a bellwether, and understanding likely 
      outcomes has been a top concern of many of our clients.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The guide provides an overview of post-grant tactics likely to prevail 
      under AIA, explores likely trial and pre-trial results under evolving 
      courtroom procedures (among them Inter Partes Review, the 
      Transitional Program for Covered Business Method Patents, and Post-Grant 
      Review) and provides statistical breakdowns based on all petitions made 
      to PTAB under AIA this year. It also provides practical advice to those 
      looking to move claims through the court, and to patent holders looking 
      to defend their most vital intellectual property.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The study is published by Goodwin Procter&#8217;s Intellectual 
      Property Litigation Practice, ranked by IP Law and Business 
      as one of the nation&#8217;s most active. Goodwin&#8217;s 150 IP attorneys and 
      scientists have worked extensively with clients to secure preliminary 
      injunctions, declaratory and summary judgments, favorable results in Markman 
      proceedings, advantageous settlements and appellate relief. Goodwin 
      attorneys routinely work with clients to take cases from pre-suit 
      investigations through discovery proceedings and trials.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Edgemont Development Corporation Issues Interest Debentures For 
      Second Interest Payment
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Edgemont Development Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) announced 
      that the Corporation has paid, effective today, its second interest 
      payment on the 8% unsecured, subordinated, convertible, extendable 
      debentures (&#8220;Offering Debentures&#8221;) by issuing to holders of the Offering 
      Debentures, on a pro rata basis, that principal amount of interest 
      debentures (the &#8220;Interest Debentures&#8221;) equal to the amount of interest 
      owing under the Offering Debentures.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Interest Debentures are 8% unsecured, subordinated, convertible, 
      extendable debentures of the Corporation and have substantially the same 
      terms as the Offering Debentures. The issuance of the Interest 
      Debentures is in accordance with the terms of the trust indenture 
      governing the Offering Debentures which were disclosed in the 
      Corporation's June 27, 2011 prospectus (the &#8220;Prospectus&#8221;).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Offering Debentures were issued as part of the Corporation&#8217;s 
      Prospectus offering. The Offering Debentures are unsecured and bear 
      interest at a rate of 8% per annum. Interest on the debentures is 
      calculated each June 30, and is payable annually on or before September 
      30. For this second payment, interest is calculated from June 30, 2012 
      to June 29, 2013, for total interest of approximately $1,869,491.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The decision to settle the interest through the issuance of Interest 
      Debentures was primarily a result of deviations in the current cash flow 
      when compared to the cash flow assumptions in the Corporation&#8217;s original 
      business model. These deviations were due to subdivision and engineering 
      drawing approvals from the City of Edmonton taking longer than 
      anticipated, which delayed the receipt of proceeds from Phase 1 lot 
      sales in the development.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In March of 2014, each investor will receive, by mail, a T5 from the 
      Corporation&#8217;s transfer agent or the shareholder&#8217;s brokerage firm. The T5 
      will indicate the amount of interest that the Offering Debenture holder 
      is required to report as a result of the issuance of the Interest 
      Debentures.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 1 (Reuters) - A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc
 vice president who was found liable for securities fraud
over a failed mortgage transaction has asked a federal judge to
throw out the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's case
against him or else set a new trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre said his jury erred in finding him liable on
six of the seven civil charges he faced, saying the evidence did
not support the verdict or was never presented to his jury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Letting the verdict stand "would work a manifest injustice
to Mr. Tourre," his lawyers wrote in a Monday night filing in
the U.S. District Court in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC did not immediately respond on Tuesday to requests
for a comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Aug. 1 verdict was the SEC's first major courtroom
victory in a case stemming from the recent financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jurors found Tourre liable for misleading investors in the
2007 synthetic collateralized debt obligation Abacus 2007-AC1,
by failing to reveal that hedge fund billionaire John Paulson
helped choose the underlying securities and was betting that
they would fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was also held responsible for having misled ACA Capital
Holdings Inc, which also chose assets for Abacus, into believing
Paulson's firm would be an equity investor in the CDO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors lost about $1 billion in the CDO, the SEC has
said. Goldman agreed in a July 2010 settlement with the
regulator to pay $550 million, without admitting wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his filing, Tourre said the charges on which he was held
liable for scheming to defraud ACA should be dismissed because
they were premised on misstatements underlying the charge on
which he was held not liable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said there was no evidence he received money or
property by making an untrue statement, or that Abacus was a
"domestic" transaction to justify liability under U.S.
securities laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, he said trial Judge Katherine Forrest made a
mistake in not letting jurors consider whether swap agreements
entered into by Goldman, ACA and the former ABN Amro were
"security-based" swaps that could subject him to liability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has been paying legal bills of Tourre, who is now
pursuing a doctorate in economics at the University of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York, No. 10-03229.&lt;/p&gt;

      protection of their payment information. A host of industry activities, 
      led by issuing and acquiring financial institutions, have already been 
      introduced to help streamline and further secure payments in digital 
      channels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Aligned with these initiatives, the proposed standard would meet this 
      consumer demand and allow the traditional account number to be replaced 
      with a digital payment &#8220;token&#8221; for online and mobile transactions. With 
      a token, consumers will no longer be required to enter an actual account 
      number when shopping online or on a smart device. Tokens provide an 
      additional layer of security and eliminate the need for merchants, 
      digital wallet operators or others to store account numbers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To ensure consistency across the globe, the proposed standard used to 
      generate tokens would be based on existing industry standards and would 
      be available to all payment networks and other payment participants. Key 
      elements of the proposed standard include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        New data fields to provide richer information about the transaction, 
        which can help improve fraud detection and expedite the approval 
        process
      
			
        Consistent methods to identify and verify a consumer before replacing 
        the traditional card account number with a token
      
			
        A common standard designed to simplify the process for merchants for 
        contactless, online or other transactions
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;For more than five decades, the payments industry has relied on 
      standards to safely and consistently process payments,&#8221; said Jim 
      McCarthy, Global Head of Innovation and Strategic Partnerships, Visa 
      Inc. &#8220;As more consumers make purchases with mobile phones, tablets and 
      PCs, we are committed to showing industry leadership in the development 
      of new standards that offer the same interoperability, reliability and 
      security as traditional card payments.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The payments industry has a long history of collaborating to develop the 
      necessary standards that allow merchants and financial institutions to 
      offer a consistent and secure payment experience, while providing 
      consumers the confidence to shop anywhere, anytime.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This continued transition from plastic cards to digital is all about 
      providing consumers with the ability to easily and safely make a 
      purchase. They would no longer need to store their actual card account 
      number when shopping online or with a smart device; the token would 
      serve as that stand-in,&#8221; said Ed McLaughlin, Chief Emerging Payments 
      Officer, MasterCard. &#8220;This proposed global standard builds on our track 
      record of working across the industry to deliver safe and secure payment 
      products. What we're introducing today is comparable to how the industry 
      came together to develop and use the magnetic stripe, EMV and NFC on a 
      global scale.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;By working together to form a common global standard for online and 
      mobile shopping, we will be able to provide enhanced security, 
      interoperability and consistency for all participants within the digital 
      payments ecosystem,&#8221; said Mike Matan, Head of Global Network Business, 
      American Express. &#8220;In addition, we will be able to drive the rapid 
      adoption and expansion of digital payments, delivering innovative new 
      products and services that will allow consumers to realize the full 
      potential of digital commerce in today&#8217;s world.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			How a Token Standard Could Work
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Once a standard is agreed to and implemented, issuers, merchants or 
      digital wallet providers would be able to request a token so that when 
      an account holder initiates an online or mobile transaction, the token &#8211; 
      and not the traditional card account number &#8211; would be used to process, 
      authorize, clear and settle the transaction in the same way traditional 
      card payments are processed today. Tokens can be restricted in how they 
      are used with a specific merchant, device, transaction or category of 
      transactions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The development of a global standard will enable a new generation of 
      payment products, while maintaining compatibility with the existing 
      payments infrastructure. Key principles driving the development of a 
      token standard for digital payments include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Ensuring broad-based acceptance of a token as replacement for the 
        traditional card account
      
			
        Enabling all participants in the existing ecosystem to route and pass 
        through the payment token
      
			
        Enabling digital wallet operators, mobile application developers and 
        others to easily and securely develop innovative payment products
      
			
        Improving cardholder security with tokens that are limited for use in 
        specific environments
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      The proposed framework has incorporated the input of many stakeholders, 
      particularly card issuers and merchants. Over the coming weeks, the 
      framework will also be presented to other partners and independent 
      industry bodies, such as The Clearing House, PCI Security Standards 
      Council and EMVCo, to align and further advance the standard.

			Options Deploys Microsoft Lync, Enabling Unified Communications and 
      Collaboration for Enterprise Clients
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Lync 2013 has been deployed to the Options&#8217; Private Financial Cloud 
      platform
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Options, 
      the leading private financial cloud provider for the global capital 
      markets industry, has today announced that it has deployed the instant 
      messaging client, Microsoft 
      Lync, to the Options PIPE platform. This latest addition to 
      the Options platform will see the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) 
      firm offer enterprise clients a complete corporate communications tool 
      that incorporates instant messaging, &#8216;Voice Over IP&#8217; (VoIP) calls and 
      video conferencing.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft Lync will provide Options clients with a consistent, single 
      platform experience that amalgamates a number of different communication 
      tools. Lync&#8217;s comprehensive product suite includes VoIP with integrated 
      audio, video and web conferencing, desktop and document sharing, 
      presence information to enhance productivity and collaboration, mobile 
      integration to allow a single user experience across PC, mobile phone, 
      phone and browser, direct dial to Outlook contacts and integration with 
      Microsoft&#8217;s equivalent consumer product, Skype. Significantly, it is 
      also highly secure and regulatory compliant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lync 2013 will be deployed as part of Options&#8217; PIPE&#174; 
      Core services, a key component of Options&#8217; Private 
      Financial Cloud platform.&#160;PIPE&#160;Core is a complete business 
      technology infrastructure service providing a robust and resilient 
      technology foundation for day-to-day business communication, regulatory 
      compliance and operations management.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      part of our PIPE Core offering,&#8221; said Options CTO, John Bryant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;From a client perspective, Lync offers an all-in-one communication and

      they need to work, and as part of a wider team &#8211; both essential

      communication products with a single, robust platform that meets FSA and 
      FCC requirements in terms of security and compliance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Additionally, it can be implemented rapidly, managed centrally, provide 
      for the addition of new users quickly and manage modern workplace 
      challenges like &#8216;bring your own device&#8217; (BYOD). It is a terrific 
      addition to the Options platform,&#8221; concluded Mr Bryant.

&lt;p&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO Oct 1 (Reuters) - A Brazilian federal judge
dismissed a lawsuit against No. 2 U.S. oil company Chevron Corp
 and its drilling contractor Transocean Ltd,
putting a close to a nearly two-year legal battle over a
November 2011 oil spill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian prosecutors have sought 40 billion reais ($18

300 million reais in compensatory activities and said that

&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, Chevron will supply Tohoku with 0.9 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Tohoku's supply agreement, Chevron has now sold off 85 percent of the gas from its Wheatstone project to Asian customers through long-term contracts, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wheatstone project, located in northwest Australia, will have an 8.9 million tonne per year capacity and is expected to come online in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Rebekah Kebede; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) will receive Goldman Sachs Inc (GS.N) stock worth nearly $2.15 billion on Tuesday through warrants acquired as part of a deal originally signed during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett received the warrants five years ago when his investment in Goldman was seen as a vote of confidence in the bank, which was reeling from turmoil in the credit market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under that deal, Berkshire had the right to buy about 43.5 million Goldman shares - or a roughly 9 percent stake then - at an exercise price of $115 per share, for $5 billion in total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman announced an amended deal in March that would give Berkshire a much smaller stake but would not require it to commit any capital to exercise the warrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire will convert the warrants into shares equal in value to the difference between the warrants' exercise price and the average closing price for Goldman shares in the 10 trading days up to October 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the last 10-day share price average of $164.38, Berkshire would be entitled to about 13.1 million Goldman shares, making it the sixth largest external investor in the bank, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett's investment in 2008 cost Goldman dearly. In addition to the warrants, the bank had to give Berkshire preferred stock that paid dividends of $500 million a year, or about $15 a second. Goldman repurchased those shares from Buffett at a premium in March 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sakthi Prasad in Bangalore; Editing by Supriya Kurane)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			Bella Corporation Introduces the World&#8217;s First Shortcut Keyboard for 
      Microsoft Office
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			World&#8217;s First Keyboard to Offer Combined Shortcuts for Microsoft 
      Office
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Bella Corporation today introduced the&#160;Shortcut 
      Keyboard, a new line of keyboards featuring time-saving shortcuts 
      for business and creative professionals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			World&#8217;s first keyboard to offer combined shortcuts for Microsoft 
      Office
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Office Trio and Office Duo models of the Shortcut Keyboard are the 
      world&#8217;s first keyboards to offer combined shortcuts for Microsoft 
      Office, using an intuitive (and patent pending) method of displaying the 
      shortcuts on the keyboard. An International Journal of Human Computer 
      Interaction study showed that using keyboard shortcuts can increase 
      productivity as much as 130% as opposed to using a mouse and clicking on 
      menus. With the Office Trio (shortcuts for Word, Excel and Outlook, MSRP 
      $79.95) and Office Duo (shortcuts for Word and PowerPoint, MSRP $69.95) 
      Shortcut Keyboards, users can quickly take advantage of the shortcuts 
      contained in the Office applications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Multiple models for Creative Applications &#8211; MSRP $89.95
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The keyboard is also available for top creative 
      applications such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Photoshop and Avid Media 
      Composer, employing a new design language with crisp color-coded icons 
      along with shortcut names for easy identification. The new design 
      language blends perfectly with any creative environment while allowing 
      the user to easily make use of the keyboard in all their applications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Customizable
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Each Shortcut Keyboard can be customized with a company logo or graphic 
      &#8211; a perfect opportunity for corporations, universities, post houses and 
      individuals to personalize their keyboard. Customization is available 
      for all Shortcut Keyboard models for a nominal fee, usually within 
      twenty-four hours.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Includes 30 Days of Free Training
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Each Shortcut Keyboard includes 30 days of free online training from&#160;Total 
      Training, the pioneer in innovative online video training. Customers 
      will have access to thousands of hours of training for software from 
      companies such as Adobe, Apple, and Microsoft.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Shortcut Keyboard
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Shortcut Keyboard features a modern design to compliment any 
      setting. The keyboards work on both Windows and Mac computers, feature 
      volume up, down and mute buttons (no software driver needed), and use an 
      industry standard USB connection.&#160;&#8220;Working efficiently is fundamental to 
      a company&#8217;s success, and with Bella&#8217;s Shortcut Keyboard, a company can 
      have nearly instant increases in productivity, get 30 days of free 
      training and reinforce their brand, all for less than $100,&#8221; commented 
      Bella&#8217;s President and CEO Gard B. Cookson.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Availability
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Shortcut Keyboard is available now directly through the Bella

&lt;p&gt;PERTH Oct 1 (Reuters) - U.S. oil company Chevron Corp
 said on Tuesday it has signed a liquefied natural gas
supply deal with Japan's Tohoku Electric Power for
supplies from its $29 billion Australian Wheatstone LNG project
for up to 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, Chevron will supply Tohoku with 0.9
million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Tohoku's supply agreement, Chevron has now sold off 85
percent of the gas from its Wheatstone project to Asian
customers through long-term contracts, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wheatstone project, located in northwest Australia, will
have an 8.9 million tonne per year capacity and is expected to
come online in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

			Chevron and Tohoku Electric Sign Wheatstone LNG Agreement
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Agreement to supply 0.9 million tonnes annually from the Wheatstone 
      Project for up to 20 years
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today announced that its Australian 
      subsidiaries have signed binding long-term Sales and Purchase Agreements 
      (SPAs) with Tohoku Electric Power Company, Inc. (Tohoku) to supply 
      liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the Chevron-operated Wheatstone Project 
      in Western Australia.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the agreements, Chevron subsidiaries, together with subsidiaries 
      of Apache Energy and Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company, will 
      supply Tohoku with 0.9 million tonnes per annum of LNG for up to 20 
      years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Joe Geagea, president, Chevron Gas and Midstream, said, &#8220;These 
      agreements with Tohoku create a new partnership between our companies 
      and demonstrate the benefits of buyers and sellers working together to 
      ensure supply is brought to the market to meet growing LNG demand.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Roy Krzywosinski, managing director, Chevron Australia, said, &#8220;We 
      welcome the agreements with Tohoku, which mean that 85 percent of 
      Chevron&#8217;s equity LNG from Wheatstone is now committed to customers in 
      Asia on a long-term basis. These agreements, combined with our ongoing 
      exploration success, demonstrate that our Wheatstone and Gorgon projects 
      in Australian are well-placed to meet the growing demand for natural gas 
      in the Asia-Pacific region.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Wheatstone Project is located at Ashburton North, 7.5 miles (12 
      kilometers) west of Onslow in Western Australia. The project will 
      consist of two LNG trains with a combined capacity of 8.9 million tonnes 
      per annum and a domestic gas plant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Wheatstone Project is a joint venture between Australian 
      subsidiaries of Chevron (64.14 percent), Apache Energy (13 percent), 
      Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company (7 percent), Shell (6.4 per 
      cent), and Kyushu Electric Power Company, Inc. (1.46 percent), together 
      with PE Wheatstone Pty Ltd. (8 percent).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron also holds an 80.17 percent equity interest in the Wheatstone 
      and Iago fields that provide 80 percent of the feed gas to the 
      Wheatstone Project. The participants in the fields are PE Wheatstone Pty 
      Ltd. (10 percent) as well as Australian subsidiaries of Shell (8 
      percent) and Kyushu Electric Power Company, Inc. (1.83 percent).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 1 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc
 will receive Goldman Sachs Inc stock worth
nearly $2.15 billion on Tuesday through warrants acquired as
part of a deal originally signed during the depths of the 2008
financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett received the warrants five years ago when his
investment in Goldman was seen as a vote of confidence in the
bank, which was reeling from turmoil in the credit market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under that deal, Berkshire had the right to buy about 43.5
million Goldman shares - or a roughly 9 percent stake then - at
an exercise price of $115 per share, for $5 billion in total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman announced an amended deal in March that would give
Berkshire a much smaller stake but would not require it to
commit any capital to exercise the warrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire will convert the warrants into shares equal in
value to the difference between the warrants' exercise price and
the average closing price for Goldman shares in the 10 trading
days up to Oct. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the last 10-day share price average of $164.38,
Berkshire would be entitled to about 13.1 million Goldman
shares, making it the sixth largest external investor in the
bank, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett's investment in 2008 cost Goldman dearly. In
addition to the warrants, the bank had to give Berkshire
preferred stock that paid dividends of $500 million a year, or
about $15 a second. Goldman repurchased those shares from
Buffett at a premium in March 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      International Atherosclerosis Society And Pfizer Independent Grants For 
      Learning  Change Collaborate On New Grant Opportunity
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today the International Atherosclerosis Society (IAS) and Pfizer 
      Independent Grants for Learning  Change (IGLC) announce their 
      collaboration on a new grant opportunity focused on improving care for 
      patients around the world with medium or high levels of cardiovascular 
      risk, with a particular focus on dyslipidemia.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Request for Proposals (RFP) being issued today by both organizations 
      is intended to encourage organizations to submit concepts and ideas for 
      design and implementation of scalable, sustainable programs for 
      healthcare providers and patients in developing countries, designed to 
      improve the management of dyslipidemia and other cardiovascular risk 
      factors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The IAS is an international federation of 64 national and regional 
      societies whose basic missions are to promote the scientific 
      understanding of the etiology, prevention, and treatment of 
      atherosclerosis. The IAS exists to coordinate the exchange of scientific 
      information among its member societies, to foster research into the 
      development of atherosclerosis and related cardiometabolic diseases, and 
      to help translate this knowledge into improving the effectiveness of 
      programs designed to prevent and treat this disease. As such, the IAS is 
      able to create partnerships worldwide, especially in those areas of the 
      world where the epidemic of atherosclerosis and its related diseases is 
      exploding and thus meet the growing needs in countries in Central and 
      South America, in Eastern Europe, in Africa, in the Gulf Region and in 
      South and South-East Asia.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The mission of the IGLC is to accelerate the adoption of evidence-based 
      innovations that align the mutual interests of patients, healthcare 
      professionals, and Pfizer, through support of independent professional 
      education activities. The term &#8220;independent&#8221; means the initiatives 
      funded by Pfizer are the full responsibility of the recipient 
      organization. Pfizer has no influence over any aspect of the 
      initiatives, and only asks for reports about the results and impact of 
      the initiatives which it may share publicly.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Comprehensive management of lipids is increasingly recognized as an 
      integral component of cardiovascular risk reduction. However, there 
      remains a wide gap that separates treatment recommendations and 
      real-world lipid management. This is especially evident in economically 
      developing countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular disease 
      accounted for nearly 1 of every 3 deaths in 2004, and approximately 80% 
      of these deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries.1 
      In 2010 the Institute of Medicine issued a report, commissioned by the 
      National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, to address the increasing 
      burden of cardiovascular disease in developing countries.2 
      This report identified numerous barriers to the control of global 
      cardiovascular disease, as well as specific recommendations to increase 
      investment and implementation of cardiovascular disease prevention and 
      management efforts in low- and middle-income countries. Crucial to these 
      efforts are an increased awareness of chronic diseases as a public 
      health priority and coordination among global, national, and regional 
      stakeholders to strengthen healthcare systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This RFP is being issued today by both organizations. The IAS is the 
      lead organization for review and evaluation of applications. A review 
      committee, led by the IAS, will ultimately make decisions on which 
      proposals will receive funding. Grant funding will be provided by 
      Pfizer. Collectively, up to $2 million is available for award. 
      Initially, project concepts and ideas must be submitted as &#8220;Letters of 
      Intent&#8221; to the Pfizer website by the deadline of October 31, 2013 and 
      must be a maximum of 3-pages in length.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Only the member societies of the IAS or their partner organizations may 
      submit Letters of Intent to this RFP. Partnering and collaboration is 
      strongly encouraged.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Organizations interested in responding to this RFP should reach out to 
      the IAS member society in their country or region of the world and 
      submit a collaborative proposal. Similarly, IAS member societies 
      interested in responding to this RFP should bring into their project 
      appropriate partner organizations such as academic medical centers, 
      hospitals or healthcare systems, and other societies or associations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and two Danish pension funds are to buy a combined 26 percent stake in Danish state-owned oil and gas group DONG Energy for 11 billion Danish crowns ($2.00 billion) and plan an IPO for the firm, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dublin, Oct. 2, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Research and Markets
			
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/4sj4p4/dewalt_dct416)
has announced the addition of the "Dewalt
DCT416 camera report and IRISYS Redeye-6A sensor report Bundle
Offer" report to their offering.
			
This bundle offer allows you to get two reports at a discounted
price:
			
			Dewalt - DCT416 Imaging Thermometer Kit Reverse Costing
Analysis
			
Being part of Dewalt
12V cordless tool platform, this rugged product is meant to bring
thermal imaging tools to everyone in the field. Its low-cost when
compared with microbolometer-based cameras is coming with the low
thermal resolution of its 15x15 pixel array. However the
possibility to blend the thermal array with a visual image enhances
its usage.
			
The thermal sensor used in this camera is a ceramic pyroelectric
array. A camera module, an infrared optical lens, a 2.2 display are
packed in a compact housing. The system with its accessories is
supplied in a rigid transport case.
			
Based on a complete teardown analysis, the report provides an
estimation of the production cost as well as the selling price of
the product.
			
			IRISYS REDEYE-6A Pyroelectric Array Sensor Reverse Costing
Analysis
			
IRISYS (Infrared Integrated Systems Ltd), Northampton, UK, is
promoting thermal technology for intelligent building. Using its
own thermal imaging cameras, the company has developed a range of
innovative solutions from people counting to security.
			
The REDEYE-6A is an array sensor using pyroelectric ceramic. The
manufacturing process is simpler than it is for a micro-bolometer.
The ceramic plate is attached on top of the readout integrated
circuit and sealed with the IR window.
			
The definition of the REDEYE-6A is rather low: 31x31 pixels. It is
optimized for low-cost application which do not need a great
definition and high refresh rate. The same pyroelectric ceramic
technology is used for higher definition array sensor, up to 47x47
pixels

			Property/Casualty insurers have a new way to improve data 
      availability, optimize performance and help reduce operational costs
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Guidewire Software, Inc. (NYSE: GWRE) a provider of software products to 
      Property/Casualty (P/C) insurers, today announced that it will add 
      support for IBM&#174; DB2&#174; Linux, UNIX and Windows database software for 
      Guidewire ClaimCenter&#174; 8. The addition expands the database system 
      options available to Guidewire 
      ClaimCenter customers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are pleased to expand our database support options for customers as 
      they embark on their claims transformation journeys,&#8221; said Ben Brantley, 
      chief technology officer, Guidewire Software. &#8220;In addition to offering 
      customers the option of running on DB2, those insurers already running 
      DB2 will now have the ability to implement ClaimCenter without needing 
      to change their relational database management system. We are pleased to 
      work with IBM to support our mutual customers in this way.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Insurers are among the most demanding organizations when it comes to 
      fast, reliable, and secure data management, and use of analytics to 
      optimize business results,&#8221; said Sean Poulley, vice president, databases 
      and warehousing, IBM Software Group. &#8220;Guidewire solutions already run on 
      a wide range of IBM hardware and software platforms including Power 
      Systems and the AIX operating system, System x, and WebSphere 
      Application Server. We are excited that insurers running their business 
      with ClaimCenter are now able to leverage the unique power of DB2 for 
      reliable transaction speed.&#8221;

			New Procter  Gamble Orgullosa Survey Reveals That While the 
      Majority of Latinas Know How to Conduct a Breast Self-Examination, Less 
      Than Half Do Them Regularly
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			To Help Promote Early Detection of Breast Cancer, Orgullosa 
      Launches Online Initiative to Benefit Latinas Through Information and 
      Mammogram Donation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the National Cancer Institute, one Latina in the U.S. dies 
      from breast cancer every 90 minutes. Not only is it the most commonly 
      diagnosed cancer among Latinas, but it is also the leading cause of 
      cancer deaths among them. Unfortunately, for many different reasons, 
      early detection is often disregarded, leading to late diagnoses and a 
      higher mortality rate.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To heighten awareness about breast cancer detection, Procter  Gamble&#8217;s Orgullosa 
      &#8211; an online community dedicated to celebrate, empower, and fuel Latinas&#8217; 
      accomplishments and dreams &#8211; teamed up with Liga Contra el C&#225;ncer 
      to ignite the conversation with Latinas about the importance of taking 
      action  preparing an early detection plan. With the support of Liga 
      Contra el C&#225;ncer, a center that is dedicated to providing free 
      cancer services for underserved patients, Orgullosa kicks off an online 
      initiative aimed at mobilizing Latinas to take charge of their health 
      and spread the message that early detection is the best protection 
      against breast cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To highlight the awareness levels of breast cancer among women, 
      Orgullosa implemented a national survey that found that:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        80 percent of Latinas are not aware that breast cancer is the most 
        common form of cancer among them.
      
			
        88 percent of Latinas acknowledged knowing how to conduct breast 
        self-examination; however, less than half (45%) report examining 
        themselves once a month.
      
			
        Latinas ages 55-64 are more likely than those ages 18-34 to perform 
        breast self-examinations at least monthly (53% vs. 37%).
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The statistics on breast cancer mortality rates among Latinas are 
      alarming. At Procter  Gamble, we recognize that early detection is 
      critical to protecting women's health and combating the disease. That's 
      why we've developed an online initiative that not only provides women 
      with information, but rallies them to help spread the message that early 
      detection saves lives,&#8221; said Luis Restrepo, Orgullosa Senior Brand 
      Manager. &#8220;To engage with Latinas on the topic of breast cancer 
      prevention in a meaningful way, we've developed an interactive online 
      footprint on the Orgullosa community that offers women the chance to 
      connect with one another on an emotional level and give back to those in 
      need.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To inform and inspire its community to join the conversation about early 
      detection, Orgullosa created an interactive online hub that enables 
      Latinas to connect on the topic, give back to underserved Latina 
      patients through a donation, and honor loved ones affected by the 
      disease via a digital tribute. Elements of the initiative include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Providing free mammograms to underserved women at Liga 
        Contra el C&#225;ncer. Throughout the month of October, for every new 
        &#8220;Like&#8221; received on the Orgullosa 
        Facebook page a $1 donation will be made. Through its donation, 
        Orgullosa aims to provide a total of 300 mammograms screenings.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers took a break from bitter debate over government spending to save a program granting special visas to civilian interpreters who risked their lives to work for the American military in Iraq, sending it to the White House on Thursday for President Barack Obama's signature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House of Representatives and the Senate passed by unanimous voice votes a measure that extended the Iraqi Special Immigrant Visa program for three months. Lawmakers said they expected Obama would sign the extension into law shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five-year-old visa plan expired at midnight on Monday, September 30, when the fiscal year ended, threatening to halt processing of visas for thousands of Iraqis who worked as interpreters, or in other capacities, for U.S. forces during the 8-1/2-year war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The State Department has not released exact numbers, but activists and lawmakers said anywhere from 2,000 to 3,500 visa applications are believed to be in the pipeline waiting for approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the Iraqis involved in the program have said they fear for their lives amid mounting violence in their country, where some consider them traitors for having helped U.S. forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had looked like the plan would get lost amid the federal budget dispute between Republicans and Democrats, which led to the government shutdown, also at midnight on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But congressional leaders threw their weight behind a bipartisan push to extend the program, at least long enough for lawmakers to write more permanent legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate passed the extension on Monday night and the House approved it on Wednesday night, sending it back for the Senate's final approval on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are the interpreters, the guides, drivers, people who performed a myriad of functions that were essential for American operations," said Representative Earl Blumenauer, an Oregon Democrat who introduced the first legislation on the program six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Last night, the United States sent a signal that we are not going to leave them behind," he said on the House floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aides said members in both the House and Senate plan to write a provision into a defense authorization bill later this year for a longer extension of the visa plan for Iraqis as well as a similar scheme for Afghan civilians that is due to expire next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocates said they also want to improve the plans, especially to get the visas processed more quickly for the civilian workers and their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The visa approval process, which was meant to take six weeks, can last for years, forcing many former interpreters to go into hiding while they wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; editing by Christopher Wilson)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ: LGND) partner Pfizer 
      received approval today from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
      for DUAVEETM (conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene), for the 
      treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms (VMS) associated with

			About Menopause
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Menopause is a normal, natural event - it marks the permanent end of 
      fertility and is usually confirmed when a woman has missed her period 
      for 12 consecutive months. Menopause is associated with reduced 
      functioning of the ovaries due to aging, resulting in lower levels of 
      estrogens and other hormones. Changes in these hormones cause symptoms 
      of menopause, which may include hot flashes, night sweats and bone loss. 
      While menopause is natural, many women have not discussed treatment 
      options for their symptoms with their doctors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Osteoporosis
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Osteoporosis, the most common bone disease in humans, becomes a serious 
      health threat in postmenopausal women by increasing their risk of 
      fractures. Lower levels of estrogens at the time of menopause are 
      associated with rapid bone loss, and an increased risk of osteoporosis. 
      Approximately 50 percent of women in the U.S. 50 years of age or older 
      have low bone mass, putting them at risk for osteoporosis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About DUAVEE
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Estrogens have been used as hormonal treatments for over 60 years to 
      help manage menopausal symptoms. Using estrogen alone can increase the 
      chance of developing cancer of the uterine lining. When treating 
      postmenopausal women with a uterus, estrogens have traditionally been 
      combined with a progestin. This can decrease the risk of hyperplasia 
      (the thickening of the endometrium), which may be a precursor to cancer 
      of the uterine lining.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      DUAVEE is the first and only therapy to pair conjugated estrogens (CE) 
      with an estrogen agonist/antagonist also known as a selective estrogen 
      receptor modulator (SERM). DUAVEE uses bazedoxifene - instead of a 
      progestin - to help protect the uterine lining against hyperplasia that 
      may result from estrogen alone treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Bazedoxifene was specifically selected to be studied as the SERM in 
      DUAVEE because of its unique pharmacologic profile and mechanism of 
      action, as demonstrated by pre-clinical studies that looked at a number 
      of different SERMs. The pairing of CE with bazedoxifene enables DUAVEE 
      to work selectively in different tissues to activate estrogen receptors 
      in some while inhibiting estrogen activity in others (the uterus). This 
      pairing allows DUAVEE to offer estrogen efficacy in treating 
      moderate-to-severe hot flashes and preventing postmenopausal 
      osteoporosis while providing an alternative way to help protect the 
      uterine lining from hyperplasia.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      DUAVEE should not be used in women who: have or had blood clots; are 
      allergic to any of its ingredients; have unusual vaginal bleeding; have 
      or had certain cancers (e.g. uterine or breast), liver problems, or 
      bleeding disorders; or are pregnant, may become pregnant or are 
      breastfeeding a baby.

&lt;p&gt;By Jeffrey Goldfarb
The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street&#8217;s biggest rivalry is fading further into history. Back in the days of so-called relationship banking, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley slugged it out for exclusive assignments. Now, when it comes to mergers and new stock sales, they are working together more often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The addition of Morgan Stanley as an underwriter on Twitter&#8217;s Goldman-led initial public offering is the latest example of the duo teaming up. They have united as bookrunners some two dozen times already this year, according to Thomson Reuters data. A decade ago, admittedly when markets were still hurting from the bursting of the tech bubble, the two firms joined forces on only four occasions. Even in 2006, the two banks collaborated on fewer than a dozen debuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares an IPO fee with Morgan Stanley more often than with any other competitor. And only Credit Suisse appears on the same tombstone as Morgan Stanley more frequently than does Goldman. It&#8217;s a similar story in MA, where deals done as co-advisers accounted for 16 percent of Goldman&#8217;s total volume from 2010 to 2012 and nearly a fifth of Morgan Stanley&#8217;s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year broke at least a decade-old record for the number of times the two institutions advised the same client, including Clayton Dubilier  Rice on its buyout of David&#8217;s Bridal and NDS on its sale to Cisco Systems. The trend is continuing this year with deals like the purchase by Hudson&#8217;s Bay of retailer Saks, which retained both Goldman and Morgan Stanley for counsel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shrinking field of top-notch advisers and the commoditization of many investment banking services have dampened the competitive spirit. Morgan Stanley has also refocused its business on wealth management. Goldman, meanwhile, has generally stuck to its traditional path. It has resisted nearly all challengers to its worldwide MA crown, topping the league tables for 16 of the last 20 years. In IPOs Morgan Stanley has been stronger of late, but since 1993 Goldman has led those rankings eight times to its rival&#8217;s four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers have changed most. They&#8217;re bigger, more global and often more complex. That encourages hiring more than one financial adviser. For stock sales, it&#8217;s comforting to have several channels to a diverse set of buyers. In mergers there&#8217;s the complexity factor, but chief executives also sometimes lock up advisers as a defensive tactic. Once upon a time Goldman or Morgan Stanley could usually lobby for a role as a trusted sole adviser. These days, with less work on offer, Wall Street&#8217;s solo stars increasingly share the stage.&lt;/p&gt;

      (Hot Flashes) Associated with Menopause and the Prevention of

			DUAVEE is the first and only therapy to pair conjugated estrogens 
      with an estrogen agonist/antagonist, also known as a selective estrogen 
      receptor modulator (SERM) [2]
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), a leader in the development of treatments for 
      menopausal symptoms, is pleased to announce that the United States Food 
      and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved DUAVEETM 
      (conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene) 0.45mg / 20mg tablets, a novel 
      therapy for women with a uterus, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe 
      vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause and the prevention of 
      postmenopausal osteoporosis [1]. When prescribing solely for the 
      prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, therapy should only be 
      considered for women at significant risk and non-estrogen medication 
      should be carefully considered [1]. DUAVEE is a once daily tablet 
      taken orally. It is recommended that all menopausal hormone therapies, 
      including DUAVEE, be used for the shortest duration consistent with 
      treatment goals and risks for the individual woman [1]. Pfizer 
      anticipates that DUAVEE will be available in the U.S. in the first 
      quarter of 2014. This is the first approval of DUAVEE in any country 
      worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There are approximately 33 million women in the United States between 
      the ages of 45-59, [3] and the average age of menopause in the 
      U.S. is 51 [4]. Based on survey data, an estimated 50% of 
      postmenopausal women experience moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms, 
      commonly known as &#8220;hot flashes.&#8221; [5]
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We know that many women currently experiencing menopausal symptoms are 
      not receiving treatment and have not talked to their doctor about 
      hormone therapy [6].
			It is clear that the menopause 
      dialogue needs to improve,&#8221; said Gail Cawkwell, MD, PhD, Vice President, 
      Pfizer Medical Affairs. &#8220;The approval of DUAVEE, an&#160;important, novel and 
      effective treatment, presents a new opportunity for women and their 
      doctors to discuss appropriate options for managing hot flashes and 
      preventing osteoporosis.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About DUAVEE
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Estrogens have been used as hormonal treatments for over 60 years to 
      help manage menopausal symptoms [7]. Using estrogen alone can 
      increase the chance of developing cancer of the uterine lining. When 
      treating postmenopausal women with a uterus, estrogens have 
      traditionally been combined with a progestin. This can decrease the risk 
      of hyperplasia (the thickening of the endometrium), which may be a 
      precursor to cancer of the uterine lining [7].
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      DUAVEE is the first and only therapy to pair conjugated estrogens (CE) 
      with an estrogen agonist/antagonist also known as a selective estrogen 
      receptor modulator (SERM) [2]. DUAVEE uses bazedoxifene - instead 
      of a progestin - to help protect the uterine lining against hyperplasia 
      that may result from estrogen-alone treatment [1].
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Bazedoxifene was specifically selected to be studied as the SERM in 
      DUAVEE because of its unique pharmacologic profile and mechanism of 
      action, as demonstrated by pre-clinical studies that looked at a number 
      of different SERMs [8]. The pairing of CE with bazedoxifene 
      enables DUAVEE to work selectively in different tissues to activate 
      estrogen receptors in some while inhibiting estrogen activity in others 
      (the uterus) [1]. This pairing allows DUAVEE to offer estrogen 
      efficacy in treating moderate-to-severe hot flashes and preventing 
      postmenopausal osteoporosis while providing an alternative way to help 
      protect the uterine lining from hyperplasia [1].
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      DUAVEE should not be used in women who: have or had blood clots; are 
      allergic to any of its ingredients; have unusual vaginal bleeding; have 
      or had certain cancers (e.g. uterine or breast), liver problems, or 
      bleeding disorders; or are pregnant, may become pregnant or are 
      breastfeeding a baby [1].
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			DUAVEE Clinical Trial Program
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The approval is based on Phase III clinical trials in the Selective 
      Estrogens, Menopause, And Response to Therapy 
      (SMART) program. These trials evaluated the safety and efficacy of 
      DUAVEE in generally healthy, postmenopausal women with a uterus for the 
      treatment of moderate-to-severe hot flashes, and the prevention of 
      postmenopausal osteoporosis [1].
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Results from one trial demonstrated that DUAVEE significantly reduced 
      the number of moderate-to-severe hot flashes by 74% at 12 weeks, as 
      compared with placebo (47%). This means that prior to starting 
      treatment, women on DUAVEE had on average 10 hot flashes per day while 
      women on placebo had 11. After 12 weeks of treatment, women taking 
      DUAVEE experienced on average three hot flashes per day while women 
      taking placebo had six. In addition, significant decreases in mean hot 
      flash severity were seen at 12 weeks (39%), as compared with placebo 
      (13%) [1].
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In other clinical trials, at years one and two, DUAVEE significantly 
      increased bone mineral density in the total hip and lumbar spine from 
      baseline compared with decreases seen with placebo [1].
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Some common side effects of DUAVEE include muscle spasms, nausea, 
      diarrhea, upset stomach, abdominal pain, throat pain, dizziness and neck 
      pain [1]. Estrogen agonist/antagonists (including bazedoxifene) 
      and estrogens individually are known to increase the risk of venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE), otherwise known as blood clots [1]. 
      Patients should talk regularly with their healthcare providers about how 
      long to stay on treatment with DUAVEE [1].
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Given that menstruation does not occur after menopause, clinicians are 
      mindful of any vaginal bleeding that may occur in patients they are 
      treating [4]. In women treated with DUAVEE, the rates of vaginal 
      bleeding and spotting were evaluated and were similar to placebo [1].
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			FDA Action
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The FDA has also issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) regarding a 
      0.625mg / 20mg dose of DUAVEE. This was the only dose submitted for a 
      proposed additional indication for vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      DUAVEE was developed by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, a wholly-owned subsidiary 
      of Pfizer, and is part of a broader research collaboration with Ligand 
      Pharmaceuticals Incorporated.

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Millions of women suffer from menopausal symptoms, despite the 
      availability of effective hormone therapies,&#8221; said Risa Kagan, MD, 
      FACOG, Clinical Professor, Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of 
      California San Francisco and East Bay Physicians Medical Group. &#8220;DUAVEE 
      is an excellent option for symptomatic menopausal women who have a 
      uterus. I&#8217;m excited to be able to offer this new, novel approach to 
      treating moderate-to-severe menopausal vasomotor symptoms for the many 
      women who could benefit.&#8221;

			About Osteoporosis
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Osteoporosis, the most common bone disease in humans, becomes a serious 
      health threat in postmenopausal women [4]. Lower levels of 
      estrogens at the time of menopause are associated with rapid bone loss, 
      and an increased risk of osteoporosis [4]. Approximately 50 
      percent of women in the U.S. 50 years of age or older have low bone 
      mass, putting them at risk for osteoporosis [9].
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Do not take additional estrogens, progestins, or estrogen 
      agonists/antagonists while taking DUAVEE.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Using estrogen may increase your chance of getting cancer of the 
      uterus.
			Report any unusual vaginal bleeding right away while 
      taking DUAVEE.
			Vaginal bleeding after menopause may be a warning 
      sign of cancer of the uterus. A healthcare provider should check unusual 
      vaginal bleeding to find the cause.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Do not use estrogens to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes 
      or dementia.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Estrogens may increase the chance of getting blood clots or strokes.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Using estrogens may increase the chance of getting dementia, based on 
      a study of women 65 years of age or older.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      DUAVEE should not be used in women who: have or had blood clots; are 
      allergic to any of its ingredients; have unusual vaginal bleeding; have 
      or had certain cancers (e.g. uterine or breast),
			liver problems, 
      or bleeding disorders;
			or are
			pregnant, may become 
      pregnant or are breastfeeding a baby.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The use of estrogen-alone has been reported to result in an increase in 
      abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. The effect of 
      treatment with DUAVEE on the risk of breast and ovarian cancer is 
      unknown.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Estrogens increase the risk of gallbladder disease. Discontinue estrogen 
      if loss of vision, severe hypertriglyceridemia or cholestatic jaundice 
      occurs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The most common side effects include muscle spasms, nausea, diarrhea, 
      upset stomach, abdominal pain, throat pain, dizziness, and neck pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      INDICATIONS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      DUAVEE is used after menopause for women with a uterus, to reduce 
      moderate to severe hot flashes and to help reduce the chances of 
      developing osteoporosis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      If using or considering using DUAVEE only to prevent osteoporosis due to 
      menopause, talk to a health care professional about whether a different 
      treatment or medicine without estrogens might be more appropriate. Use 
      DUAVEE for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and 
      risks for the individual woman. Postmenopausal women should be 
      re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if 
      treatment is still necessary.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct 3 (Reuters) - U.S. health regulators have approved
Pfizer Inc's menopause drug Duavee, which is designed to
reduce hot flashes with fewer side effects than older
hormone-replacement therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration said on Thursday it
approved the drug to treat women with moderate to severe
menopause symptoms and to prevent post-menopausal osteoporosis,
a bone disease which can increase the risk of fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug, which Pfizer is developing with Ligand
Pharmaceuticals Inc, combines bazedoxifene - which
belongs to a class of drugs known as selective estrogen receptor
modulators, or SERMS - and conjugated estrogens, which are
derived from the urine of pregnant horses and contained in the
hormone replacement drug Premarin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Census data from 2000 indicate there are about 37.5
million women reaching or currently at menopause, which
typically occurs between the ages of 40 and 59, according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conjugated estrogens have been shown to increase the risk of
uterine cancer, blood clots and strokes. Combining estrogens
with progestin therapy can increase the risk of heart attacks,
strokes, breast cancer and blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA said the bazedoxifene component of the drug reduces
the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, or excessive growth of the
lining of the uterus. But the product's label will carry a boxed
warning, the most serious type, reflecting the risk of
estrogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use of hormone therapy dropped significantly following the
2002 release of safety data from a big study published by the
Women's Health Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA said Duavee is only intended for post-menopausal
women who still have a uterus and should be used for the
shortest duration possible. If the drug is used only to prevent
osteoporosis, "such use should be limited to women who are at
significant risk of osteoporosis after carefully considering
alternatives that do not contain estrogen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug is expected to generate sales of only $161 million
by 2017, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Thursday instructed the U.S. International Trade Commission to reconsider a ruling that gave Google Inc a victory over Microsoft Corp in a patent dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acting on an appeal by Microsoft, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found that the ITC erred in its reasoning when it found that the Google unit Motorola Mobility did not infringe a Microsoft graphical interface patent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a critical discussion of the ITC judge's reasoning, the appeals court said: "This conclusion requires reversal of the 133 patent non-infringement judgment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it also said it agreed with the ITC that Motorola Mobility had successfully changed its smartphones so they no longer infringed the patent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also found the ITC was correct in ruling that Motorola Mobility, which was acquired by Google during the legal fight, did not infringe three other patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dispute is one of dozens globally between various smartphone makers. Google's Android system has become the top-selling smartphone operating system, ahead of mobile systems by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry Ltd and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the original case, the ITC found in May 2012 that Motorola Mobility infringed a patent for meeting-scheduling technology but did not infringe several other Microsoft patents. An order was issued banning infringing mobile phones from the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility says it removed the infringing software from its phones. Microsoft disagrees, and has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, accusing the agency of failing to properly enforce the ITC order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it was happy with the appeals court decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're pleased the court determined Google unfairly uses Microsoft technology," said David Howard, corporate vice president and deputy general counsel. "Google is free to license our inventions, but we're equally pleased if Google makes product adjustments to avoid using them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Motorola Mobility spokesman also saw good news in the appeals court decision. "Today's favorable opinion confirms our position that our products don't infringe the Microsoft patents," said spokesman Matt Kallman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. courts continue to work during the shutdown of the federal government but the ITC is largely shut down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case at the ITC was No. 337-744.

&lt;p&gt;COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Two funds managed by Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and two Danish pension funds will between them buy 26 percent in Danish state-owned oil and gas group DONG Energy for 11 billion Danish crowns ($2.00 billion) and plan an IPO for the firm, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit analysts said the investment, via a capital increase, could lead to a review of the negative outlook on DONG's credit rating. It will allow DONG DOENRY.UL to strengthen its balance sheet, hit by falling electricity demand due to the economic crisis and competition from cheap coal, and pursue its ambition to become a leading player in offshore wind energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already European market leader with 2 gigawatts of offshore wind power installed in Denmark, Britain and Germany, DONG wants to more than triple that to 6.5 gigawatt by 2020, its CEO told Reuters in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once the agreement is finalized, the company can also in the future invest significantly in offshore wind turbines and exploration and production of oil and gas," Danish Finance Minister Bjarne Corydon said in a statement on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Infrastructure Partners - one of the world's biggest infrastructure investors with nearly $10 billion under management - will subscribe to new shares worth 8 billion crowns, along with energy-focused private equity fund Broad Street Energy Partners, also managed by Goldman Sachs. Together they will have a stake of about 19 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danish pension fund Arbejdsmarkedets Till&#230;gspension (ATP) will subscribe 2.2 billion crowns for a 5 percent stake and Pension Forsikringsaktieselskab (PFA) 0.8 billion for a 2 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal would see the state's ownership reduced from around 81 percent to about 60 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEGATIVE RATINGS OUTLOOK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DONG Chief Executive Henrik Poulsen, who took over in August 2012, is refocusing the firm's investments. He has said that 50 percent of DONG's future investments will go towards offshore wind and 40 percent to DONG's traditional business of oil and gas exploration and production in the seas around Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Announcing 2012 results in February, Poulsen said DONG planned to divest 10 billion Danish crowns ($1.80 billion) of non-core assets in 2013-14, cut costs by 1.2 billion and raise 6 to 8 billion crowns of new equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DONG has sold more than 8 billion crowns worth of assets - including Danish, Polish, and Norwegian onshore wind projects - and announced nearly 1,000 job cuts in the past 12 months. It has also issued a 500 million euro hybrid bond, half of which was classified as equity by some ratings agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DONG's 36 billion crown debt is rated BBB+, three notches above junk, and is on negative outlook with Standard and Poor's and Fitch. Analysts say the equity increase would have to be finalized before the outlook could be changed, but said it was positive for DONG's creditworthiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitch revised DONG's rating outlook to negative from stable in November 2012 due to a marked deterioration in the firm's leverage ratio and its tough operating environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its adjusted net debt had grown to about six times Funds From Operations (FFO, or operating cash flow) from three times in 2011. For a stabilization of the outlook, this ration would have to sustain below four times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We project that the planned large equity increase, together with good progress on other elements of DONG's financial action plan, would improve the leverage ratio to about three times," Fitch senior director Arkadiusz Wicik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SELL-BACK CLAUSE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DONG and its new investors said in a statement they would seek an initial public offering when conditions were right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they added that if an IPO has not been completed following the release of financial statements for the 2017 financial year, the new investors would have the option to sell their shares back to the Danish State on pre-agreed terms. It gave no further detail on the sell-back clause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An IPO would further break open the near-total public control over the utility sector in Scandinavia, where Finland's Fortum - which is 50.76 percent state-owned - is the only major listed public utility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweden's finance minister said last week that a listing of Swedish utility Vattenfall VATN.UL was not currently on the agenda, although bankers have told Reuters the firm is starting to prepare the ground for a sale or a stock market flotation of its ailing European business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Mette Fraende and Geert De Clercq; writing by Geert De Clercq; editing by Tom Pfeiffer and Sophie Walker)&lt;/p&gt;

      Regulatory News:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Technip (Paris:TEC) (ISIN:FR0000131708) (ADR:TKPPY) and Zachry 
      Industrial, in a partnership called Gulf Coast Partners, have been 
      awarded a substantial contract* to design and build two Polyethylene 
      Plants for Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP (Chevron Phillips 
      Chemical) as a part of its US Gulf Coast Petrochemicals project in Old 
      Ocean, Texas, USA.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The scope of work includes the design, supply and installation of two 
      500,000 metric tons per annum Polyethylene Plants, together with the 
      related offsites, utilities and rail yard. The two new Polyethylene 
      Plants will be built adjacent to the existing Chevron Phillips Chemical 
      facility at Old Ocean. Detailed design has started and on-site 
      mobilization will commence in the first half of 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The partnership combines the strengths of both organizations. Technip&#8217;s 
      operating center in Houston will provide detailed design and field 
      support. Zachry will be responsible for construction. Technip and Zachry 
      will jointly manage global procurement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Polyethylene Plants are part of Chevron Phillips Chemical&#8217;s US Gulf 
      Coast Petrochemicals project, which includes a new grassroots Ethylene 
      Plant at Cedar Bayou, Texas, USA designed by Technip Stone  Webster 
      Process Technology and including the supply of proprietary furnaces and 
      equipment. Following its acquisition of Stone  Webster process 
      technologies last year, Technip leverages a wider offer in Onshore and 
      has strengthened its downstream business leadership.

			Fluor and JGC Joint Venture Awarded EPC Contract by Chevron Phillips 
      Chemical for Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project in Texas
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fluor Corporation (NYSE: FLR) and JGC Corporation announced today that 
      their 50/50 joint venture was awarded an engineering, procurement and 
      construction (EPC) contract by Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP 
      (Chevron Phillips Chemical) for its U.S. Gulf Coast (USGC) 
      Petrochemicals Project. Fluor booked its share of the undisclosed 
      contract value in the third quarter of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The project consists of the ethylene unit (cracker) and associated 
      offsite components to be built at Chevron Phillips Chemical&#8217;s existing 
      Cedar Bayou complex in Baytown, Texas. Fluor&#8217;s scope includes 
      engineering and procurement for the outside battery limit scope as well 
      as direct hire construction for the entire cracker project.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      newly formed association with JGC,&#8221; said Peter Oosterveer, president of 
      Fluor&#8217;s Energy  Chemicals Group. &#8220;The U.S. Gulf Coast continues to play

      their success throughout the project.&#8221;

			Chevron Phillips Chemical Receives Final Approval to Build USGC 
      Petrochemicals Project and Awards EPC Contracts
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP (Chevron Phillips Chemical) is 
      pleased to announce it received board approval to execute the US Gulf 
      Coast (USGC) Petrochemicals Project first announced in March 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additionally, the company awarded an engineering, procurement and 
      construction (EPC) contract to a joint venture between JGC (USA), Inc. 
      and Fluor Enterprises, Inc. to execute the 1.5 million metric tons/year 
      (3.3 billion pounds/year) ethane cracker portion of the project. The 
      company has also awarded an EPC contract to Gulf Coast Partners, a 
      partnership between Technip USA Inc. and Zachry Industrial, Inc., to 
      execute the two new polyethylene facilities, each with an annual 
      capacity of 500,000 metric tons (1.1 billion pounds).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We remain in the first mover position as we take another critical step 
      in executing a project that will benefit our customers, suppliers, local 
      communities and existing and future employees,&#8221; said Pete Cella, 
      president and chief executive officer of Chevron Phillips Chemical. &#8220;We 
      are able to realize this important milestone thanks to continued strong 
      growth in demand for our products, shale resource development in the 
      United States, and the tremendous support of our owners.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The state-of-the-art, world-scale polyethylene units will be capable of 
      producing a wide variety of high and linear low density polyethylene 
      products including bimodal and metallocene-based polyethylene polymers. 
      These facilities will incorporate Chevron Phillips Chemical&#8217;s leading 
      edge metallocene technology and proprietary Advanced Dual Loop bimodal 
      technology.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the bimodal and linear low density products, the 
      flexibility of these units will allow for growth of current blow 
      molding, injection molding and film grades offered by Chevron Phillips 
      Chemical. Sold under the long-established brand names of Marlex&#174; resins 
      for rigid packaging and extrusion applications and Marflex&#174; resins for 
      film and extrusion coating applications, the new production facilities 
      will be complemented by expansion of Chevron Phillips Chemical&#8217;s 
      Technical Service capability offering sustainable solutions in a wide 
      variety of applications ranging from flexible packaging to high 
      performance pressure pipe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ethane cracker will be built at Chevron Phillips Chemical&#8217;s Cedar 
      Bayou plant in Baytown, Texas, and two polyethylene units will be built 
      at a site in Old Ocean, Texas, near Chevron Phillips Chemical&#8217;s Sweeny 
      plant. The USGC Petrochemicals Project is expected to commence 
      construction in early 2014 and create approximately 400 long-term direct 
      jobs and 10,000 engineering and construction jobs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Site preparation is in progress, critical equipment for the project has 
      been ordered, expansion of the supporting infrastructure has commenced 
      and the company has executed a contract for the fabrication of the rail 
      cars needed to supply product to our customers. &#8220;Overall, this project 
      aligns perfectly with Chevron Phillips Chemical&#8217;s strategy of profitable 
      growth, competitive advantage, operational excellence and organizational 
      capability, and we look forward to a successful and safe startup in 
      2017,&#8221; said Cella.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      In August 2013, Chevron Phillips Chemical announced that the company had 
      received the cracker&#8217;s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) greenhouse 
      gas permit and the required Texas Commission on Environmental Quality 
      (TCEQ) air permits necessary to commence construction of both facilities.

which it said only existed for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FRESH 2008 instruments in question were essentially
notes convertible into Monte dei Paschi's shares that JP Morgan
sold to a number of investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Siena prosecutors are also seeking indictments against
seven people, including former Monte Paschi managers Giuseppe
Mussari and Antonio Vigni, for obstructing regulators, market
manipulation and falsifying filings, the judicial source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monte dei Paschi paid 9 billion euros in cash to buy
Antonveneta, badly stretching its finances just months before
the outbreak of the global financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is also at the centre of a probe over loss-making
derivatives deals its former management made in the aftermath of
the Antonveneta deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank took a 4.1 billion euro state bailout earlier this
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

			Visa and @UKplc announce strategic partnership to launch cloudBuy, an 
      advanced Procure-to-Pay and business planning tool in Asia Pacific
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Global payments technology company, Visa 
      and @UKplc, 
      one of the United Kingdom&#8217;s largest eCommerce marketplace solutions 
      providers, today jointly announced a partnership that will position and 
      deliver effective cost management for Governments and Enterprises in the 
      region. The partnership will launch a cloud-based, advanced 
      e-procurement system that extends the capabilities of existing 
      procure-to-pay products, into business planning and improving 
      interaction between buyers and their suppliers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			cloudBuy 
      is an integrated solution that takes a corporate buyer through a 
      procurement process, from sourcing, order placement, payment, through to 
      analyzing the purchase from a cost management standpoint, in a few mouse 
      clicks. The solution then takes the process further with in-built 
      controls and immediate audit facilities, eliminating rogue buying and 
      off-contract pricing as well as ensuring compliance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      cloudBuy has an exclusive partnership with Visa, which offers a safe and 
      controlled payment environment. The payment method also ensures that 
      buyer organizations do not lapse on payment schedules with their 
      suppliers and that suppliers have better cash flow with shorter payment 
      periods. The payment method will particularly benefit SME suppliers who 
      often suffer cash flow problems because of payment delays by buyers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Economic forecasts in Asia Pacific markets, particularly the more 
      developed ones, have called for austerity measures. We acknowledge that 
      organizations are under pressure to cut costs and improve efficiencies 
      quickly. They are looking for solutions that are not just quick fixes 
      but provide sustainable cost management possibilities,&#8221; said Olivia 
      Leong, Regional Head of Enterprise  Government Payment Solutions, 
      Commercial Products, Visa, Asia Pacific, Central Europe, Middle East and 
      Africa.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We decided to extend Visa&#8217;s collaboration with @UKplc that started in 
      Europe, to Asia Pacific. Through cloudBuy, we bring to market an 
      enhanced electronic procure-to-pay solution that doesn&#8217;t just provide 
      immediate cost savings, but will push companies to reassess their buying 
      behaviors and payment methods to meet long-term cost management 
      objectives,&#8221; Leong added.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa says that the partnership combines the strengths of the company&#8217;s 
      issuer relationships, a proven network and a track record of bringing 
      innovative payment solutions to the market, with @UKplc&#8217;s experience in 
      developing and running e-commerce and cloud computing solutions for 
      Government and corporate clients.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			cloudBuy &#8211; Going Beyond Procure-to-Pay
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A key differentiator of cloudBuy is its starting point. The system 
      operates on artificial intelligence technology that analyses a buying 
      organization&#8217;s spend detail in just days. It gives an immediate 
      assessment of compliance to raising purchase orders, price variances for 
      the same product across the organization locally and globally, lost 
      opportunities with volume discounts and special promotions, as well as a 
      global price benchmark for the same product. The data and analysis will 
      assist buying organizations to set realistic cost management targets 
      even before cloudBuy is implemented.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Upon implementation, cloudBuy continues to offer data analysis that 
      produces extensive reports that assist organizations with supplier 
      management, contract negotiations and renegotiations, as well as real 
      time tracking of cost management leading to better business forecasting.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We have at hand the intelligence of having analyzed more than $500 
      billion of spend through our SpendInsight tool,&#8221; said Lyn Duncan, CEO, 
      @UKplc. &#8220;cloudBuy&#8217;s client base will benefit from the knowledge gained 
      from @UKplc&#8217;s experience in analyzing corporate buying behavior as well 
      as price variances across the globe. We remain steadfastly committed to 
      helping organizations improve purchasing processes and achieving their 
      strategic business goals.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Working with Visa, we have been challenged to bring to market a 
      technological solution that is easy to implement and use. Buying 
      organizations need not deal with high up-front investments and 
      complicated set-up procedures. There will be a minimum training 
      requirement for administrators and users.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Using the system is intuitive as it has been modeled to be an eCommerce 
      site for corporate purchases. So anyone who is capable of online 
      shopping through an amazon.com or Travelocity will breeze through 
      cloudBuy. This ensures that the adoption rate is higher and 
      organizations will see the benefits of implementation much faster,&#8221; said 
      Duncan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			cloudBuy for Suppliers
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Another e-commerce influence that buyers can see on cloudBuy is its 
      catalogue management system. Typically in e-procurement systems, 
      catalogue management resides with buying organizations that have to 
      manually load suppliers&#8217; spreadsheet catalogues into their portals. This 
      results in extra work for buyers and suppliers as well as out-of-date 
      content and a limited ability to deal with services and more complex 
      products.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      cloudBuy enables suppliers to manage their own content. Suppliers are 
      provided with a B2B website which enables them to manage their catalogue 
      of goods or services, time based booking, pricing and discount 
      structures, inform buyers of delivery charges, stock levels, as well as 
      tax and currency. If suppliers maintain their own websites, cloudBuy can 
      work with them to make those sites interoperable with the buyer&#8217;s 
      cloudBuy portal.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This is a significant step forward from a supplier standpoint as the 
      website structure allows for them to promote their products and services 
      at the right price, ensuring availability, and eliminating hidden costs 
      for buyers, significantly reducing the possibility of disagreement on 
      final purchase prices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      cloudBuy will be first launched in Australia in late 2013. Other markets 
      earmarked for first phase launch include New Zealand, Singapore and Hong 
      Kong.

&lt;p&gt;FLORENCE, Italy Oct 3 (Reuters) - Siena prosecutors
requested that JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co stand trial for
obstructing regulators as part of a wider probe into Banca Monte
dei Paschi di Siena's purchase of Banca Antonveneta
, said a judicial source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors allege JPMorgan withheld information from Italian
regulators about a 1 billion euro ($1.36 billion) financing the
New York-based bank arranged for Italian bank Monte Paschi's
takeover of domestic rival Antonveneta in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors are also seeking indictments against seven
people, including former Monte Paschi managers Giuseppe Mussari
and Antonio Vigni, for obstructing regulators, market
manipulation and falsifying filings, the judicial source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Zurich-based reinsurer finds just CHF175m of demand for
cat/CoCo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* One in 200-year hurricane covered in bond sale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jon Penner and Aimee Donnellan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Oct 4 (IFR) - Swiss Re broke new ground in
reinsurance hybrid capital this week when it priced a
dual-trigger CoCo that borrowed features from the catastrophe
bond market, although the bespoke nature of the deal means it's
unlikely to be replicated widely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Zurich-based reinsurance company printed a CHF175m
(EUR142.7m) 32-year non-call seven-year bond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subordinated contingent write-off structure incorporated
triggers for both solvency and insurance risks. The deal is not
entirely unique, as French reinsurer SCOR priced a similar
private placement in euros this year, but there are very few
other obvious candidates to bring such a trade, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a bit of a strange animal with both solvency and
cat triggers that seemed to only appeal to quite a specialist
audience," said a hybrid capital expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain investors were frightened by the complexity of the
structure. Perhaps one of the scariest elements is the trigger
for a one-in-200-year Atlantic hurricane, a feature typically
seen in a catastrophe bond but not in normal capital-raising
exercises. If such an event were to occur, the paper would be
written down to zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The usual risk profile of cat bonds is based on much higher
probabilities, usually in the one in 30-year to one in 50-year
range, and they generally have a much larger yield to make up
for the increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One lead indicated that the 1/200 risk embedded in this deal
would only have warranted roughly just 2% yield, well below the
amount typically required by insurance-linked security (ILS)
buyers, who are more used to 5-7% yields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swiss Re would have struggled to shift the hurricane risk
off its balance sheet with a standalone cat bond, and decided to
fold it into a solvency bond offering investors 7.5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most ILS investors wouldn't get out of bed for a 2% return,
so this was a chance for Swiss Re to sell hurricane tail-risk to
a wider pool of investors," said a DCM banker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WIDER APPEAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that the deal also had elements of a traditional
CoCo meant that the Zurich-based reinsurer could distribute
catastrophe risk to a wider pool of investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CoCos are also a useful tool for reinsurers seeking to cover
their risks effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with traditional cat bonds, CoCos not only offer
longer duration and larger sized deals, but also provide access
to a more diverse investor base - one that banks such as Credit
Agricole and Credit Suisse have already taken advantage of to
issue permanent write-down deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOLVENCY TRIGGER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Swiss Re's hybrid is slightly more complicated than your
garden variety CoCo or cat issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bond will also trigger if Swiss Re's Swiss Solvency Test
numbers fall below 135%. However, its latest SST levels were at
245% for the Group and 224% for Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd
(the issuing entity), as at the end of the first half of 2013.
Like the catastrophe risk, that level has also been modelled to
have a 1/200-year probability of occurring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The added complexity of the hurricane trigger along with the
solvency trigger led to some interesting conversations for lead
managers - Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, UBS and ZKB - that were
looking to reach a wide investor audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Splitting the deal into its three main components, they
settled on around 4% for a standard classic hybrid, 1.5% for the
SST writedown - using a similar US dollar deal as a guide - and
2% for the cat risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its multiple triggers, orders came in for the bond
from private banks and ultra high net worth individuals with
48%, while hedge funds took 23%, family offices 15%,
institutional and pension funds 12%, and insurance-linked
security funds 2%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bonds came off a bit in the secondary market, quoted
around 98.75-99.30, or roughly 6bp wider on a yield basis, by
Friday afternoon.

			Joslin Partners with Pfizer and Lilly to Develop Ways to Predict and 
      Treat Kidney Failure in Type 2 Diabetes Patients
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Joslin Diabetes Center&#8217;s Office of Commercialization and Ventures, today 
      announced it is collaborating with Eli Lilly and Company and Pfizer Inc. 
      which will enable Joslin and both companies to accelerate research aimed 
      at predicting kidney failure in patients with type 2 diabetes and 
      developing potential ways to treat and prevent this complication of 
      diabetes. This is the first time two pharmaceutical companies have 
      joined forces with Joslin, the world&#8217;s leading diabetes research and 
      clinical care organization, to identify biomarkers for predicting kidney 
      disease. The work at Joslin has been pioneered by and will be led by 
      Andrzej Krolewski, M.D., Ph.D., who heads Joslin&#8217;s Section on Genetics 
      and Epidemiology.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of this co-funded research effort, Joslin will analyze samples 
      from a unique biorepository collected and studied by Dr. Krolewski over 
      a period of 15 years from Joslin type 2 diabetes patients in order to 
      study specific biomarkers associated with the development of kidney 
      failure, with the goal of predicting which patients are at risk of 
      losing kidney function and eventually helping develop targeted drugs to 
      address this condition.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;At Joslin, we are open to creating the best partnerships with industry 
      and this alliance will help us continue our mission to deliver 
      translational research into diagnostic and treatment strategies that 
      better serve the patient community,&#8221; said John L. Brooks III, President 
      and CEO of Joslin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Pfizer is pleased to be a part of this research initiative. The 
      longitudinal sample collection that Dr. Krolewski and colleagues have 
      assembled from patients with Type 2 diabetes and renal function decline 
      is a unique resource,&#8221; said Dr. Christelle Perros-Huguet, Chief 
      Scientific Officer, Pfizer&#8217;s Inflammation  Remodeling Research Unit.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;By leveraging our combined areas of expertise we hope to identify 
      biomarkers that may facilitate development of next generation therapies 
      for people at risk for kidney failure resulting from diabetes,&#8221; said 
      Matt Breyer, M.D., chief scientific officer, lead generation 
      biotechnology discovery research at Lilly. &#8220;Tailoring is increasingly 
      recognized as an important aspect of medical care for diabetics, and 
      this partnership underscores our shared commitment to advancing 
      innovation in an area where the needs are great.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We truly believe that the study of biomarkers that specifically 
      associate with renal function decline will help identify patients who 
      are at the greatest risk of end-stage renal disease which promises to 
      have a tremendous impact on better diagnostic tests for patients as well 
      as new approaches to treat diabetic nephropathy,&#8220; agreed Dr. Krolewski 
      of Joslin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Renal complications, also known as diabetic nephropathy, are one of the 
      most life-threatening complications of diabetes. Over the course of many 
      years, this damage frequently leads to end-stage renal disease, when the 
      kidneys are no longer able to work at the level needed for everyday 
      life. About a half million people in the United States have ESRD, which 
      requires dialysis or kidney transplantation. Nearly 44 percent of these 
      cases are due to diabetes. Currently, there is no accurate noninvasive 
      test to identify patients at high risk of ESRD.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Joslin&#8217;s Office of Commercialization and Ventures (OCV) was created in 
      2011 to work closely with industry partners and deliver new research and 
      clinical solutions to the diabetes community. The OCV has worked with 
      companies in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology device, and food 
      industries to help conduct research, clinical trials and develop 
      product-driven strategic alliances. The OCV also works with Jenesis 
      Biosciences, a for-profit small business, to incubate and accelerate 
      novel technology opportunities to a commercially-ready stage for venture 
      spin-outs and for partner investments.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) was sending workers back out to oil platforms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico on Saturday, a sign the worst of Tropical Storm Karen has passed deepwater areas of the basin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storm has so far shut down about half of all oil output in the U.S. Gulf, according to the government, and a refinery in Louisiana has reduced rates because its supply of crude was affected. Chevron said its production was minimally impacted by the storm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Friday report from the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said 49.5 percent of crude oil output was down, along with about 39 percent of natural gas output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Gulf produces about 1.3 million barrels of oil a day (bpd), according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gulf of Mexico accounts for about 19 percent of U.S. oil production and 6 percent of natural gas output. Energy companies have said they halted facilities with capacity of about 1.06 million barrels of oil a day, though many platforms normally do not run full bore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 30 percent of U.S. natural gas processing plant capacity and 40 percent of the country's refining capacity also line the Gulf Coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motiva Enterprises LLC MOTIV.UL said on Friday it has begun to reduce rates at its 233,500 bpd Norco, Louisiana plant after the storm delayed shipments of oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Norco plant is not in the path of the storm as defined by the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE), but its supplies were affected. The DoE said the cyclone was expected to pass over five Gulf Coast refineries with combined capacity of nearly 1 million bpd. Other nearby refineries could be affected if the storm's path changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had forecasted above-normal activity for the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season, but cooler ocean waters were expected to make it harder for storms to form. In August NOAA said they expected 13 to 19 named storms, of which six to nine could become hurricanes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The storm was weakening but could gain strength over the weekend.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Oct 8 (Reuters) - Swiss fund-of-hedge-funds
manager Gottex is partnering with two former executives
of Blackstone Group and Goldman Sachs to back
Asian hedge fund managers starved of capital since the global
finance crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gottex, via a partnership with Headland Strategic Ltd
founded by Michael Garrow, an ex-Blackstone executive, and
Johannes Kaps, who earlier worked at Goldman, will offer hedge
fund managers as much as $75 million each from next year. It
aims to help them individually build a start-up capital of at
least $100 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scale of the initial financial backing is substantial. A
typical seed investment in Asia has remained around $25 million
in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeders usually pocket 20-30 cents of every dollar earned by
a hedge fund in addition to their share of the return generated.
Many smaller managers and those looking to start in Asia are
willing to share revenues in exchange for long-term capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gottex, via its partnership with Hong Kong-based Headland,
plans to start seeding funds by the first quarter of next year
and back two to three managers every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The aim is for Headland Strategic to make fairly large day
one investments," Gottex co-founder Max Gottschalk told Reuters.
"We want to help each fund launch with a minimum of $100
million, a critical amount of capital for hedge funds to survive
and grow in Asia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partnership has also roped in V-Nee Yeh, co-founder of
Hong Kong-based money manager Value Partners, and
other investors to commit cornerstone capital to Headland
Strategic, Gottex's Gottschalk said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Asian dedicated hedge fund assets have seen virtually no
growth since the global financial crises, creating an ideal
environment for us to negotiate... with top-tier portfolio
managers," Kaps said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three-quarters of Asia's 1,300 hedge funds manage less than
$100 million, according to data from tracker Eurekahedge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headland will compete with the likes of Woori Absolute
Partners and Ascalon Capital, a unit of Australia's Westpac
Banking Corp, in seeding managers in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asian hedge funds as measured by Eurekahedge returned an
average 9.7 percent through September in 2013, outperforming a
1.4 percent drop in the MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares
outside Japan during the period.&lt;/p&gt;

      On January 29, 2006, while reporting on U.S. and Iraqi security forces, 
      Woodruff was seriously injured by a roadside bomb that struck his 
      vehicle near Taji, Iraq. In February 2007, just 13 months after being 
      wounded in Iraq, Woodruff returned to ABC News with his first on-air 
      report, "To Iraq and Back: Bob Woodruff Reports." The hour-long, 
      primetime documentary chronicled his traumatic brain injury (TBI), his 
      painstaking recovery and the plight of thousands of service members 
      returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with similar injuries. Woodruff 
      continues to cover traumatic brain injuries for all ABC News broadcasts 
      and platforms and was honored with a Peabody Award in 2008 for his 
      reporting on the subject.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In February 2007, Woodruff and his wife, Lee, co-wrote a bestselling 
      memoir, In an Instant, chronicling his 
      injuries in Iraq and how their family persevered through a time of 
      intense trauma and uncertainty. The Woodruff family established the Bob 
      Woodruff Foundation (BWF) to raise money to assist injured service 
      members, veterans and their families.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Returning veterans need tools and opportunities in order to move onto 
      the next chapter in their lives. I'm pleased to participate in an event 
      that enables companies to reach out to these heroes so that they can 
      thrive after they return home,&#8221; said Mr. Woodruff.

			About &#8216;Veterans Institute&#8217;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The day-long Veterans Institute, co-sponsored by Heroes Work 
      Here and Disney Institute, is designed to help companies build 
      effective veteran-hiring programs of their own. The event will feature 
      experts from Disney&#8217;s Heroes Work Here, government officials, 
      veterans, and non-profit veterans service organizations, who will share 
      their experiences, best practices, and tips for making a successful 
      transition from the military to the civilian workforce.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Veterans Institute is the latest effort in Disney&#8217;s long history 
      of respect and appreciation for the U.S. Armed Services, and it will 
      leverage the success of Heroes Work Here, which Disney launched 
      in March, 2012 with a commitment to hire more than 1,000 veterans by 
      2015&#8212;a goal the company has already surpassed. This past March, Disney 
      increased its hiring goal to create opportunities for another 1,000 
      former service members in the next two years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Highlights of the Veterans Institute workshop will include: an 
      inside look at Heroes Work Here; renowned keynote speakers, 
      panelists, Disney on-air talent and personalities; customized Disney 
      Institute courses; advice and insights from experts and elite veterans 
      support organizations; and stories from veterans about their own 
      transition to the civilian workforce.

			About Disney&#8217;s Heroes Work Here
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Supporting the U.S. Armed Forces has long been a Disney tradition, and 
      Disney&#8217;s Heroes Work Here continues that proud legacy with a 
      company-wide initiative to hire, train and support military veterans. 
      Disney introduced the program in March, 2012 with a commitment to hire 
      at least 1,000 veterans by 2015. Having exceeded that goal in the first 
      year alone, with 1,300 veterans hired, the company announced in March, 
      2013 that it would create opportunities for another 1,000 former service 
      members over the next two years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Disney&#8217;s Heroes Work Here initiative also features a public 
      awareness campaign to encourage employers across the U.S. to hire former 
      military service members. The campaign includes the free Veterans 
      Institute workshop at Walt Disney World on November 14, 2013, as 
      well as public service announcements 
      highlighting the skills and experience of veterans who work at Disney. 
      The PSAs direct viewers to the White House&#8217;s Joining Forces initiative (www.joiningforces.gov) 
      and have aired across Disney&#8217;s media properties including ESPN, ABC and 
      ABC Family, making more than 500 million impressions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third component of Disney&#8217;s Heroes Work Here initiative is 
      philanthropy. Disney&#8217;s philanthropic support of veteran and military 
      organizations has exceeded $1 million since the launch of Heroes Work 
      Here, and through the Disney VoluntEARS program, employees have 
      engaged in several service projects with veterans organizations in 
      communities around the country.

      Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today announced that it is making three 
      key appointments to its executive team and realigning its existing 
      technology and services organizations.

      president, Chevron Gas and Midstream, reporting to John Watson, chairman 
      of the board and chief executive officer. Following Kirkland&#8217;s planned 
      retirement in 2015, consistent with the company&#8217;s mandatory retirement 
      policy, Johnson and Geagea will report to Watson.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;These appointments ensure a smooth transition in our upstream business

      businesses,&#8221; Watson said. &#8220;Jay, Joe and Pierre are experienced leaders 
      who will enhance a very effective leadership team.&#8221;

      Johnson will lead an upstream organization that continues to have four 
      regional operating companies:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Todd Levy will replace Johnson in London as president of Europe, 
        Eurasia and Middle East Exploration and Production Company. Levy 
        currently leads a key Chevron upstream support organization and has 
        wide-ranging upstream experience with past assignments for the company 
        in Kazakhstan, Angola, Australia and the United States.

      These groups will support the company&#8217;s upstream, downstream and 
      midstream businesses. Geagea, who joined Chevron in 1982, has held 
      positions in each of these three areas. He is the current president of 
      Chevron Gas and Midstream and previously was the managing director of 
      the Asia South upstream business unit and president of the company&#8217;s 
      downstream operations in East Africa, the Middle East and Pakistan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Breber, 49, currently is managing director of the Asia South upstream 
      business unit, based in Bangkok, Thailand. He joined Chevron in 1989 and 
      previously has held senior roles in Chevron&#8217;s finance organization, 
      including corporate vice president and treasurer. He will lead a Gas and 
      Midstream business that was reorganized earlier this year to consolidate 
      trading operations and strengthen its support to the upstream and

&lt;p&gt;JUBA Oct 7 (Reuters) - Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB)
, the biggest bank in South Sudan, plans to grow by
launching the first credit card service in the young African
country and adding more branches, executives told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KCB has won a licence from VISA Inc to launch credit
cards in South Sudan, a war-torn country where few people have a
bank account, the executives said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KCB was one of the first foreign banks to set up shop in
Juba after the end of civil war between south and north Sudan in
2005, which led six years later to the secession of South Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Sudan has a large business potential with a population
of nearly 12 million but has struggled to build up state
institutions and an efficient legal system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That has not deterred foreign banks from arriving. Apart
from KCB, Qatar National Bank, Kenya's Co-Operative
Bank and a bank funded by Dubai Islamic Bank 
are also active in South Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KCB now has a market share of 42 percent serving 138,000
customers, Rebecca Likami, deputy managing director of KCB in
South Sudan, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have started VISA," Likami said. "Some KCB outlets
accept VISA. By the end of this year we should (have) VISA in
all the hotels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added customers should be able to use VISA cards at
automated teller machines (ATMs) from next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank also plans to add more branches beyond the existing
20, said Harun Kibogong, KCB's managing director, without being
more specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has started offering mortgages as well, another
novelty in one of the world's least developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have mortgages because there is a lot of construction
taking place across the country. Housing is lacking in Juba,"
said Likami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have developers financing, then we have the normal
mortgage for people who want to buy the house," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KCB was recently hit by a strike of some of its 380 staff
over salaries but Likami said the issue was being worked out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also said the central bank had not yet resumed pumping
dollars into commercial banks after the first oil revenues
landed in its accounts in September with the restart of oil
exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are ... waiting. I am not sure what they are doing but
I believe they will be soon releasing funds to the market," she
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Sudan depends on oil exports, routed through Sudan, to
fund its budget and get dollars to finance imports of food and
consumer goods. A 16-month oil shutdown due to tensions with
Sudan has posed huge liquidity problems for commercial banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KCB South Sudan boosted profit after tax to 41.5 million
South Sudanese Pounds (SSP) (around $14 million) in 2012 from
25.4 million SSP the year before, according to its annual
report.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - Sales Growth Analysis: This section reviews the fastest growing and

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs' equity strategists back trades favouring "long" positions
betting on further gains on Britain's FTSE 100 and Germany's DAX
 equity indexes against "short" bets against Switzerland's SMI 
and the pan-European STOXX 600 indexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first of these ideas is to go "long" on the FTSE 100 while going "short"
on the Swiss market, with Goldman arguing that the British market is more geared
to an improvement in the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Swiss SMI equity index has been an outperformer since the start of 2013,
rising 15.5 percent to beat gains of 12 percent on the DAX and 9 percent on the
FTSE 100, while the STOXX 600 has risen 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Goldman writes that going forward, the FTSE 100 looks a better bet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As we highlighted before, the Swiss market looks expensive versus the FTSE
100. Moreover, we see the UK as more geared to an improvement in the global
cycle and less vulnerable to a relative sell-off in consumer staples," Goldman
writes in its strategy note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, it backs going "long" on the DAX and "short" on the STOXX 600.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The DAX tends to have higher operating leverage than the market, and should
therefore gain more as global growth improves. Further, we expect domestic
demand in Germany to outgrow other euro area countries," it writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters messaging rm://sudip.kargupta.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      On 30 July 2013, Vodafone Vierte Verwaltungs AG (formerly Vodafone 
      Vierte Verwaltungsgesellschaft mbH), D&#252;sseldorf, Germany (the &#8220;Bidder&#8221;), 
      published the offer document (the &#8220;Offer Document&#8221;) for its 
      voluntary public takeover offer (the &#8220;Takeover
			Offer&#8221;) to 
      the shareholders of Kabel Deutschland Holding AG, Unterf&#246;hring, 
      Deutschland (the &#8220;Target Company&#8221;), to acquire all non-par value 
      bearer shares (ISIN DE000KD88880) in the Target Company (collectively 
      the &#8220;KDH Shares&#8221; and individually &#8220;KDH Share&#8221;). The 
      acceptance period for the Takeover Offer (the &#8220;Acceptance Period&#8221;) 
      expired on 11&#160;September 2013, 24:00 hrs (local time at Frankfurt am 
      Main). The additional acceptance period of the Takeover Offer (the &#8220;Additional
			Acceptance Period&#8221;) expired on 30&#160;September 2013, 24:00 hrs 
      (local time at Frankfurt am Main). The Takeover Offer cannot be accepted 
      anymore.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			I. Publication pursuant to Section 23 para. 1 sentence 1 no. 3 Wp&#220;G
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At the end of the Additional Acceptance Period, on 30 September 2013, 
      24:00 hrs (local time at Frankfurt am Main) (the &#8220;Reference Date&#8221;), 
      the share capital of the Target Company amounted to EUR&#160;88,522,939.00 
      and was divided into 88,522,939 KDH Shares.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the Reference Date Vodafone Group Plc, Newbury, England (&#8220;Vodafone&#8221;), 
      a person acting jointly with the Bidder within the meaning of section 2 
      para. 5 Wp&#220;G, held 3,782,179 KDH Shares. This corresponds to 
      approximately 4.27% of the share capital and voting rights of the Target 
      Company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Until the end of the Additional Acceptance Period the Takeover Offer has 
      been accepted for a total of 67,780,374&#160;KDH Shares. This corresponds to 
      approximately 76.57% of the share capital and voting rights of the 
      Target Company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Furthermore, neither the Bidder, nor any person acting jointly with it 
      within the meaning of section&#160;2 para. 5 Wp&#220;G, nor any of their 
      subsidiaries, held any additional KDH Shares or financial instruments or 
      other instruments within the meaning of sections 25, 25a WpHG on the 
      Reference Date. Moreover, no further voting rights from KDH Shares were 
      attributed to them as of the Reference Date.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the Reference Date, the aggregate number of KDH Shares held by the 
      Bidder and persons acting jointly with the Bidder plus the number of 
      KDH&#160;Shares for which the Takeover Offer has been accepted until the 
      Reference Date amounts to 67,780,374&#160;KDH Shares, provided that 
      KDH&#160;Shares which would qualify under more than one of the above criteria 
      shall only be counted once. This corresponds to approximately 76.57% of 
      the share capital and voting rights of the Target Company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			II. Settlement of the Takeover Offer
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the settlement of the Takeover Offer Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, 
      Frankfurt am Main, as central settlement agent for the Takeover Offer, 
      has to transfer the offer consideration to the depository banks 
      simultaneously with transfer of title to the tendered KDH Shares 
      pursuant to Section&#160;11.6 of the Offer Document. Settlement of the 
      Takeover Offer is expected to occur on 14 October 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As the settlement of the Takeover Offer will therefore take place 
      following the annual general meeting of the Target Company on 10 October 
      2013 the shareholders of the Target Company will pursuant to Section 4 
      of the Offer Document first receive the dividend resolved upon in the 
      annual general meeting of the Target Company, which was announced to 
      amount to EUR&#160;2.50 per KDH Share. By way of the settlement of the 
      Takeover Offer the shareholders in the Target Company having accepted 
      the Takeover Offer will receive EUR 84.50 per KDH Share from the Bidder.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			III. Domination and profit and loss transfer agreement
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On 20 September 2013, the Bidder has approached KDH in order to enter 
      into negotiations on the conclusion of a domination and profit and loss 
      transfer agreement pursuant to Sections 291 et seq. of the German Stock 
      Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz &#8211; AktG).

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Guitarist Phil Chevron of the Anglo-Irish folk-punk band the Pogues died on Tuesday at the age of 56 after a long battle with cancer, the band said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron joined the Pogues in 1984 and became a core member as the group made its name internationally in the 1980s and early 1990s with albums including "Rum, Sodomy and The Lash" and "If I Should Fall From Grace With God".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, whose real name was Philip Ryan, wrote the band's popular ballad "Thousands Are Sailing".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was unique. We'll miss him terribly. Dublin town, and the world, just got smaller," the Pogues said in a statement on their website. "His loved ones are in our thoughts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, who was born in Dublin, started out with the Irish act The Radiators From Space, which has been described as Ireland's first punk band, but he moved to London where he joined the Pogues fronted by fellow Irishman Shane MacGowan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as playing guitar for the Pogues, he turned his hand to banjo and mandolin and occasionally took lead vocals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron stayed with the Pogues after MacGowan left in 1991 and was replaced by Joe Strummer, former frontman of The Clash, but he quit three years later due to poor health spurred by drug and alcohol abuse. The band split up in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He later reformed the Radiators with ex-Pogues bassist Cait O'Riordan. When the Pogues reformed in 2001 and interest in their music revived, Chevron remastered the band's back catalogue on CD and took a big role in their annual reunion tours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was diagnosed with head and neck cancer in 2007 and was given a clean bill of health in April 2012 but the cancer returned. His last appearance was at a testimonial concert in his honor in Dublin two months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Belinda Goldsmith; Editing by Mark Heinrich)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Tuesday it is paying a well-known hacking expert more than $100,000 for finding security holes in its software, one of the largest such bounties awarded to date by a high-tech company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) disclosed a 2.8 percent passive stake in Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) as it converted warrants acquired during the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett received the warrants five years ago when his investment in Goldman was seen as a vote of confidence in the bank, which was reeling from turmoil in the credit market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Buffett's deal with Goldman, Berkshire had the right to buy about 43.5 million Goldman shares - or a roughly 9 percent stake then - at an exercise price of $115 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman had amended the deal in March, which gave Berkshire a much smaller stake but did not require it to commit any capital to exercise the warrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters reported last week that Berkshire would convert the warrants into shares equal in value to the difference between the warrants' exercise price and the average closing price for Goldman shares in the 10 trading days up to October 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The billionaire investor disclosed the stake of 13.06 million shares as of October 1 in a regulatory filing late on Tuesday. (r.reuters.com/vyv63v)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stake, valued at about $2 billion based on Goldman's Tuesday close of $153.05, makes Berkshire the sixth-largest external investor in the bank, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Aman Shah in Bangalore)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 8 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc
 disclosed a 2.8 percent passive stake in Goldman Sachs
Group Inc as it converted warrants acquired during the
financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett received the warrants five years ago when his
investment in Goldman was seen as a vote of confidence in the
bank, which was reeling from turmoil in the credit market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Buffett's deal with Goldman, Berkshire had the right
to buy about 43.5 million Goldman shares - or a roughly 9
percent stake then - at an exercise price of $115 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman had amended the deal in March, which gave Berkshire
a much smaller stake but did not require it to commit any
capital to exercise the warrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters reported last week that Berkshire would convert the
warrants into shares equal in value to the difference between
the warrants' exercise price and the average closing price for
Goldman shares in the 10 trading days up to Oct. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The billionaire investor disclosed the stake of 13.06
million shares as of Oct. 1 in a regulatory filing late on
Tuesday. ()&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stake, valued at about $2 billion based on Goldman's
Tuesday close of $153.05, makes Berkshire the sixth-largest
external investor in the bank, according to Thomson Reuters
data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Jim Finkle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSTON Oct 8 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on
Tuesday it is paying a well-known hacking expert more than
$100,000 for finding security holes in its software, one of the
largest such bounties awarded to date by a high-tech company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software maker also released a much anticipated update

Security, won Microsoft's first $100,000 bounty for identifying
a new "exploitation technique" in Windows, which will allow it
to develop defenses against an entire class of attacks, the

take ownership of, Oracle Corp's Java software in a
high-profile contest known as Pwn2Own (pronounced "pown to

Explorer on Tuesday afternoon to fix a security bug that it
first disclosed last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers say hackers initially exploited that flaw to
launch attacks on companies in Asia in an operation that the
cybersecurity firm FireEye has dubbed DeputyDog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marc Maiffret, chief technology officer of the cybersecurity
firm BeyondTrust, said the vulnerability was later more broadly
used after Microsoft's disclosure of the issue brought it to the
attention of cyber criminals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is advising computer users to immediately install the
update to Internet Explorer, if they do not have their PCs
already set to automatically download updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any time they patch something that has already been used
(to launch attacks) in the wild, then it is critical to apply
the patch," Maiffret said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That vulnerability in Internet Explorer was known as a
"zero-day" because Microsoft, the targeted software maker, had
zero days notice to fix the hole when the initial attacks

			JPMCC 
      2012-C8 Surveillance Report
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) affirmed all of its outstanding ratings 
      for 14 classes of certificates in JPMCC 2012-C8, a $1.1 billion CMBS 
      multi-borrower transaction. The conduit transaction is collateralized by 
      43 fixed-rate commercial mortgage loans that are secured by 83 
      properties. For individual certificate ratings, please see the list 
      below.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction has exhibited stable performance since issuance. The WA 
      KLTV (95.2%) and WA KDSC (1.57x) have remained relatively flat since 
      issuance when they were 96.2% and 1.57x, respectively. The top 10 loans, 
      which comprise 57.9% of the pool, have generally posted stable 
      performance since securitization and all were assigned a KBRA 
      Performance Outlook (KPO) of Perform. In September 2013, a permitted 
      property release occurred in the National Industrial Portfolio, which 
      reduced the loan&#8217;s balance by $17.9 million, or 115% of the allocated 
      loan amount of the released property. Post release, National Industrial 
      Portfolio is the fourth largest loan comprising 6.5% of the pool 
      balance. As of the September 2013 pay-date, there are no delinquent or 
      specially serviced loans. During our review of the transaction, we did 
      not identify any KBRA Loans of Concern (&#8220;K-LOCs&#8221;). K-LOCs are loans that 
      are either in default or at heightened risk of default in the near term. 
      The review included an examination of the CREFC Investor Reporting 
      Package files and other information provided by the master servicer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The review utilized property financial information obtained from the 
      master servicer, KeyBank National Association (KeyBank), who recently 
      merged with KeyCorp Real Estate Capital Markets, Inc. (KRECM). KeyBank 
      provided updated financial information for 100% of the pool. Of this 
      information, June 2013 data was available for 20 loans (55.9% of the 
      pool balance). The remaining information was comprised of March 2013 
      data (20 loans, 37.2%) and December 2012 data (three loans, 6.9%). KBRA 
      generally utilized 12 months of financial information to determine KNCF. 
      In certain instances, KBRA annualized financial information for loans 
      with partial year financial data. Once KNCF was determined, we conducted 
      our credit modeling using the KBRA Multi-Borrower Model. The modeling 
      produced credit enhancement levels that were compared to the 
      transaction's capital structure, which resulted in the affirmation of 
      all of the transaction's outstanding ratings. For complete details on 
      our analysis, please refer to the surveillance report, as well as links

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) said on Monday that former World Bank Group President Robert Zoellick will rejoin the investment bank as chairman of its international advisory board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appointment marks Zoellick's second stint at Goldman Sachs. Before taking the helm of the World Bank in 2007, he served as vice chairman, international, at the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoellick stepped down from the World Bank after his term ended in 2012. President Barack Obama tapped Dr. Jim Yong Kim, the former president of Dartmouth College, to replace him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since leaving the World Bank, Zoellick has also joined the board of Temasek Holdings, the sovereign wealth fund of Singapore, as well as the international advisory board of the Rolls-Royce Group RROYC.UL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Goldman Sachs, Zoellick will oversee an advisory board that helps identify sources of international business or investment for the bank's clients. Other members of the international advisory board include Otmar Issing, a former member of the executive board of the European Central Bank, and Erik &#197;sbrink, a former Swedish finance minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The story corrects paragraph 3 to say Zoellick opted to step down after his term ended; previously in paragraph 3, the name of Dr. Kim's former employer was corrected to Dartmouth College.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Peter Rudegeair; Editing by L Gevirtz and S Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Chevron blames recent legislative changes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Says to stay in Lithuania, focus on existing field&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Andrius Sytas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VILNIUS, Oct 8 (Reuters) - U.S. energy major Chevron 
has pulled out after winning a tender to explore for shale gas
in Lithuania, blaming changes to laws which have made it less
attractive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron was the only bidder to explore for unconventional
hydrocarbons in the 1,800 square km Silute-Taurage prospect. The
government picked it as a winner a month ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lithuania called the shale gas exploration tender hoping to
become less reliant on gas from its former Soviet master,
Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. company said in a statement it blamed regulatory
and legislative changes that came in after it placed the bid for
exploration rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Significant changes to the fiscal, legislative and
regulatory climate in Lithuania have substantially impacted the
operational and commercial basis of the investment decision
since the company submitted its bid in January 2013," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lithuania's Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius said in a
statement he regretted Chevron's decision, but admitted there
was a lack of regulatory clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The parliament still debates various amendments, which
could affect the use of hydrocarbons in our country. That means,
that first of all we need to have a legal framework in place,"
he said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposals debated by the parliament include taxing
exploration of shale gas and shale oil at 40 percent, up from
the current 16 percent on conventional hydrocarbons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The government will discuss whether to call a new tender
for exploration of shale gas and oil," a government spokeswoman
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said it will stay in Lithuania, focusing on
exploration of conventional hydrocarbons at its existing
Rietavas block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also said it remained "committed to exploring
and evaluating investment opportunities in Central and Eastern
Europe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, which has four concessions for shale gas
exploration in neighboring Poland, said earlier it wanted more
consultation with the Polish government on proposed draft
amendments before they are adopted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil, Talisman and Marathon 
have pulled out of Polish shale gas, citing difficult geology
and short-comings in the regulatory environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian companies will have a more diversified base of funding in coming years, with longer maturities and different structures, that will benefit firms with a focus on infrastructure and other capital-intensive activities, the head of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's unit in the country said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraising patterns within a few years will be very different from now, with longer maturities making the chief difference, Jose Berenguer, JPMorgan's senior country officer in Brazil, said at an event sponsored by Brazil's banking lobby group Febraban.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An improved mix of funding should help companies with a focus on infrastructure investments, because money for those activities is needed for longer periods, the banker said. The country has the lowest investment ratio among Latin America's top economies despite being the region's largest recipient for direct investment and capital inflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, a small part of the banking system's loan book goes to fund the construction of dams, ports and roads, with state development bank BNDES assuming a bigger part of that lending segment in Latin America's largest economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I see a trend in which maturities, conditions will be different five or six years from now," Berenguer said at the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil's government is pushing to create an attractive environment for infrastructure spending in an economy that has struggled over the past three years. The government expects $90 billion in annual investments through 2017 to help Brazil overcome soaring logistics costs and overheads for farmers and exporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure development is a key focus for the Rousseff administration as Brazil prepares to host the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics. Usually, investment in infrastructure is seen as riskier than consumer lending because infrastructure investment tends to be less liquid, with funds parked for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. SHUTDOWN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked by an attendee about the U.S. government shutdown, Berenguer said the political impasse between Republicans and Democrats could be negative for the global economy if it translates into a debt default.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO Oct 8 (Reuters) - Brazilian companies will have a
more diversified base of funding in coming years, with longer
maturities and different structures, that will benefit firms
with a focus on infrastructure and other capital-intensive
activities, the head of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's unit in the
country said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fundraising patterns within a few years will be very
different from now, with longer maturities making the chief
difference, Jose Berenguer, JPMorgan's senior country officer in
Brazil, said at an event sponsored by Brazil's banking lobby
group Febraban.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An improved mix of funding should help companies with a
focus on infrastructure investments, because money for those
activities is needed for longer periods, the banker said. The
country has the lowest investment ratio among Latin America's
top economies despite being the region's largest recipient for
direct investment and capital inflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, a small part of the banking system's loan book
goes to fund the construction of dams, ports and roads, with
state development bank BNDES assuming a bigger part of that
lending segment in Latin America's largest economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I see a trend in which maturities, conditions will be
different five or six years from now," Berenguer said at the
event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil's government is pushing to create an attractive
environment for infrastructure spending in an economy that has
struggled over the past three years. The government expects $90
billion in annual investments through 2017 to help Brazil
overcome soaring logistics costs and overheads for farmers and
exporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure development is a key focus for the Rousseff
administration as Brazil prepares to host the 2014 World Cup and
the 2016 Olympics. Usually, investment in infrastructure is seen
as riskier than consumer lending because infrastructure
investment tends to be less liquid, with funds parked for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. SHUTDOWN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked by an attendee about the U.S. government
shutdown, Berenguer said the political impasse between
Republicans and Democrats could be negative for the global
economy if it translates into a debt default. The impasse is
probably going to be resolved at "the very last minute,"
Berenguer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the U.S. defaulted, it would be for a very short time, he
added. A consequence of that a debt rating downgrade among other
things, he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OSLO Oct 8 (Reuters) - U.S. energy major Chevron 
has decided to pull out of a tender to explore for shale gas in
Lithuania, citing an incomplete legal framework, the Baltic
state's government said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron was the only bidder to explore for unconventional
hydrocarbons in the 1,800 square kilometre Silute-Taurage
prospect, and the government has recognized it as a winner a

		&lt;p&gt;
	CALGARY, Alberta, Oct. 8, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The much-anticipated SMART Room System for Microsoft Lync has been qualified by Microsoft as fully interoperable with Microsoft Lync Server 2013 and is now shipping worldwide. SMART Technologies Inc. (Nasdaq:SMT) (TSX:SMA), a leading provider of collaboration solutions, is one of the first companies to globally ship an integrated hardware and software solution that supports Microsoft Lync in the meeting room. Lync is the popular software application that thousands of companies around the world already use on a daily basis for their communication requirements. The SMART Room System is fully integrated with innovative features, all developed with the goal of extending customers' Microsoft Lync investment into any collaboration space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"We are delighted to see the SMART Room System for Microsoft Lync shipping," says Giovanni Mezgec, General Manager of Lync Product Marketing for Microsoft. "The SMART Room System combines SMART's outstanding visual collaboration solutions with Lync's industry-leading UC features, offering a collaboration solution that can help increase productivity, efficiency and organizational flexibility."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Even prior to the system being available, SMART documented hundreds of customer orders from businesses. The conferencing solution simplifies the collaboration experience for both virtual and face-to-face meeting participants and provides a seamless online experience through sharing of real-time video, voice and data. Businesses that have started using SMART Room System have benefited from its ease-of-use and found it led to better engagement, enhanced communication and increased productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin was presented with the opportunity to test the SMART Room System for Microsoft Lync prior to product launch to assist with product development. The university had previously deployed Microsoft Lync and was one of the largest user bases for enterprise voice, with close to 2,000 active users, making the SMART Room System an ideal fit for the university.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"One of the first benefits we experienced upon implementation was ease-of-use. With the SMART Room System, you can walk into the room, press one button and you're in the meeting," says Dan Smith, Deputy Chief Information Officer, Marquette University. "The system takes the technology barriers away and allows you to quickly get to the heart of the meeting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The SMART Room System is frequently used for IT project meetings that require collaboration by local and remote participants. "With the system, meetings have become more effective because remote attendees are able to see the shared content easily and contribute to the meeting as if they were physically in the room," says Smith. "The video experience enables participants to read visual cues from all attendees &#8211; whether they are local or remote &#8211; which is very powerful and leads to better engagement and clearer communication."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Microsoft's internal studies have indicated that it takes an average of 8 to 12 minutes to begin a meeting using technology, but with the SMART Room System for Microsoft Lync the start-up time for an active session with full access to audio, video and presentation data is reduced to a single touch ensuring optimal use of meeting time. SMART's industry-leading interactive displays feature specialized glass treatment for a smooth touch experience with no drag. The displays also offer integrated ink controls for color selection and proximity detection, an innovative feature enabled by sensors that automatically detect user movements to turn the display on when you enter the room and power off when not in use. The SMART Room System includes an ultra wide-angle, high definition camera offering 109-degree field of view and room grade optics, customized speakers and microphones along with an extra-large room control console with an 11.6" (29.5 cm) display. Each component has been specifically designed and manufactured by SMART.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Since we announced the SMART Room System for Microsoft Lync in March, we have experienced significant interest and growing demand from business users around the world," says Scott Brown, President, Enterprise, SMART Technologies. "We are very pleased to now be shipping this outstanding solution which empowers our customers to participate in active, richly collaborative work sessions from almost anywhere."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CAMBRIDGE, England (Reuters) - Nearly three years after a cost-cutting drive that stunned many in the drugs industry, Pfizer Inc's head of research Mikael Dolsten says his scientists are delivering more for less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability of the biggest U.S. drugmaker to slash research spending by a fifth without reducing the flow of new drugs has boosted returns on invested capital, been applauded by Wall Street and not gone unnoticed at rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Merck &amp; Co Inc followed a similar path with a plan to cut costs and scrap 8,500 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dolsten, 55, Pfizer's quietly spoken president of worldwide research and development (R), who has spent 15 of his 25 years in the pharmaceuticals industry working in Europe, is not ready to declare the job finished yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He intends to fine-tune the company's R engine further by a process of "dynamic" shifting of resources to the hottest research areas, which currently include cancer, vaccines and immune system medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Reinventing drug discovery and development is not a one-time fix. It is a multi-year journey," he said in an interview at Pfizer's Neusentis drug research unit outside Cambridge, England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After closing numerous research sites and cutting spending in several areas requiring big sales forces, Dolsten said Pfizer now had the right level of R spending overall - but it would be adjusted and redeployed as projects waxed and waned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a committed strategic funding for each therapeutic area that gives them critical mass, and then we will move resources as we see the most successful projects need them," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the near-term, we see oncology, vaccines and immunology as three very strong areas ... if great projects arrive, like palbociclib in breast cancer, then we will fund those projects appropriately."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palbociclib, which analysts from JP Morgan and Leerink Swann believe could generate annual sales of $5 billion or more, is arguably Pfizer's most valuable compound in late-stage development and the company has started several new clinical trials to maximize its potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Dolsten said he was also excited about the upside for Pfizer's established Prevnar 13 vaccine - already widely used in children - which may be given as well to prevent pneumonia in adults if clinical tests produce good results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEASURING SUCCESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other big drugmakers have also pruned costs in the face of disappointing R returns and shrinking sales, due to patent losses, but Pfizer's cuts have been particularly deep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The line-up of medicines getting priority treatment at Pfizer these days is very different from the past, when sales were dominated by the cholesterol fighter Lipitor, once the world's top-selling drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipitor was a mass-market drug with peak sales of $12 billion a year but its price crashed once the patent expired in 2011 and cheap generic copies flooded the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, the focus is on "precision" drugs targeted at selected groups of patients - and the low-key building housing Neusentis south of Cambridge exemplifies the new slimmed-down Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the drugs being worked on at Neusentis is a novel painkiller inspired by a rare genetic mutation detected among a few families in northern Pakistan who do not feel pain. The drug is being tested in patients with an extremely rare type of neuropathic pain called erythromelalgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such medicines, if successful, offer true innovation and can fill a critical market niche - a combination that makes for a compelling value proposition to put to healthcare providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, Pfizer is not disclosing just how well its new R structure is performing in terms of financial returns, emphasizing instead the progress of the pipeline and its run of recent drug approvals, which include cancer drugs Xalkori, Inlyta and Bosulif, and Xeljanz for rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dolsten said he might consider sharing more information about R returns in due course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain's GlaxoSmithKline Plc is currently the only major drugmaker to report an internal rate of return on R investment. It said last year that returns had reached 12 percent, up from 11 percent in 2010, and it was confident of reaching its longer-term 14 percent target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dolsten said Pfizer's own internal financial measurements had also shown an improvement, although the U.S. company was wary of publishing data prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you put metrics on the table too early it may serve your story but I'm not sure if those metrics have meaning," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Jane Merriman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bank J.Van Breda  C&#176; Moves its Car Finance Application from an IBM 
      VM/VSE Mainframe to Microsoft .Net with Anubex
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Anubex, leader in automated application modernization, is pleased 
      to announce that the Belgian bank Bank J.Van Breda  C&#176; has completed 
      the migration of its mission-critical Car Finance application from 
      VM/VSE with CICS and VSAM to .Net.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Van Breda Car Finance is a 100% owned subsidiary of Bank J.Van Breda  
      C&#176;, specialized in car financing and car leasing, offering fast credit 
      solutions to its clients. The application is used by about 1500 external 
      users and car dealers, across the country, and covers all aspects of the 
      business. The migrated application went live in September 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Marc Wijnants, CIO at Bank J.Van Breda  C&#176; comments: &#8220;the whole team 
      did a fantastic job, but I would like to express my respect for the 
      Anubex team and their tools, especially for their help with testing, and 
      for their assistance in tuning the performance of the migrated 
      application on the new platform. This project presented a big technical 
      challenge, but after all, that is why we chose Anubex in the first 
      place.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The migration of the mainframe system offered the bank the opportunity 
      to move this mission-critical application to a state-of-the-art 
      architecture, ready for deployment in a private or even the public 
      cloud, if the need would arise.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			ModernizationThe application comprises about 1,1 million 
      lines of COBOL code in total, and 885 screens. These applications use 10 
      gigabytes of data that were managed on the mainframe in VSAM files. The 
      programs made extensive use of transaction processing, internet access, 
      and batch environments of the mainframe. The tools provided by Anubex 
      offered an automation rate of 99.99% for the migration phase.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to Marc Wijnants, the bank&#8217;s CIO, who initiated and oversaw 
      the project, &#8220;The mainframe applications fully addressed the needs of 
      the business for many years. The migration let us preserve the 
      investment in the existing system, while adding value by moving it to a 
      scalable, open environment.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The target system runs on a modern environment with a SQLServer 
      database, and COBOL application servers on a fully virtualized Windows 
      Server platform. The developers are now using &#8220;drag and drop&#8221; gestures 
      to maintain the migrated code in a standard Visual Studio IDE which the 
      bank also hosts on a virtual desktop infrastructure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			IBM VM/VSEVery experienced with BS2000/ODS and z/OS, Anubex 
      now took on the challenge to help its customer migrate away from VM/VSE 
      with CICS and DMS panels, in a fully automated way.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Louis Heymans, CEO of Anubex comments: &#8220;We extended our migration 
      toolset to cover the VM/VSE architecture, as well as our testing tool. 
      From now on, we are fully equipped to help VM/VSE customers unlock their 
      applications and run them on the most modern environments.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Guitarist Phil Chevron of the Anglo-Irish folk-punk band the Pogues died on Tuesday at the age of 56 after a long battle with cancer, the band said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron joined the Pogues in 1984 and became a core member as the group made its name internationally in the 1980s and early 1990s with albums including "Rum, Sodomy and The Lash" and "If I Should Fall From Grace With God".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, whose real name was Philip Ryan, wrote the band's popular ballad "Thousands Are Sailing".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was unique. We'll miss him terribly. Dublin town, and the world, just got smaller," the Pogues said in a statement on their website. "His loved ones are in our thoughts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, who was born in Dublin, started out with the Irish act The Radiators From Space, which has been described as Ireland's first punk band, but he moved to London where he joined the Pogues fronted by fellow Irishman Shane MacGowan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as playing guitar for the Pogues, he turned his hand to banjo and mandolin and occasionally took lead vocals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron stayed with the Pogues after MacGowan left in 1991 and was replaced by Joe Strummer, former frontman of The Clash, but he quit three years later due to poor health spurred by drug and alcohol abuse. The band split up in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He later reformed the Radiators with ex-Pogues bassist Cait O'Riordan. When the Pogues reformed in 2001 and interest in their music revived, Chevron remastered the band's back catalogue on CD and took a big role in their annual reunion tours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was diagnosed with head and neck cancer in 2007 and was given a clean bill of health in April 2012 but the cancer returned. His last appearance was at a testimonial concert in his honor in Dublin two months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Belinda Goldsmith; Editing by Mark Heinrich)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Reuters) - The Caribbean is becoming a hot spot again for drug smuggling into the United States as a new generation of "Cocaine Cowboys" plows the seas in fast boats in search of easy entry points for illicit shipments into the world's largest consumer market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 14 percent of U.S.-bound cocaine shipments - roughly 42 tons - was trafficked through the Caribbean in the first six months of this year, and Puerto Rico and the neighboring Dominican Republic are emerging as hubs of the burgeoning trade, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was double the share of U.S.-bound cocaine that was shipped through the region during the first half of 2012, Vito Guarino, special agent in charge of the DEA's Caribbean division, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the increase - which came amid a 30 percent overall drop in the amount of cocaine smuggled into the United States over the same time period - was at least partly due to increased drug interdiction efforts along the U.S.-Mexico border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Colombian-led traffickers are also simply taking advantage of a region where they made deep inroads in the 1980s, before drug lords in Mexico began to dominate the trade by the late 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last year, U.S. law enforcement agencies have turned up the pressure on the Caribbean traffickers, with more Coast Guard patrols, as well as well as human and electronic intelligence, to detect illicit planes and boats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guarino said the DEA's drug flow estimates were based on seizures and arrests - which offer only a partial indicator. But while experts have been predicting an uptick in Caribbean trafficking for years now, Guarino said the evidence of an escalation was now unmistakable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most cocaine shipments into the region are smuggled aboard drug-laden speed boats, with two or more big engines, that roar across from the northern tip of South America in one or two days, Guarino said, often under cover of darkness. Bales of cocaine are off-loaded to fishing boats or transferred to vehicles on deserted beaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was here when they were doing it predominantly by air. Now it's predominantly by go-fast (boats)," Guarino said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection aircraft spotted a 30-foot long, go-fast boat near Puerto Rico loaded with 1,500 lbs (680 kg) of cocaine in waterproof bales. The boat, its three-man crew, and its cargo were seized by a British navy frigate, HMS Lancaster, patrolling in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lure of Puerto Rico is its status as a U.S. territory. Once drugs are smuggled onto the island they can head right to the U.S. mainland without going through customs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based in Puerto Rico, Guarino, a former Newark cop, began his career with the DEA in Miami in 1985. That was during the heyday of the Colombian cartels and so-called "Cocaine Cowboys," when Miami's role as an epicenter for the cocaine trade turned it into one of the most dangerous cities in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dominican Republic, just across the treacherous Mona Passage strait separating it from Puerto Rico, serves as the transfer point for most of the South American cocaine shipped from Puerto Rico into the United States, Guarino said. The Dominican Republic is also a major transit area for drugs heading to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOMINICAN DRUG LAB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 500 lbs (225 kg) of coca paste, the raw ingredient for refined cocaine, was recently seized from a laboratory on a ranch on the outskirts of the Dominican capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dominican authorities said it was the first full-scale cocaine processing operation ever uncovered in the Caribbean. Cocaine lab refining is usually done in South America, before the final product is shipped in bulk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The similarities between Miami in the 1980s and Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic today are striking, Guarino added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Cocaine Cowboys, the Uzis, the shootouts that we used to have ... You're seeing the same violence," Guarino said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, Puerto Rico set a new record with 1,117 killings. The homicide rate was more than six times the rate on the U.S. mainland and the government said almost half the murders were drug related. The crime rate has since fallen, but still remains three times higher than on the mainland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highlighting Puerto Rico's role as a magnet for the drug trade, federal and local law enforcement authorities on the island announced the take-down earlier this month of one of the most powerful drug gangs to operate in the Caribbean over the last 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those arrested in the bust was Edgar Collazo Rivera, a prominent Puerto Rico businessman who operated shipping and garbage companies and had contracts with municipal governments. His $8 million, 61-foot (18.5-meter) yacht "Olga" was allegedly used to transport cash to the Dominican Republic to buy drugs, according to authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by David Adams in Miami and a Reuters correspondent in San Juan, Puerto Rico; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)&lt;/p&gt;

      U.S. net oil-equivalent production was slightly lower, primarily due to 
      planned turnaround activity across multiple assets in the Gulf of 
      Mexico. International net oil-equivalent production was modestly higher 
      compared to the second quarter, reflecting less turnaround and 
      maintenance activity related to several different assets worldwide.

      U.S. refinery crude-input volumes were slightly higher as the Richmond, 
      California refinery resumed normal operations during the second quarter, 
      but the increase was mostly offset by planned maintenance activity at 
      the El Segundo, California refinery. International refinery crude-input 
      volumes increased following maintenance activity early in the second

      PURPOSE OF "SAFE HARBOR" PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION 
      REFORM ACT OF 1995
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			This interim update of Chevron Corporation contains forward-looking 
      statements relating to Chevron&#8217;s operations that are based on 
      management&#8217;s current expectations, estimates and projections about the 
      petroleum, chemicals and other energy-related industries. Words such as 
      &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;targets,&#8221; &#8220;forecasts,&#8221; 
      &#8220;projects,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;seeks,&#8221; &#8220;schedules,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;budgets,&#8221; 
      &#8220;outlook&#8221; and similar expressions are intended to identify such 
      forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of 
      future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and 
      other factors, many of which are beyond the company&#8217;s control and are 
      difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ 
      materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking 
      statements. The reader should not place undue reliance on these 
      forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this 
      interim update. Unless legally required, Chevron undertakes no 
      obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as 
      a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ 
      materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: changing 
      crude oil and natural gas prices; changing refining, marketing and 
      chemical margins; actions of competitors or regulators; timing of 
      exploration expenses; timing of crude oil liftings; the competitiveness 
      of alternate-energy sources or product substitutes; technological 
      developments; the results of operations and financial condition of 
      equity affiliates; the inability or failure of the company&#8217;s 
      joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and development 
      activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production 
      from existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; 
      potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned 
      projects; the potential disruption or interruption of the company&#8217;s 
      production or manufacturing facilities or delivery/transportation 
      networks due to war, accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe 
      weather or crude oil production quotas that might be imposed by the 
      Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; the potential liability 
      for remedial actions or assessments required by existing or future 
      environmental regulations and litigation; significant investment or 
      product changes required by existing or future environmental statutes, 
      regulations and litigation; the potential liability resulting from other 
      pending or future litigation; the company&#8217;s future acquisition or 
      disposition of assets and gains and losses from asset dispositions or 
      impairments; government-mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, 
      industry-specific taxes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on 
      scope of company operations; foreign currency movements compared with 
      the U.S. dollar; the effects of changed accounting rules under generally 
      accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; and 
      the factors set forth under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; on pages 28 
      through 30 of the company&#8217;s 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In 
      addition, such results could be affected by general domestic and 
      international economic and political conditions. Other unpredictable or 
      unknown factors not discussed in this interim update could also have 
      material adverse effects on forward-looking statements.

      Fitch to Rate JPMBB 2013-C15 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through 
      Certificates; Presale Issued
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on the J.P. Morgan Chase 
      Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust, Series 2013-C15 commercial 
      mortgage pass-through certificates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Outlooks as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$63,681,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$110,000,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$206,902,000 class A-5 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$67,687,000 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$93,942,000 class A-S 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$928,977,000b class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$76,047,000 class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      b Notional amount and interest only.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Oct. 2, 2013. Fitch does not expect to rate the $47,716,349 non-rated 
      class or the $83,503,349 class X-C.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 68 loans secured by 151 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.193 
      billion as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, Barclays Bank PLC, 
      Starwood Mortgage Funding LLC, and KeyBank National Association.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 76.1% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 86.1%, and asset summary reviews on 86.1% of the pool.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction has a Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
      of 1.17x, a Fitch stressed loan-to-value (LTV) of 101.7%, and a Fitch 
      debt yield of 9.08%. Fitch's aggregate net cash flow represents a 
      variance of 7.15% to issuer cash flows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Leverage: The Fitch DSCR of 1.17x is below the average 2012 and 
      first-half 2013 of 1.24x and 1.36x, respectively. The Fitch LTV of 
      101.7% is higher than the 2012 and first-half 2013 averages of 97.2% and 
      99.8%, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Subordinate Debt: Eight loans (21.4%) have subordinate debt, including 
      the largest loan, Veritas Multifamily Portfolio, which has a B note as 
      well as two layers of preferred equity. Three other loans in the top 10 
      (369 Lexington Avenue, Regency Park Apartments, and 2 West 46th Street) 
      all have mezzanine debt.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Concentration in Michigan: The pool has an above average concentration 
      of properties in Michigan with 13 properties (9.1%), atypical of CMBS 
      2.0 transactions. The properties are generally stable performers and 
      considered best in class assets. The largest concentration in this pool 
      is Texas (17.3%), followed by California (15.4%) and Nevada (10.1%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Multifamily Concentration: Multifamily properties comprise 20.4% of the 
      portfolio, which is greater than the first-half 2013 concentration of 
      8.9%. This consists largely of the largest loan in the pool, Veritas 
      Multifamily Portfolio (10%). Additionally, 5.7% of the pool is backed by 
      manufactured housing communities. The largest property types are retail 
      (28.8%) and office (28.2%).

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch performed two model-based break-even analyses to determine the 
      level of cash flow and value deterioration the pool could withstand 
      prior to $1 of loss being experienced by the 'BBB-sf' and 'AAAsf' rated 
      classes. Fitch found that the JPMBB 2013-C15 pool could withstand a 
      40.08% decline in value (based on appraised values at issuance) and an 
      approximately 17.17% decrease to the most recent actual cash flow prior 
      to experiencing a $1 of loss to the 'BBB-sf' rated class. Additionally, 
      Fitch found that the pool could withstand a 49.82% decline in value and 
      an approximately 30.64% decrease in the most recent actual cash flow 
      prior to experiencing $1 of loss to any 'AAAsf' rated class.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) has launched the sale of its physical commodities business, circulating offering documents to potential buyers and valuing the assets at $3.3 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's sales pitch comes after the bank announced it was exiting physical commodity trading in July, as Wall Street faces heightened scrutiny from regulators and politicians on their role in the natural resources supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest part of the physical business is the bank's crude trading operations, which the bank values at $1.7 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter. That's followed by the firm's North American natural gas assets at $800 million and base metals - including the Henry Bath warehouse company - at $500 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch of the offering documents was first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street's largest bank told prospective buyers that the physical business generated $750 million in annual income, before compensation costs, the Journal reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michael Erman in New York and David Sheppard in London; Editing by Eric Beech)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A high dose of Pfizer Inc's drug, tofacitinib, proved as effective as the widely used treatment Enbrel in treating adults with moderate-to-severe psoriasis in a late-stage study, while a lower dose of tofacitinib was less effective than Enbrel, the drugmaker said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts said the mixed results, from a 12-week study called OPT Compare, suggest there would be limited demand for tofacitinib as a treatment for psoriasis if it is eventually approved for the inflammatory skin condition affecting more than 7 million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study examined the effectiveness of both 5 milligram and 10 milligram twice-daily doses of oral tofacitinib with a placebo and with the approved twice-weekly starting dose of injectable Enbrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said tofacitinib, already approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis under the brand name Xeljanz, showed similar dose-response trends and similar safety trends as those seen in an earlier mid-stage trial of tofacitinib for treatment of psoriasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said the findings suggest that tofacitinib, at the 10 milligram dose, has "biologic-like efficacy," meaning effectiveness on par with costly biotech drugs like Enbrel that are grown in living cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Schoenebaum noted that although tofacitinib had been studied at both the 5 milligram and 10 milligram doses for rheumatoid arthritis, it was only approved for the 5 milligram dose due to concerns of increased safety risk of the higher dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a result, there is a risk that only the 5 milligram dose is approved in psoriasis and dermatologists will view (tofacitinib) to be inferior to Enbrel and other biologics with a similar and less robust pool of long-term safety data," Schoenebaum said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citi analyst Yaron Werber said mid-stage trials of tofacitinib showed serious side effects at all dosages, including cardiovascular events, elevated cholesterol and decreases in hemoglobin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Based on our doctor checks, the safety of tofacitinib is not clean enough to garner broad use by the risk-averse dermatology community," Werber said in a research report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xeljanz, approved last November for rheumatoid arthritis, had second quarter sales of $22 million. But some industry analysts expect it to eventually capture annual sales of $1 billion or more, as an alternative to injectable biotech arthritis drugs like Enbrel and Abbott Laboratories Inc's Humira that have their own side effect issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Pfizer said tofacitinib met its primary effectiveness goal in a separate Phase III psoriasis study, called OPT Retreatment, which lasted 56 weeks and compared the 5 milligram and 10 milligram doses of tofacitinib to a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That study compared the effectiveness and safety of withdrawal and retreatment with both tofacitinib doses, compared with placebo, in adult patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A greater proportion of patients taking tofacitinib maintained symptom relief during the withdrawal of treatment compared with patients who switched to placebo, Pfizer said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said full data from the pair of Phase III studies, the first of five late-stage trials of tofacitinib for psoriasis, will be presented at a future scientific meeting. Data from two more of the large studies is expected in the second quarter of 2014, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Pfizer slipped 0.3 percent in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the skin, which also affects nails, joints and other organs. An estimated 125 million people worldwide have the condition, according to Pfizer, including 7.5 million in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is caused partly by an overactive immune system, which causes the body to grow skin cells up to 10-fold faster than normal. The cells build up on top of each other to form raised red patches of plaque on the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enbrel, a blockbuster product sold by Amgen Inc and Pfizer, works by blocking a protein called tumor necrosis factor, that is linked to inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tofacitinib is a so-called JAK inhibitor, as it blocks an enzyme called Janus kinase that is also associated with inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Bernadette Baum and Bob Burgdorfer)&lt;/p&gt;

			Kroll Bond Rating Agency Assigns Preliminary Ratings to JPMBB 2013-C15
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) is pleased to announce the assignment of 
      preliminary ratings to 14 classes of the JPMBB 2013-C15 transaction (see 
      ratings listed below). JPMBB 2013-C15 is a $1.19 billion CMBS conduit 
      transaction collateralized by 68 fixed-rate commercial mortgage loans 
      that are secured by 151 properties.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The loans have principal balances ranging from $2.0 million to $119.0 
      million for the largest loan in the pool, which is secured by Veritas 
      Multifamily Portfolio (10.0%). The portfolio contains 1,230 residential 
      units in 45, mid-rise multifamily complexes located throughout San 
      Francisco, California. The five largest loans also include Miracle Mile 
      Shops (9.2%), 1615 L Street (8.4%), Hulen Mall (7.5%) and Briarcliff 
      Office Portfolio (4.8%) and represent 39.9% of the initial pool balance, 
      while the ten largest loans represent 55.8%. The majority of the loans 
      (56 loans, 86.6% of the pool balance) were used to refinance existing 
      debt, while the proceeds from 11 loans (11.3%) were used for property 
      acquisitions. The proceeds from one portfolio loan (2.0%) were used for 
      both acquisition and refinance. The mortgaged properties are located in 
      31 states and the District of Columbia. Two state concentrations each 
      represent in excess of 15.0% of the pool balance: Texas (17.3%) and 
      California (15.4%). There is also exposure to three property types with 
      concentrations in excess of 15.0%: Retail (28.8%), Office (28.2%) and 
      Multifamily (20.4%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KBRA&#8217;s analysis of the transaction incorporated our multi-borrower 
      rating process that begins with our analysts' evaluation of underlying 
      collateral properties' financial and operating performance, which 
      determine KBRA&#8217;s estimate of sustainable net cash flow (KNCF) and KBRA 
      value using our CMBS Property Evaluation Guidelines. On an aggregate 
      basis, KNCF was 3.4% less than the issuer cash flow. KBRA capitalization 
      rates were applied to each asset&#8217;s KNCF to derive values that were, on 
      an aggregate basis, 31.8% less than third party appraisal values. The 
      pool has an in-trust KLTV of 96.0% and an all-in KLTV of 108.8%; 
      however, the all-in KLTV is skewed by preferred equity that has debt 
      like characteristics and which is associated with the Veritas 
      Multifamily Portfolio loan. Excluding the preferred equity, the pool 
      all-in cutoff KLTV would be 100.5%. The model deploys rent and occupancy 
      stresses, probability of default regressions, and loss given default 
      calculations to determine losses for each loan, which are then used to 
      assign the credit ratings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      For complete details on the analysis, please see our Presale Report,&#160;JPMBB 
      2013-C15, published today at&#160;www.krollbondratings.com.&#160;The 
      preliminary ratings are based on information known to KBRA at the time 
      of this publication. Information received subsequent to this release 
      could result in the assignment of final ratings that differ from the 
      preliminary ratings.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oct 9 (Reuters) - A high dose of Pfizer Inc's drug,
tofacitinib, proved as effective as the widely used treatment
Enbrel in treating adults with moderate-to-severe psoriasis in a
late-stage study, while a lower dose of tofacitinib was less
effective than Enbrel, the drugmaker said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said the mixed results, from a 12-week study called
OPT Compare, suggest there would be limited demand for
tofacitinib as a treatment for psoriasis if it is eventually
approved for the inflammatory skin condition affecting more than
7 million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study examined the effectiveness of both 5 milligram and
10 milligram twice-daily doses of oral tofacitinib with a
placebo and with the approved twice-weekly starting dose of
injectable Enbrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said tofacitinib, already approved to treat
rheumatoid arthritis under the brand name Xeljanz, showed
similar dose-response trends and similar safety trends as those
seen in an earlier mid-stage trial of tofacitinib for treatment
of psoriasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said the findings suggest
that tofacitinib, at the 10 milligram dose, has "biologic-like
efficacy," meaning effectiveness on par with costly biotech
drugs like Enbrel that are grown in living cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Schoenebaum noted that although tofacitinib had been
studied at both the 5 milligram and 10 milligram doses for
rheumatoid arthritis, it was only approved for the 5 milligram
dose due to concerns of increased safety risk of the higher
dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a result, there is a risk that only the 5 milligram dose
is approved in psoriasis and dermatologists will view
(tofacitinib) to be inferior to Enbrel and other biologics with
a similar and less robust pool of long-term safety data,"
Schoenebaum said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citi analyst Yaron Werber said mid-stage trials of
tofacitinib showed serious side effects at all dosages,
including cardiovascular events, elevated cholesterol and
decreases in hemoglobin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Based on our doctor checks, the safety of tofacitinib is
not clean enough to garner broad use by the risk-averse
dermatology community," Werber said in a research report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xeljanz, approved last November for rheumatoid arthritis,
had second quarter sales of $22 million. But some industry
analysts expect it to eventually capture annual sales of $1
billion or more, as an alternative to injectable biotech
arthritis drugs like Enbrel and Abbott Laboratories Inc's
 Humira that have their own side effect issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Pfizer said tofacitinib met its primary
effectiveness goal in a separate Phase III psoriasis study,
called OPT Retreatment, which lasted 56 weeks and compared the 5
milligram and 10 milligram doses of tofacitinib to a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That study compared the effectiveness and safety of
withdrawal and retreatment with both tofacitinib doses, compared
with placebo, in adult patients with moderate to severe
psoriasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A greater proportion of patients taking tofacitinib
maintained symptom relief during the withdrawal of treatment
compared with patients who switched to placebo, Pfizer said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said full data from the pair of Phase III studies,
the first of five late-stage trials of tofacitinib for
psoriasis, will be presented at a future scientific meeting.
Data from two more of the large studies is expected in the
second quarter of 2014, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Pfizer slipped 0.3 percent in midday trading on
the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the skin,
which also affects nails, joints and other organs. An estimated
125 million people worldwide have the condition, according to
Pfizer, including 7.5 million in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is caused partly by an overactive immune system,
which causes the body to grow skin cells up to 10-fold faster
than normal. The cells build up on top of each other to form
raised red patches of plaque on the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enbrel, a blockbuster product sold by Amgen Inc and
Pfizer, works by blocking a protein called tumor necrosis
factor, that is linked to inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tofacitinib is a so-called JAK inhibitor, as it blocks an
enzyme called Janus kinase that is also associated with
inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has told foreign workers - about a third of its 27 million population - to make sure their visas are in order before a planned crackdown next month or face possible deportation, local media reported on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kingdom has turned a blind eye to minor violations of its strict labor regulations for decades, allowing an influx of cheap labor used both by companies and as domestic workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yemen, Egypt, Lebanon, Ethiopia, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Indonesia and the Philippines all have large numbers of citizens working in Saudi Arabia and all rely heavily on their remittances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of a series of reforms over the last two years, Saudi Arabia has tried to free up jobs for its own citizens, 12 percent of whom are unemployed, according to official data. The figure does not include the much larger number of people who are jobless but not looking for work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior Saudis have frequently spoken of efforts to raise employment among locals as one of the biggest long-term challenges facing the world's top oil exporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A majority of the Saudi workforce is employed by the government, Central Bank figures show, but efforts to reduce joblessness by stimulating the economy with free market reforms over the past decade have mostly created posts for expatriates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies face fines and hiring restrictions if they fail to meet their quotas for local hires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the government has introduced a levy of 2,400 riyals ($640) on each foreign worker employed by a company over the number of Saudi nationals it employs. The fee is payable each year when an expatriate's work permit is renewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early this year Riyadh started an unprecedented crackdown on expatriates who were working for a different company than that listed on their residence visa or were employed in a different professional field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 4 the crackdown will resume after a seven-month grace period, and the Labor Ministry said on Tuesday it would form inspection teams to raid companies while Interior Ministry officials check papers on the street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arab News newspaper reported last month that 5.3 million foreign workers had put their papers in order since April. Hundreds of thousands of others left the country during that time, officials have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A text message sent to Saudi mobile phones on Monday read: "the deadline to correct status is approaching.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Tuesday it is paying a well-known hacking expert more than $100,000 for finding security holes in its software, one of the largest such bounties awarded to date by a high-tech company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software maker also released a much anticipated update to Internet Explorer, which it said fixes a bug that made users of the world's most popular browser vulnerable to remote attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Forshaw, who heads vulnerability research at London-based security consulting firm Context Information Security, won Microsoft's first $100,000 bounty for identifying a new "exploitation technique" in Windows, which will allow it to develop defenses against an entire class of attacks, the software maker said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forshaw earned another $9,400 for identifying security bugs in a preview release of Microsoft's Internet Explorer 11 browser, Katie Moussouris, senior security strategist with Microsoft Security Response Center, said in a blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft unveiled the reward programs four months ago to bolster efforts to prevent sophisticated attackers from subverting new security technologies in its software, which runs on the vast majority of the world's personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forshaw has been credited with identifying several dozen software security bugs. He was awarded a large bounty from Hewlett-Packard Co for identifying a way to "pwn," or take ownership of, Oracle Corp's Java software in a high-profile contest known as Pwn2Own (pronounced "pown to own").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also released an automatic update to Internet Explorer on Tuesday afternoon to fix a security bug that it first disclosed last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers say hackers initially exploited that flaw to launch attacks on companies in Asia in an operation that the cybersecurity firm FireEye has dubbed DeputyDog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marc Maiffret, chief technology officer of the cybersecurity firm BeyondTrust, said the vulnerability was later more broadly used after Microsoft's disclosure of the issue brought it to the attention of cyber criminals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is advising computer users to immediately install the update to Internet Explorer, if they do not have their PCs already set to automatically download updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any time they patch something that has already been used (to launch attacks) in the wild, then it is critical to apply the patch," Maiffret said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That vulnerability in Internet Explorer was known as a "zero-day" because Microsoft, the targeted software maker, had zero days notice to fix the hole when the initial attacks exploiting the bug were discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an active, underground market for "zero day" vulnerabilities, criminal groups and governments sometimes pay $1 million or more to hackers who identify such bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/3jjvx5/customer) 
      has announced the addition of the "Customer 
      Analytics Profile: IBM" company profile to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM is one of the most established players in the enterprise customer 
      analytics market, a position it has built up predominately through its 
      industrious acquisition strategy snapping up players such as SPSS, 
      Unica, Coremetrics and Tealeaf. IBM's approach is set apart from others 
      due to its two-fold approach to customer analytics delivered 
      predominately through its Smarter Analytics and Smarter Commerce 
      initiatives.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Each is designed to bring more cohesion to the vast array of software 
      products and components it has on offer but differs by virtue of the 
      fact they target different buying audiences and customer needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      What's more, IBM's customer analytics capabilities stretch further than 
      just software. The company's ability to leverage its global scale and 
      technology footprint to mash together assets from its research labs, 
      service lines and hardware offerings enable it to target some of its 
      clients' most pressing customer analytics needs.

			Pfizer Announces Top-Line Results Of The First Two Of Five Phase 3 
      Clinical Trials Of Tofacitinib In Adults With Moderate-To-Severe Chronic 
      Plaque Psoriasis
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today top-line results from two Phase 3 
      clinical trials of tofacitinib, a novel, oral Janus kinase (JAK) 
      inhibitor that is being investigated for the treatment of adults with 
      moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis: OPT Compare (A3921080) and 
      OPT Retreatment (A3921111). These are the first two of five studies in 
      the Phase 3 Oral Psoriasis Treatment (OPT) Program, one of the largest 
      global clinical trial programs in moderate-to-severe chronic plaque 
      psoriasis to date. Top-line results for the OPT Pivotal 1 and OPT 
      Pivotal 2 trials (A3921078 and A3921079) are anticipated in the second 
      quarter of 2014, and these four studies, in addition to a long-term 
      extension study, will form the potential psoriasis submission package to 
      regulatory authorities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are excited to see progress in our development program in 
      psoriasis,&#8221; said Dr. Steven Romano, senior vice president and the head 
      of the Medicines Development Group for Pfizer Specialty Care. &#8220;The OPT 
      Compare and OPT Retreatment studies provide information that is 
      consistent with our expectations based on the Phase 2 data in psoriasis. 
      We look forward to the results of our remaining Phase 3 trials in order 
      to fully evaluate tofacitinib in psoriasis and how it may fit into 
      clinical practice for patients and physicians.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      OPT Compare is a 12-week, non-inferiority study comparing the efficacy 
      and safety of tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg twice-daily (BID) to high-dose 
      ENBREL&#174; (etanercept) 50 mg twice-weekly (BIW), the approved 
      starting dose for ENBREL for the first twelve weeks, and placebo for the 
      treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque 
      psoriasis. Top-line results from the OPT Compare study showed that 
      tofacitinib met the primary endpoint of non-inferiority to high-dose 
      ENBREL at the 10 mg BID dose. Tofacitinib did not meet the 
      non-inferiority criteria to high-dose ENBREL at the 5 mg BID dose. The 
      dose-response relationship observed for tofacitinib in this trial is 
      consistent with the findings from the Phase 2 trial. Additionally, rates 
      of important safety events were similar across the active treatment arms.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      OPT Retreatment is a 56-week study comparing the efficacy and safety of 
      withdrawal and retreatment with tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg BID to placebo 
      for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe chronic 
      plaque psoriasis. The OPT Retreatment study met its primary efficacy 
      endpoints at the 5 and 10 mg BID doses by demonstrating that a greater 
      proportion of patients continuing tofacitinib treatment maintained their 
      response during the treatment withdrawal phase compared to patients who 
      switched to placebo. Additionally, among patients who lost an adequate 
      response, many were able to recapture their response upon retreatment 
      with tofacitinib. The results of OPT Retreatment will provide relevant 
      information to physicians in clinical practice, as it is common for 
      patients with psoriasis to stop and restart therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      No new safety signals for tofacitinib were observed in these studies, 
      and the efficacy and safety profile of tofacitinib in psoriasis remains 
      consistent with that seen in the Phase 2 clinical trial. Full analyses 
      of the OPT Compare and OPT Retreatment data, including additional 
      efficacy and safety data, will be submitted for presentation at a future 
      scientific meeting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			About OPT Compare (A3921080)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      OPT Compare was a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
      12-week non-inferiority study comparing the efficacy and safety of 
      tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg BID to ENBREL (etanercept) 50 mg BIW and placebo 
      for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe chronic 
      plaque psoriasis who had an inadequate response to, intolerance to, or 
      contraindication to systemic therapy. There were 1106 patients enrolled 
      in this study. The primary objectives of the study were to compare the 
      efficacy of tofacitinib to ENBREL and placebo for the reduction in 
      severity of plaque psoriasis as measured by the proportion of patients 
      achieving a Physician&#8217;s Global Assessment (PGA) response of &#8220;clear&#8221; or 
      &#8220;almost clear,&#8221; and the proportion of patients achieving at least a 75 
      percent reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI75) relative 
      to baseline, two commonly used measures of efficacy in psoriasis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About OPT Retreatment (A3921111)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      OPT Retreatment was a Phase 3 randomized, mixed-blind, three-period, 
      parallel group, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and 
      safety of the withdrawal and retreatment with tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg 
      BID to placebo in adult patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque 
      psoriasis. There were 674 patients enrolled in the study. During period 
      A (24 weeks), patients were treated with tofacitinib at a dose of 5 or 
      10 mg BID in a blinded manner. To qualify for period B, patients had to 
      achieve both a PASI75 and a PGA response of &#8220;clear&#8221; or &#8220;almost clear&#8221;. 
      In period B, patients were randomized to either continue tofacitinib or 
      switch to placebo for 16 weeks or until they lost half of their original 
      PASI response to treatment from Period A, whichever occurred first. In 
      period C, all patients resumed their original tofacitinib dose until 
      week 56. One of the primary objectives of the study was to compare the 
      maintenance of response (period B, withdrawal) with tofacitinib relative 
      to placebo at various time points during the 16 week double-blind active 
      or placebo treatment period. The second primary objective of the study, 
      evaluated in period C (retreatment), was to assess the percentage of 
      patients who regained responses with tofacitinib retreatment after 
      having lost adequate responses during period B. The data announced today 
      are from the planned final analysis at 56 weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			About the OPT Clinical Trial Program
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Phase 3 OPT clinical trial program consists of five studies, 
      including one open-label, long-term extension study evaluating oral 
      tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg BID in adults with moderate-to-severe chronic 
      plaque psoriasis. It is a global, multi-study, comprehensive clinical 
      development program that includes 3,600 patients in 39 countries. The 
      OPT Program is designed to specifically evaluate tofacitinib in 
      moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis, and to support an 
      independent assessment of the benefit:risk profile of tofacitinib in 
      psoriasis patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to OPT Compare and OPT Retreatment, the OPT Program includes 
      the following Phase 3 studies of tofacitinib in psoriasis:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        OPT Pivotal #1 (A3921078) and OPT Pivotal #2 (A3921079): Two Phase 3, 
        52-week, multi-site, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
        parallel-group studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of 
        tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg BID. The primary objectives of the studies are 
        to compare the efficacy of tofacitinib to placebo for the reduction in 
        severity of plaque psoriasis as measured by the proportion of patients 
        achieving a Physician&#8217;s Global Assessment (PGA) response of &#8220;clear&#8221; or 
        &#8220;almost clear,&#8221; at week 16, and the proportion of patients achieving 
        at least a 75 percent reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 
        (PASI75) relative to baseline at week 16, as well as to evaluate the 
        safety and tolerability of tofacitinib over 52 weeks. Key secondary 
        objectives are to evaluate the onset of efficacy and durability of 
        efficacy of tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg BID for the reduction in severity 
        of plaque psoriasis at various time points during 52 weeks of 
        treatment.
      
			
				OPT Extend (A3921061): A long-term (5-year) open-label, 
        extension study evaluating the safety and tolerability of tofacitinib. 
        Patients who have completed any of the other Phase 3 studies have the 
        option, if eligible, to enroll in this study.

			About Plaque Psoriasis
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Psoriasis is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory disease affecting the 
      skin and other organs, such as nails and joints. It affects 
      approximately 125 million people worldwide and 7.5 million in the U.S.1,2,3 
      Due to inconsistent response to treatment, adverse effects, and the 
      limited persistence of therapeutic effects of some systemic therapies, a 
      need for additional therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe 
      chronic plaque psoriasis still remains.4,5,6 Even though 
      guidelines typically state that moderate-to-severe patients are 
      candidates for systemic therapy, 30 percent of moderate patients and 22 
      percent of severe patients appear to be undertreated, and many (moderate 
      24 percent, severe 9 percent) receive no treatment at all, according to 
      a published study. Furthermore, while various treatment modalities are 
      available for psoriasis, widespread treatment dissatisfaction exists, 
      with more than 50 percent of moderate and more than 40 percent of severe 
      patients saying they are dissatisfied with the treatment they have 
      received for their psoriasis.7
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Tofacitinib
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Tofacitinib is a novel oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that is being 
      investigated for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe chronic 
      plaque psoriasis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Discovered and developed by Pfizer scientists, tofacitinib has a novel 
      mechanism of action specifically designed to inhibit the JAK pathways, 
      which are signaling pathways inside the cell that are thought to play a 
      role in the chronic inflammatory responses involved in psoriasis. By 
      inhibiting these JAK pathways, tofacitinib reduces cytokine signaling, 
      cytokine-induced gene expression and activation of cells, which when 
      over activated, results in the immune and inflammatory response, which 
      characterizes psoriasis.

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE Oct 11 (Reuters) - Infosys, India's
second-largest software services exporter, posted a quarterly
profit which missed analyst estimates, and raised the lower end
of its revenue guidance for the fiscal year ending in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consolidated net profit for the three months to Sept. 30 was
24.07 billion rupees ($391 million) compared with 23.69 billion
rupees in the same period a year earlier, the Bangalore-based
company said in a statement Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That missed the 26.26 billion rupees average of analyst
estimates according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, though the
earnings suffered from a 2.19 billion rupee provision for "visa
related matters."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infosys, which trails market leader Tata Consultancy
Services by revenue, counts among its customers Bank of
America Corp, BT Group PLC, Procter &amp; Gamble Co
 and Volkswagen AG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, Infosys, one of the relatively few companies in
India to give guidance, narrowed the range for its fiscal year
revenue growth outlook to 9-10 percent, from 6-10 percent
previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The forecast compares with 12-14 percent for the sector,
according to an estimate by the National Association of Software
and Services Companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 61.5900 Indian rupees)

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - India is talking with JP Morgan and others to gain entry to benchmark indexes for emerging market debt in hopes of attracting billions of dollars in investment and may ease some restrictions on foreign inflows in order to do so, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finance Minister P. Chidambaram and other officials plan to meet next week in the United States with big fund managers that track such indexes including Pimco, Capital International and Standard Life, one of the sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To qualify for entry into the widely-followed JP Morgan Government Bond Index - Emerging Markets, India needs to ease rules on registration, documentation, due diligence rules for the entry of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) in the Indian debt market, besides allowing them to invest more in the government debt, two sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A finance ministry spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a wide current account gap and a weakened rupee, India wants to attract some of the billions of dollars managed passively by tracking global indexes. However, Indian restrictions limit foreign investment in onshore debt, which exclude it from indexes managed by JP Morgan and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India has been taking steps to ease investment rules but is also skittish about fully removing limits given worries about the volatility of global flows. Its credit rating also stands just one notch above junk status, although a downgrade would not disqualify it from an emerging market index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inclusion in popular government bond indexes could attract $20 billion-$40 billion in additional flows into India over a year, Standard Chartered Bank wrote in a report last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is kind of opening up the debt market completely, with all the good and bad that comes with it," said Dilip Parameswaran, head of Asia Credit Advisors, an independent fixed-income consultancy in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It won't solve its balance of payments problems immediately as both the government and the index providers need to finalise details and following which investors will have to readjust their portfolios," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indian government bonds and the rupee gained after the Reuters report, with the benchmark 10-year bond yield falling 4 bps on the day to 8.42 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rupee rose to close at 61.39/40 per dollar on Thursday, strengthening from around 61.95 before the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MODIFYING RULES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In seeking index inclusion, India may modify rules to allow foreign institutions to invest more in government debt, now capped at $30 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While India doesn't want to do away with caps entirely, it is considering further loosening rules that allow higher limits once investors reach 80 percent of the cap, one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another source with a bank said Indian officials approached banks seeking feedback on what New Delhi can do to include its government bonds in indexes. While talks have shown progress, a final decision on timing and India's index weight is at least a couple of months away, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One obstacle to index inclusion is India's withholding tax on foreign investment in government debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year India reduced withholding tax of as much as 20 percent on coupon payments to 5 percent. India argues that the effective rate is zero for the majority of investors covered under bilateral tax treaties with countries such as the United States and Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India last month eased rules to allow foreign institutions to invest in government bonds on an "on tap" basis, or without first requiring the purchase of debt limits. It is also in the process of easing registration and due diligence rules for foreign investors to buy government debt, one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India's preference is to get into the JPMorgan index, one of the sources said, but authorities are also in touch with other index operators such as Barclays and Citi, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan, Barclays and Citi declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the sources said India hopes to reach an agreement with JPMorgan by the end of November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some $250 billion in global funds is invested tracking JP Morgan's Government Bond Index - Emerging Markets - Global Diversified, Standard Chartered Bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign holdings in Asian bond markets have swelled to record highs in recent months, reaching as high as 35 percent of outstanding debt in Indonesia, but in India foreign holdings account for just 4 percent, according to BNP Paribas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Suvashree Dey Choudhury, Himank Sharma and Archana Narayanan; Editing by Kim Coghill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former employee, Carmen Segarra, said that in her seven months of examining Goldman's legal and compliance divisions, she found the bank did not have policies to prevent conflicts of interest as required by regulation, a conclusion that might have caused a downgrade of the Wall Street bank's regulatory rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of Segarra's findings, the New York Fed's Legal Compliance and Risk team voted to downgrade Goldman's annual rating pertaining to policies and procedures, according to the lawsuit filed in federal court in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not clear whether the downgrade occurred, but according to the lawsuit, the threat of one startled Michael Silva, who oversees the New York Fed's relationship with Goldman, and Silva's deputy, Michael Koh. The two officials were concerned that a downgrade could cause clients to stop doing business with the Wall Street bank, the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silva and Koh are named as defendants in Segarra's lawsuit, as is her former supervisor, Johnathon J. Kim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, New York Fed spokesman Jack Gutt said the regulator cannot speak about individual employees or about supervised institutions because the information is private.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The New York Fed provides multiple venues and layers of recourse for its employees to freely express concerns about the institutions it supervises," said Gutt. "Such concerns are treated seriously and investigated appropriately with a high degree of independence. Personnel decisions at the New York Fed are based exclusively on individual job performance and are subject to thorough review. We categorically reject any suggestions to the contrary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally said the bank does not have knowledge of internal Fed discussions or the matters raised by Segarra. He also pointed to a Business Standards Committee report that Goldman produced in January 2011, whose full implementation was announced in May of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman Sachs has a comprehensive approach to addressing conflicts through firmwide and divisional policies and infrastructure," DuVally said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segarra was assigned to Goldman's legal and compliance divisions from October 2011 until May 2012, and looked into three controversial transactions related to Solyndra, Capmark and the merger of El Paso and Kinder Morgan (KMI.N). At that point, Kim, Silva and Koh fired her and had her escorted from the building by security guards after weeks of disputes and pressure to change her examination findings, the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segarra's lawyer, Linda Stengle, said in an interview that Goldman's committees and standards represented "a paper policy that didn't really have any weight." Stengle said that Goldman executives in charge of conflicts told Segarra and other Fed examiners that they did not have a firmwide conflicts policy and also gave inconsistent statements about the conflicts board's duties and findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bank examiners should be able to operate without fear of retaliation against the banks that they're examining," said Stengle. Instead, she said her client was "cornered" by supervisors who "tried to force her or persuade her very heavily to change her findings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra; Editing by Ken Wills)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 10 (Reuters) - A former senior bank examiner
at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York filed a wrongful
termination lawsuit on Thursday, saying  she was fired after
refusing to alter a critical examination of Goldman Sachs Group

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms JPMCC 2011-PLSD
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed all classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Trust 2011-PLSD with Stable Outlooks. A detailed 
      list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations are the result of stable collateral performance since 
      issuance. At issuance the property was 91.6% leased and 90% occupied. 
      Per the first quarter 2013 rent roll, the property was 98% occupied. 
      Servicer reported year-end (YE) 2012 debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
      was 1.84 times (x), compared to 1.85x at issuance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The certificates are collateralized by a five-year fixed rate (5.658%) 
      loan that is amortizing on a 30-year schedule. The current balance of 
      the loan is $366.4 million, reduced from $374.6 million at issuance. The 
      loan matures in November 2016. In addition, there is $150 million 
      mezzanine debt held outside the trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The loan is secured by 1.94 million square feet (SF) of the 2.26 million 
      SF Palisades Center, a super-regional mall located in West Nyack, NY. 
      The anchors Macy's and Lord  Taylor own their own spaces. The in-line 
      tenancy consists of over 200 diverse retail and entertainment tenants. 
      The collateral anchors include JC Penney, Burlington Coat Factory, 
      Dick's Sporting Goods, BJ's Wholesale Club, Target, and Home Depot. As 
      of year-end 2012, sales for in-line tenants at the property remain 
      strong at $537 per square foot (PSF), compared to $529/PSF at issuance. 
      Sales excluding the Apple store were at $463/PSF.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch expects that the newly opened Shops at Nanuet, a 750,000 SF 
      redevelopement located approximately five miles away from the subject, 
      may have some impact on short-term collateral performance. The Shops at 
      Nanuet is smaller in scale with approximately 50 in-line tenants. 
      Several of the newly signed tenants have upcoming lease expirations at 
      the Palisades Center, including The Gap, Apple and Banana Republic.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of its review, Fitch analyzed the performance of the loan and 
      its underlying collateral. Fitch modeled cash flow based on YE2012 OSAR 
      and March 2013 rent roll. Fitch stressed the cash flow by excluding 
      revenue from month-to-month leases, and several tenants with lease 
      rollovers in 2014/2015.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) for the loan is 
      1.26x, compared to 1.40x at issuance which was based on trailing 12 
      month (TTM) Sept. 30, 2011 financials. The Fitch stressed loan-to-value 
      ratio is 70.4%, which is based on capitalization of the Fitch-adjusted 
      net cash flow at a rate of 7.75%, compared to 63.3% at issuance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At issuance, the loan had a Free Rent Reserve account with a total 
      balance of $10.1 million. The account has been depleted.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      All ratings are expected to remain stable as the property is expected to 
      continue to perform within expectations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has affirmed the following classes:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$17.2 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$242.9 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --IO class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --IO class X-B at 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$33.2 million class B at 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$35.5 million class C at 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$37.6 million class D at 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 10 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co,
one of Wall Street's biggest advisers and financiers of
leveraged buyouts, is set to lose its chief private equity
banker to cosmetics maker Revlon Inc this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Alletto, currently JPMorgan's global head of its
financial sponsors group, is due to join Revlon as chief
financial officer, chief administrative officer and executive
vice president by the end of the month, according to a Revlon
regulatory filing published in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alletto's last day with JPMorgan could not be learned but a
person familiar with the matter, who was not authorized to speak
publicly about personnel matters, said on Thursday Alletto was
still with the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alletto, 48, will be replaced by Karen Simon, another
JPMorgan investment banking veteran, whose new title will be
head of North America financial sponsors group. She was
previously vice chair covering the global oil and gas sector and
before that head of the European financial sponsors group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to comment on behalf of the
bank, Alletto or Simon. A Revlon spokeswoman did not respond to
a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alletto became global head of financial sponsors at JPMorgan
in 2009 following a 20-year career in investment banking with
JPMorgan and Chemical Bank spanning several roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Revlon, Alletto's annual base salary will be at least
$765,000, with a target bonus of 75 percent of his base salary
and a provision for exceeding this based upon over-achievement
of the company's goals, according to the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alletto's 2013 target bonus will be guaranteed and he will
also receive a grant of 120,000 restricted shares of Revlon's
common stock which will vest on a pro rata basis over three
years, the filing shows. He is also eligible for grants of more
than $1 million under Revlon's long-term incentive compensation
plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revlon is searching for a new chief after announcing last
week that David Kennedy, the company's vice chairman and former
chief executive, had been appointed as interim CEO. His
predecessor, Alan Ennis, decided to leave to pursue other
interests, Revlon said.&lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Global Software Testing Services Market 2012-2016 
      with Capgemini SA, IBM Corp., and Wipro Ltd Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/kf3bxg/global_software) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Software Testing Services Market 2012-2016" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysts forecast the Global Software Testing Services market to 
      grow at a CAGR of 5.41 percent over the period 2012-2016. One of the key 
      factors contributing to this market growth is the reduction in operation 
      time and cost due to the use of software testing services. The Global 
      Software Testing Services market has also been witnessing an increase in 
      the adoption of cloud-based testing services. However, shortage of 
      skilled workforce could pose a challenge to the growth of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The key vendors dominating this space include Accenture plc, Capgemini 
      SA, IBM Corp., and Wipro Ltd.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The other vendors mentioned in this report are Cognizant Technology 
      Solutions Corp., Computer Sciences Corp., Groupe Steria SA, HCL 
      Technologies Ltd., Hewlett-Packard Co., Hexaware Technologies, Infosys 
      Ltd., Logica plc, Micro Focus International plc, Software Quality 
      Systems AG, TCS Ltd., Tech Mahindra Ltd., Thinksoft Global Services 
      Ltd., and UST Global.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from the team said: The Global Pure 
      Play Software Testing Services market is witnessing a trend of vendors 
      offering cloud-based testing solutions. Cloud computing offers an 
      opportunity to access testing tools and test environments from anywhere 
      around the world. By moving IT infrastructure to the cloud, 
      organizations reduce the capital investment as well as the cost of 
      maintenance, security, and infrastructure. Furthermore, with the testing 
      taking place over the cloud, testers can work independently to decrease 
      the testing time. This can be done by accessing the tested software on 
      the cloud even in the product development stage. Cloud-based solutions 
      also remove the delays during product development and testing, as the 
      software testing team can work independently and in synchronization with 
      the product development team.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers in this market is the 
      need to reduce operation time and cost. In recent years, the market is 
      witnessing an increasing demand for software testing from companies 
      because the quality of applications is highly dependent on the testing 
      process. Hence, to avoid poor execution, slow test turnaround, or 
      excessive costs in the software's lifecycle, companies are relying more 
      on testing services, thereby increasing the adoption of pure-play 
      software testing services.

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - India is talking with JP Morgan and others to gain entry to benchmark indexes for emerging market debt in hopes of attracting billions of dollars in investment and may ease some restrictions on foreign inflows in order to do so, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finance Minister P. Chidambaram and other officials plan to meet next week in the United States with big fund managers that track such indexes including Pimco, Capital International and Standard Life, one of the sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To qualify for entry into the widely-followed JP Morgan Government Bond Index - Emerging Markets, India needs to ease rules on registration, documentation, due diligence rules for the entry of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) in the Indian debt market, besides allowing them to invest more in the government debt, two sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A finance ministry spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a wide current account gap and a weakened rupee, India wants to attract some of the billions of dollars managed passively by tracking global indexes. However, Indian restrictions limit foreign investment in onshore debt, which exclude it from indexes managed by JP Morgan and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India has been taking steps to ease investment rules but is also skittish about fully removing limits given worries about the volatility of global flows. Its credit rating also stands just one notch above junk status, although a downgrade would not disqualify it from an emerging market index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inclusion in popular government bond indexes could attract $20 billion-$40 billion in additional flows into India over a year, Standard Chartered Bank wrote in a report last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is kind of opening up the debt market completely, with all the good and bad that comes with it," said Dilip Parameswaran, head of Asia Credit Advisors, an independent fixed-income consultancy in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It won't solve its balance of payments problems immediately as both the government and the index providers need to finalize details and following which investors will have to readjust their portfolios," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MODIFYING RULES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In seeking index inclusion, India may modify rules to allow foreign institutions to invest more in government debt, now capped at $30 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While India doesn't want to do away with caps entirely, it is considering further loosening rules that allow higher limits once investors reach 80 percent of the cap, one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another source with a bank said Indian officials approached banks seeking feedback on what New Delhi can do to include its government bonds in indexes. While talks have shown progress, a final decision on timing and India's index weight is at least a couple of months away, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One obstacle to index inclusion is India's withholding tax on foreign investment in government debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year India reduced withholding tax of as much as 20 percent on coupon payments to 5 percent. India argues that the effective rate is zero for the majority of investors covered under bilateral tax treaties with countries such as the United States and Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India last month eased rules to allow foreign institutions to invest in government bonds on an "on tap" basis, or without first requiring the purchase of debt limits. It is also in the process of easing registration and due diligence rules for foreign investors to buy government debt, one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India's preference is to get into the JPMorgan index, one of the sources said, but authorities are also in touch with other index operators such as Barclays and Citi, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan, Barclays and Citi declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the sources said India hopes to reach an agreement with JPMorgan by the end of November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some $250 billion in global funds is invested tracking JP Morgan's Government Bond Index - Emerging Markets - Global Diversified, Standard Chartered Bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign holdings in Asian bond markets have swelled to record highs in recent months, reaching as high as 35 percent of outstanding debt in Indonesia, but in India foreign holdings account for just 4 percent, according to BNP Paribas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Suvashree Dey Choudhury, Himank Sharma and Archana Narayanan; Editing by Kim Coghill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Guitarist Phil Chevron of the Anglo-Irish folk-punk band the Pogues died on Tuesday at the age of 56 after a long battle with cancer, the band said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron joined the Pogues in 1984 and became a core member as the group made its name internationally in the 1980s and early 1990s with albums including "Rum, Sodomy and The Lash" and "If I Should Fall From Grace With God".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, whose real name was Philip Ryan, wrote the band's popular ballad "Thousands Are Sailing".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was unique. We'll miss him terribly. Dublin town, and the world, just got smaller," the Pogues said in a statement on their website. "His loved ones are in our thoughts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, who was born in Dublin, started out with the Irish act The Radiators From Space, which has been described as Ireland's first punk band, but he moved to London where he joined the Pogues fronted by fellow Irishman Shane MacGowan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as playing guitar for the Pogues, he turned his hand to banjo and mandolin and occasionally took lead vocals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron stayed with the Pogues after MacGowan left in 1991 and was replaced by Joe Strummer, former frontman of The Clash, but he quit three years later due to poor health spurred by drug and alcohol abuse. The band split up in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He later reformed the Radiators with ex-Pogues bassist Cait O'Riordan. When the Pogues reformed in 2001 and interest in their music revived, Chevron remastered the band's back catalogue on CD and took a big role in their annual reunion tours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was diagnosed with head and neck cancer in 2007 and was given a clean bill of health in April 2012 but the cancer returned. His last appearance was at a testimonial concert in his honor in Dublin two months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Belinda Goldsmith; Editing by Mark Heinrich)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Tuesday it is paying a well-known hacking expert more than $100,000 for finding security holes in its software, one of the largest such bounties awarded to date by a high-tech company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software maker also released a much anticipated update to Internet Explorer, which it said fixes a bug that made users of the world's most popular browser vulnerable to remote attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Forshaw, who heads vulnerability research at London-based security consulting firm Context Information Security, won Microsoft's first $100,000 bounty for identifying a new "exploitation technique" in Windows, which will allow it to develop defenses against an entire class of attacks, the software maker said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forshaw earned another $9,400 for identifying security bugs in a preview release of Microsoft's Internet Explorer 11 browser, Katie Moussouris, senior security strategist with Microsoft Security Response Center, said in a blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft unveiled the reward programs four months ago to bolster efforts to prevent sophisticated attackers from subverting new security technologies in its software, which runs on the vast majority of the world's personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forshaw has been credited with identifying several dozen software security bugs. He was awarded a large bounty from Hewlett-Packard Co for identifying a way to "pwn," or take ownership of, Oracle Corp's Java software in a high-profile contest known as Pwn2Own (pronounced "pown to own").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also released an automatic update to Internet Explorer on Tuesday afternoon to fix a security bug that it first disclosed last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers say hackers initially exploited that flaw to launch attacks on companies in Asia in an operation that the cybersecurity firm FireEye has dubbed DeputyDog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marc Maiffret, chief technology officer of the cybersecurity firm BeyondTrust, said the vulnerability was later more broadly used after Microsoft's disclosure of the issue brought it to the attention of cyber criminals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is advising computer users to immediately install the update to Internet Explorer, if they do not have their PCs already set to automatically download updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any time they patch something that has already been used (to launch attacks) in the wild, then it is critical to apply the patch," Maiffret said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That vulnerability in Internet Explorer was known as a "zero-day" because Microsoft, the targeted software maker, had zero days notice to fix the hole when the initial attacks exploiting the bug were discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an active, underground market for "zero day" vulnerabilities, criminal groups and governments sometimes pay $1 million or more to hackers who identify such bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch Affirms JPMorgan Chase Ratings at 'A+/F1' Despite Legal Reserve; 
      Outlook Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Following the announced $9.15 billion addition to litigation reserves in 
      the quarter, Fitch Ratings has affirmed JPMorgan Chase  Co.'s (JPM) 
      long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+' and short-term IDR at 
      'F1'. Fitch has also affirmed JPM's Viability Rating (VR) at 'a+', its 
      Support Rating at '1', and its Support Rating Floor (SRF) at 'A'. The 
      Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of ratings is provided at the end 
      of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPM's ratings affirmation reflects the strong underlying earnings 
      capacity of the bank, given its dominant domestic franchise and growing 
      international franchise, and progress made toward achieving compliance 
      with heightened capital and liquidity requirements. While the litigation 
      charge is significant, and beyond Fitch's expectations, the agency had 
      considered possible ranges of mortgage-related costs in its analysis, 
      and recognizes that growing legal costs are not unique to JPM. While the 
      scope of current negotiations is unclear, Fitch believes the bank is 
      striving to put the bulk of mortgage-related matters behind them.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Legal costs are likely to remain elevated in coming quarters, but Fitch 
      expects the incremental impact to earnings will be manageable. Still, 
      the emergence of material and unexpected litigation losses could alter 
      the agency's view, particularly given where the firm's current 
      capitalization ratios compare to the broader peer group.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Excluding the litigation charge, core operating performance was 
      relatively solid during the quarter, with the exception of mortgage 
      banking, which was hurt by rising interest rates and expected declines 
      in origination volume. Consumer asset quality trends continued on a 
      positive trajectory, and JPM recognized $1.6 billion of reserve 
      releases, largely in real estate and credit card. Non-interest expenses 
      improved modestly, with headcount reductions and efficiency improvements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The corporate and investment bank's results reflected a seasonally 
      slower quarter, but results outperformed Fitch's expectations. Income 
      was up year over year due to stronger debt and equity underwriting fees 
      and strides made in improving the firm's market position in equities. 
      Average Value-at-Risk (VaR) was down meaningfully from the third quarter 
      of 2012 (3Q'12), at $45 million. Debt valuation adjustment (DVA) losses 
      increased to $397 million from losses of $211 million a year ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mortgage production had a relatively weak quarter given a decline in 
      origination volumes, while mortgage servicing posted a loss due to lower 
      servicing revenue and a negative MSR valuation adjustment. Still, 
      progress has been made in reducing core servicing expenses. Fitch 
      expects mortgage revenue will remain challenged in coming quarters, as 
      new originations fail to offset reductions in refinancing volume. Real 
      estate portfolios had a solid quarter, due largely to improvements in 
      credit and a $1.25 billion reduction in reserves.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The commercial banking and asset management segments remained very 
      steady performers within JPM, with commercial loan growth of 9% and 
      asset under management growth of 12% year over year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company reported a Basel III Tier I Common ratio of 9.3%, which is 
      slightly below the 9.5% requirement, inclusive of the globally 
      systemically important financial institution capital buffer. 
      Additionally, JPM disclosed a firm supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 
      4.7% and a bank SLR of 4.3%, which compare to requirements of 5.5% and 
      6%, respectively. Fitch considers compliance with leverage ratios to be 
      manageable, and will largely be achieved through management actions. 
      Furthermore, JPM disclosed that its liquidity coverage ratio remains in 
      excess of 100%, based on its interpretation of the standard.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Stable Outlook reflects expectations for continued operating 
      consistency, although Fitch believes earnings could decline from current 
      levels as the interest rate environment remains challenging, regulatory 
      costs grow, and credit metrics, particularly in card and the commercial 
      bank, normalize from unsustainable lows. Still, offsets could be 
      achieved from improved performance in mortgage banking and stronger 
      operating efficiencies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Going forward, Fitch believes JPM is going to be challenged to continue 
      to deliver consistent earnings growth, particularly in light of the 
      current regulatory environment. Higher capital charges and what remains 
      difficult market conditions present a challenge for all GTUBs, which may 
      be encouraged to seek more aggressive ways to generate profits that take 
      advantage of regulatory loopholes. However, Fitch expects that JPM's 
      strong global franchise, liquidity risk management, and product 
      diversity mitigate some of these concerns.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch considers JPM's ratings to be particularly sensitive to the degree 
      and scope of litigation risk going forward. Fitch recognizes that the 
      large litigation charge taken during the quarter reflects JPM's desire 
      to address outstanding legal issues. To the extent JPM enters into any 
      litigation settlements, Fitch will consider whether these effectively 
      diminish ongoing legal risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Negative rating actions could result from material asset quality 
      weakening which would pressure JPM's earnings and its ability to build 
      capital, deterioration in liquidity levels, material and unexpected 
      litigation losses, and/or failure to sufficiently address weaknesses 
      noted in regulatory consent orders and the CCAR submission process in a 
      timely fashion. Further, significant risk management or operational 
      failures that result in material losses to the firm could also result in 
      a negative rating action.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Upward rating momentum for JPM is believed to be limited for the 
      foreseeable future given the risk and governance issues the firm is 
      still addressing. Further, its current rating level is among the highest 
      of its peer group and relative to the global bank universe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SRF
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations of JPM's Support Rating and SRF are based on Fitch's 
      view that the probability of support from the U.S. authorities for JPM, 
      if required, remains extremely high in the near term due to the bank's 
      systemic importance. However, JPM's ratings do not currently receive any 
      uplift from support.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SRF
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Support Rating and SRF are sensitive to a change in Fitch's view of 
      the ability or propensity of the U.S. sovereign to extend full support 
      to the bank's senior creditors. There is a clear political intention to 
      ultimately reduce the implicit state support for systemically important 
      banks in Europe and the U.S., as demonstrated by a series of policy and 
      regulatory initiatives aimed at curbing systemic risk posed by the 
      banking industry. This might result in Fitch revising SRFs downward in 
      the medium term, although the timing and degree of any change would 
      depend on developments with respect to specific jurisdictions. Until 
      now, senior creditors in major global banks have been supported in full, 
      but resolution legislation is developing quickly and the implementation 
      of creditor 'bail-in' is starting to make it look more feasible for 
      taxpayers and creditors to share the burden of supporting large, complex 
      banks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS  SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID 
      SECURITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by JPM and by various 
      issuing vehicles are all notched down from JPM's or its bank 
      subsidiaries' VRs in accordance with Fitch's assessment of each 
      instrument's respective nonperformance and relative Loss Severity risk 
      profiles. Their ratings are primarily sensitive to any change in the VRs 
      of JPM or its bank subsidiaries.

      JPM's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and 
      banks, reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is 
      mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of strength for its bank 
      subsidiaries. It has modest double leverage of 105.6% at year-end 2012.

      The IDRs and VRs of JPM's bank subsidiaries benefit from the 
      cross-guarantee mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA and therefore IDRs 
      and VRs are equalized across the group. JPMorgan Securities LLC (JPMS) 
      is a wholly owned subsidiary that is the firm's U.S. broker dealer and 
      is considered core to JPM's business. As a result, its IDR is equalized 
      with that of its parent JPM. Bear Stearns Companies, LLC and JPMorgan 
      Clearing Corp. benefit from a parent guarantee and therefore their IDRs 
      are equalized with JPM's. Collateralized Commercial Paper Co., LLC's 
      short-term IDR benefits from JPMS's guarantee of the amounts payable by 
      the repo seller, JPMCC, and as result its short-term IDR is equalized 
      with that of JPMS. Collateralized Commercial Paper II Co., LLC's 
      short-term IDR is based on the repo seller, JPMS's short-term IDR.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co Inc's hard-charging chief executive, looked a bit more vulnerable on Friday after the bank took a $7.2 billion hit from litigation expenses and posted its first quarterly loss since 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loss is a blow to Dimon, who has long used the bank's steady profit as a shield to ward off critics of its mounting regulatory and legal issues. The bank for the first time said it has stockpiled reserves of $23 billion for expected settlements and other legal expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In unusually humble language for a CEO once lionized on Wall Street and in Washington, Dimon said that the first loss under his leadership was "very painful for me personally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan reported a loss of $380 million, or 17 cents per share, for the third quarter. A year earlier it posted a profit of $5.71 billion, or $1.40 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon earned widespread praise as a risk manager for avoiding most of the mortgage-related losses that hobbled rivals during the financial crisis. But he was less adept at anticipating legal expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"His halo is a little off-kilter at this point," said Jordan Posner, a senior portfolio manager at Matrix Asset Advisors of New York, which owns over 600,000 JPMorgan shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third-quarter legal hit includes money set aside for future settlements. Dimon cautioned that these expenses will likely be elevated for the next year or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wish we could reduce the uncertainty for investors, but we can't," he told reporters in a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, in a conference call with investors, he said it is "very hard to fight with your regulators and the federal government."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even putting litigation aside, revenue fell and other results were lukewarm. Weak fixed-income markets squeezed revenue at JPMorgan's investment bank, off 2 percent from a year ago and down 17 percent from the second quarter, reflecting the tough environment for bond-trading at all Wall Street banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equity markets revenue gained 20 percent. Rivals such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley, both due to report earnings next week, tend to be more heavily weighted in fixed income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"HIT FROM ALL SIDES"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan executives have long been quick to point out the bank's profitability when investors bring up its troubles. The bank posted record profits last year, even as bad derivatives bets known as the "London whale" trades resulted in $6 billion of losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the third-quarter loss underscores how legal problems threaten the profitability of a bank that has long boasted of a "fortress" balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon "has become a little bit less critical, a little bit less vocal, a little bit more humble," said Shannon Stemm, a stock analyst at brokerage Edward Jones. "He used to run the bank that really stood out for weathering the crisis better than others."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's legal issues are legion. JPMorgan faces more than a dozen probes globally, including whether it fraudulently sold U.S. mortgage securities and whether it improperly fixed certain benchmark borrowing rates. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether the bank violated anti-bribery laws in hiring sons and daughters of executives of Chinese state-owned companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department is looking into whether bank employees obstructed justice in a power market manipulation probe by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that the bank settled in July for $410 million. JPMorgan neither admitted nor denied violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors in August brought criminal charges against two former JPMorgan traders, accusing the pair of deliberately understating losses in the "Whale" scandal. The SEC received an admission of wrongdoing from the bank in a parallel civil action, a rare step for the government agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, JPMorgan tried to reach a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and other federal and state agencies to resolve claims against the bank over its mortgage businesses. An $11 billion settlement was discussed, according to sources familiar with the matter. Dimon went to Washington to meet with U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on September 25, but no deal has resulted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of those claims relate to mortgage bank Washington Mutual and investment bank Bear Stearns, two failing firms that JPMorgan took over in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAYOUT SEEN SAFE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the clouds, the bank's shares are up 20 percent this year and its CEO still has many fans. JPMorgan shares closed down a penny at $52.51 on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While headlines today suggest the government is looking to slap some fines on them for business units that underwrote or securitized various products, JPMorgan is still in far better shape than any peers," said Tom Jalics, senior investment analyst at Key Private Bank. "It's not even close."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 57, became CEO on December 31, 2005, and added the post of chairman a year later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, said legal expenses would not affect stock repurchase plans and that the bank "has every intention to pay our dividends."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even beyond the litigation expenses, the third-quarter results were less than spectacular, with revenue declining 8 percent to $23.9 billion - about in line with forecasts - as fee income and lending income both fell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and other U.S. banks have struggled to boost profits as loan volume has declined, interest margins have been under pressure, and fee income from debit cards and mortgages has been squeezed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also on Friday, Wells Fargo &amp; Co, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, reported a 13 percent rise in third-quarter profit but saw a sharp drop in mortgage banking income as a boom in refinancings began to fade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mortgage banking income also declined at JPMorgan, with net revenue falling 45 percent to $2.02 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry in New York; additional reporting by Tanya Agrawal in Bangalore and Lauren Tara LaCapra in New York; Editing by John Wallace and Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co kept its commodity trading risk unchanged in the third quarter from the previous three months, as the bank prepares to exit physical commodities trading, results from the largest U.S. bank showed on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value-at-Risk (VaR) in commodities at JPMorgan stood at $13 million in the third quarter, flat with the second quarter and also unchanged from the third quarter of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is in the process of selling its physical commodity arm in the face of rising regulatory pressure. JPMorgan circulated the offering documents to potential buyers this week, valuing the assets at $3.3 billion, with annual income of $750 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its earnings release, the banks said physical commodities was one part of the bank that was either "non-core" to its customer or carried "outsized operational risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, typical of Wall Street banks, groups its commodities revenue under the fixed income category and does not break down the sector individually, often leaving VaR as one of its key risk-reward indicators for commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the third quarter, JPMorgan said fixed-income revenue fell to $3.4 billion, down by 8 percent from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank as a whole reported a $400 million loss for the third quarter, as the biggest U.S. bank by assets tried to put a number of costly legal settlements behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That included a $410 million settlement with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in July, over allegations of market manipulation in U.S. power markets. The settlement with FERC came shortly after the bank announced it was exiting physical commodities trading&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said it had about $23 billion in reserve for fighting and settling legal disputes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Sheppard and Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Gerald E.

his leadership was "very painful for me personally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan reported a loss of $380 million, or 17 cents per
share, for the third quarter. A year earlier it posted a profit
of $5.71 billion, or $1.40 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon earned widespread praise as a risk manager for
avoiding most of the mortgage-related losses that hobbled rivals
during the financial crisis. But he was less adept at
anticipating legal expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"His halo is a little off-kilter at this point," said Jordan
Posner, a senior portfolio manager at Matrix Asset Advisors of
New York, which owns over 600,000 JPMorgan shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third-quarter legal hit includes money set aside for
future settlements. Dimon cautioned that these expenses will
likely be elevated for the next year or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wish we could reduce the uncertainty for investors, but
we can't," he told reporters in a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, in a conference call with investors, he said it is
"very hard to fight with your regulators and the federal
government."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even putting litigation aside, revenue fell and other
results were lukewarm. Weak fixed-income markets squeezed
revenue at JPMorgan's investment bank, off 2 percent from a year
ago and down 17 percent from the second quarter, reflecting the
tough environment for bond-trading at all Wall Street banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equity markets revenue gained 20 percent. Rivals such as
Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley, both
due to report earnings next week, tend to be more heavily
weighted in fixed income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"HIT FROM ALL SIDES"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan executives have long been quick to point out the
bank's profitability when investors bring up its troubles. The
bank posted record profits last year, even as bad derivatives
bets known as the "London whale" trades resulted in $6 billion
of losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the third-quarter loss underscores how legal problems
threaten the profitability of a bank that has long boasted of a
"fortress" balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon "has become a little bit less critical, a little bit
less vocal, a little bit more humble," said Shannon Stemm, a
stock analyst at brokerage Edward Jones. "He used to run the
bank that really stood out for weathering the crisis better than
others."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's legal issues are legion. JPMorgan faces more than
a dozen probes globally, including whether it fraudulently sold
U.S. mortgage securities and whether it improperly fixed certain
benchmark borrowing rates. The Securities and Exchange
Commission is investigating whether the bank violated
anti-bribery laws in hiring sons and daughters of executives of
Chinese state-owned companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department is looking into whether bank
employees obstructed justice in a power market manipulation
probe by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that the bank
settled in July for $410 million. JPMorgan neither admitted nor
denied violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors in August brought criminal charges
against two former JPMorgan traders, accusing the pair of
deliberately understating losses in the "Whale" scandal. The SEC
received an admission of wrongdoing from the bank in a parallel
civil action, a rare step for the government agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, JPMorgan tried to reach a settlement with the
U.S. Department of Justice and other federal and state agencies
to resolve claims against the bank over its mortgage businesses.
An $11 billion settlement was discussed, according to sources
familiar with the matter. Dimon went to Washington to meet with
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Sept. 25, but no deal has
resulted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of those claims relate to mortgage bank Washington
Mutual and investment bank Bear Stearns, two failing firms that
JPMorgan took over in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAYOUT SEEN SAFE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the clouds, the bank's shares are up 20 percent this
year and its CEO still has many fans. JPMorgan shares closed
down a penny at $52.51 on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While headlines today suggest the government is looking to
slap some fines on them for business units that underwrote or
securitized various products, JPMorgan is still in far better
shape than any peers," said Tom Jalics, senior investment
analyst at Key Private Bank. "It's not even close."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 57, became CEO on Dec. 31, 2005, and added the post
of chairman a year later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, said
legal expenses would not affect stock repurchase plans and that
the bank "has every intention to pay our dividends."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even beyond the litigation expenses, the third-quarter
results were less than spectacular, with revenue declining 8
percent to $23.9 billion - about in line with forecasts - as fee
income and lending income both fell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and other U.S. banks have struggled to boost
profits as loan volume has declined, interest margins have been
under pressure, and fee income from debit cards and mortgages
has been squeezed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also on Friday, Wells Fargo &amp; Co, the largest U.S.
mortgage lender, reported a 13 percent rise in third-quarter
profit but saw a sharp drop in mortgage banking income as a boom
in refinancings began to fade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mortgage banking income also declined at JPMorgan, with net
revenue falling 45 percent to $2.02 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan is the first big bank to suffer a quarterly loss on account of multi-billion-dollar legal bills. It is also the most profitable bank in America (or was, up until this morning). Which means there are three possibilities here:&lt;/p&gt;

The profits and the fines share a common cause: the internal behavior which produces massive profits also  eventually  has a tendency to produce massive fines.
The profits and the fines are unrelated: its just unfortunate bad luck that such a well-run, profitable bank should come unstuck in this manner.
The profits in some way caused the fines: regulators feel comfortable going after JP Morgan precisely because it has a fortress balance sheet and can easily pay the fines.

&lt;p&gt;All three of these have a kernel of truth to them, I think. If you look at misbehavior like the Libor scandal or the London Whale debacle, the misconduct in question was clearly driven by traders looking to make as much money as possible. But all banks have traders looking to make as much money as possible, and most of the worlds biggest banks have been sucked in to the Libor scandal, in one way or another. And if you look at classic trading blowups, theyre pretty uncorrelated with profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan is also a little bit unlucky here, in that its literally paying the price for misconduct at companies (WaMu and Bear Stearns) it wasnt managing when the misconduct took place. Few of us are going to shed any tears as a result: those two acquisitions were still wildly profitable for JP Morgan even after accounting for all their associated legal liabilities. But it is a bit of a stretch to blame Jamie Dimon personally for actions which took place at rival banks, before he bought those banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But its the third possibility which is the most intriguing. JP Morgan is hardly alone in having engaged in the kind of behavior which has produced all these fines  but it is alone in building up a $23 billion reserve against future legal costs, and spending $9.2 billion on such things in a single quarter. Were Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns really worse than Countrywide and Merrill Lynch? If not, how come its JP Morgan with the legal losses, and not Bank of America as well?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One theme running through the aftermath of the financial crisis is that banks have to some extent been insulated from being held accountable for their actions by fears that aggressive prosecutions could endanger Americas fragile economic recovery. Were trying to recapitalize the banks, trying to get them to lend more; if we simply suck out all their capital in the form of fines, then that will only serve to weaken them. If thats a real fear, and I think it probably is, in corners of Washington, then it makes sense that JP Morgan would be the biggest target of prosecutorial zeal  just because its the bank with the strongest balance sheet, and therefore the bank which is most capable of paying big fines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of which in any way excuses JP Morgans actions, or implies that the fines its suffering are any less than fully deserved. It just implies that weaker banks might also deserve such massive fines as well  and are managing to avoid them only because they have less ability to pay them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Im fine with this possibility. When the Obama administration was forced to decide whether or not to nationalize Americas biggest banks, it knew that one of the consequences of its ultimate choice  not to nationalize  was that it would see less upside if and when its bailout worked. So in a weird way, JP Morgans current legal woes are a way of it paying the US government back for all the help we gave the bank during and after the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about it this way: lets say you went up to Jamie Dimon during the height of the crisis, and told him that the Fed would implement an all-out flood of liquidity, and the Bush and Obama administrations would stop at nothing in their attempts to rescue the financial system, on one condition. The bargain would be this: if all those efforts worked, and JP Morgan ended up as a bank making $6 billion per quarter in profits, then at that point it would have to fully atone, with a few quarters profits, for its own sins and those of the banks it wanted to acquire. JP Morgans solvency and capital adequacy would be guaranteed: it would only face the fines if it was more than capable of paying them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon would have jumped at such a bargain, and so would any other bank CEO. (Well, maybe not Dick Fuld.) As a result, JP Morgans fines are entirely fair. They are deserved on a narrow basis, and they are easily within the banks ability to repay. The only reason for Dimon to feel hard done by, here, is if he thinks that rival banks are getting off easier than he is, just because theyve got less money. That might be the case. But that doesnt mean hed be willing to trade places with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
NEW YORK, October 11 (Fitch) Following the announced $9.15
billion addition to 
litigation reserves in the quarter, Fitch Ratings has affirmed
JPMorgan Chase &amp; 
Co.'s (JPM) long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+' and
short-term IDR at 
'F1'. Fitch has also affirmed JPM's Viability Rating (VR) at
'a+', its Support 
Rating at '1', and its Support Rating Floor (SRF) at 'A'. The
Rating Outlook is 
Stable. A full list of ratings is provided at the end of this
release.
KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT
JPM's ratings affirmation reflects the strong underlying
earnings capacity of 
the bank, given its dominant domestic franchise and growing
international 
franchise, and progress made toward achieving compliance with
heightened capital 
and liquidity requirements. While the litigation charge is
significant, and 
beyond Fitch's expectations, the agency had considered possible
ranges of 
mortgage-related costs in its analysis, and recognizes that
growing legal costs 
are not unique to JPM. While the scope of current negotiations
is unclear, Fitch 
believes the bank is striving to put the bulk of
mortgage-related matters behind 
them. 
Legal costs are likely to remain elevated in coming quarters,
but Fitch expects 
the incremental impact to earnings will be manageable. Still,
the emergence of 
material and unexpected litigation losses could alter the
agency's view, 
particularly given where the firm's current capitalization
ratios compare to the 
broader peer group. 
Excluding the litigation charge, core operating performance was
relatively solid 
during the quarter, with the exception of mortgage banking,
which was hurt by 
rising interest rates and expected declines in origination
volume. Consumer 
asset quality trends continued on a positive trajectory, and JPM
recognized $1.6 
billion of reserve releases, largely in real estate and credit
card. 
Non-interest expenses improved modestly, with headcount
reductions and 
efficiency improvements. 
The corporate and investment bank's results reflected a
seasonally slower 
quarter, but results outperformed Fitch's expectations. Income
was up year over 
year due to stronger debt and equity underwriting fees and
strides made in 
improving the firm's market position in equities. Average
Value-at-Risk (VaR) 
was down meaningfully from the third quarter of 2012 (3Q'12), at
$45 million. 
Debt valuation adjustment (DVA) losses increased to $397 million
from losses of 
$211 million a year ago.  
Mortgage production had a relatively weak quarter given a
decline in origination 
volumes, while mortgage servicing posted a loss due to lower
servicing revenue 
and a negative MSR valuation adjustment. Still, progress has
been made in 
reducing core servicing expenses. Fitch expects mortgage revenue
will remain 
challenged in coming quarters, as new originations fail to
offset reductions in 
refinancing volume. Real estate portfolios had a solid quarter,
due largely to 
improvements in credit and a $1.25 billion reduction in
reserves.  
The commercial banking and asset management segments remained
very steady 
performers within JPM, with commercial loan growth of 9% and
asset under 
management growth of 12% year over year.  
The company reported a Basel III Tier I Common ratio of 9.3%,
which is slightly 
below the 9.5% requirement, inclusive of the globally
systemically important 
financial institution capital buffer. Additionally, JPM
disclosed a firm 
supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 4.7% and a bank SLR of
4.3%, which compare 
to requirements of 5.5% and 6%, respectively. Fitch considers
compliance with 
leverage ratios to be manageable, and will largely be achieved
through 
management actions. Furthermore, JPM disclosed that its
liquidity coverage ratio 
remains in excess of 100%, based on its interpretation of the
standard.  
The Stable Outlook reflects expectations for continued operating
consistency, 
although Fitch believes earnings could decline from current
levels as the 
interest rate environment remains challenging, regulatory costs
grow, and credit 
metrics, particularly in card and the commercial bank, normalize
from 
unsustainable lows. Still, offsets could be achieved from
improved performance 
in mortgage banking and stronger operating efficiencies.
RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT
Going forward, Fitch believes JPM is going to be challenged to
continue to 
deliver consistent earnings growth, particularly in light of the
current 
regulatory environment. Higher capital charges and what remains
difficult market 
conditions present a challenge for all GTUBs, which may be
encouraged to seek 
more aggressive ways to generate profits that take advantage of
regulatory 
loopholes. However, Fitch expects that JPM's strong global
franchise, liquidity 
risk management, and product diversity mitigate some of these
concerns.
Fitch considers JPM's ratings to be particularly sensitive to
the degree and 
scope of litigation risk going forward. Fitch recognizes that
the large 
litigation charge taken during the quarter reflects JPM's desire
to address 
outstanding legal issues. To the extent JPM enters into any
litigation 
settlements, Fitch will consider whether these effectively
diminish ongoing 
legal risks.
Negative rating actions could result from material asset quality
weakening which 
would pressure JPM's earnings and its ability to build capital,
deterioration in 
liquidity levels, material and unexpected litigation losses,
and/or failure to 
sufficiently address weaknesses noted in regulatory consent
orders and the CCAR 
submission process in a timely fashion. Further, significant
risk management or 
operational failures that result in material losses to the firm
could also 
result in a negative rating action.
Upward rating momentum for JPM is believed to be limited for the
foreseeable 
future given the risk and governance issues the firm is still
addressing. 
Further, its current rating level is among the highest of its
peer group and 
relative to the global bank universe. 
KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SRF
The affirmations of JPM's Support Rating and SRF are based on
Fitch's view that 
the probability of support from the U.S. authorities for JPM, if
required, 
remains extremely high in the near term due to the bank's
systemic importance. 
However, JPM's ratings do not currently receive any uplift from
support.  
RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SRF
The Support Rating and SRF are sensitive to a change in Fitch's
view of the 
ability or propensity of the U.S. sovereign to extend full
support to the bank's 
senior creditors. There is a clear political intention to
ultimately reduce the 
implicit state support for systemically important banks in
Europe and the U.S., 
as demonstrated by a series of policy and regulatory initiatives
aimed at 
curbing systemic risk posed by the banking industry. This might
result in Fitch 
revising SRFs downward in the medium term, although the timing
and degree of any 
change would depend on developments with respect to specific
jurisdictions. 
Until now, senior creditors in major global banks have been
supported in full, 
but resolution legislation is developing quickly and the
implementation of 
creditor 'bail-in' is starting to make it look more feasible for
taxpayers and 
creditors to share the burden of supporting large, complex
banks.
KEY RATING DRIVERS &amp; SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER
HYBRID 
SECURITIES
Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by JPM and by
various issuing 
vehicles are all notched down from JPM's or its bank
subsidiaries' VRs in 
accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's
respective 
nonperformance and relative Loss Severity risk profiles. Their
ratings are 
primarily sensitive to any change in the VRs of JPM or its bank
subsidiaries. 
KEY RATING DRIVERS &amp; SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY 
JPM's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating
companies and banks, 
reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is
mandated in the U.S. 
to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. It has
modest double 
leverage of 105.6% at year-end 2012.
KEY RATING DRIVERS &amp; SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED
COMPANY 
The IDRs and VRs of JPM's bank subsidiaries benefit from the
cross-guarantee 
mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA and therefore IDRs and VRs
are equalized 
across the group. JPMorgan Securities LLC (JPMS) is a wholly
owned subsidiary 
that is the firm's U.S. broker dealer and is considered core to
JPM's business. 
As a result, its IDR is equalized with that of its parent JPM.
Bear Stearns 
Companies, LLC and JPMorgan Clearing Corp. benefit from a parent
guarantee and 
therefore their IDRs are equalized with JPM's. Collateralized
Commercial Paper 
Co., LLC's short-term IDR benefits from JPMS's guarantee of the
amounts payable 
by the repo seller, JPMCC, and as result its short-term IDR is
equalized with 
that of JPMS. Collateralized Commercial Paper II Co., LLC's
short-term IDR is 
based on the repo seller, JPMS's short-term IDR. 
JPM is a leading global trading and universal bank with $2.5
trillion in total 
assets and $12.6 billion of net income for the nine months ended
Sept. 30, 2013.

			Fake arrival ceremonies are deceptive, not symbolic, says national 
      commander
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The American Legion is demanding immediate reform with the Joint POW/MIA 
      Accounting Command (JPAC) after NBC News reported that &#8220;arrival 
      ceremonies&#8221; honoring the recovery of POW/MIA servicemembers&#8217; remains 
      were staged.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPAC, a joint task force within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), 
      conducts recovery operations to identify all U.S. military personnel and 
      designated civilian personnel missing and unaccounted for from our 
      nation&#8217;s wars. According to NBC News, the Pentagon admitted that false 
      POW/MIA arrival ceremonies have occurred for seven years at the Joint 
      Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii where honor guards have carried 
      flag-draped coffins off military aircraft. The Pentagon defended the 
      staged arrival ceremonies in its statement to NBC News: &#8220;Part of the 
      ceremony involves symbolically transferring the recovered remains from 
      an aircraft to a vehicle for follow-on transportation to the lab. It is 
      important to note that recovered remains ceremoniously transferred from 
      the aircraft to the (bus) have been in the lab undergoing forensic 
      analysis to determine identity. When remains first arrive in Hawaii, 
      JPAC cannot confirm if the remains are those of an American 
      servicemember.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      NBC News also reported that the staged ceremonies are known by military 
      and civilian staff at Harbor-Hickam base as &#8220;The Big Lie.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For families awaiting the return of their missing loved ones, The 
      American Legion believes JPAC&#8217;s actions are deceptive and must change.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Symbolic honors are one thing, but deception is quite another,&#8221; 
      American Legion National Commander Daniel Dellinger said. &#8220;The so-called 
      &#8216;Big Lie&#8217; does not honor our war dead. Instead, it misleads and insults 
      the living. It is especially egregious during a most sensitive and 
      vulnerable time for families. Though I am certain these deceptions were 
      not meant to be cruel, this revelation shines a bad light on JPAC, whose 
      mission The American Legion strongly supports, and the Pentagon. 
      Honesty, from the beginning, would have served the Pentagon, JPAC and, 
      most importantly, the families of our fallen heroes much more honorably.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I sincerely believe, based on The American Legion&#8217;s experiences and 
      interactions, that the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command is, by and 
      large, dedicated to its mission and provides a valuable service to the 
      military family community. Professionalism, compassion, sympathy and 
      honesty need to be at the top of the list as JPAC reforms are considered 
      and made into policy. The mission of identifying and repatriating our 
      missing is a sacred obligation.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPAC was the subject of media reports last spring that characterized its 
      command as &#8220;dysfunctional,&#8221; a Government Accountability Office report 
      called the Pentagon&#8217;s efforts to recover servicemembers remains 
      &#8220;inefficient&#8221; and recommend an overhaul of JPAC.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Tuesday it is paying a well-known hacking expert more than $100,000 for finding security holes in its software, one of the largest such bounties awarded to date by a high-tech company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software maker also released a much anticipated update to Internet Explorer, which it said fixes a bug that made users of the world's most popular browser vulnerable to remote attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Forshaw, who heads vulnerability research at London-based security consulting firm Context Information Security, won Microsoft's first $100,000 bounty for identifying a new "exploitation technique" in Windows, which will allow it to develop defenses against an entire class of attacks, the software maker said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forshaw earned another $9,400 for identifying security bugs in a preview release of Microsoft's Internet Explorer 11 browser, Katie Moussouris, senior security strategist with Microsoft Security Response Center, said in a blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft unveiled the reward programs four months ago to bolster efforts to prevent sophisticated attackers from subverting new security technologies in its software, which runs on the vast majority of the world's personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forshaw has been credited with identifying several dozen software security bugs. He was awarded a large bounty from Hewlett-Packard Co for identifying a way to "pwn," or take ownership of, Oracle Corp's Java software in a high-profile contest known as Pwn2Own (pronounced "pown to own").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also released an automatic update to Internet Explorer on Tuesday afternoon to fix a security bug that it first disclosed last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers say hackers initially exploited that flaw to launch attacks on companies in Asia in an operation that the cybersecurity firm FireEye has dubbed DeputyDog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marc Maiffret, chief technology officer of the cybersecurity firm BeyondTrust, said the vulnerability was later more broadly used after Microsoft's disclosure of the issue brought it to the attention of cyber criminals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is advising computer users to immediately install the update to Internet Explorer, if they do not have their PCs already set to automatically download updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any time they patch something that has already been used (to launch attacks) in the wild, then it is critical to apply the patch," Maiffret said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That vulnerability in Internet Explorer was known as a "zero-day" because Microsoft, the targeted software maker, had zero days notice to fix the hole when the initial attacks exploiting the bug were discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an active, underground market for "zero day" vulnerabilities, criminal groups and governments sometimes pay $1 million or more to hackers who identify such bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

			Rockwell Collins, Elbit Systems of America Respond to F-35 JPO 
      Decision Regarding Helmet Mounted Display System
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rockwell Collins and Elbit Systems of America responded today to 
      Thursday&#8217;s announcement that the F-35 Joint Program Office will focus 
      exclusively on maturing their joint venture&#8217;s Helmet Mounted Display 
      System (HMDS).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This decision validates the significant achievement by the Rockwell 
      Collins Elbit Systems of America Vision Systems team in delivering next 
      generation technology that provides unprecedented situational awareness 
      capabilities in support of the F-35 program,&#8221; said Kelly Ortberg, Chief 
      Executive Officer and President, Rockwell Collins. &#8220;We&#8217;re looking 
      forward to the continued development and production of the third 
      generation F-35 HMDS, which will offer even greater capabilities while 
      reducing overall cost for this critical program.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We appreciate the confidence and support of the F-35 Joint Program 
      Office and Lockheed Martin leading to this decision,&#8221; said Bezhalel 
      (Butzi) Machlis, President and CEO of Elbit Systems. &#8220;The F-35 HMDS 
      leverages tremendous innovation, technology base and experience gained 
      by Elbit Systems and Rockwell Collins through nearly two decades of 
      collaborating in development, production and fielding of thousands of 
      advanced helmets for fighter aircraft. Elbit Systems is committed to the 
      success of the F-35 program, providing the warfighter with an effective 
      and affordable 5th generation fighter helmet mounted display solution.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Gen 3 helmet, which will include an improved night vision camera, 
      new liquid-crystal displays, automated alignment and software 
      improvements is to be introduced to the fleet in low rate initial 
      production Lot 7 in 2016. Rockwell Collins ESA Vision Systems LLC also 
      developed the Gen 2 helmet that F-35 pilots currently use, which will 
      meet the needs for the U.S. Marine Corps to declare Initial Operational 
      Capability in July 2015.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The F-35 HMDS provides pilots with unprecedented situational awareness. 
      All the information that pilots need to complete their missions &#8211; 
      through all weather, day or night &#8211; is projected on the helmet&#8217;s visor. 
      Additionally, the F-35&#8217;s Distributed Aperture System (DAS) streams 
      real-time imagery from six infrared cameras mounted around the aircraft 
      to the helmet, allowing pilots to &#8220;look through&#8221; the airframe.

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects analysts' average forecast in 5th paragraph to $1.17
per share from $1.20; the error first appeared in UPDATE 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By David Henry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oct 11 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co on Friday
posted its first quarterly loss under Chairman and CEO Jamie
Dimon after a tangle of legal and regulatory probes cost the
biggest U.S. bank $7.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon managed to avoid posting losses during the financial
crisis as the bank shied away from the worst subprime mortgage
assets. But now legal woes, at least some tied to banks that
JPMorgan bought during the crisis, are taking a toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan posted a loss of $380 million, or 17 cents per
share, for the third quarter, its first loss since the second
quarter of 2004. A year earlier it reported a profit of $5.71
billion, or $1.40 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding litigation expenses and other special items, the
company posted a profit of $5.82 billion, or $1.42 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average had forecast earnings of $1.17 per share
 excluding special items, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
It was not immediately clear if the results were comparable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legal expenses - $9.2 billion, or $7.2 billion after
taxes - include money it is setting aside for future
settlements. The bank disclosed exactly how much it has set
aside for settlements, fines and other legal expenses: $23
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we expect our litigation costs should abate and
normalize over time, they may continue to be volatile over the
next several quarters," Dimon said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan faces a welter of regulatory issues, including a
Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into possible
bribery in the hiring of sons and daughters of executives of
Chinese state-owned companies, possibly fraudulent sales of
mortgage securities, and its role in setting certain benchmark
borrowing rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has been focusing on its mortgage issues recently.
In September, it tried to reach a settlement with the U.S.
Department of Justice and other federal and state agencies in
which it could have paid as much as $11 billion to resolve
claims against the bank over its mortgage businesses. Dimon went
to Washington to meet with U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on
Sept. 25 as part of the talks, but no deal has resulted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of those claims relate to mortgage bank Washington
Mutual and investment bank Bear Stearns, two failing companies
that JPMorgan took over in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators pressed JPMorgan to acquire both companies, a
fact that Dimon alluded to in a statement on Friday, noting that
the bank was seeking a fair settlement with the government on
mortgage related issues, "and one that recognizes the
extraordinary circumstances of the Bear Stearns and Washington
Mutual transactions, which were undertaken at the request or
encouragement of the U.S. Government."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking on CNBC earlier this month, former Treasury
Secretary Hank Paulson said that JPMorgan was "begged" to take
Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns, but added that JPMorgan took
on potential legal liabilities as part of the deal. "Jamie knew
that at the time," Paulson said.

			Internet of Things Gets Major Distance Boost from IBM and Semtech
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wireless sensor technology with a range of 15 km (9 miles) demonstrated 
      at European Utility Week in Amsterdam
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Semtech Corporation (Nasdaq: SMTC), a leading 
      supplier of analog and mixed-signal semiconductors, today announced a 
      significant advancement in wireless technology, combining IBM software 
      and Semtech hardware to create a system capable of transmitting data up 
      to a distance of 15 km (9 miles), depending on the environment, with 
      significantly improved ease-of-use.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The joint solution, comprised of IBM&#8217;s Mote Runner software and 
      Semtech&#8217;s SX127x with LoRa&#8482;, will be demonstrated at European Utility 
      Week in Amsterdam October 15-17 in the Semtech/Future Electronics booth, 
      Hall 5 Booth F47.

			Fast Growth Projected for Internet of ThingsOver the next 
      15 years, the number of machines and sensors connected to the Internet 
      will explode creating what is called the Internet of Things. According 
      to IMS Research, there will be more than 22 billion web-connected 
      devices by 2020[i]. These new devices will generate more than 2.5 
      quintillion bytes of new data every day[ii], while every hour enough 
      information is transported on the Internet to fill seven million 
      DVDs.[iii]
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To make wireless sensor networks (WSN) easier to program and use, IBM 
      has developed a software development kit &#8212; called Mote Runner &#8212; which 
      provides an open and programmer-friendly platform to connect sensor and 
      actuator motes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This platform is now available on the Semtech SX1272 RFIC to create a 
      system capable of covering a range of 15 km (nine miles) in a semi-rural 
      environment and up to five km (three miles) in dense urban environments. 
      For comparison, the maximum distance today of a smart-meter transceiver 
      in Europe, utilizing FSK modulation, is between one and two kilometers 
      (1.2 miles).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The biggest request we hear from our clients is longer battery life, 
      low cost, ease of use and longer distances. With IBM, we now have an 
      answer to all of these questions,&#8221; said Hardy Schmidbauer, Wireless 
      Products Director at Semtech. &#8220;The new IBM Mote Runner-Semtech system is 
      available starting today.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new sensors will utilize a star network architecture with each 
      gateway capable of handling millions of transactions per day making it 
      an ideal system to easily deploy any number of applications from smart 
      metering to remotely monitoring train tracks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;To realize our vision of a Smarter Planet, we must improve the 
      usability of instrumented sensors and devices to securely and 
      efficiently manage large volumes of data,&#8221; said Thorsten Kramp, 
      researcher, IBM Research - Zurich. &#8220;Together with hardware utilizing 
      Semtech's new long range technology, IBM Mote Runner now also serves 
      markets that inherently require adaptive long-range communication.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			How does it work?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The IBM and Semtech sensor platform utilizes Semtech's new LoRa (long 
      range) modulation technology to enable drastic range improvements over 
      alternative modulation methods.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The additional range provided by LoRa, of up to 15 km, will eliminate 
      the need for repeaters in these applications, significantly simplifying 
      the system design and lowering the total cost of deployment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Semtech SX127x IC for the end nodes and the SX130x for the gateway 
      are extremely low power, making the system ideal for battery operated 
      devices. The adaptive link rate capabilities maximize battery lifetime, 
      improve capacity of the network and improve scalability. The LoRa 
      modulation also provides significant improvement interference robustness 
      compared to traditional modulation techniques.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM Mote Runner is an easy to use, infrastructure platform for WSNs. The 
      software is based on a highly-optimized virtual machine tailored from

&lt;p&gt;Oct 11 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co kept its
commodity trading risk unchanged in the third quarter from the
previous three months, as the bank prepares to exit physical
commodities trading, results from the largest U.S. bank showed
on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value-at-Risk (VaR) in commodities at JPMorgan stood at $13
million in the third quarter, flat with the second quarter and
also unchanged from the third quarter of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is in the process of selling its physical commodity
arm in the face of rising regulatory pressure. JPMorgan
circulated the offering documents to potential buyers this week,
valuing the assets at $3.3 billion, with annual income of $750
million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its earnings release, the banks said physical commodities
was one part of the bank that was either "non-core" to its
customer or carried "outsized operational risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, typical of Wall Street banks, groups its
commodities revenue under the fixed income category and does not
break down the sector individually, often leaving VaR as one of
its key risk-reward indicators for commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the third quarter, JPMorgan said fixed-income revenue
fell to $3.4 billion, down by 8 percent from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank as a whole reported a $400 million loss for the
third quarter, as the biggest U.S. bank by assets tried to put a
number of costly legal settlements behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That included a $410 million settlement with the U.S.
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in July, over allegations
of market manipulation in U.S. power markets. The settlement
with FERC came shortly after the bank announced it was exiting
physical commodities trading&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said it had about $23 billion in reserve for
fighting and settling legal disputes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 11 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co reported a
loss in the third quarter as the biggest U.S. bank by assets
recorded additional expenses for lawsuits and government
investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank posted a loss of $380 million, or 17 cents per
share, compared with net income of $5.71 billion, or $1.40 per

      JPMorgan&#160;Chase  Co. (NYSE: JPM) today reported net loss of $0.4&#160;billion 
      for the third quarter of 2013, compared with net income of $5.7 billion 
      in the third quarter of 2012. Earnings per share were $(0.17), compared 
      with $1.40 in the third quarter of 2012. Revenue1 for the 
      quarter was $23.9 billion, compared with $25.9 billion in the prior 
      year. The Firm's return on tangible common equity1 for the 
      third quarter of 2013 was (2)%, compared with 16% in the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Third-quarter results included legal expense in Corporate of $9.2 
      billion ($7.2 billion after-tax), and a benefit from reserve releases of 
      $1.6 billion ($992 million after-tax). Excluding these items, 
      third-quarter net income would have been $5.8 billion, or $1.42 per share1.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the 
      Company&#8217;s results: &#8220;While we had strong underlying performance across 
      the businesses, unfortunately, the quarter was marred by large legal 
      expense. We continuously evaluate our legal reserves, but in this highly 
      charged and unpredictable environment, with escalating demands and 
      penalties from multiple government agencies, we thought it was prudent 
      to significantly strengthen them. While we expect our litigation costs 
      should abate and normalize over time, they may continue to be volatile 
      over the next several quarters.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dimon continued: &#8220;The Board continues to seek a fair and reasonable 
      settlement with the government on mortgage-related issues &#8211; and one that 
      recognizes the extraordinary circumstances of the Bear Stearns and 
      Washington Mutual transactions, which were undertaken at the request or 
      encouragement of the U.S. Government.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the business performance, Dimon continued: &#8220;We maintained 
      our #1 ranking in Global Investment Banking fees and our unparalleled 
      capital raising and advisory capabilities led to ground-breaking 
      transactions and market share gains. Equity Markets revenue was up 20%, 
      driven by broad-based strength across products. In Consumer Banking and 
      Credit Card, our customer satisfaction scores continue to rise and our 
      customer attrition remains low. For the second consecutive year, we led 
      the nation in deposit growth &#8211; up 10% from the prior year &#8211; more than 
      twice the industry average. Credit card sales volume was a record $107.0 
      billion, up 11%, and general purpose credit card sales volume growth has 
      outperformed the industry for 22 consecutive quarters. Asset Management 
      continued to have strong performance, with $19 billion of net long-term 
      client flows, the 18th consecutive quarter of positive net long-term 
      client flows. We are seeing continued positive trends in consumer and 
      stability in wholesale &#8211; loss rates in mortgage are improving steadily 
      as delinquencies continue to decline, and credit card delinquencies are 
      at 20-year lows across the industry.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dimon concluded: &#8220;We continue our intense focus on our legal, control, 
      and regulatory agenda &#8211; we are simplifying our business and making 
      unprecedented investments in controls, which will make our company 
      better and stronger for the long-run. We are extremely gratified that, 
      in light of the issues the Company is facing, our people continue to do 
      an unwavering and excellent job in serving their clients and 
      communities, which you see in the underlying performance of our 
      businesses.&#8221;

			Discussion of Results:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was $2.7 billion, an increase of $347 million, or 15% 
      compared with the prior year, due to lower provision for credit losses 
      and noninterest expense, predominantly offset by lower net revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $11.1 billion, a decrease of $1.6 billion, or 13%, 
      compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $7.1 billion, down 
      $174 million, or 2%, driven by lower deposit margins, spread compression 
      in Credit Card and Auto and lower loan balances due to portfolio runoff, 
      largely offset by higher deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was 
      $4.0&#160;billion, a decrease of $1.5&#160;billion, or 27%, driven by lower 
      mortgage fees and related income.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $267&#160;million, compared 
      with a provision for credit losses of $1.9&#160;billion in the prior year and 
      a benefit of $19&#160;million in the prior quarter.&#160;The current-quarter 
      provision reflected a $1.6 billion reduction in the allowance for loan 
      losses and total net charge-offs of $1.3 billion. The prior-quarter 
      provision reflected a $1.5&#160;billion reduction in the allowance for loan 
      losses and total net charge-offs of $1.5 billion. The prior-year 
      provision reflected a $955&#160;million reduction in the allowance for loan 
      losses and total net charge-offs of $2.8 billion. Prior-year total net 
      charge-offs included $880 million of incremental charge-offs reported in 
      accordance with regulatory guidance on certain loans discharged under 
      Chapter 7 bankruptcy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $6.9&#160;billion, a decrease of $89&#160;million, or 1%, 
      from the prior year, driven by lower mortgage servicing expense, 
      partially offset by continued investments in Chase Private Client 
      expansion, and costs related to the control agenda.

			Consumer  Business Banking net income was $762 million, a 
      decrease of $16 million, or 2%, compared with the prior year, due to 
      higher noninterest expense, predominantly offset by higher net revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			Mortgage Banking net income was $705 million, an increase of $82 
      million, or 13%, compared with the prior year, driven by lower provision 
      for credit losses and noninterest expense, predominantly offset by lower 
      net revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $2.0 billion, a decrease of $1.7 billion compared with 
      the prior year. Net interest income was $1.1 billion, a decrease of $44 
      million, or 4%, driven by lower loan balances due to portfolio runoff. 
      Noninterest revenue was $877 million, a decrease of $1.6&#160;billion, driven 
      by lower mortgage fees and related income.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $1.0 billion2, 
      compared with a provision for credit losses of $524&#160;million in the prior 
      year. The current quarter reflected a $1.25 billion reduction in the 
      allowance for loan losses due to lower estimated losses reflecting 
      continued home price improvement and favorable delinquency trends. The 
      prior year included a $900 million reduction in the allowance for loan 
      losses. Net charge-offs were $206 million, compared with $1.4 billion in 
      the prior year. Prior-year total net charge-offs included $825 million 
      of incremental charge-offs reported in accordance with regulatory 
      guidance on certain loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $1.9 billion, a decrease of $223 million, or 
      11%, from the prior year, due to lower servicing expense.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Mortgage Production pretax income was $90&#160;million, a 
      decrease of $997 million from the prior year, reflecting lower volumes 
      and lower margins, partially offset by lower repurchase losses. Mortgage 
      production-related revenue, excluding repurchase losses, was $584 
      million, a decrease of $1.2&#160;billion, or 67%, from the prior year, 
      reflecting lower volumes from rising rates and lower revenue margins. 
      Production expense2 was $669 million, a decrease of 
      $9&#160;million from the prior year. Repurchase losses for the current 
      quarter reflected a benefit of $175 million, compared with losses of $13 
      million in the prior year and a benefit of $16 million in the prior 
      quarter. The current quarter reflected a $300 million reduction in 
      repurchase liability and lower realized repurchase losses, compared with 
      a $218 million reduction in repurchase liability in the prior year and a 
      $185 million reduction in repurchase liability in the prior quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Mortgage Servicing pretax loss was $406 million, a 
      decrease of $247 million from the prior year. Mortgage net 
      servicing-related revenue was $632 million, a decrease of $122 million, 
      or 16%, from the prior year, driven by lower revenue from an exited 
      non-core product and lower gains on Government National Mortgage 
      Association (&#8220;Ginnie Mae&#8221;) buy outs. MSR risk management was a loss of 
      $180 million, compared with income of $150 million in the prior year. 
      Servicing expense was $858 million, a decrease of $205 million from the 
      prior year, reflecting lower costs associated with the Independent 
      Foreclosure Review and lower servicing headcount, partially offset by 
      higher expense for foreclosure-related matters. The current quarter 
      included approximately $200 million of expense related to refined 
      estimates of servicing liabilities resulting from foreclosure delays.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Real Estate Portfolios pretax income was $1.5 billion, up 
      $1.4&#160;billion from the prior year. Net revenue was $809 million, a 
      decrease of $197&#160;million, or 20%, from the prior year. The decrease was 
      due to higher loan retention driving lower noninterest revenue and a 
      decline in net interest income, resulting from lower loan balances due 
      to portfolio runoff.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $1.0 billion, compared 
      with a provision for credit losses of $520&#160;million in the prior year. 
      The current-quarter provision reflected a $1.25 billion reduction in the 
      allowance for loan losses, $750 million from the purchased 
      credit-impaired allowance and $500 million from the non credit-impaired 
      allowance, due to lower estimated losses reflecting continued home price 
      improvement and favorable delinquency trends. The prior year provision 
      included a $900 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses. Net 
      charge-offs were $204&#160;million, compared with $1.4 billion in the prior 
      year. Prior-year total net charge-offs included $825 million of 
      incremental charge-offs reported in accordance with regulatory guidance 
      on certain loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Home equity net 
      charge-offs were $218&#160;million (1.42% net charge-off rate1), 
      compared with $1.1 billion (6.22% net charge-off rate1) in 
      the prior year. Subprime mortgage net recoveries were $4&#160;million (0.21% 
      net recovery rate1), compared with net charge-offs of 
      $152&#160;million (6.89% net charge-off rate1). Prime 
      mortgage, including option ARMs, net recoveries were $11&#160;million (0.09%

      Credit Card and Auto. Noninterest revenue was $1.3&#160;billion, up $58 
      million compared with the prior year, primarily driven by higher net 
      interchange income, auto lease income and merchant servicing revenue,

      $1.2&#160;billion in the prior year and $564&#160;million in the prior quarter. 
      The current-quarter provision reflected lower net charge-offs and a 
      $351&#160;million reduction in the allowance for loan losses due to lower 
      estimated losses reflecting improved delinquency trends and restructured 
      loan performance. The prior-year provision included a $55 million

			Discussion of Results:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was $2.2&#160;billion, up 12% compared with the prior year. These 
      results primarily reflected lower noninterest expense and a higher 
      benefit from the provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower 
      net revenue. Net revenue was $8.2&#160;billion, compared with $8.4&#160;billion in 
      the prior year. Net revenue included a $397 million loss from debit 
      valuation adjustments (&#8220;DVA&#8221;) on structured notes and derivative 
      liabilities; the prior year included a loss from DVA of $211 million. 
      Excluding the impact of DVA, net income was $2.5 billion1, up 
      17% from the prior year, and net revenue was $8.6 billion1, 
      flat compared with the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Banking revenue was $2.9 billion, up 2% from the prior year. Investment 
      banking fees were $1.5 billion, up 6% from the prior year, driven by 
      higher equity underwriting fees of $333 million, up 42% from the prior 
      year, and higher debt underwriting fees of $855 million, up 6% from the 
      prior year, partially offset by lower advisory fees of $322&#160;million, 
      down 17% from the prior year. Treasury Services revenue was $1.1 
      billion, flat compared with the prior year. Lending revenue was 
      $351&#160;million, primarily reflecting net interest income on retained loans 
      and fees on lending-related commitments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Markets  Investor Services revenue was $5.3 billion, down 4% from the 
      prior year. Fixed Income Markets revenue was $3.4 billion, down 8% 
      compared with a strong prior year. The prior year included a modest loss 
      from the synthetic credit portfolio. Equity Markets revenue was $1.2 
      billion, up 20% from the prior year, driven by broad-based strength 
      across products and regions. Securities Services revenue was $1.0 
      billion, up 3% from the prior year. Credit Adjustments  Other revenue 
      was a loss of $409&#160;million, compared with a loss of $225 million in the 
      prior year; both periods were predominantly driven by the impact of DVA.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $218 million, compared 
      with a benefit of $60 million in the prior year. The ratio of the 
      allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained was 1.09%, 
      compared with 1.35% in the prior year. Excluding the impact of the 
      consolidation of Firm-administered multi-seller conduits and trade 
      finance loans, the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to period-end 
      loans retained1 was 2.01%, compared with 2.92% in the prior 
      year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $5.0 billion, down 7% from the prior year, 
      primarily driven by lower compensation expense on lower reported 
      revenue. The compensation ratio
			for the current quarter was 
      27%, excluding the impact of DVA1.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Net income was $665 million, a decrease of $25 million, or 4%, compared 
      with the prior year, reflecting an increase in noninterest expense and a 
      decrease in net revenue, partially offset by a lower provision for 
      credit losses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $1.7&#160;billion, flat compared with the prior year. Net 
      interest income was $1.1&#160;billion, flat compared with the prior year, 
      reflecting spread compression on loan and liability products and lower 
      purchase discounts recognized on loan repayments, predominantly offset 
      by higher loan balances. Noninterest revenue was $588&#160;million, flat 
      compared with the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Revenue from Middle Market Banking was $745 million, flat compared with 
      the prior year. Revenue from Corporate Client Banking was $459&#160;million, 
      flat compared with the prior year. Revenue from Commercial Term Lending 
      was $311&#160;million, an increase of $13 million, or 4%, compared with the 
      prior year. Revenue from Real Estate Banking was $118&#160;million, an 
      increase of $12 million, or 11%, compared with the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $41 million, compared 
      with a benefit of $16 million in the prior year. Net charge-offs were 
      $16 million (0.05% net charge-off rate), compared with net recoveries of 
      $18&#160;million (0.06% net recovery rate) in the prior year and net 
      charge-offs of $9&#160;million (0.03% net charge-off rate) in the prior 
      quarter. The allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained was 
      1.99%, down from 2.15% in the prior year and down from 2.06% in the 
      prior quarter. Nonaccrual loans were $566&#160;million, down $310&#160;million, or 
      35%, from the prior year, and up by $53 million, or 10%, from the prior 
      quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $661 million, up 10% compared with the prior 
      year, reflecting higher product- and headcount-related2 
      expense.

      $578&#160;million, up $26&#160;million, or 5%, from the prior year, due to higher 
      loan and deposit balances, partially offset by narrower loan and deposit 
      spreads.

      Revenue from Private Banking was $1.5 billion, up 9% compared with the

      Client assets were $2.2 trillion, an increase of $215&#160;billion, or 11%, 
      compared with the prior year. Assets under management were $1.5 
      trillion, an increase of $159 billion, or 12%, from the prior year, due 
      to net inflows to long-term products and the effect of higher market 
      levels. Custody, brokerage, administration and deposit balances were 
      $706&#160;billion, up $56&#160;billion, or 9%, from the prior year, due to the 
      effect of higher market levels and custody inflows.

      Noninterest expense was $2.0 billion, an increase of $272 million, or 
      16%, from the prior year, primarily due to higher headcount-related2 
      expense, higher performance-based compensation and costs related to the 
      control agenda.

      Net income was a loss of $6.5 billion, compared with net income of $228 
      million in the prior year.

      Private Equity reported net income of $242 million, compared with a net 
      loss of $89 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $398 million, 
      compared with a loss of $135 million in the prior year, primarily due to 
      net valuation gains on private investments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Treasury and CIO reported a net loss of $193 million, compared with net 
      income of $369 million in the prior year. Net revenue was a loss of $232 
      million, compared with net revenue of $713 million in the prior year. 
      The prior-year revenue reflected $888 million extinguishment gains 
      related to the redemption of trust preferred securities. Current-quarter 
      net interest income was a loss of $261 million due to low interest rates 
      and limited reinvestment opportunities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Other Corporate reported a net loss of $6.5 billion, compared with a net 
      loss of $52 million in the prior year. The current quarter included 
      approximately $9.2 billion of legal expense, including reserves for 
      litigation and regulatory proceedings, compared with $684 million of 
      expense for additional litigation reserves in the prior year.

            Presented on a managed basis. See notes on page 13 for further 
            explanation of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis 
            totaled $23,117 million, $25,211 million, and $25,146 million for 
            the third quarter of 2013, second quarter of 2013, and third 
            quarter of 2012, respectively.

			Discussion of Results:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was a loss of approximately $0.4 billion, down $6.1 billion 
      from the prior year, due to higher noninterest expense and lower net 
      revenue, partially offset by lower provision for credit losses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $23.9 billion, down $2.0 billion, or 8%, compared with 
      the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $12.9 billion, down $1.8 
      billion, or 12%, compared with the prior year. The current-quarter 
      revenue included a $397 million loss from DVA on certain structured 
      notes and derivative liabilities. Net interest income was $11.0 billion, 
      down $220 million, or 2%, compared with the prior year, reflecting the 
      impact of lower loan yields due to competitive pressures and replacement 
      of higher yielding loans with lower yielding loans, partially offset by 
      higher investment securities yield and lower net interest expense on 
      long-term debt.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $543 million, compared 
      with a provision for credit losses of $1.8 billion in the prior year. 
      The total consumer provision for credit losses was a benefit of $273 
      million, compared with an expense of $1.9 billion in the prior year. The 
      current-quarter provision reflected a $1.6 billion reduction in the 
      allowance for loan losses due to favorable delinquency trends and lower 
      estimated losses in the mortgage and credit card portfolios. Consumer 
      net charge-offs were $1.3 billion, compared with $2.8 billion in the 
      prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 1.47% and 3.10%, 
      respectively. The prior-year total net charge-offs included $880 million 
      of incremental charge-offs reported in accordance with regulatory 
      guidance on certain loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The 
      wholesale provision for credit losses was a benefit of $270 million, 
      compared with a benefit of $63 million in the prior year. Wholesale net 
      charge-offs were $26 million, compared with net recoveries of $34 
      million in the prior year, resulting in a net charge-off rate of 0.03% 
      and a net recovery rate of 0.05%, respectively. The Firm&#8217;s allowance for 
      loan losses to period-end loans retained1 was 1.89%, compared 
      with 2.61% in the prior year. The Firm&#8217;s nonperforming assets totaled 
      $10.2 billion, down from the prior-quarter and prior-year levels of 
      $10.9 billion and $12.5 billion, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $23.6 billion, up $8.3 billion, or 54%, compared 
      with the prior year, driven by higher litigation reserves. The current 
      quarter included approximately $9.3 billion of legal expense, including 
      reserves for litigation and regulatory proceedings, compared with $790 
      million of expense for additional litigation reserves in the prior year.

            The Firm presents net income and earnings per share excluding the 
            aftertax impact of reductions in the allowance for loan losses and 
            litigation expense in Corporate. These measures should be viewed 
            in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Firm&#8217;s reported 
            results. Management believes this information helps investors 
            understand the effect of these items on reported results and 
            provides an alternate presentation of the Firm's performance. The 
            table below provides a reconciliation of reported results to these

            In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, 
            management reviews the Firm's results and the results of the lines 
            of business on a &#8220;managed&#8221; basis, which is a non-GAAP financial 
            measure. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts with the 
            reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications 
            to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the 
            business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (&#8220;FTE&#8221;) basis. 
            Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and 
            tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a 
            basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This 
            non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the 
            comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt 
            sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt 
            items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments 
            have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or 
            by the lines of business.

            The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans 
            excludes the following: loans accounted for at fair value and 
            loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired (&#8220;PCI&#8221;) loans; and 
            the allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans. Additionally, 
            Real Estate Portfolios net charge-off rates exclude the impact of 
            PCI loans. The allowance for loan losses related to the PCI 
            portfolio totaled $5.0 billion at September 30, 2013, and $5.7 
            billion at each of June 30, 2013, and September 30, 2012. In 
            Corporate  Investment Bank, the ratio of the allowance for loan 
            losses to end-of-period loans is calculated excluding the impact 
            of trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered 
            multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to 
            provide a more meaningful assessment of the CIB's allowance

            Tangible common equity (&#8220;TCE&#8221;) represents the Firm&#8217;s common

            The Tier 1 common ratio under both Basel I and Basel III are both 
            non-GAAP financial measures. These measures, along with other 
            capital measures, are used by management, bank regulators, 
            investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Firm's capital 
            position and to compare the Firm's capital to that of other 
            financial services companies. The Basel I Tier 1 common ratio is 
            Tier 1 common capital divided by Basel I risk-weighted assets. 
            Tier 1 common capital is defined as Tier 1 capital less elements 
            of Tier 1 capital not in the form of common equity, such as 
            perpetual preferred stock, noncontrolling interests in 
            subsidiaries, and trust preferred securities. In July 2013, U.S. 
            federal banking agencies approved a final rule for implementing 
            Basel III in the U. S. For further information on Basel I and

          Asset Management pretax margin represents income before income tax

          a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring

          Basel 2.5 rules became effective for the Firm on January 1, 2013. 
          The implementation of these rules in the first quarter of 2013 
          resulted in an increase of approximately $150 billion in 
          risk-weighted assets compared with the Basel I rules. The 
          implementation of these rules also resulted in decreases of the 
          Firm&#8217;s Tier 1 capital, Total capital and Tier 1 common capital 
          ratios by 140 basis points, 160 basis points and 120 basis points, 
          respectively, at March 31, 2013. For further discussion of Basel 
          2.5, see Regulatory capital on pages 60-63 of JPMorgan Chase's 2Q13

      JPMorgan&#160;Chase  Co. (NYSE: JPM) today reported net loss of $0.4&#160;billion 
      for the third quarter of 2013, compared with net income of $5.7 billion 
      in the third quarter of 2012. Earnings per share were $(0.17), compared 
      with $1.40 in the third quarter of 2012. Revenue1 for the 
      quarter was $23.9 billion, compared with $25.9 billion in the prior 
      year. The Firm's return on tangible common equity1 for the 
      third quarter of 2013 was (2)%, compared with 16% in the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Third-quarter results included legal expense in Corporate of $9.2 
      billion ($7.2 billion after-tax), and a benefit from reserve releases of 
      $1.6 billion ($992 million after-tax). Excluding these items, 
      third-quarter net income would have been $5.8 billion, or $1.42 per share1.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the 
      Company&#8217;s results: &#8220;While we had strong underlying performance across 
      the businesses, unfortunately, the quarter was marred by large legal 
      expense. We continuously evaluate our legal reserves, but in this highly 
      charged and unpredictable environment, with escalating demands and 
      penalties from multiple government agencies, we thought it was prudent 
      to significantly strengthen them. While we expect our litigation costs 
      should abate and normalize over time, they may continue to be volatile 
      over the next several quarters.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dimon continued: &#8220;The Board continues to seek a fair and reasonable 
      settlement with the government on mortgage-related issues &#8211; and one that 
      recognizes the extraordinary circumstances of the Bear Stearns and 
      Washington Mutual transactions, which were undertaken at the request or 
      encouragement of the U.S. Government.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the business performance, Dimon continued: &#8220;We maintained 
      our #1 ranking in Global Investment Banking fees and our unparalleled 
      capital raising and advisory capabilities led to ground-breaking 
      transactions and market share gains. Equity Markets revenue was up 20%, 
      driven by broad-based strength across products. In Consumer Banking and 
      Credit Card, our customer satisfaction scores continue to rise and our 
      customer attrition remains low. For the second consecutive year, we led 
      the nation in deposit growth &#8211; up 10% from the prior year &#8211; more than 
      twice the industry average. Credit card sales volume was a record $107.0 
      billion, up 11%, and general purpose credit card sales volume growth has 
      outperformed the industry for 22 consecutive quarters. Asset Management 
      continued to have strong performance, with $19 billion of net long-term 
      client flows, the 18th consecutive quarter of positive net long-term 
      client flows. We are seeing continued positive trends in consumer and 
      stability in wholesale &#8211; loss rates in mortgage are improving steadily 
      as delinquencies continue to decline, and credit card delinquencies are 
      at 20-year lows across the industry.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dimon concluded: &#8220;We continue our intense focus on our legal, control, 
      and regulatory agenda &#8211; we are simplifying our business and making 
      unprecedented investments in controls, which will make our company 
      better and stronger for the long-run. We are extremely gratified that, 
      in light of the issues the Company is facing, our people continue to do 
      an unwavering and excellent job in serving their clients and 
      communities, which you see in the underlying performance of our 
      businesses.&#8221;

      Net income was $2.7 billion, an increase of $347 million, or 15% 
      compared with the prior year, due to lower provision for credit losses 
      and noninterest expense, predominantly offset by lower net revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $11.1 billion, a decrease of $1.6 billion, or 13%, 
      compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $7.1 billion, down 
      $174 million, or 2%, driven by lower deposit margins, spread compression 
      in Credit Card and Auto and lower loan balances due to portfolio runoff, 
      largely offset by higher deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was 
      $4.0&#160;billion, a decrease of $1.5&#160;billion, or 27%, driven by lower 
      mortgage fees and related income.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $267&#160;million, compared 
      with a provision for credit losses of $1.9&#160;billion in the prior year and 
      a benefit of $19&#160;million in the prior quarter.&#160;The current-quarter 
      provision reflected a $1.6 billion reduction in the allowance for loan 
      losses and total net charge-offs of $1.3 billion. The prior-quarter 
      provision reflected a $1.5&#160;billion reduction in the allowance for loan 
      losses and total net charge-offs of $1.5 billion. The prior-year 
      provision reflected a $955&#160;million reduction in the allowance for loan 
      losses and total net charge-offs of $2.8 billion. Prior-year total net 
      charge-offs included $880 million of incremental charge-offs reported in 
      accordance with regulatory guidance on certain loans discharged under 
      Chapter 7 bankruptcy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $6.9&#160;billion, a decrease of $89&#160;million, or 1%, 
      from the prior year, driven by lower mortgage servicing expense, 
      partially offset by continued investments in Chase Private Client 
      expansion, and costs related to the control agenda.

			Mortgage Banking net income was $705 million, an increase of $82 
      million, or 13%, compared with the prior year, driven by lower provision 
      for credit losses and noninterest expense, predominantly offset by lower 
      net revenue.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $2.0 billion, a decrease of $1.7 billion compared with 
      the prior year. Net interest income was $1.1 billion, a decrease of $44 
      million, or 4%, driven by lower loan balances due to portfolio runoff.

      by lower mortgage fees and related income.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $1.0 billion2, 
      compared with a provision for credit losses of $524&#160;million in the prior 
      year. The current quarter reflected a $1.25 billion reduction in the 
      allowance for loan losses due to lower estimated losses reflecting 
      continued home price improvement and favorable delinquency trends. The 
      prior year included a $900 million reduction in the allowance for loan 
      losses. Net charge-offs were $206 million, compared with $1.4 billion in 
      the prior year. Prior-year total net charge-offs included $825 million 
      of incremental charge-offs reported in accordance with regulatory 
      guidance on certain loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $1.9 billion, a decrease of $223 million, or 
      11%, from the prior year, due to lower servicing expense.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Mortgage Production pretax income was $90&#160;million, a 
      decrease of $997 million from the prior year, reflecting lower volumes 
      and lower margins, partially offset by lower repurchase losses. Mortgage 
      production-related revenue, excluding repurchase losses, was $584 
      million, a decrease of $1.2&#160;billion, or 67%, from the prior year, 
      reflecting lower volumes from rising rates and lower revenue margins. 
      Production expense2 was $669 million, a decrease of 
      $9&#160;million from the prior year. Repurchase losses for the current 
      quarter reflected a benefit of $175 million, compared with losses of $13 
      million in the prior year and a benefit of $16 million in the prior 
      quarter. The current quarter reflected a $300 million reduction in 
      repurchase liability and lower realized repurchase losses, compared with 
      a $218 million reduction in repurchase liability in the prior year and a 
      $185 million reduction in repurchase liability in the prior quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Mortgage Servicing pretax loss was $406 million, a 
      decrease of $247 million from the prior year. Mortgage net 
      servicing-related revenue was $632 million, a decrease of $122 million, 
      or 16%, from the prior year, driven by lower revenue from an exited 
      non-core product and lower gains on Government National Mortgage 
      Association (&#8220;Ginnie Mae&#8221;) buy outs. MSR risk management was a loss of 
      $180 million, compared with income of $150 million in the prior year. 
      Servicing expense was $858 million, a decrease of $205 million from the 
      prior year, reflecting lower costs associated with the Independent 
      Foreclosure Review and lower servicing headcount, partially offset by 
      higher expense for foreclosure-related matters. The current quarter 
      included approximately $200 million of expense related to refined 
      estimates of servicing liabilities resulting from foreclosure delays.

			Real Estate Portfolios pretax income was $1.5 billion, up 
      $1.4&#160;billion from the prior year. Net revenue was $809 million, a 
      decrease of $197&#160;million, or 20%, from the prior year. The decrease was 
      due to higher loan retention driving lower noninterest revenue and a 
      decline in net interest income, resulting from lower loan balances due 
      to portfolio runoff.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      allowance for loan losses, $750 million from the purchased 
      credit-impaired allowance and $500 million from the non credit-impaired 
      allowance, due to lower estimated losses reflecting continued home price 
      improvement and favorable delinquency trends. The prior year provision 
      included a $900 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses. Net 
      charge-offs were $204&#160;million, compared with $1.4 billion in the prior 
      year. Prior-year total net charge-offs included $825 million of

      mortgage, including option ARMs, net recoveries were $11&#160;million (0.09%

      Credit Card and Auto. Noninterest revenue was $1.3&#160;billion, up $58 
      million compared with the prior year, primarily driven by higher net 
      interchange income, auto lease income and merchant servicing revenue,

      loan performance. The prior-year provision included a $55 million

			Discussion of Results:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was $2.2&#160;billion, up 12% compared with the prior year. These 
      results primarily reflected lower noninterest expense and a higher 
      benefit from the provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower 
      net revenue. Net revenue was $8.2&#160;billion, compared with $8.4&#160;billion in 
      the prior year. Net revenue included a $397 million loss from debit 
      valuation adjustments (&#8220;DVA&#8221;) on structured notes and derivative 
      liabilities; the prior year included a loss from DVA of $211 million. 
      Excluding the impact of DVA, net income was $2.5 billion1, up 
      17% from the prior year, and net revenue was $8.6 billion1, 
      flat compared with the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Banking revenue was $2.9 billion, up 2% from the prior year. Investment 
      banking fees were $1.5 billion, up 6% from the prior year, driven by 
      higher equity underwriting fees of $333 million, up 42% from the prior 
      year, and higher debt underwriting fees of $855 million, up 6% from the 
      prior year, partially offset by lower advisory fees of $322&#160;million, 
      down 17% from the prior year. Treasury Services revenue was $1.1 
      billion, flat compared with the prior year. Lending revenue was 
      $351&#160;million, primarily reflecting net interest income on retained loans 
      and fees on lending-related commitments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Markets  Investor Services revenue was $5.3 billion, down 4% from the 
      prior year. Fixed Income Markets revenue was $3.4 billion, down 8% 
      compared with a strong prior year. The prior year included a modest loss 
      from the synthetic credit portfolio. Equity Markets revenue was $1.2 
      billion, up 20% from the prior year, driven by broad-based strength 
      across products and regions. Securities Services revenue was $1.0 
      billion, up 3% from the prior year. Credit Adjustments  Other revenue 
      was a loss of $409&#160;million, compared with a loss of $225 million in the 
      prior year; both periods were predominantly driven by the impact of DVA.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $218 million, compared 
      with a benefit of $60 million in the prior year. The ratio of the 
      allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained was 1.09%, 
      compared with 1.35% in the prior year. Excluding the impact of the 
      consolidation of Firm-administered multi-seller conduits and trade 
      finance loans, the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to period-end 
      loans retained1 was 2.01%, compared with 2.92% in the prior 
      year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $5.0 billion, down 7% from the prior year, 
      primarily driven by lower compensation expense on lower reported 
      revenue. The compensation ratio
			for the current quarter was 
      27%, excluding the impact of DVA1.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Net income was $665 million, a decrease of $25 million, or 4%, compared 
      with the prior year, reflecting an increase in noninterest expense and a 
      decrease in net revenue, partially offset by a lower provision for 
      credit losses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $1.7&#160;billion, flat compared with the prior year. Net 
      interest income was $1.1&#160;billion, flat compared with the prior year, 
      reflecting spread compression on loan and liability products and lower 
      purchase discounts recognized on loan repayments, predominantly offset 
      by higher loan balances. Noninterest revenue was $588&#160;million, flat 
      compared with the prior year.

      Revenue from Middle Market Banking was $745 million, flat compared with 
      the prior year. Revenue from Corporate Client Banking was $459&#160;million, 
      flat compared with the prior year. Revenue from Commercial Term Lending 
      was $311&#160;million, an increase of $13 million, or 4%, compared with the 
      prior year. Revenue from Real Estate Banking was $118&#160;million, an 
      increase of $12 million, or 11%, compared with the prior year.

      The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $41 million, compared 
      with a benefit of $16 million in the prior year. Net charge-offs were 
      $16 million (0.05% net charge-off rate), compared with net recoveries of 
      $18&#160;million (0.06% net recovery rate) in the prior year and net 
      charge-offs of $9&#160;million (0.03% net charge-off rate) in the prior 
      quarter. The allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained was 
      1.99%, down from 2.15% in the prior year and down from 2.06% in the 
      prior quarter. Nonaccrual loans were $566&#160;million, down $310&#160;million, or 
      35%, from the prior year, and up by $53 million, or 10%, from the prior 
      quarter.

      Noninterest expense was $661 million, up 10% compared with the prior

      or 15%, from the prior year, due to net client inflows, the effect of 
      higher market levels and higher placement fees. Net interest income was 
      $578&#160;million, up $26&#160;million, or 5%, from the prior year, due to higher 
      loan and deposit balances, partially offset by narrower loan and deposit

      to net inflows to long-term products and the effect of higher market 
      levels. Custody, brokerage, administration and deposit balances were 
      $706&#160;billion, up $56&#160;billion, or 9%, from the prior year, due to the 
      effect of higher market levels and custody inflows.

      Noninterest expense was $2.0 billion, an increase of $272 million, or 
      16%, from the prior year, primarily due to higher headcount-related2

			Discussion of Results:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was a loss of $6.5 billion, compared with net income of $228 
      million in the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Private Equity reported net income of $242 million, compared with a net 
      loss of $89 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $398 million, 
      compared with a loss of $135 million in the prior year, primarily due to 
      net valuation gains on private investments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Treasury and CIO reported a net loss of $193 million, compared with net 
      income of $369 million in the prior year. Net revenue was a loss of $232 
      million, compared with net revenue of $713 million in the prior year. 
      The prior-year revenue reflected $888 million extinguishment gains 
      related to the redemption of trust preferred securities. Current-quarter 
      net interest income was a loss of $261 million due to low interest rates 
      and limited reinvestment opportunities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Other Corporate reported a net loss of $6.5 billion, compared with a net 
      loss of $52 million in the prior year. The current quarter included 
      approximately $9.2 billion of legal expense, including reserves for 
      litigation and regulatory proceedings, compared with $684 million of 
      expense for additional litigation reserves in the prior year.

            Presented on a managed basis. See notes on page 13 for further 
            explanation of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis 
            totaled $23,117 million, $25,211 million, and $25,146 million for 
            the third quarter of 2013, second quarter of 2013, and third 
            quarter of 2012, respectively.

			Discussion of Results:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was a loss of approximately $0.4 billion, down $6.1 billion 
      from the prior year, due to higher noninterest expense and lower net 
      revenue, partially offset by lower provision for credit losses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $23.9 billion, down $2.0 billion, or 8%, compared with 
      the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $12.9 billion, down $1.8 
      billion, or 12%, compared with the prior year. The current-quarter 
      revenue included a $397 million loss from DVA on certain structured 
      notes and derivative liabilities. Net interest income was $11.0 billion, 
      down $220 million, or 2%, compared with the prior year, reflecting the 
      impact of lower loan yields due to competitive pressures and replacement 
      of higher yielding loans with lower yielding loans, partially offset by 
      higher investment securities yield and lower net interest expense on 
      long-term debt.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $543 million, compared 
      with a provision for credit losses of $1.8 billion in the prior year. 
      The total consumer provision for credit losses was a benefit of $273 
      million, compared with an expense of $1.9 billion in the prior year. The 
      current-quarter provision reflected a $1.6 billion reduction in the 
      allowance for loan losses due to favorable delinquency trends and lower 
      estimated losses in the mortgage and credit card portfolios. Consumer 
      net charge-offs were $1.3 billion, compared with $2.8 billion in the 
      prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 1.47% and 3.10%, 
      respectively. The prior-year total net charge-offs included $880 million 
      of incremental charge-offs reported in accordance with regulatory 
      guidance on certain loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The 
      wholesale provision for credit losses was a benefit of $270 million, 
      compared with a benefit of $63 million in the prior year. Wholesale net 
      charge-offs were $26 million, compared with net recoveries of $34 
      million in the prior year, resulting in a net charge-off rate of 0.03% 
      and a net recovery rate of 0.05%, respectively. The Firm&#8217;s allowance for 
      loan losses to period-end loans retained1 was 1.89%, compared 
      with 2.61% in the prior year. The Firm&#8217;s nonperforming assets totaled 
      $10.2 billion, down from the prior-quarter and prior-year levels of 
      $10.9 billion and $12.5 billion, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $23.6 billion, up $8.3 billion, or 54%, compared 
      with the prior year, driven by higher litigation reserves. The current 
      quarter included approximately $9.3 billion of legal expense, including 
      reserves for litigation and regulatory proceedings, compared with $790 
      million of expense for additional litigation reserves in the prior year.

            aftertax impact of reductions in the allowance for loan losses and 
            litigation expense in Corporate. These measures should be viewed 
            in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Firm&#8217;s reported 
            results. Management believes this information helps investors 
            understand the effect of these items on reported results and 
            provides an alternate presentation of the Firm's performance. The

            In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, 
            management reviews the Firm's results and the results of the lines 
            of business on a &#8220;managed&#8221; basis, which is a non-GAAP financial 
            measure. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts with the 
            reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications 
            to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the 
            business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (&#8220;FTE&#8221;) basis. 
            Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and 
            tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a 
            basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This 
            non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the 
            comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt 
            sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt 
            items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments 
            have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or 
            by the lines of business.

            The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans

            loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired (&#8220;PCI&#8221;) loans; and 
            the allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans. Additionally, 
            Real Estate Portfolios net charge-off rates exclude the impact of 
            PCI loans. The allowance for loan losses related to the PCI 
            portfolio totaled $5.0 billion at September 30, 2013, and $5.7 
            billion at each of June 30, 2013, and September 30, 2012. In 
            Corporate  Investment Bank, the ratio of the allowance for loan 
            losses to end-of-period loans is calculated excluding the impact 
            of trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered 
            multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to 
            provide a more meaningful assessment of the CIB's allowance

            The Tier 1 common ratio under both Basel I and Basel III are both 
            non-GAAP financial measures. These measures, along with other 
            capital measures, are used by management, bank regulators, 
            investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Firm's capital 
            position and to compare the Firm's capital to that of other 
            financial services companies. The Basel I Tier 1 common ratio is 
            Tier 1 common capital divided by Basel I risk-weighted assets. 
            Tier 1 common capital is defined as Tier 1 capital less elements 
            of Tier 1 capital not in the form of common equity, such as 
            perpetual preferred stock, noncontrolling interests in 
            subsidiaries, and trust preferred securities. In July 2013, U.S.

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - Infosys (INFY.NS), India's second-largest software services exporter, posted quarterly profit that missed analyst estimates on a charge related to visa use in the United States, but raised the lower end of its fiscal full-year revenue guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were the first for a full quarter since co-founder Narayana Murthy came out of retirement on June 1 to be executive chairman after two years of mostly disappointing earnings that saw the long-time industry bellwether lose ground to rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several analysts said the company has set conservative revenue guidance that they expect it to beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's still a lot of work to be done, but they're turning around," said Bhavin Shah, CEO of Equirus Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think they're seeing deal wins, client traction and revenue momentum. I'm sure Murthy is spending a lot of energy in sort of assuring clients that Infosys means business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consolidated net profit for the three months to September 30 was 24.07 billion rupees ($391 million) compared with 23.69 billion rupees in the same period a year earlier, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Infosys, which in recent quarters have reacted violently to its results and guidance statements, rose a relatively modest 5 percent soon after markets opened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result missed the 26.26 billion rupees average of analyst estimates according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, though the earnings suffered from a 2.19 billion rupee provision for "visa related matters."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infosys has been under investigation in the U.S., its biggest market, over the past use of temporary employment visas and the company said it had made the provision based on discussions with U.S. government agencies and is seeking a "civil resolution" to the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infosys, which trails market leader Tata Consultancy Services (TCS.NS) by revenue, counts among its customers Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), BT Group PLC (BT.L), Procter &amp; Gamble Co (PG.N) and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As widely expected, Infosys, one of the relatively few Indian companies to give guidance, narrowed the range of its fiscal year revenue growth outlook to 9-10 percent from 6-10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several analysts said Infosys was being conservative after a series of guidance misses, and some said they expect revenue to exceed the current guidance for the full year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Infosys is back to its days of under-promising and over-delivering," said Manik Taneja, an analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's forecast compares with 12-14 percent for the sector, according to an estimate by the National Association of Software and Services Companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murthy, who had retired at 65 under company rules at the time, has said Infosys took its eye off its growth target to earn a bigger share of revenue from higher-margin proprietary software and consulting. He is attempting to re-focus on large plain-vanilla IT outsourcing contracts that boost growth and have long been the industry staple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services are being helped by a revival in demand from investment banks in their largest market, the U.S., and growing appetite for outsourcing in Europe as companies seek to reduce IT costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The industry, which generates most of its revenue in dollars, is also benefiting from weakness in the rupee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consolidated revenue for the September quarter was 129.65 billion rupees, up nearly 32 percent from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 61.5900 Indian rupees)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Aradhana Aravindan and Abhishek Vishnoi in MUMBAI; Editing by Christopher Cushing and Tony Munroe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Tuesday it is paying a well-known hacking expert more than $100,000 for finding security holes in its software, one of the largest such bounties awarded to date by a high-tech company.&lt;/p&gt;

      Case Study: Chevron Delo&#174; Products Deliver Extended Engine Life to 
      Sindall Transport
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Delo 400 Multigrade SAE 15W-40 and Delo Extended Life Coolant Keep 
      CAT&#174; C-15 Engine in &#8220;Incredible&#8221; Condition After More Than 1.1 Million 
      Miles
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Products Company, a Chevron U.S.A. Inc. division, maker of the 
      Delo&#174; brand of technologically advanced engine oils, lubricants and 
      coolants, released a case study demonstrating the performance of Delo 
      400 Multigrade SAE 15W-40 and Delo Extended Life Coolant in a CAT&#174; C-15 
      engine used by New Holland, Pennsylvania&#8217;s Sindall Transport. The two 
      products played a key role in the CAT engine reaching 1.1 million miles 
      with minimal wear.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Don M. Sindall founded Sindall Companies in the 1950s, hauling hay and 
      balers between the sale barns of New Holland, PA, and Ontario, Canada. 
      Now under the leadership of Don&#8217;s son Doug, Sindall Transport has used 
      Chevron Delo lubricants and coolants for its fleet for over 16 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nearly a fifth of the engines in the company&#8217;s fleet have more than a 
      million miles of service. &#8220;They stay on the road in top condition thanks 
      to Delo,&#8221; said Doug Sindall. &#8220;We have 29 trucks, many with 1 million 
      miles plus without an overhaul,&#8221; Sindall said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In order to demonstrate, Sindall mechanics disassembled one of the 
      company&#8217;s oldest CAT C-15 engines to see how it was holding up after 1.1 
      million miles on the road using Delo 400 Multigrade SAE 15W-40 and Delo 
      Extended Life Coolant. Mechanics found the engine in &#8220;incredible&#8221; 
      condition, said Sindall Master Mechanic Harry Kline.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      After removing the cylinder head and valves, the team found that the 
      engine had only minor carbon deposits inside the cylinders and on the 
      valves themselves.&#8220;The cam shaft &#8211; there was no sign of wear,&#8221; Kline 
      said. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to reinstall it back in the engine.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sindall Fleet Manager Dave Troop said that the condition of the engine 
      Kline&#8217;s team inspected is seen across the board in all the company&#8217;s 
      trucks, including five other vehicles each with more than a million 
      miles on their engines. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got five or six trucks with over a million 
      miles on them, and with the Delo products in them, I certainly hope we 
      can try to get 2 million miles out of them,&#8221; Troop said. &#8220;I&#8217;m pretty 
      confident that we can get close to that.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The success with Delo engine oil has led Sindall Transportation to 
      switch to Delo&#8217;s full line of engine products, including Delo gear 
      lubricant and Delo Extended Life Coolant. Sindall Transportation has 
      used Delo Extended Life Coolant since 2003 and has seen it help put a 
      stop to liner pitting and cavitation, with engine liners staying clean 
      and in good condition with no deposits.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In summing up his experience with Chevron Delo products, Sindal said &#8220;We 
      use Delo 400 oil, because it extends the lives of our engines.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chevron Corp will try to convince a U.S. judge this week that a group of Ecuadorean villagers and their U.S. lawyer used bribery to win an $18 billion judgment against Chevron from a court in Ecuador, in the latest chapter in a long-running fight over pollution in the Amazon jungle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a trial starting Tuesday, the oil company is asking a federal court in New York to prevent the villagers and their Harvard-educated lawyer, Steven Donziger, from using U.S. courts to enforce the Ecuadorean judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A victory in the United States would likely help Chevron's defense in other countries where Donziger and the villagers may seek to enforce the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe that any jurisdiction that observes the rule of law will find that the judgment is illegal and unenforceable because it's a product of fraud," said Morgan Crinklaw, a spokesman for Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger and the villagers say they did nothing wrong in obtaining the judgment, and they accuse the judge in the U.S. case, District Judge Lewis Kaplan, of bias against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These claims by Chevron are utterly baseless," said Chris Gowen, a spokesman for Donziger and the Ecuadoreans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial is the latest chapter in a dispute over environmental contamination between 1964 and 1992 at an oil field in northeastern Ecuador operated by Texaco, which Chevron bought in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron says Texaco cleaned up its share of waste before turning the field over to state-owned Petroecuador. But in 2011, an Ecuadorean court awarded $18 billion to people from the village of Lago Agrio, which was affected by the pollution. The court subsequently increased the award to $19 billion to cover fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger and the Ecuadoreans have been unable to collect the award in Ecuador because Chevron no longer has operations there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, Chevron obtained an injunction from Judge Kaplan in New York blocking enforcement of the judgment anywhere outside Ecuador. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals later reversed that ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RACKETEER ACCUSATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lawsuit, Chevron accuses Donziger of violating the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and says both he and the villagers committed fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central to Chevron's case is the evidence of a former Ecuadorean judge, Alberto Guerra. Guerra said in a sworn deposition that he often wrote opinions for Judge Nicolas Zambrano, who issued the award to the villagers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guerra said Donziger and another lawyer pledged to pay Zambrano $500,000 from whatever they collected from the judgment in exchange for allowing them to write it. Guerra also said Zambrano promised to share part of the bribe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ted Boutrous, a lawyer for Chevron, said the proceedings in Ecuador were "one of the most egregious litigation frauds in history."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger and the Ecuadoreans say Guerra has no credibility and say he is being paid for his testimony by Chevron. Donziger denies writing the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are completely and utterly denying the allegations by Chevron," his spokesman Gowen told reporters on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Steven Donziger did not ghostwrite a judgment," Gowen said. "Steven Donziger did not bribe a judge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, Chevron said it relocated Guerra's family to protect his safety and paid him $38,000 for the costs of providing his evidence. Chevron also confirmed that it agreed to pay Guerra's family $10,000 per month for living expenses and $2,000 for housing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guerra and Zambrano are expected to testify at the trial, which is expected to last several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger and the Ecuadoreans argue that the relief Chevron seeks - a ban on enforcing the Ecuadorean judgment in U.S. courts or profiting from it in any way - would violate the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' reversal of Kaplan's 2011 injunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also say they are fighting an unfair battle. Chevron has overwhelmingly more resources. And Donziger and the villagers accuse Kaplan of bias. In a court filing, they wrote that Kaplan's "contempt" for Ecuador, "its courts, and its laws has only grown more prominent over time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2nd Circuit on September 26 rejected their request to remove Kaplan from the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Kaplan ruled that the villagers and Donziger are not entitled to a trial by jury, as they had preferred, because Chevron waived damages claims against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Chevron Corp v. Steven Donziger et al, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 11-0691.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bernard Vaughan; Editing by Eddie Evans and Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Tuesday it is paying a well-known hacking expert more than $100,000 for finding security holes in its software, one of the largest such bounties awarded to date by a high-tech company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software maker also released a much anticipated update to Internet Explorer, which it said fixes a bug that made users of the world's most popular browser vulnerable to remote attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Forshaw, who heads vulnerability research at London-based security consulting firm Context Information Security, won Microsoft's first $100,000 bounty for identifying a new "exploitation technique" in Windows, which will allow it to develop defenses against an entire class of attacks, the software maker said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forshaw earned another $9,400 for identifying security bugs in a preview release of Microsoft's Internet Explorer 11 browser, Katie Moussouris, senior security strategist with Microsoft Security Response Center, said in a blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft unveiled the reward programs four months ago to bolster efforts to prevent sophisticated attackers from subverting new security technologies in its software, which runs on the vast majority of the world's personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forshaw has been credited with identifying several dozen software security bugs. He was awarded a large bounty from Hewlett-Packard Co for identifying a way to "pwn," or take ownership of, Oracle Corp's Java software in a high-profile contest known as Pwn2Own (pronounced "pown to own").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also released an automatic update to Internet Explorer on Tuesday afternoon to fix a security bug that it first disclosed last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers say hackers initially exploited that flaw to launch attacks on companies in Asia in an operation that the cybersecurity firm FireEye has dubbed DeputyDog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marc Maiffret, chief technology officer of the cybersecurity firm BeyondTrust, said the vulnerability was later more broadly used after Microsoft's disclosure of the issue brought it to the attention of cyber criminals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is advising computer users to immediately install the update to Internet Explorer, if they do not have their PCs already set to automatically download updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any time they patch something that has already been used (to launch attacks) in the wild, then it is critical to apply the patch," Maiffret said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That vulnerability in Internet Explorer was known as a "zero-day" because Microsoft, the targeted software maker, had zero days notice to fix the hole when the initial attacks exploiting the bug were discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an active, underground market for "zero day" vulnerabilities, criminal groups and governments sometimes pay $1 million or more to hackers who identify such bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Aqua Data Studio 14 Adds Support for NoSQL Databases MongoDB and 
      Cassandra, As Well As Hadoop-based Hive and Microsoft&#8217;s Cloud Azure 
      Database
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      AquaFold, Inc. has released Aqua Data Studio 14, a major upgrade to its 
      universal database query and management software, allowing users to 
      design and administer the latest class of databases, including 
      relational, embedded, NoSQL, and even databases hosted in the cloud. 
      NoSQL and cloud databases have grown in importance as both startups and 
      large enterprises face the challenge of working with massive data sets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Aqua Data Studio is the first to market with a multi-database GUI that 
      also supports NoSQL, Cloud and Hadoop-based databases,&#8221; says AquaFold&#8217;s 
      CEO, Niels Gron. &#8220;Our customers see huge value in these specialized 
      databases that provide low cost and highly scalable solutions for their 
      business analytics.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Adding support for NoSQL required the AquaFold development team to 
      develop creative ways to provide a relational &#8220;SQL&#8221; frontend to 
      databases that explicitly do not support it. The team designed its own 
      MongoSQL language specific to MongoDB, as well as a command line shell 
      that places an interactive JavaScript MongoDB shell directly in Aqua 
      Data Studio. The team also worked to bring Aqua Data Studio's full 
      toolset to users of Apache Hive and the open source distributed database 
      Apache Cassandra.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Connecting to Microsoft's relational database-as-a-service, SQL Database 
      (Azure), is now also possible in version 14 of Aqua Data Studio using 
      the same tools users have come to expect when connecting to Microsoft 
      SQL Server.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Hosted databases offer cost savings and simplicity that are very 
      attractive to companies,&#8221; says Gron. &#8220;We&#8217;ve ensured that they can 
      continue using Aqua Data Studio whether that database is on the 
      company&#8217;s own server or moves to the cloud.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Aqua Data Studio&#8217;s built-in Git client was rebuilt from the ground up 
      and vastly improved. The overhauled interface supports all of the source 
      control tasks customers expect, including branching, tagging, fetching, 
      merging and pushing. A complete history graph makes tracing changes and 
      finding forks and branches effortless.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Aqua Data Studio 14 also features additional enhancements, including 
      connection clustering, which allows users to use a single registered 
      server to access multiple databases from PostgreSQL, nCluster, 
      Greenplum, Netezza or ParAccel. The Table Data Editor and Sybase import 
      have seen dramatic performance improvements, and configurable keyboard 
      shortcuts help make Aqua Data Studio adapt to individual users, 
      including with preconfigured Emacs key mappings. Database support has 
      also been upgraded to include Sybase IQ 16, Oracle 12c, Teradata Aster 
      Database 5.0, Teradata Database 14.0, ParAccel 4.0, MySQL 5.6, SQLite 
      3.7.15 and Apache Derby 10.10.1, and more.

&lt;p&gt;DAEGU, South Korea Oct 14 (Reuters) - The cost of
delivering U.S. gas to Asia will eventually rise as U.S.
production costs increase, erasing North America's price
advantage over other global suppliers of the fuel in its
liquefied form, an ExxonMobil executive said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development will disappoint Japan and other buyers who
are counting on bringing liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Asia at
huge discounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prices for U.S. natural gas are currently around $3.80 per
million British thermal units (mmBtu) compared with just over
$16 per mmBtu for LNG delivered into Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think there is a misperception out there that with Henry
Hub sales from $3.50 we can land LNG in Asia for $11, $12 (per
million British thermal units)," Richard Guerrant, ExxonMobil's
global vice president for LNG, told the World Energy Congress in
South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over time the arbitrage is going to be consumed ... and you
can expect a convergence of prices."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. natural gas prices are currently below replacement
costs because producers are drilling in areas rich in more

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects attribution in paras 6,7; adds paras 3,4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Meeyoung Cho&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAEGU, South Korea Oct 14 (Reuters) - The cost of
delivering U.S. gas to Asia will eventually rise as U.S.
production costs increase, erasing North America's price
advantage over other global suppliers of the fuel in its
liquefied form, an ExxonMobil executive said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development will disappoint Japan and other buyers who
are counting on bringing liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Asia at
huge discounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prices for U.S. natural gas are currently around $3.80 per
million British thermal units (mmBtu) compared with just over
$16 per mmBtu for LNG delivered into Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today the Henry Hub prices are in one of the low price
cycles and below replacement cost," Richard Guerrant,
ExxonMobil's global vice president for LNG, told the World
Energy Congress in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If history is any indication, this can't be maintained over
the long term since the gas produced in liquid-rich plays is not
enough to meet long-term demand."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ConocoPhillips executive vice president Don Wallette,
speaking at the same panel discussion, said: "I think there is a
misperception out there that with Henry Hub sales from $3.50 we
can land LNG in Asia for $11, $12 (per million British thermal
units)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over time the arbitrage is going to be consumed ... and you
can expect a convergence of prices."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. natural gas prices are currently below replacement
costs because producers are drilling in areas rich in more
lucrative petroleum liquids, which subsidise the cost of
drilling for the cheaper gas, Guerrant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;History indicates those low prices cannot be maintained over
the long term, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since the gas produced from liquid-rich places is not

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co on Tuesday reported a higher quarterly profit and said it was on track to achieve its goal of doubling its 2010 "system revenue," which includes its sales and those of its bottlers, by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VIENNA/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - JP Morgan's (JPM.N) One Equity Partners (OEP) is seeking to sell its majority stake in Austrian packaging group Constantia Flexibles either through a stock market listing or a trade sale, three people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separate sources said in August that Constantia had hired banks for an initial public offering (IPO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a flotation in Frankfurt remains the preferred option for OEP, and could take place this year or early in 2014, the private equity firm is also keeping the door open for potential buyers, the three people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"OEP has already tested the market and received tentative bids from private equity groups," one of the people said, adding that CVC CVC.UL and EQT were among those who had put in bids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OEP beat CVC in an auction to buy Constantia Flexibles in 2009. CVC has remained interested in the packaging business ever since, one of the three sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OEP, Constantia Flexibles, CVC and EQT all declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OEP owns 75 percent of Constantia Flexibles, with the founding family's foundation holding the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is hoping to see Constantia Flexibles' equity and debt valued at 1.8-2 billion euros in a transaction, equivalent to 8-9 times its 2013 expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 220-230 million, two of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private equity firms buy companies, try to boost their profitability by cutting costs or shaking up operations, and then sell them on in the hope of making a return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While OEP could divest all of its stake in a trade sale, it is unlikely to be able to do so in a listing. Between 30 and 50 percent of the company would be floated on the stock market, sources have said in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constantia Flexibles' net profit fell by a third to 21 million euros in the first half of 2013 and its operating margin slipped 0.6 percentage point to 7.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It makes packaging for the food and drugs sectors among others, and its peers include Australia's Amcor (AMC.AX) and U.S. groups Bemis (BMS.N) and Sealed Air Corp (SEE.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The listed rivals trade at an average of 7.8 their expected earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The story has been filed again to correct the line that sources spoke on Tuesday, not Monday, as stated in paragraph 3.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Angelika Gruber and Arno Schuetze; Editing by Pravin Char)&lt;/p&gt;

Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"OEP has already tested the market and received tentative
bids from private equity groups," one of the people said, adding
that CVC and EQT were among those who had put in bids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OEP beat CVC in an auction to buy Constantia Flexibles in
2009. CVC has remained interested in the packaging business ever
since, one of the three sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OEP, Constantia Flexibles, CVC and EQT all declined to
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OEP owns 75 percent of Constantia Flexibles, with the
founding family's foundation holding the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is hoping to see Constantia Flexibles' equity and debt
valued at 1.8-2 billion euros in a transaction, equivalent to
8-9 times its 2013 expected earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortisation of 220-230 million, two of the
sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private equity firms buy companies, try to boost their
profitability by cutting costs or shaking up operations, and
then sell them on in the hope of making a return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While OEP could divest all of its stake in a trade sale, it
is unlikely to be able to do so in a listing. Between 30 and 50
percent of the company would be floated on the stock market,
sources have said in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constantia Flexibles' net profit fell by a third to 21
million euros in the first half of 2013 and its operating margin
slipped 0.6 percentage point to 7.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It makes packaging for the food and drugs sectors among
others, and its peers include Australia's Amcor and
U.S. groups Bemis and Sealed Air Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The listed rivals trade at an average of 7.8 their expected
earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Steven Brill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oct 15 (Reuters) - (This the latest installment of Steven
Brill's weekly column "Stories I'd like to see.")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. How Boehner can save his speakership:
Conventional wisdom is that House Speaker John Boehner has been
afraid to defy the Ted Cruz-inspired House members who have
insisted on closing the government and holding the debt ceiling
hostage unless President Obama agrees to delay or defund
Obamacare. The assumption is that Boehner fears that the most
zealous Republicans in his caucus would turn on him and remove
him as speaker. With that in mind, there's one story I've been
waiting for and still haven't seen: Why haven't the Democrats
offered to protect Boehner if he runs into trouble by allowing
the full House to vote to reopen the government and extend the
debt ceiling?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think the speaker of the House is chosen only by the
majority Republicans, you're wrong. Under the Constitution, the
speaker is elected by a majority of all the members of the
House. Traditionally, the majority party will caucus and choose
one of their own as the speaker, for whom all, or most, of the
majority party will then vote, assuring that he or she gets a
majority of the full House and becomes speaker. (The minority
party all votes for their favorite, who of course loses, but
becomes the Minority Leader, a post chosen by the party, not the
full House.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it doesn't have to be that way. So here's a scenario
Politico, the Washington Post, the New York Times, Roll Call or
other news organizations that swarm Capitol Hill ought to
explore: To get Boehner to take a more moderate stance, House
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, with President Obama's
encouragement, could offer Boehner enough Democratic votes to
keep him in power through the 2014 Congressional elections, even
if members of his own caucus rebel and introduce a motion that
he be removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the House's rules, if a member proposes the removal of
the speaker, it would require a majority vote to pass. So even
if more than half of the Republicans wanted to remove Boehner,
the Democrats could provide the votes to keep him - which would
not be much of a sacrifice for them because they don't have the
votes to put one of their own in the speakership and the
alternative would be, by definition, a Republican more to the
far right's liking than Boehner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine what a sea change this admittedly unlikely
development would bring. The leadership of the House would
suddenly be less extreme and, in fact, based on a bipartisan
coalition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be great if some enterprising reporter could get
Pelosi and others to talk about this - asking them why it hasn't
happened, and whether it could.

2. Auditing JPMorgan's lawyers:
Last week, I saw that JPMorgan Chase had recorded its first
quarterly loss under chief executive officer Jamie Dimon because
it had reserved a whopping $9.2 billion for legal expenses due
to its ongoing regulatory and litigation battles. So, I was all
set to suggest a story examining how it could be that legal
expenses - even for a giant bank fighting so many battles - are
so high. $9.2 billion is about the same as the total gross
revenues recorded by the world's four highest-grossing law firms
for all of last year, according to The American Lawyer magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then on Saturday morning I saw this front page story in
the New York Times, headlined, "JPMorgan's Loss is Corporate Law
Firms' Gain." So I figured the Times, which assigned not one but
two reporters from its DealBook section to the story, had beaten
me to the punch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, for all its length and reporting firepower, the
story has none of the detail - and answers none of the questions
- it should. There's a description of some of the firms doing
work for the bank, but there isn't even an estimate, much less
an account, of how much of what the Times referred to as "legal
expenses" are actually going to pay lawyers, as opposed to fines
and settlements or reserves being taken now for future fines and
settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, someone with a bit more energy ought to take a crack at
these mind-blowing numbers, especially given that the bank
revealed in the same statement that it has now reserved a
cushion totaling $23 billion for "litigation expenses" going
forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If just 10 percent of that is for lawyers, JPM could be the
world's most lucrative private client ever, making this a huge
legal business story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With much of the rest of the corporate legal market
sputtering, has the bank tried to use its leverage to negotiate
discounts with the major firms it is using?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, this is all high-stakes stuff justifying hiring the
best lawyers around. But there are multiple firms capable of
giving Dimon and his team premium representation. Are any
offering discounts to edge out the others? Are Dimon and his
board pushing for some restraint on costs, or is the bank so
besieged with multi-billion dollar claims that worrying about
saving a few hundred million here or there is beside the point?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who's making these buying decisions at the bank, and does
that person have a reputation for bargaining hard with lawyers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have any firms offered contingent fees based on how well
they stave off the regulators or plaintiffs lawyers? Which
single lawyer is billing JPMorgan the highest hourly rate?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is hard information to get, but it's not
impossible. It just takes more work than the Times devoted to
its overview.

3. Is Rupert Murdoch rooting against a Detroit-St. Louis World
Series?
As Detroit and Boston in the American League and St. Louis and
Los Angeles in the National League compete this week to get into
the World Series, I wish someone would take data from prior
ratings and ad sales pricing to tell us how much Rupert Murdoch
and 21st Century Fox stand to gain or lose depending on the
outcomes. Fox, which will broadcast the series, has to be
rooting for Boston and L.A. to beat their smaller-market rivals
(who also arguably have less enthusiastic fan bases nationally).
But how much does the difference really matter in dollars and
cents?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nailing that story would yield a fun read, as well as an
effective primer on the economics of sports broadcasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Walt Disney Company Recommends Stockholders Reject 
      Below-Market-Price &#8220;Mini-Tender Offer&#8221; by TRC Capital Corporation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Disney is not associated in any way with TRC or this mini-tender 
      offer
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) has been notified of an unsolicited 
      "mini-tender offer" made by TRC Capital Corporation (TRC) to Disney 
      shareowners to purchase up to 2,000,000 shares of Disney common stock at 
      a price of $61.00 per share. TRC's offer is for approximately one tenth 
      of one percent of our outstanding shares and the offer price is $3.00 
      per share, or approximately 4.7 percent, below Disney's closing price of 
      $64.00 on October 8, 2013, the day before commencement of the offer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Disney recommends that shareowners not tender their shares because the 
      offer price is below Disney&#8217;s current share price, and urges them to 
      consult with their financial advisor and exercise caution with respect 
      to TRC's offer. Disney notes that the offer is subject to the 
      satisfaction of a substantial number of conditions, including the 
      absence of any decrease in the market price of Disney shares from the 
      price on the date of the offer and the ability of TRC to finance the 
      offer. If the market price of Disney shares falls or TRC cannot obtain 
      financing, TRC is permitted to terminate the offer and not purchase any 
      shares.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued an investor 
      alert regarding mini-tender offers, noting that in making the offers at 
      below-market prices, "bidders are hoping that they will catch investors 
      off guard if the investors do not compare the offer price to the current 
      market price." The SEC's investor alert can be found on the SEC Web site 
      at http://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/minitend.htm.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the SEC, mini-tender offers are for not more than 5 percent 
      of a company's stock and typically do not provide the same investor 
      protections required of larger tender offers, including the filing of 
      disclosure documents with the SEC and other procedural protections 
      mandated by U.S. securities laws.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Disney does not endorse this unsolicited mini-tender offer, and Disney 
      is not associated in any way with TRC, the mini-tender offer or the 
      offer documentation. Disney shareowners who already have tendered their 
      shares are advised that they may withdraw their shares by providing the 
      written notice described in the TRC offering documents prior to the 
      expiration of the offer, currently scheduled for 12:01 a.m. eastern time 
      on Thursday, November 7, 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Disney encourages brokers and dealers, as well as other market 
      participants, to review the SEC's letter regarding broker-dealer 
      mini-tender offer dissemination and disclosures at http://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/minitenders/sia072401.htm; 
      and the NASD Notice to Members 99-53, issued in July 1999, regarding 
      guidance to members forwarding mini-tender offers to their customers, 
      which can be found at http://www.finra.org/web/groups/industry/@ip/@reg/@notice/documents/notices/p004221.pdf.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Disney requests that a copy of this press release be included with all 
      distributions of materials relating to TRC Capital's mini-tender offer.

      December 2013.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Everyone has heard about digital print. But how much do you really know? 
      Digital print is just beginning to infiltrate the packaging market and 
      demonstrate its true potential for seamless and personalised advertising.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Coca-Cola&#8217;s 
      recent global &#8216;Share a Coke&#8217; campaign serves as the perfect success 
      story to demonstrate the potential of digital printing for businesses. 
      Coca-Cola personalised bottles with the most common first names from 
      around the world in multiple languages, and saw both sales and social 
      media engagement with the brand increase significantly.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Digital print is opening up a world of creativity in packaging 
      design and digital marketing strategy. Personalised digitally 
      printed material have been driving ROI for years, using content which 
      can also be incorporated into online and mobile media as pioneered by 
      marketing teams such as BSkyB. This kind of personalisation ensures 
      relevant messages are delivered to targeted groups. According to 
      Forbes.com, 61% of US consumers feel more positive about a brand when 
      marketing messages are personalised. Following Sky&#8217;s lead, FMCG brands 
      could be producing completely bespoke and targeted packaging in the not 
      so distant future.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This technology is in its relatively early stages and there is a general 
      lack of coverage and awareness in the industry. Despite common 
      misconceptions, digital printing is becoming increasingly cost-effective 
      and offers the same standard of quality as more traditional printing 
      methods. Companies of all shapes and sizes are beginning to recognise 
      its potential, and those who don&#8217;t get on board are likely to get left 
      behind.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hear from Coca-Cola, Unilever, BSkyB, SAB Miller, Mondelez, Marks  
      Spencer and many more at the Digital 
      Print for Packaging conference 2013, in London from 2-4 
      December. Whether you&#8217;re considering digital print for your business or 
      would like to know a little more about this increasingly popular 
      printing method, this event will provide you with answers to all of your 
      questions.

(The minority party all votes for their favorite, who of course loses, but becomes the Minority Leader, a post chosen by the party, not the full House.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it doesn't have to be that way. So here's a scenario Politico, the Washington Post, the New York Times, Roll Call or other news organizations that swarm Capitol Hill ought to explore: To get Boehner to take a more moderate stance, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, with President Obama's encouragement, could offer Boehner enough Democratic votes to keep him in power through the 2014 Congressional elections, even if members of his own caucus rebel and introduce a motion that he be removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the House's rules, if a member proposes the removal of the speaker, it would require a majority vote to pass. So even if more than half of the Republicans wanted to remove Boehner, the Democrats could provide the votes to keep him &#8212; which would not be much of a sacrifice for them because they don't have the votes to put one of their own in the speakership and the alternative would be, by definition, a Republican more to the far right's liking than Boehner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine what a sea change this admittedly unlikely development would bring. The leadership of the House would suddenly be less extreme and, in fact, based on a bipartisan coalition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be great if some enterprising reporter could get Pelosi and others to talk about this &#8212; asking them why it hasn't happened, and whether it could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Auditing JPMorgan's lawyers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, I saw that JPMorgan Chase had recorded its first quarterly loss under chief executive officer Jamie Dimon because it had reserved a whopping $9.2 billion for legal expenses due to its ongoing regulatory and litigation battles. So, I was all set to suggest a story examining how it could be that legal expenses &#8212; even for a giant bank fighting so many battles &#8212; are so high. $9.2 billion is about the same as the total gross revenues recorded by the world's four highest-grossing law firms for all of last year, according to The American Lawyer magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then on Saturday morning I saw this front page story in the New York Times, headlined, "JPMorgan's Loss is Corporate Law Firms' Gain." So I figured the Times, which assigned not one but two reporters from its DealBook section to the story, had beaten me to the punch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, for all its length and reporting firepower, the story has none of the detail &#8212; and answers none of the questions &#8212; it should. There's a description of some of the firms doing work for the bank, but there isn't even an estimate, much less an account, of how much of what the Times referred to as "legal expenses" are actually going to pay lawyers, as opposed to fines and settlements or reserves being taken now for future fines and settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, someone with a bit more energy ought to take a crack at these mind-blowing numbers, especially given that the bank revealed in the same statement that it has now reserved a cushion totaling $23 billion for "litigation expenses" going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If just 10 percent of that is for lawyers, JPM could be the world's most lucrative private client ever, making this a huge legal business story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With much of the rest of the corporate legal market sputtering, has the bank tried to use its leverage to negotiate discounts with the major firms it is using?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, this is all high-stakes stuff justifying hiring the best lawyers around. But there are multiple firms capable of giving Dimon and his team premium representation. Are any offering discounts to edge out the others? Are Dimon and his board pushing for some restraint on costs, or is the bank so besieged with multi-billion dollar claims that worrying about saving a few hundred million here or there is beside the point?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who's making these buying decisions at the bank, and does that person have a reputation for bargaining hard with lawyers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have any firms offered contingent fees based on how well they stave off the regulators or plaintiffs lawyers? Which single lawyer is billing JPMorgan the highest hourly rate?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is hard information to get, but it's not impossible. It just takes more work than the Times devoted to its overview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Is Rupert Murdoch rooting against a Detroit-St. Louis World Series?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Detroit and Boston in the American League and St. Louis and Los Angeles in the National League compete this week to get into the World Series, I wish someone would take data from prior ratings and ad sales pricing to tell us how much Rupert Murdoch and 21st Century Fox stand to gain or lose depending on the outcomes. Fox, which will broadcast the series, has to be rooting for Boston and L.A. to beat their smaller-market rivals (who also arguably have less enthusiastic fan bases nationally). But how much does the difference really matter in dollars and cents?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nailing that story would yield a fun read, as well as an effective primer on the economics of sports broadcasting.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan (NYSE: JPM) today announced its Call for Entries to the 
      firm&#8217;s second annual Code for Good Challenge in the UK. Hosted at the 
      firm&#8217;s London headquarters on November 16-17, the Code for Good 
      Challenge brings together talented university students studying 
      technology to develop solutions to challenges faced by nonprofits. The 
      event is also held throughout the United States in New York, Ohio and 
      Delaware, as well as Mumbai.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are excited to host the Code for Good Challenge in London for a 
      second year, building on last year&#8217;s successful event&#8221; said Mark Kimber, 
      EMEA CIO and CIB iCTO for J.P. Morgan. &#8220;The event is designed to not 
      only aid local nonprofit organizations, but it also gives incoming 
      talent the opportunity to see what it&#8217;s like to work in technology at a 
      major investment bank.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Participants at the event will be placed into teams and tasked with 
      working together to creatively solve a challenge faced by a local 
      nonprofit organization. J.P. Morgan technologists will also be involved, 
      advising participants throughout the course of the event. A panel of 
      judges will determine the winning team, which will be announced at the

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Last year&#8217;s event in London hosted students from 15 universities who 
      joined with three nonprofit organizations to create innovative 
      technology solutions for the social sector, coding over a two-day 
      period. Winners in London included students from University College 
      London who developed an interactive and educational application for the 
      Nature Conservancy, an organization aiming to raise awareness of nature 
      among young people. Their application highlighted notable aspects of the 
      nature and environmentally friendly initiatives within any specific 
      geographic location, while educating youths with pieces of trivia about 
      urban spaces, and instilling a sense of ownership of the environment by 
      allowing them to donate through an interactive interface.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While only one winner is chosen, JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s Technology

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. lawyer used fraud to win a historic $18 billion judgment against Chevron Corp (CVX.N) for polluting the Ecuadorean jungle, witnesses said at a trial in New York on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The witnesses were testifying in federal court on behalf of Chevron, which is seeking to prevent lawyer Steven Donziger from profiting from the award, which he won for a group of Ecuadorean villagers in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopher Bogart, the head of a firm that helped finance Donziger's case in Ecuador, said he ended his investment in the case after mounting concerns of misconduct by Donziger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was quite a lot of disturbing information coming out," said Bogart, who is the chief executive of litigation financing firm Burford Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a sworn statement in April, which became part of the Wednesday's proceeding, Bogart said he learned from emails that plaintiffs' lawyers knew they were engaging in misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high-profile trial, which began this week, is the latest chapter in a dispute over environmental contamination between 1964 and 1992 at an oil field in northeastern Ecuador operated by Texaco, which Chevron bought in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron says Texaco cleaned up its share of waste before turning the field over to state-owned Petroecuador. An Ecuadorean court disagreed and in 2011 awarded $18 billion to people from the village of Lago Agrio, which was affected by the pollution. The court subsequently increased the award to $19 billion to cover fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burford provided $4 million in financing to Patton Boggs, a prominent Washington firm working with the Ecuadoreans on their environmental lawsuit. But Bogart said in his statement that Burford terminated the funding agreement in 2011 over concerns about actions by lawyers for the Ecuadoreans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Wednesday, Ricardo Reis Veiga, a lawyer in Texaco's and now Chevron's legal department, said Donziger and his legal team had pressured Ecuadorean officials to bring bogus criminal charges against him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In cross-examining Bogart, Julio Gomez of Donziger's team of lawyers presented a series of Bogart's emails in an attempt to show that his firm had long been trying to pass on the case to other investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gomez also said Burford signed a settlement agreement with Chevron that included the promise to testify in the oil company's case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Bogart said any allegation he was coerced by Chevron into giving testimony was "flatly untrue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Bogart testified, Chevron called David Russell, an engineer from an environmental consulting firm that worked for Donziger, who said he was pressured to provide an exaggerated cost estimate for the oil clean-up in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's lawyers raised a flurry of objections to Donziger's legal team, which U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan largely upheld. Kaplan at times also scolded Donziger's team for meandering off topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I understand that both sides are playing to an audience outside this courtroom, but this is not the forum for that," Kaplan said in an exchange with Donziger's lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger has denied fraud and says he is fighting an unfair battle against Chevron, which had many more lawyers than Donziger in court on Wednesday. He has also accused Kaplan of bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a court filing, lawyers for Donziger and the Ecuadorean plaintiffs wrote that Kaplan's "contempt" for Ecuador, "its courts, and its laws has only grown more prominent over time." The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on September 26 rejected their request to remove Kaplan from the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Chevron Corp v. Steven Donziger et al, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 11-0691.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Mica Rosenberg; Editing by Eddie Evans and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 16 (Reuters) - A U.S. lawyer used fraud to win
a historic $18 billion judgment against Chevron Corp for
polluting the Ecuadorean jungle, witnesses said at a trial in
New York on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed more than 1 percent higher on Wednesday after Senate leaders said they had a deal to reopen the federal government and raise the debt ceiling, which would avoid the threat of a debt default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said senators had come to an agreement that will reopen the government through January 15 and raise the debt ceiling until February 7. The House of Representatives planned to vote on the measure later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day's gains brought the S 500 within a few points of its all-time closing high of 1,725.52 on September 18. Volume has been below average, however, as many investors stayed on the sidelines until a resolution of the fiscal issues was official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks like we'll get through this, which brings the market a bit of a reprieve. Not only is this a relief rally, but we're still in an environment with a very accommodative monetary policy, which provides a tailwind," said Judy Moses, portfolio manager at Evercore Wealth Management in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gains were broad, with all 10 S 500 sectors solidly higher, led by financial stocks .SPSY, which rose 2.1 percent. Other groups tied to the pace of economic growth, including energy .SPNY, also jumped. Crude oil rose 1 percent while gold was essentially flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another sign of easing concerns, the CBOE Volatility index .VIX sank 21 percent in its biggest daily drop since August 2011. However, the index remains up about 12 percent over the past four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 78 percent of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange ended higher while 69 percent of Nasdaq-listed shares closed up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the market closed, IBM (IBM.N) reported earnings that beat expectations but revenue below consensus, sending shares down 6 percent to $175.56.

The number of companies topping revenue forecasts has also been below the historical average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors will be closely watching for any sign that the government shutdown and debt ceiling impasse had a negative impact on results or forecasts. David Joy, who oversees about $703 billion in assets as chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Boston, said he expected political uncertainty to erode earnings expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To me the market has yet to reflect the reality of the economic damage and the psychological damage this has done," Joy said.

Morgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) will pay $100 million to settle charges for the "London Whale" trading scandal, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Wednesday.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - IBM reported a 4 percent drop in third-quarter revenue, worse than expected by Wall Street, amid a decline in hardware and emerging markets even as it beat earnings estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM shares fell 6 percent in after-hours trade to $175.56.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a conference call for investment analysts that third quarters tended to be difficult for the world's largest technology service provider but added the company faced some particular challenges this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profitability in its hardware business declined by $1 billion year-to-date and currency effects had a $500 million year-to-year negative impact, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is increasingly less demand for hardware as software replaces traditional infrastructure. IBM has recognized that trend and is itself shifting to become a more software focused business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardware was mostly hit in China, which Loughridge said broadly accounted for about 5 percent of IBM's business and about 40 percent of that business was hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's growth has slowed this year, impacting corporate and public spending as the country develops an economic reform plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As far as the growth markets are concerned, we will be dealing with the China impact for another couple of quarters," Loughridge said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue dropped 4 percent to $23.7 billion, below Wall Street analysts' expectations of $24.74 billion, mainly due to the decline in its hardware division, excluding its System z mainframe servers, and in emerging markets, which were down 9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardware revenue was down 17 percent, while System z mainframe revenue rose 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quarterly net income rose 6 percent to $4.0 billion, or $3.99 a share on a non-GAAP basis from $3.62 a year earlier, above estimates of $3.96 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The revenue drop was worse than investors expected, RBC Capital analyst Amit Daryanani said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson agreed, saying it was a disappointing quarter from a revenue standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that the hardware business is going to be something they need to work through, and growth markets are down much more than expected," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olson added that the services backlog was healthy, but "we are not seeing the conversion of that backlog into meaningful revenue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company reiterated its full year outlook of non-GAAP EPS of at least $16.25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But ISI Group analyst Brian Marshall said there was concern that IBM's days of double-digit EPS growth are nearing an end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Increasingly, we believe IBM has been relying on non-operating, inorganic drivers of EPS growth," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked on the call if investors should prepare for no revenue growth and less than double-digit earnings growth in the future, Loughridge promised "stronger operational performance as we go into 2014."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's hardware business should return to profit growth in the second half and stabilize profit on a year to year basis for the year, he said. Emerging markets would return to mid-single-digit performance for the 2014 full-year especially after the implementation of China's new economic plans, he added, without specifying the measure of performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about the impact of the U.S. federal government shutdown, Loughridge said that there would not be much of an impact to the company if the issue is resolved this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If this extends into December, then it's going to get to be a meaningful number, say around a nickel, that we would probably not be able to contain," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. federal government business was a little less than 3 percent of the total revenue mix, Loughridge said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Nicola Leske; Editing by Leslie Gevirtz and Cynthia Osterman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Shares down 6 percent in after-hours trade&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Hardware division also blamed for revenue decline&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Nicola Leske&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oct 16 (Reuters) - IBM reported a 4 percent drop in

difficult for the world's largest technology service provider
but added the company faced some particular challenges this
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profitability in its hardware business declined by $1

Loughridge said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue dropped 4 percent to $23.7 billion, below Wall

the decline in its hardware division, excluding its System z
mainframe servers, and in emerging markets, which were down 9

I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The revenue drop was worse than investors expected, RBC

disappointing quarter from a revenue standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that the hardware business is going to be something
they need to work through, and growth markets are down much more
than expected," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olson added that the services backlog was healthy, but "we

&lt;p&gt;Last year, Salesforce&#160;acquired Buddy Media&#160;for $689 million to become a marketing powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Social Touch hopes to emulate Buddy Media&#8217;s success in China &#8212; and just snagged more than $10 million to help brands like Proctor &amp; Gamble, Dell, and Coca-Cola get their message out on China&#8217;s social networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2011, Social Touch offers a social media suite that enables enterprises to launch and manage their marketing efforts across Chinese social networks like Sina Weibo, Wechat, and Renren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Think of Social Touch as the Buddy Media of China with a huge potential to impact the growing Chinese market,&#8221; said a Social Touch representative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has around 100 large enterprise customers &#8212; including&#160;Proctor &amp; Gamble, Dell, and Coca-Cola &#8212; and recently launched a management suite called &#8220;PinQu&#8221; targeted at small to medium-sized enterprises. That service has already racked up &#8220;thousands&#8221; of paying customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China has plenty of traditional ad agencies, but Social Touch is the only sizable software-as-a-service offering in the country that provides customers with monitoring and analytics capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, &#8220;Social Touch is by far the largest social media marketing software platform [in China],&#8221; said Ben Yu, managing director of Sierra Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley-based Sierra Ventures led this latest funding round in Social Touch. Legend Capital and GCV Capital also participated.&#160;Social Touch will use the funds for product development and customer acquisition, according to Yu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social Touch has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

percent higher on Wednesday after Senate leaders said they had a
deal to reopen the federal government and raise the debt
ceiling, which would avoid the threat of a debt default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Republican
leader Mitch McConnell said senators had come to an agreement
that will reopen the government through Jan. 15 and raise the
debt ceiling until Feb. 7. The House of Representatives planned
to vote on the measure later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day's gains brought the S 500 within a few points of
its all-time closing high of 1,725.52 on Sept. 18. Volume has
been below average, however, as many investors stayed on the
sidelines until a resolution of the fiscal issues was official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks like we'll get through this, which brings the
market a bit of a reprieve. Not only is this a relief rally, but
we're still in an environment with a very accommodative monetary
policy, which provides a tailwind," said Judy Moses, portfolio
manager at Evercore Wealth Management in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gains were broad, with all 10 S 500 sectors solidly
higher, led by financial stocks, which rose 2.1 percent.
Other groups tied to the pace of economic growth, including
energy, also jumped. Crude oil rose 1 percent
while gold was essentially flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another sign of easing concerns, the CBOE Volatility
index sank 21 percent in its biggest daily drop since
Aug. 2011. However, the index remains up about 12 percent over
the past four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 78 percent of stocks traded on the New York Stock
Exchange ended higher while 69 percent of Nasdaq-listed shares
closed up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the market closed, IBM reported earnings that
beat expectations but revenue below consensus, sending shares
down 6 percent to $175.56. Online auction site eBay Inc 
fell 4.5 percent to $51.10 after a disappointing sales forecast
for the holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Express Co reported a 9.3 percent rise in
earnings after the bell on Wednesday, but shares were flat in
extended trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average was up 205.82

The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 45.42 points, or 1.20
percent, at 3,839.43.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the issues in Washington continued to be the market's
primary driver, analysts said the focus would likely turn to the
 third-quarter earnings season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In general, revenue growth has been challenged, and
especially in technology shares there's been low revenue
growth," said Moses, who helps oversee $4.7 billion in assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With 11 percent of S 500 companies having reported, about
57 percent have topped profit expectations, below the historical
average of 63 percent. The number of companies topping revenue
forecasts has also been below the historical average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors will be closely watching for any sign that the
government shutdown and debt ceiling impasse had a negative
impact on results or forecasts. David Joy, who oversees about
$703 billion in assets as chief market strategist at Ameriprise

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The London Whale is the gift that keeps giving for regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co has agreed to pay the latest in a string of fines for the disastrous trades and admit wrongdoing, this time in a settlement with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank agreed to pay $100 million and admit its traders acted recklessly, the CFTC said on Wednesday. The bank was instructed to send the funds to accounts receivable at the CFTC's division of enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement follows one month after it paid $920 million to four other U.S. and British regulators to resolve probes of the bank's $6.2 billion in derivative losses involving its chief investment office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The episode has proven to be one that just about every regulator the bank deals with has wanted to investigate and levy fines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department, even after filing criminal charges against two former JPMorgan traders who allegedly helped conceal the losses, is still investigating whether to bring any action against the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are pleased to be able to put behind us another aspect of the CIO (chief investment office) trading matter by the resolution of the CFTC investigation," JPMorgan spokesman Joseph Evangelisti said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement with the CFTC comes as JPMorgan continues to deal with regulators and U.S. authorities on a number of fronts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is the middle of trying to negotiate a global settlement with federal prosecutors over its role in the packaging and selling of faulty mortgage-backed securities that could result in a potential $11 billion settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, JPMorgan announced it has set aside up to $23 billion in reserves to pay for all its potential legal bills to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CFTC, in its case, charged the bank with violating a prohibition on manipulative conduct when it traded in the credit default swaps that the bank had built an outsized exposure to by early 2012 and then needed to quickly exit to try to minimize the losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By selling a huge volume of swaps in a concentrated period, the bank's traders "recklessly disregarded" the principle that legitimate market forces should set prices, the CFTC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan traders acted recklessly with respect to this fundamental precept by employing an aggressive trading strategy," the CFTC said in a portion of the settlement to which the bank admitted to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reckless conduct occurred on one day, February 29, 2012, according to the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Republican commissioner, Scott O'Malia, voted against the settlement and said he thought the CFTC should have further investigated whether JPMorgan engaged in a more serious violation of price manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am concerned that in a rush to join in on a settlement brokered by other regulators, the Commission may be missing the opportunity to pursue allegations of greater wrongdoing," O'Malia said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By charging the bank with "employing a manipulative device," the agency relied on new powers granted it by the 2010 Dodd Frank financial regulatory overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency previously had to prove a defendant intended to engage in manipulate conduct, a bar so high that the commission was able to bring few cases under it. The new authority, introduced by Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell, allows the CFTC to rely on evidence of "reckless" misconduct rather than any specific intent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CFTC case against JPMorgan "is exactly what were looking for" in providing the new authority, Cantwell said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think it really does create a bright line in the marketplace," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the CFTC charges, a JPMorgan portfolio in credit default indices with a net value of more than $51 billion started to plummet in January 2012. In February, as daily losses were large and growing, the traders tried to reduce their mark-to-market losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief investment office had a $65 billion short position on one index, CDX NA.IG9 10 year index, and on February 29, sold $7 billion in protection on it. The sales substantially dropped the market price of the index and improved the book value of the group's position, the CFTC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two former bank employees have already been criminally charged with trying to hide some of the losses by deliberately giving inaccurate values to the securities involved in the trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CFTC has been operating on a skeleton staff since the October 1 government shutdown, and called some employees in on Wednesday on an "emergency basis" to announce the settlement, Commissioner Bart Chilton said on CNBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Aruna Viswanatha and Emily Stephenson in Washington, and David Henry in New York; Editing by Andrew Hay, Matthew Goldstein and Cynthia Osterman)&lt;/p&gt;

against two former JPMorgan traders who allegedly helped conceal
the losses, is still investigating whether to bring any action
against the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are pleased to be able to put behind us another aspect

quarterly net income rose 6 percent to $4.0 billion, or $3.99 a
share on a non-GAAP basis from $3.62 a year earlier, above 
estimates of $3.96 a share, according to Thomson Reuters
I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue dropped 4 percent to $23.7 billion below average

		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM (NYSE:IBM) today announced third-quarter 2013 diluted earnings of 
      $3.68 per share, compared with diluted earnings of $3.33 per share in 
      the third-quarter of 2012, an increase of 11 percent. Operating 
      (non-GAAP) diluted earnings were $3.99 per share compared with operating 
      diluted earnings of $3.62 per share in the third-quarter of 2012, an 
      increase of 10 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Third-quarter net income was $4.0 billion compared with $3.8 billion in 
      the third-quarter of 2012, an increase of 6 percent. Operating 
      (non-GAAP) net income was $4.4 billion, as compared with $4.2 billion in 
      the third-quarter of 2012, an increase of 6 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total revenues for the third-quarter of 2013 of $23.7 billion were down 
      4 percent (down 2 percent, adjusting for currency) from the 
      third-quarter of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In the third-quarter we continued to expand operating margins and 
      increased earnings per share, but fell short on revenue. Where we had 
      identified high growth opportunities and pursued them aggressively --- 
      cloud, mobile, business analytics, and security --- we continued to show 
      strong growth. This underscores our strategy to continuously transform 
      the company to high value,&#8221; said Ginni Rometty, IBM chairman, president 
      and chief executive officer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are taking action to improve execution in our growth markets unit 
      and in the elements of our hardware businesses that are under 
      performing. Given these actions, our strategic initiatives and the 
      strength of our model, we are maintaining our view for the full year and 
      remain confident in our ability to achieve at least $20 operating EPS in 
      2015.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Third-Quarter GAAP &#8211; Operating (non-GAAP) Reconciliation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Third-quarter operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings exclude $0.31 per 
      share of charges: $0.15 per share for the amortization of purchased 
      intangible assets and other acquisition-related charges, and $0.16 per 
      share for retirement-related charges driven by changes to plan assets 
      and liabilities primarily related to market performance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Full-Year 2013 Expectations
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company expects full-year 2013 GAAP diluted earnings per share of at 
      least $15.01. Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share 
      expectations remain at least $16.25; and at least $16.90, excluding the 
      second-quarter workforce rebalancing charge of $1.0 billion. Operating 
      (non-GAAP) diluted earnings expectations exclude $1.24 per share of 
      charges for amortization of purchased intangible assets, other 
      acquisition-related charges, and retirement-related charges.

      Financing debt totaled $25.8 billion versus $24.5 billion at year-end 
      2012, resulting in a debt-to-equity ratio of 7.1 to 1. Non-global 
      financing debt totaled $10.4 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion since 
      year-end 2012, resulting in a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 38.7 
      percent from 36.1 percent. On a year-over-year basis, debt increased 
      $2.5 billion, primarily driven by Global Financing debt.

      Research and Markets: IT Market in Lebanon 2012-2016 Featuring HP, IBM, 
      Microsoft  Oracle
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/fm8mvh/it_market_in) 
      has announced the addition of the "IT 
      Market in Lebanon 2012-2016" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysts forecast the IT market in Lebanon to grow at a CAGR of 8.8 
      percent over the period 2012-2016. One of the key factors contributing 
      to this market growth is the increasing support received from the 
      Lebanese government. The IT market in Lebanon has also been witnessing 
      the increasing adoption of internet in the country. However, the 
      increasing piracy issues faced by the Software segment could pose a 
      challenge to the growth of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cloud computing is a technology that is used for maintaining data and 
      applications with the help of central remote servers. It enables 
      consumers and businesses to use applications without installation and 
      access their personal files from any computer. The benefits of cloud 
      computing include the pay-per-use model, reduced spending on technology 
      infrastructure, and reduced licensing fees for new software packages. In 
      Lebanon, many sectors have started using cloud services as they do not 
      want to invest much in IT infrastructure such as hardware and software. 
      In addition, organizations would like to take advantage of paying per 
      use. Organizations will also require a fewer number of people to manage 
      their IT environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers is the increase in 
      government support for improving the IT infrastructure of the country. 
      The government has introduced a number of initiatives that are 
      positively impacting the IT market in Lebanon. For instance, the 
      government has increased its spending on internal infrastructure such as 
      data centers and fixed wireless deployments such as Wi-Fi, WiMAX, and 
      broadband networks.

			CompuCom Announces Its Involvement in the Microsoft Devices Program
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today CompuCom, a leading technology infrastructure services 
      company, announced its participation in the Microsoft Devices Program, 
      empowering the organization to resell Surface Pro and Surface RT to 
      commercial customers. The goal of the Microsoft Devices Program is to 
      serve customers by activating Microsoft&#8217;s channel of partners to resell

      boardroom.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      Officer at CompuCom. &#8220;As one of the largest providers of 
      Microsoft-related solutions in the U.S., this is not only an exciting 
      opportunity to expand our portfolio to include one of Microsoft&#8217;s most 
      anticipated products, but it also enables us to continue to be a single 
      source for all of our clients&#8217; Microsoft software and hardware needs.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Bringing Surface Pro and Surface RT to the U.S. commercial channel 
      greatly extends the reach of our devices-and-services strategy, 
      delivering our family of devices enabled by cloud services to more 
      organizations than ever before,&#8221; said Jenni Flinders, Vice President 
      U.S. Partner Group for Microsoft Corp. &#8220;We look forward to working 
      closely with our Microsoft Devices Program partners to better serve 
      their customers and create compelling solutions together.&#8221;

			Managed Care Advisory Group, LLC: Visa/MasterCard Settlement Offers 
      Cash to Millions of U.S. Merchants
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Ohio Company Helps Merchants File Claims into Complex Settlement
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Over the past month, the Payment Card Interchange Fee Settlement has 
      drawn considerable attention among U. S. merchants. (In re Payment Card 
      Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation | MDL No. 
      1720). Since the opportunity is almost unprecedented, there is 
      considerable confusion and misinformation regarding the settlement, its 
      terms and provisions designed to provide cash and various forms of 
      relief to merchants. Although final approval of the settlement is still 
      pending, there is no better time than the present for merchants to 
      educate themselves about the opportunity and their options.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Payment Card Settlement arises from allegations that merchants paid 
      excessive fees (interchange fees) for accepting Visa and MasterCard 
      because of an alleged conspiracy among the Defendants. It also alleges 
      that merchants had to follow unfair rules that limited their ability to 
      steer customers to other payment methods. The Settlement originally 
      provided $7.25 Billion in relief for merchants, but the amount was 
      reduced after a group of large merchants opted out of the fund in May. 
      The Settlement still has funds totaling nearly $6 billion for merchants, 
      before legal and administrative expenses are withdrawn. The Settlement 
      was designed to provide cash and other relief for all merchants that 
      accepted Visa and MasterCard purchases between January 1, 2004 and 
      November 28, 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Merchants can file a basic claim on their own and receive a cash award 
      based on an estimate of their sales and fee volume for a nine-year 
      period. The estimate will be provided by the Settlement Administrator 
      based on data they have accumulated from VISA and other sources. 
      However, if a merchant wants to file an accurate and timely claim 
      supported by actual historical sales and fee volume, it can be a tedious 
      and complex process. Most merchants had various Merchant IDs and 
      probably used multiple card processing companies over the last decade, 
      making it very difficult, if not impossible, to consolidate and collect 
      accurate data for the majority of the claims period.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      An Ohio company, Managed Care Advisory Group, LLC (MCAG), www.mcagvmc.com, 
      has contracted with more than 20 of the top 50 payment card processors, 
      and over 100 ISO&#8217;s and Agents, in order to provide assistance to 
      merchants who want to file a claim using their actual historical 
      financial data. Since using real data is the only proven method that is 
      valid and effective for increasing recoveries, MCAG has spent over a 
      year building a vast data set, including current and historical data for 
      an estimated 40% of all active merchants.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Relying on over a decade of class action settlement filing experience, 
      MCAG maintains an intricate knowledge of the Settlement documents and 
      the claims filing process required to maximize their clients&#8217; cash 
      returns. In recent settlements, MCAG increased their clients&#8217; cash 
      awards by an average of 52% over the default or estimated award that 
      would have otherwise been provided by the settlement administrator. MCAG 
      clients received a cash award that averaged 44% more than other class 
      members who filed claims into these settlements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Tim Schmidt, CEO, explains, &#8220;MCAG uses actual merchant data when 
      negotiating a claim; we don&#8217;t rely on guesswork or estimates. In order 
      to submit a timely and complete claim that is supported by actual data, 
      MCAG triangulates the current, historical and settlement provided data, 
      wherever possible, for each of its merchant clients. Many other 
      competing service companies simply accept the Settlement Administrator&#8217;s 
      estimate, or plan on trying to obtain data after the claim period has 
      opened, leaving little or no time to contest a claim or to ensure that 
      an accurate and comprehensive claim is submitted for merchants. MCAG&#8217;s 
      technology and access to data is unique and unprecedented in the 
      marketplace. The goal is to maximize our client&#8217;s cash return from these 
      settlement funds.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MCAG specializes in assisting merchants of all sizes and complexities. 
      Their Settlement Recovery Service is performed on a contingent fee basis 
      &#8211; if there is no recovery, there will be no fee. Merchants that process 
      with one of MCAG&#8217;s many partners may be offered a substantially 
      discounted fee.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      It is strongly recommended that merchants take the time to educate 
      themselves about this historic opportunity. For those interested in 
      assistance in maximizing the cash award from these funds, more 
      information about MCAG and its Settlement Recovery Service can be found 
      by visiting mcagvmc.com.

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has picked up support since naming Hindu nationalist Narendra Modi as its candidate for prime minister last month, but would need new allies to form the next government, an opinion poll showed on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi, three times chief minister of the coastal state of Gujarat, was put forward by India's main opposition party in August, cementing the rise of a leader who many think is capable of turning round India's economy but who remains tainted by deadly religious riots that broke out on his watch in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling Congress party has led a coalition government for nearly a decade but is headed for its worst electoral performance since at least 1999 as it battles allegations of corruption, the survey showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey, conducted by pollsters Team Cvoter for two television networks, forecasts the BJP will pick up 162 seats. The last Cvoter survey conducted in August, before Modi was named, forecast the party would get 130 seats, up from the 116 it holds now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Congress tally would drop to 102 seats from the 206 it now holds in the 545-member lower house of parliament if voting in the election were to reflect the poll, conducted for the India TV and Times Now networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A coalition led by the BJP is expected to win 186 seats, meaning the BJP would have to find new allies among regional parties if it were to form a government. To rule, a party needs the support of 272 members of parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BJP and Congress are India's largest national parties but political power has shifted in recent years to smaller regional or state-level parties, making them kingmakers during coalition building and giving them more influence over policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modi is credited with helping Gujarat's economy achieve average yearly growth in the double digits in the past decade and he is popular among many wealthy businessmen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he remains a polarizing figure even within his own party and some analysts believe he would struggle to cobble together a coalition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A federal government beholden to regional parties with their own diverse agendas could be fragile and unwieldy, making it harder for any government to manage Asia's third-largest economy, whose growth rate has already slowed to a decade low after a period of policy paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest democracy is due to hold its largest ever general election by May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elections are notoriously hard to predict in India, which has very complex demographics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cvoter study was based on a national sample of 24,284 randomly selected respondents. The data was collected between August 16 and October 15 - the period four weeks before and four weeks after Modi was declared as the BJP's candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Malini Menon; writing by Frank Jack Daniel; editing by Tom Pfeiffer)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSTON, Oct. 16, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- National Tay-Sachs  Allied Diseases Association (NTSAD) today announced that it is forming the Jacob's Cure Fund to support research and family services in Canavan disease. NTSAD will continue and expand the work of Jacob's Cure, a non-profit that has funded research for Canavan disease and plans to close this month. Tay-Sachs and Canavan are among a group of about 90 rare inherited diseases that cause neurological impairment, are often life limiting, and have been NTSAD's focus for more than fifty years. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Canavan disease is a leukodystrophy, a group of disorders characterized by degeneration of the white matter in the brain. Tay-Sachs is a lysosomal storage disease caused by an enzyme deficiency.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Founded 13 years ago by Jordana Holovach to fund Canavan Disease research after her son, Jacob, was diagnosed with the disease, Jacob's Cure has raised $10 million to fund medical research in the hope of finding a cure for the progressive neurodegenerative disease. The gene therapy and stem cell research funded by Jacob's Cure may lead to treatments for other "white matter" neurological diseases, including Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis and ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"We chose NTSAD, the nation's oldest patient advocacy group, in order to consolidate our efforts to find a treatment or cure for this group of debilitating and often devastating diseases," Holovach said. "NTSAD's family support services are also second to none and have earned NTSAD a great deal of respect in the rare disease community."&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Jacob's Cure will continue its legacy as an NTSAD fund, and Ms. Holovach will join the NTSAD Board as an honorary member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Jacob's Cure has contributed immeasurably to the advance of new approaches to treat Canavan Disease, and we are honored to carry their mission into the future," said Shari Ungerleider, President of NTSAD. "The diseases are different, but the path is similar both in research and for the families affected, and collectively, our strength is multiplied."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			About National Tay-Sachs  Allied Diseases Association (NTSAD)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	NTSAD leads the fight to treat and cure Tay-Sachs, Canavan and related genetic diseases while supporting affected families and individuals to foster quality of life.&#160;Founded in 1957, NTSAD was a pioneer in the development of community education about Tay-Sachs disease, carrier screening programs, and laboratory quality control programs. Today more than two million people have been screened for Tay-Sachs disease. Numerous Tay-Sachs carriers have been identified and thousands of healthy children have been born to high-risk couples. NTSAD was also instrumental in developing Canavan disease carrier screening guidelines and advocating having Canavan screening recommended in medical guidelines [American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), 1998].&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      deliver unique product experiences tied to the hottest properties on

      opportunity to wear styles inspired by favorite characters at a retailer

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The passion and enthusiasm our viewers have for our series and iconic 
      characters is only matched by their passion for the trendsetting fashion 
      of our shows,&#8221; said Kate Juergens, Executive Vice President, Original

      &#8220;Fans are always asking &#8211;&#8216;how can I get &#8216;that&#8217; look?&#8217; and I&#8217;m so happy

      enables us to further extend the connection our fans have with their 
      favorite characters.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The first collection this fall will feature fashions inspired by 
      characters from ABC Family&#8217;s sizzling dramas &#8220;The Fosters,&#8221; &#8220;Twisted&#8221; 
      and &#8220;Switched at Birth&#8221; and its hit comedy series, &#8220;Baby Daddy.&#8221; &#8220;The 
      Fosters,&#8221; &#8220;Baby Daddy,&#8221; and &#8220;Switched at Birth&#8221; have launched as the #1 
      new cable television/cable comedy series for the past three summers, 
      respectively. Each of the items in the collection is designed 
      specifically based on a character&#8217;s personality and individual style:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        ABC Family&#8217;s breakout hit The Fosters, which was the summer&#8217;s 
        #1 new cable television series with women 12-341, is 
        represented in the collection through looks inspired by Callie (played 
        by Maia Mitchell), a tough girl with a tender heart.

        
					
            Callie influences the collection with casual, easy styles that 
            have a boho flair. Her collection is threaded in earthy colors and 
            bohemian influenced patterns, as well as classic silhouettes that 
            reflect hope and optimism as she is embraced in the Foster family.
          
				
			
			
        Inspired by the eclectic style and fierce independence of Switched 
        at Birth&#8217;s street-artist Bay (played by Vanessa Marano), key 
        pieces of the collection are grounded in a darker palette with a mix 
        of edgy styles and silhouettes.

        
					
            A passionate romantic often caught in love triangles, Bay is 
            embodied in this collection, which is layered with dark romantic 
            prints and graphics. Her rebellious nature influences the 
            structure of moto-style jackets worn with brocade print dresses 
            and maxi skirts.
          
				
			
			
        In Twisted, the popular and sophisticated Lacey (played by 
        Kylie Bunbury) is the recognized fashionista of the show, inspiring 
        new silhouettes and fabrications to classic feminine dressing.

        
					
            Lacey&#8217;s determination to always be perfect and maintain her 
            hard-earned social stature is represented in the pairing of 
            graphic tops with sleek pencil skirts. Lace insets and unexpected 
            embellishments add a unique twist to these classic feminine looks.
          
				
			
			
        The classic girl-next-door from hit comedy Baby Daddy, Riley 
        (played by Chelsea Kane) brings pretty and feminine style to this 
        collection.

        
					
            Through modern florals and prints, paired with clean, casual 
            silhouettes, pieces are inspired by her fun-loving attitude but 
            ambitious legal mind. Flirty skirts, dresses and skinny denim 
            paired with floaty tops and cardigans reveal Riley as a romantic 
            at heart.
          
				
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This is a very innovative collaboration unlike anything Wet Seal has 
      done in the past. The team has worked to craft fashions and marketing 
      programs that will drive exciting buzz around two very well-known 
      brands,&#8221; said John D. Goodman, chief executive officer of The Wet Seal 
      Inc. &#8220;We know that the &#8216;Crush by ABC Family&#8217; collection will directly 
      appeal to our customer, as she will now have access to the closets of 
      her favorite ABC Family characters.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wet Seal will support the launch with creative windows and in-store 
      displays, a national print and digital media campaign, and an extensive 
      social media program that includes a variety of contests hosted on the 
      brand&#8217;s social platforms. The first contest is live now and offers fans 
      a chance to win a trip to Los Angeles, CA and experience a runway 
      fashion show to view the &#8216;Crush by ABC Family&#8217; collection, modeled by

      long-time DCP licensee, Jerry Leigh, in collaboration with ABC Family 
      stylists and DCP product development teams. The collection will offer a 
      variety of apparel and accessory items ranging from $9.90 to $32.90.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Baby Daddy" follows Ben, a young man in his early 20s living the life 
      of a bachelor as a bartender in New York City with his buddy, Tucker, 
      and his brother, Danny, a professional hockey player. Their lives are 
      turned upside down when they come home one day to find a baby girl left 
      on the doorstep by an ex-girlfriend of Ben's. After much deliberation, 
      Ben decides to raise the baby with the help of his friends and his 
      protective and sometimes over-bearing mother, Bonnie, and his close 
      female friend, Riley, who has had a secret crush on him since childhood. 
      Riley is hopeful that Ben will finally take notice, but she doesn't 
      realize that Ben's brother, Danny, is harboring a secret crush on her.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The series, which launched as the network's #1 comedy series in ABC 
      Family history, stars Jean-Luc Bilodeau ("Kyle XY"), Derek Theler 
      ("90210") and Tahj Mowry ("The Game"), along with Melissa Peterman 
      ("Reba") and Chelsea Kane ("Dancing with the Stars," "Jonas LA"). "Baby 
      Daddy" is created and executive produced by Dan Berendsen ("The Nine 
      Lives of Chloe King," "Sabrina, the Teenage Witch" and "Hannah Montana: 
      The Movie"). The multi-camera comedy shoots in front of a live studio 
      audience in Los Angeles.

      Winner of 2013 Teen Choice Awards for Choice TV Breakout 
      Show,&#160;&#8220;The&#160;Fosters&#8221; is a compelling, one-hour drama about a multi-ethnic 
      family mix of&#160;foster and biological kids being raised by two moms.&#160;Stef 
      Foster, a&#160;dedicated&#160;police officer, and her partner Lena&#160;Adams, a school 
      Vice Principal, have&#160;built a close-knit, loving family with Stef&#8217;s 
      biological son from a previous&#160;marriage, Brandon, and their adopted 
      twins Mariana and Jesus. Their lives are disrupted in unexpected&#160;ways 
      when&#160;Lena meets Callie, a hardened teen with an abusive&#160;past who has 
      spent her life in and out of foster homes. Lena and Stef warily&#160;welcome 
      Callie, along with her younger brother Jude, into their&#160;home thinking 
      it&#8217;s just for a few weeks, until a more&#160;permanent placement can be found.

		&lt;p&gt;
      In &#8220;Switched at Birth,&#8221; two families are forever altered when they 
      discover their daughters were switched at birth. Life hasn&#8217;t been easy 
      for hard-working, single mom Regina Vasquez, but along with her mother, 
      Adriana, Regina has provided her daughter Daphne, a typical teenager who 
      just happens to be deaf, with a loving and secure home. Although she 
      attends a school for the deaf and hard-of-hearing with best friend 
      Emmett, Daphne&#8217;s hearing loss does not prevent her from leading a full 
      life. In sharp contrast to the Vasquezes, Kathryn, a stay-at-home mom 
      and John Kennish, a state senator, lead a seemingly perfect life with 
      their two children, Bay and Toby. But when the Kennishes&#8217; learn the 
      hospital made a grievous error and Bay is not their biological child, 
      their entire world is turned upside down. Regina, Kathryn and John must 
      learn to co-exist as parents, and blend two families into one for the 
      sake of their daughters, despite overwhelming socio-economic, ethnic and 
      cultural differences. The award-winning series is the first mainstream 
      television series to have multiple deaf and hard-of-hearing series 
      regulars, and scenes shot entirely in American Sign Language (ASL). A 
      ground-breaking all-ASL episode aired in March.

      &#8220;Twisted&#8221; is a one-hour mystery full of twists and turns that follows 
      Danny Desai, a charismatic 16-year-old with a troubled past who returns 
      to his hometown after spending five years in juvenile detention. 
      Immediately branded an outcast, Danny attempts to reconnect with his two 
      childhood best friends, Jo and Lacey, and smooth over tensions with his 
      mother, Karen, whose socialite status plummeted after her son&#8217;s 
      imprisonment and the mysterious disappearance of her husband, Danny&#8217;s 
      father.&#160;When a fellow student is found dead in her home, Danny instantly 
      becomes the prime suspect and the town spirals into a frenzy of 
      suspicion and mystery. Jo and Lacey must decide if their childhood 
      friend is unforgivable, or if he&#8217;s really a victim being persecuted for 
      his own twisted secrets.

			Wells Fargo, J.P. Morgan, Citibank Ranked Most 
      Improved Reputations Among Financial Services Companies, According to

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Corporate Reputations See Traction After Financial Crisis Five Years 
      Ago
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Makovsky, a leading independent integrated communications firm, today 
      released its 2013 Most Improved Reputation List which ranks the 
      financial services companies with the most improved reputations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This most improved reputation list is part of the 2013 Makovsky Wall 
      Street Reputation Study designed to determine the current state of the 
      financial industry&#8217;s reputation and identify best practices and emerging 
      trends. It was conducted by Echo Research among marketing, 
      communications and investors relations executives at large and mid-sized 
      financial services firms.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The 2013 Makovsky Most Improved Reputation List*:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      1. Wells Fargo2. J.P. Morgan3. Citibank4. Bank of 
      America5. AIG6. American Express7. Merrill Lynch8. 
      Goldman Sachs9. Barclays
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      *Respondents asked, &#8220;Thinking about corporate reputation, what one 
      financial services company has improved the most in the past 12 months?&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It appears that corporate reputation in the financial services industry 
      is on a comeback, but it is a slow, fragile and sometimes dicey 
      recovery,&#8221; said Scott Tangney, executive vice president at Makovsky. Our 
      study indicates a very long road to strong reputation remains and the 
      risk of recurring government actions and fines as well as other negative 
      news will impede the entire industry&#8217;s image restoration.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Makovsky unveiled the 2013 Most Improved Reputation List at a recent 
      Financial Communications Society event in Manhattan where a panel of top 
      communications executives for leading financial services brands -- 
      including AIG, UBS, Wells Fargo and The Hartford -- provided insight and 
      personal experiences in their work to rebuild the reputations of their 
      company and industry. Some of the key takeaways include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        When thinking about rebuilding damaged reputations, the panelists 
        concurred that there are no shortcuts. Much of the damage from the 
        financial crisis remains, and it's going to take a long time for the 
        industry to completely heal.
      
			
        Winning back the industry&#8217;s overall reputation has been hampered by a 
        number of regulatory and legal hurdles.
      
			
        Regulations have evolved and, in many cases, become more cumbersome 
        and are actually seen as a burden by consumers, (i.e. the request for 
        more documentation or information that had never been collected 
        before).
      
			
        Many companies have tailored their lines of business to go back to the 
        basics, focus on core strengths and reduce risk, which has help them 
        rebuild reputation.
      
			
        Financial firms will continue to attempt to differentiate themselves 
        from other companies that have problems, but companies understand that 
        when one firm has a big reputation problem it's usually a problem for 
        everyone.
      
			
        Internal communications is increasingly critical. Financial firms&#8217; 
        employees must not only understand strategies, but they must be able 
        to believe in them and be able to speak to them. The industry as a 
        whole is spending a great deal of time building internal ambassadors 
        who have a strong understanding of brand and strategy before taking 
        messages out to the general public.
      
			
        Social media has become closely tied to business initiatives at 
        financial services firms and an important tool in rehabilitating 
        reputations, as it allows financial firms to communicate with 
        customers in ways that customers enjoy.
      
			
        Financial firms will be making greater use of communications platforms 
        like Twitter and Facebook to directly engage with consumers. And they 
        are conducting more, and deeper, monitoring of social media sites to 
        better gauge public impressions of programs.

			Research Methodology
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In May 2013 Echo Research completed 151 interviews with executives and 
      managers responsible for the management and supervision of 
      communications, investor relations or marketing at large and mid-sized 
      publicly traded and private financial services institutions. The type of 
      companies surveyed included banks, brokerage firms, asset management 
      firms, insurance companies, real estate companies, credit card 
      companies, mortgage lenders, venture capital firms, credit unions and 
      financial technology firms. The study has a margin of error of +/- 8.0% 
      at a 95% confidence level.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) bond-trading revenue plunged in the third quarter, and the bank slashed employee compensation costs by 35 percent - an unusual step that signals its concern about performance for the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from trading fixed-income, currency and commodity products for clients, one of the bank's biggest businesses, tumbled 47 percent in the quarter, excluding an accounting adjustment, Goldman said on Thursday. That was a much sharper decline than rivals have posted, which sources said was dispiriting to some employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's shares fell 2.4 percent to close at $158.32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman showed that they are also mortal," said Michael Holland, founder of Holland &amp; Co, which owns financial stocks but does not own Goldman shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Client trading volume dropped across Wall Street as the Federal Reserve said it would refrain from changing its bond-buying stimulus policy, giving investors less reason to trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman Sachs was hit harder than peers because it has a big mortgage-bond trading business, which was strong a year ago but particularly weak last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also has a good deal of institutional clients such as hedge funds that trade frequently - often on economic data that were not being released during the government shutdown. That factor hurt the bank late in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter as well, while rivals including Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) can rely on a broader array of clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We just had a tough quarter," Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said on a conference call with analysts. Management is "not happy with" the bank's performance, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While rival Morgan Stanley (MS.N) has been building up its brokerage unit - sometimes painfully - to reduce its reliance on areas such as trading, Goldman has been resolutely sticking to its traditional businesses, focusing on advising companies, underwriting and trading securities, and managing assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors seemed less worried on Thursday about Morgan Stanley, which reports earnings on Friday. Its shares rose 1 percent amid a broader market rally to close at $28.93.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third quarter may have been lackluster for Goldman, but its executives said it has no plans to change its strategy to be more diversified like its rivals JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) or Morgan Stanley. Regulators are reluctant to allow big banks to get bigger through acquisitions now, and until regulators write more rules, it is not clear how different businesses will perform in the post-crisis world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman responded to the weaker revenue by setting aside less money to pay employees during the quarter - $2.38 billion, compared with $3.68 billion in the same quarter last year. The 35 percent decline is high compared with competitors. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's investment bank cut its third-quarter compensation expense by 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's compensation costs amounted to 35 percent of its revenue in the quarter. The bank's target is usually closer to 43 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank sometimes cuts the money it sets aside for pay in a quarter, but it usually does so in the fourth quarter, when there is no hope of earning extra revenue for the year. Doing so in the third quarter signals that it does not expect a big rebound in the fourth quarter, a point Schwartz conceded on the conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One bright spot - Goldman set aside a fair amount for pay in the first half of the year, when net income was up about 35 percent over the year-earlier period. Even with the third quarter drop, total compensation costs for the first three quarters are only down 5 percent from the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the bank may always change the amount of money it sets aside later in the year, the third-quarter reduction will likely translate to lower bonuses for employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOWN HALL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the bank's analyst conference call on Thursday morning, Schwartz held a town hall meeting in which he, CEO Lloyd Blankfein and Dane Holmes, head of investor relations, spoke with managing directors about the firm's results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two managing directors told Reuters that employees in underperforming divisions were dispirited on Thursday - as the earnings report underscored that market conditions have been so difficult for so long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Layoffs are all too familiar to many at the bank. Goldman had been cutting jobs almost consistently since the end of 2010. The bank added 900 workers to its payroll in the third quarter, even as it cut the amount of money it set aside for compensation. But the drop in revenue and bleak outlook for the fourth quarter suggested job cuts might be on the table again, one Goldman trader said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if banks are not forced to cut staff, fixed-income, currency, and commodities trading bonuses could fall 10 to 15 percent this year across Wall Street, with many employees getting no bonus checks, pay consultant Alan Johnson estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Goldman reported net income for common shareholders of $1.43 billion, or $2.88 per share, down 2 percent from $1.46 billion, or $2.85 per share, a year earlier. Per-share earnings rose because of stock repurchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts had been expecting earnings of $2.43 per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Analysts had forecast higher revenue, and most of the better-than-expected performance came from cost-cutting and a lower tax rate, which are difficult trends to sustain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall revenue fell 20 percent to $6.72 billion. Excluding an accounting adjustment that investors often ignore, revenue from the bank's fixed income, currency and commodities business for clients fell to $1.29 billion, from $2.49 billion. Its revenue from investments in debt securities and loans fell 46 percent to $300 million from last year's third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BLAME IT ON WASHINGTON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank boosted its dividend for the third time in less than two years, to 55 cents per share quarterly from 50 cents. The dividend is a relatively small expenditure for the bank, but Goldman is usually loath to boost its payout if there are better opportunities for it to invest the money elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The third quarter's results reflected a period of slow client activity," Chief Executive Blankfein said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein laid some of the blame on the budget impasse in Washington, which made companies and investors hesitant to take risk.

    By Lauren Tara LaCapra
    Oct 17 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's 
bond-trading revenue plunged in the third quarter, and the bank
slashed employee compensation costs by 35 percent - an unusual
step that signals its concern about performance for the rest of
the year.
    Revenue from trading fixed-income, currency and commodity
products for clients, one of the bank's biggest businesses,
tumbled 47 percent in the quarter, excluding an accounting
adjustment, Goldman said on Thursday. That was a much sharper
decline than rivals have posted, which sources said was
dispiriting to some employees.
    Goldman's shares fell 2.4 percent to close at $158.32.
    "Goldman showed that they are also mortal," said Michael
Holland, founder of Holland &amp; Co, which owns financial stocks
but does not own Goldman shares.
    Client trading volume dropped across Wall Street as the
Federal Reserve said it would refrain from changing its
bond-buying stimulus policy, giving investors less reason to
trade. 
    But Goldman Sachs was hit harder than peers because it has a
big mortgage-bond trading business, which was strong a year ago
but particularly weak last quarter. 
    Goldman also has a good deal of institutional clients such
as hedge funds that trade frequently - often on economic data
that were not being released during the government shutdown.
That factor hurt the bank late in the third quarter and into the
fourth quarter as well, while rivals including Bank of America
Corp can rely on a broader array of clients.  
    "We just had a tough quarter," Chief Financial Officer
Harvey Schwartz said on a conference call with analysts.
Management is "not happy with" the bank's performance, he added.
    While rival Morgan Stanley has been building up its
brokerage unit - sometimes painfully - to reduce its reliance on
areas such as trading, Goldman has been resolutely sticking to
its traditional businesses, focusing on advising companies,
underwriting and trading securities, and managing assets.
    Investors seemed less worried on Thursday about Morgan
Stanley, which reports earnings on Friday. Its shares rose 1
percent amid a broader market rally to close at $28.93.    
    The third quarter may have been lackluster for Goldman, but
its executives said it has no plans to change its strategy to be
more diversified like its rivals JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co or
Morgan Stanley. Regulators are reluctant to allow big banks to
get bigger through acquisitions now, and until regulators write
more rules, it is not clear how different businesses will
perform in the post-crisis world. 
    Goldman responded to the weaker revenue by setting aside
less money to pay employees during the quarter - $2.38 billion,
compared with $3.68 billion in the same quarter last year. The
35 percent decline is high compared with competitors. JPMorgan
Chase &amp; Co's investment bank cut its third-quarter compensation
expense by 15 percent.
    Goldman's compensation costs amounted to 35 percent of its
revenue in the quarter. The bank's target is usually closer to
43 percent.
    The bank sometimes cuts the money it sets aside for pay in a
quarter, but it usually does so in the fourth quarter, when
there is no hope of earning extra revenue for the year. Doing so
in the third quarter signals that it does not expect a big
rebound in the fourth quarter, a point Schwartz conceded on the
conference call.
    One bright spot - Goldman set aside a fair amount for pay in
the first half of the year, when net income was up about 35
percent over the year-earlier period. Even with the third
quarter drop, total compensation costs for the first three
quarters are only down 5 percent from the same period last year.
  
    While the bank may always change the amount of money it sets
aside later in the year, the third-quarter reduction will likely
translate to lower bonuses for employees.
    
    TOWN HALL
    Ahead of the bank's analyst conference call on Thursday
morning, Schwartz held a town hall meeting in which he, CEO
Lloyd Blankfein and Dane Holmes, head of investor relations,
spoke with managing directors about the firm's results.
    Two managing directors told Reuters that employees in
underperforming divisions were dispirited on Thursday - as the
earnings report underscored that market conditions have been so
difficult for so long.  
    Layoffs are all too familiar to many at the bank. Goldman
had been cutting jobs almost consistently since the end of 2010.
The bank added 900 workers to its payroll in the third quarter,
even as it cut the amount of money it set aside for
compensation. But the drop in revenue and bleak outlook for the
fourth quarter suggested job cuts might be on the table again,
one Goldman trader said.
    Even if banks are not forced to cut staff, fixed-income,
currency, and commodities trading bonuses could fall 10 to 15
percent this year across Wall Street, with many employees
getting no bonus checks, pay consultant Alan Johnson estimates.
 
   
    Overall, Goldman reported net income for common shareholders
of $1.43 billion, or $2.88 per share, down 2 percent from $1.46
billion, or $2.85 per share, a year earlier. Per-share earnings
rose because of stock repurchases.
    Analysts had been expecting earnings of $2.43 per share, on
average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Analysts had
forecast higher revenue, and most of the better-than-expected
performance came from cost-cutting and a lower tax rate, which
are difficult trends to sustain.
    Overall revenue fell 20 percent to $6.72 billion. Excluding
an accounting adjustment that investors often ignore, revenue
from the bank's fixed income, currency and commodities business
for clients fell to $1.29 billion, from $2.49 billion. Its
revenue from investments in debt securities and loans fell 46
percent to $300 million from last year's third quarter.  
    
    BLAME IT ON WASHINGTON   
    The bank boosted its dividend for the third time in less
than two years, to 55 cents per share quarterly from 50 cents.
The dividend is a relatively small expenditure for the bank, but
Goldman is usually loath to boost its payout if there are better
opportunities for it to invest the money elsewhere.   
    "The third quarter's results reflected a period of slow
client activity," Chief Executive Blankfein said in a statement.
    Blankfein laid some of the blame on the budget impasse in
Washington, which made companies and investors hesitant to take
risk. Wall Street banks that reported earnings earlier in the
month, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Citigroup Inc and
Bank of America, also reported lower fixed-income trading
revenue, and said that uncertainty about the Federal Reserve's
plans for monetary easing had also hurt trading volumes.
    But declines at Citigroup and Bank of America were more in
the 20 percent range. Goldman said its mix of products and
clients, including its mortgage bond trading business and its
focus on institutional clients, was responsible for the bigger
drop.

      Fitch: Goldman 3Q13 Revenue Declines Buffered by Reduced Compensation
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Third quarter 2013 (3Q'13) net revenues for The Goldman Sachs Group, 
      Inc. (Goldman) were weaker than Fitch Ratings' expectations, driven by 
      significant declines in fixed income, currency and commodities trading 
      and investment banking. That said, Fitch views the firm's ability to 
      reduce compensation expenses to offset net revenue declines positively, 
      as it reflects the somewhat variable nature of the cost structure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman also continues to maintain conservative liquidity and capital, 
      and reported a higher estimated Basel III capital ratio this quarter. 
      These results have no rating implications on Goldman's 'A/F1' ratings or 
      Stable Outlook, although the ability to manage market risk in the 
      trading business through volatile market conditions will remain an 
      important rating consideration.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total revenues declined 22% sequentially, driven by the uncertain 
      macroeconomic environment surrounding interest rates and U.S. fiscal 
      policy, reduced client activity and seasonality. Net earnings were down 
      21% from 2Q'13 and flat compared with 3Q'12. Lower variable expenses, 
      primarily lower compensation and benefits, which were 36% lower 
      sequentially and 35% on a year-over-year (YoY) basis, supported bottom 
      line results.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Institutional client services continues to be the major contributor to 
      revenues at 43% of total, despite a 33% decline in revenues (excluding 
      DVA impact) from both 2Q'13 and YoY. Goldman's fixed income business was 
      particularly challenged by a 47% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) decrease in 
      net revenues (excluding DVA impact) which was significantly weaker than 
      peers. The equity business, excluding the sale of the reinsurance 
      business, was flat as compared with the prior year despite the difficult 
      operating environment. Trading VaR was up sequentially due to a higher 
      contribution from interest rates, partially offset by a lower 
      contribution from currency rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Investment banking revenues were down 25% from a strong 2Q'13, as lower 
      MA activity negatively affected advisory revenues, which was consistent 
      with industry volumes. Underwriting revenues were lower sequentially 
      when compared to a very strong 2Q'13 but improved YoY primarily due to 
      higher net revenues from IPOs. The investment banking backlog remains 
      strong, which should position Goldman's investment banking business well 
      for a pickup in economic activity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Investing and lending revenues were positively impacted by 
      mark-to-market gains on private equity investment and continued interest 
      income on fixed income investments. Results for this segment are 
      volatile as they tend to move with broader market conditions and rate 
      movements. Asset management revenues were slightly lower than 2Q'13. 
      Assets under supervision were positively impacted by market appreciation 
      and net inflows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Global core excess liquidity, including unencumbered, highly liquid 
      securities and cash, stood at a solid $175 billion (19% of total assets) 
      and averaged $187 billion during the quarter as compared with $180 
      billion in 2Q'13. Liquidity has been consistently maintained at 
      conservative levels over the past several years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman estimated that its Tier I common ratio under Basel III was 9.8% 
      compared with approximately 9.3% at end-2Q'13. The ratio is comfortably 
      above the 8.5% minimum (7% plus the 1.5% G-SIFI buffer) and above 
      Goldman's 9.5% target. Goldman also estimated that its supplementary 
      leverage ratios were approximately 5% at the holding company and 
      approximately 6% at Goldman Sachs Bank USA, both of which are in line 
      with proposed regulatory minimums.

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
NEW YORK, October 17 (Fitch) Third quarter 2013 (3Q'13) net

compared with the 
prior year despite the difficult operating environment. Trading
VaR was up 
sequentially due to a higher contribution from interest rates,
partially offset 
by a lower contribution from currency rates.
Investment banking revenues were down 25% from a strong 2Q'13,
as lower M 
activity negatively affected advisory revenues, which was

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - IBM Corp has reassigned the head of its growth markets unit, a source with knowledge of the move said, after a surprisingly steep drop in quarterly hardware sales in China prompted a 7 percent share slide on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

of its growth markets unit, a source with knowledge of the move

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. lawyer used inflated estimates to pursue what eventually became an $18 billion pollution judgment against Chevron Corp (CVX.N) in Ecuador, despite warnings that the numbers were "wildly inaccurate," his former consultant said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consultant was called as a witness in federal court in New York by Chevron, which claims that lawyer Steven Donziger used fraud to obtain the judgment from an Ecuadorean court in 2011 on behalf of a group of villagers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Russell said Donziger asked him in 2003 to assess what Donziger said was widespread pollution at an Ecuadorean oil field that had been operated by Texaco. Texaco was acquired by Chevron in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russell said that his initial estimate of more than $6 billion was based in part on assumptions given to him by Donziger about the extent of the damage and on Donziger's desire for a figure that could be used to put pressure on Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By late 2005, however, he said he had become "thoroughly disillusioned" with his estimate, after testing that showed contamination was less severe. He claimed he repeatedly asked Donziger to stop referring to it in press releases and other statements, a request he said Donziger ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The non-jury trial, which is being heard by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, comes after years of litigation over environmental contamination in Ecuador between 1964 and 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, which asserts that Texaco cleaned up before ceding control of the field to a state-owned oil company, is seeking to prevent Donziger and the residents of the village of Lago Agrio from using U.S. courts to enforce the $18 billion judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger has denied using fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INACCURATE ESTIMATE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point, Russell said, Donziger and the other plaintiff lawyers in the case decided to stop doing certain testing because the results suggested that some contamination was due to the state-owned company, not Texaco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Russell and Donziger deteriorated to the point that Russell filed a lawsuit when he was not paid for his work, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During cross-examination from Donziger's lawyer, Zoe Littlepage, Russell acknowledged sending an email to a Chevron scientist with an early draft of his cost estimate after he stopped working for Donziger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked why he sent a draft of his work for Donziger's team to a Chevron employee, Russell said he did so for "informational purposes." He also said he had sent the same scientist a report from a cleanup company suggesting that the cost of remediation could be substantially lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientist, Sara McMillen, was scheduled to testify after Russell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron also planned to call a forensic linguist to testify that the Ecuadorean judgment contained numerous instances of language taken directly from Donziger's own legal documents that were never filed with the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he did on Wednesday, the judge scolded lawyers, particularly on Donziger's team, when they asked questions he felt were unnecessary. But there were still moments of levity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point, Littlepage asked Russell what he meant by using the acronym "CYA" in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CYA is a term of art that means Cover Your Ass," Russell replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Which is a high art form in our society," Kaplan said, without missing a beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Chevron Corp v. Steven Donziger et al, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 11-0691.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joseph Ax; Editing by Eddie Evans and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Julia Edwards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks neared record highs
on Thursday as investors regained confidence in the market
following a last-minute deal to avoid a U.S. default, but
weakness in IBM pulled the Dow lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S 500 reached 1729.64, just under its record intraday
high of 1729.86 on Sept. 18. The CBOE Volatility Index, a
measure of investor anxiety, fell to 13.60, its lowest since
Sept. 26, the week before the government shutdown began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress on Wednesday approved an 11th-hour deal to end a
partial government shutdown and pull the world's biggest economy
back from the edge of default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This has been a market with a 'buy the dip' mentality. If
investors are convinced money is going to flow into the market
for whatever reason, they may not want to miss that run up,"
said Quincy Krosby, market strategist for Prudential Financial
in Newark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow, however, fell, pulled down by International
Business Machines Corp's shares. That stock hit a
two-year low a day after reporting weaker-than-expected revenue,
and accounted for 78 points off the Dow Jones industrial
average. IBM was the biggest decliner on the S 500, trading
down 6.8 percent to $174.04.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The political wrangling has led some investors to believe
the U.S. Federal Reserve will have no choice but to leave its
fiscal stimulus measures in place for several more months. This
could bolster stocks in coming months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We never really had a chance to have a nice rally off the
Fed's lack of tapering because when we got the news back in
September everyone started worrying about the budget situation,"
said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer for multi-asset
strategies for ING Investment Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Reuters survey showed economists have grown less
optimistic about prospects for the economy as the fight over
fiscal policy takes its toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average was down 55.66
points, or 0.36 percent, at 15,318.17. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
Index was up 4.70 points, or 0.27 percent, at 1,726.24.
The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 9.48 points, or 0.25
percent, at 3,848.92.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a revenue basis, 54.4 percent of companies in the S 500
have bested Wall Street estimates, below the 61 percent average
since 2002 but above the 49 percent average for the past four
quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EBay Inc dropped 3.9 percent at $51.46 as the
biggest drag on the Nasdaq 100 index after the company
gave a disappointing holiday forecast on Wednesday, saying the
U.S. economic environment had deteriorated partly because of the
government shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shares fell 2.6 percent to $158 after
the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets said its quarterly profit
dropped amid weak bond-trading volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verizon Communications Inc was a bright spot as
shares rose 3.3 percent to $48.79 after the company posted
stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings and
revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment
benefits dropped from a six-month high last week but remained
elevated as California continued to deal with a backlog related
to computer problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pace of manufacturing growth in the U.S. mid-Atlantic
region slowed slightly in October, but firms' optimism about the
future hit a 10-year high, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank
said.&lt;/p&gt;

pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chuck Mikolajczak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Thursday as
investors assessed the ramifications of an agreement by
lawmakers in Washington to raise the U.S. debt ceiling and end
the partial shutdown of the government, but a decline in IBM
pulled the Dow lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress on Wednesday approved an 11th-hour deal to end a
partial government shutdown and pull the world's biggest economy
back from the edge of default that could have brought about
financial calamity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The political wrangling has led some investors to believe
the U.S. Federal Reserve will have no choice but to leave its
fiscal stimulus measures in place for at least several months as
the damage caused to the economy becomes apparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Reuters survey showed economists have grown less
optimistic about prospects for the economy as the fight over
fiscal policy takes its toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The scare that was created by the lengthy delay in
resolving the issue has created a situation that has taken Fed
tapering off the table for a considerable period. That is viewed
as bullish," said Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush
Equity Management LLC in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What is going to hold it back is earnings are not going to
be good and from what we've seen so far - IBM, eBay - we will
see more of the same and that is going act as a restraint."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow was dragged lower by International Business Machines
Corp's shares hitting a two-year low a day after
reporting weaker than expected revenue. The tech bellwether was
also the worst performing stock on the S 500, trading down 6.3
percent to $174.98.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average fell 35.48 points or
0.23 percent, to 15,338.35, the S 500 gained 7.97
points or 0.46 percent, to 1,729.51 and the Nasdaq Composite
 added 17.334 points or 0.45 percent, to 3,856.765.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Thomson Reuters data through Thursday morning,
of the 79 companies in the S 500 that have reported earnings,
64.6 percent have topped Wall Street expectations, above the 63
percent beat rate since 1994 but below the 66 percent average
over the past four quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a revenue basis, 54.4 percent of companies in the S 500
have bested Wall Street estimates, below the 61 percent average
since 2002 but above the 49 percent average for the past four
quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EBay Inc dropped 3.4 percent at $51.67 as the
biggest drag on the Nasdaq 100 index after the company
gave a disappointing holiday forecast on Wednesday, saying the
U.S. economic environment had deteriorated partly because of the
government shutdown. The S technology index
 declined 0.3 percent, the only major S sector in
negative territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shares fell 2.6 percent to $158.05
after the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets said its quarterly
profit dropped amid weak bond-trading volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verizon Communications Inc was a bright spot as
shares rose 3.6 percent to $48.97 after the company posted
stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings and revenue. The
S telecom index climbed 1.8 percent as the best
performing of the ten major S sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new
claims for unemployment benefits dropped from a six-month high
last week but remained elevated as California continued to deal
with a backlog related to computer problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other data showed the pace of manufacturing growth in the
U.S. mid-Atlantic region slowed slightly in October, but firms'
optimism about the future hit a 10-year high, a survey showed on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' (GS.N) net revenues in commodities "declined significantly" in the third quarter from the previous three months, the bank said on Thursday, but reiterated its determination to remain in the physical trading business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking on the bank's third-quarter conference call, Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said the firm's commodity business had suffered from a difficult trading environment between June and September, a period when the bank came under intense political and regulatory pressure over its role in the natural resources supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Commodities declined significantly versus the second quarter under challenging macro conditions and lower client activities," Schwartz said in prepared comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before revealing the quarter-on-quarter decline, the bank earlier said in its earnings release that commodities was one of the few areas in its Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) business where third-quarter results had improved from the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's commodity division, J. Aron, faced significant regulatory and political pressure during the third quarter as a series of investigations and lawsuits over the operations of its Metro International metals warehouse business drew widespread attention, amid allegations the firm has purposely created long wait times for metal consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz, in response to questions from analysts on the call, said the bank remained committed to its commodity business, even as rivals on Wall Street have looked at scaling back or exiting the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The commodities business for us, we've been in the business for 30 plus years. It's an essential business for our clients," Schwartz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll see what happens in the regulatory discussion. It's an important discussion. But it's not distracting us from focusing on our clients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve announced in July that it was conducting a review of the position of Wall Street in physical commodities trading, amid concerns in Washington that banks could be taking on unseen financial risks by leasing crude oil tankers and operating power plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) has announced that it is selling its physical commodities arm, arguing the risks and the regulatory scrutiny outweigh the returns from the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS.N), traditionally Goldman's biggest and longest-running rival on Wall Street in commodities, has also looked at a possible sale or spin-off of its natural resources trading business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have no intention of selling our (commodities) business," Schwartz said in response to an analyst's question on the importance of the physical commodity arm to Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The extent we're involved in the physical business is to the extent our clients needs us in the physical business. It's important from the standpoint of being able to fill the requirements they have. Ultimately, the regulators will come to their own opinion about the business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined FICC net revenues fell to $1.25 billion in the third quarter, down 44 percent from the same period last year as bond trading slowed, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VaR IN COMMODITIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like other Wall Street banks, Goldman does not break out its commodity revenues in its quarterly earnings release.

&lt;p&gt;Oct 17 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' net revenues in commodities
"declined significantly" in the third quarter from the previous three months,
the bank said on Thursday, but reiterated its determination to remain in the
physical trading business.
    Speaking on the bank's third-quarter conference call, Chief Financial
Officer Harvey Schwartz said the firm's commodity business had suffered from a
difficult trading environment between June and September, a period when the bank
came under intense political and regulatory pressure over its role in the
natural resources supply chain.
    "Commodities declined significantly versus the second quarter under
challenging macro conditions and lower client activities," Schwartz said in
prepared comments.
    Before revealing the quarter-on-quarter decline, the bank earlier said in
its earning release that commodities was one of the few areas in its Fixed
Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) business where third-quarter results
had improved from the same period last year.
    The bank's commodity division, J. Aron, faced significant regulatory and
political pressure during the third quarter as a series of investigations and
lawsuits over the operations of its Metro International metals warehouse
business drew widespread attention, amid allegations the firm has purposely
created long wait times for metal consumers.
     Schwartz, in response to questions from analysts on the call, said the bank
remained committed to its commodity business, even as rivals on Wall Street have
looked at scaling back or exiting the sector.
    "The commodities business for us, we've been in the business for 30 plus
years. It's an essential business for our clients," Schwartz said. 
    "We'll see what happens in the regulatory discussion. It's an important
discussion. But it's not distracting us from focusing on our clients."
    The Federal Reserve announced in July that it was conducting a review of the
position of Wall Street in physical commodities trading, amid concerns in
Washington that banks could be taking on unseen financial risks by leasing crude
oil tankers and operating power plants.
    JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co has announced that it is selling its physical
commodities arm, arguing the risks and the regulatory scrutiny outweigh the
returns from the business.
    Morgan Stanley, traditionally Goldman's biggest and longest-running
rival on Wall Street in commodities, has also looked at a possible sale or
spin-off of its natural resources trading business. 
    "We have no intention of selling our (commodities) business," Schwartz said
in response to an analyst's question on the importance of the physical commodity
arm to Goldman.
    "The extent we're involved in the physical business is to the extent our
clients needs us in the physical business. It's important from the standpoint of
being able to fill the requirements they have. Ultimately, the regulators will
come to their own opinion about the business."
    Combined FICC net revenues fell to $1.25 billion in the third quarter, down
44 percent from the same period last year as bond trading slowed, Goldman said.
    
    VaR IN COMMODITIES
    Like other Wall Street banks, Goldman does not break out its commodity
revenues in its quarterly earnings release. They are published later in a more
detailed filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
    The bank's Value-at-Risk (VaR) in commodities, the only figure most Wall
Street firms publish regularly on the sector, slipped to $17 million in the
third quarter, down from $19 million in the second quarter and $22 million in
the third quarter of 2012.
    The bank as a whole reported a 2 percent fall in quarterly profit due to
weak revenues from bond trading, its biggest business.

&lt;p&gt;* Thousands have rallied across Romania against exploration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Company has all necessary permits for exploration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Romania has substantial reserves of recoverable gas-US
data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUCHAREST, Oct 17 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Chevron 
suspended its search for shale gas at a site in eastern Romania
after opposition from local residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company earlier this year won approval to drill
exploratory wells in the impoverished eastern county of Vaslui  
 and also has rights to explore three blocks near the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of people have rallied across Romania in recent
months to protest government backing for shale gas exploration
and plans to set up Europe's largest open cast gold mine in a
small Carpathian town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the small town of Pungesti, where Chevron was expected to
begin work on its first exploration well, locals blocked access
to the site earlier this week. Chevron aimed to set up the first
well by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron can today confirm it has suspended activities in
Silistea, Pungesti commune, Vaslui county," the company said on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron is committed to building constructive and positive
relationships with the communities where we operate and we will
continue our dialogue with the public, local communities and
authorities on our projects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pungesti local council decided on Thursday to hold a
referendum on Nov. 24 on whether to allow Chevron to explore for
shale. The referendum would not be binding, and the company said
it has all the necessary permits it needs for the works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shale gas faces local opposition due to environmental
concerns around hydraulic fracturing, the process of injecting
water and chemicals at high pressure into underground rock
formations to push out gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many countries in central and southeastern Europe see shale
gas as a way to wean themselves off Russian supplies, though
Romania only imports about a quarter of what it uses due to
conventional reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that
Romania could potentially recover 51 trillion cubic feet of
shale gas, which would cover domestic demand for more than a
century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* IBM, eBay among biggest decliners after results&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Financial sector has reported strong earnings so far:
analyst&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Chinese rating agency cuts U.S. sovereign credit rating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Indexes: Dow off 0.6 pct; S off 0.2 pct; Nasdaq off 0.3
pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Angela Moon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Thursday as
investors shifted their focus to earnings of heavyweight
companies such as IBM, in the wake of an agreement by lawmakers
in Washington to reopen the federal government and raise the
debt ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp was among the
biggest decliners, hitting a two-year low a day after reporting
a 4 percent drop in third-quarter revenue, worse than expected,
amid a decline in hardware and emerging markets even as it beat
profit estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Wednesday's close, 61 companies representing 18.8
percent of S 500's market-cap have reported, with revenues
missing expectations by 0.5 percent and earnings beating
forecasts by 4.5 percent, according to RBC Capital Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings have been particularly strong for financials with
results beating expectations by 6.2 percent and year-on-year
growth of 16.4 percent, said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. market
strategist at RBC. Excluding financials, results have surprised
by 3.3 percent and grew by 8.6 percent for those that have
reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While investors had been concerned about lower FICC trading
activity and mortgage volumes, this seems to have been offset by
stronger loan activity and improved credit quality," Golub said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, 24 companies representing 7 percent of the S
500 index report results, including Google after the
market close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average was down 85.91
points, or 0.56 percent, at 15,287.92. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
Index was down 3.80 points, or 0.22 percent, at 1,717.74.
The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 9.89 points, or 0.26
percent, at 3,829.54.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares were down 6.5 percent at $174.69 after hitting a
two-year low of $172.57 shortly after the open. It was the
biggest one-day decline for the stock since April 19, also after
quarterly results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shares fell 3 percent to $157.45 after
the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets said its quarterly profit
dropped amid weak bond-trading volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Verizon Communications Inc shares rose 2.6
percent to $48.49 after the company posted stronger-than
expected third-quarter earnings and revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EBay Inc dropped 5.2 percent at $50.71 after the
company gave a disappointing holiday forecast on Wednesday,
saying the U.S. economic environment had deteriorated partly
because of the government shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also weighing on the market, China's Dagong Global Credit
Rating said the temporary fix of the U.S. debt issue would not
solve the fundamental conundrum of the massive U.S. fiscal
deficit or improve repayment ability in the long term, but could
trigger defaults at any time in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new
claims for unemployment benefits dropped from a six-month high
last week, but remained elevated as California continued to deal
with a backlog related to computer problems. The report barely
moved the market.&lt;/p&gt;

Thursday said third-quarter revenue plunged 20 percent, hurt by
weak mortgage and bond-trading results, but profit dropped only
slightly as the Wall Street bank slashed compensation and other
expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from trading fixed-income, currency and commodity
products for clients, one of the bank's biggest businesses, 
plunged 44 percent, a much sharper decline than those posted by
rivals. Goldman said revenue from investing its own money in
bonds and loans fell 46 percent. The bank's shares fell 2.6
percent in pre-market trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman showed that they are also mortal," said Michael
Holland, founder of Holland &amp; Co, which owns financial stocks
but does not own Goldman shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks across Wall Street were hurt in the third quarter by
the Federal Reserve's surprise decision to continue its bond
buying stimulus instead of starting to wind it down. Customer
trading volume dropped because the decision assured investors
that they could hold onto their bonds for longer periods without
worrying about rising rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman responded to the weaker revenue by cutting the money
set aside for compensation by 35 percent, to $2.38 billion. So
far this year it has set aside $10.4 billion to pay employees,
down 5 percent from the first nine months of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Goldman reported net income for common shareholders
of $1.43 billion, or $2.88 per share, down 2 percent from $1.46
billion, or $2.85 per share, a year earlier. Per-share earnings
rose because of stock repurchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts had been expecting earnings of $2.43 per share, on
average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. But analysts had
forecast higher revenue, and most of Goldman's earnings beat
came from cost-cutting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank boosted its dividend for the third time in less
than two years, to 55 cents per share quarterly from 50 cents.
The dividend is a relatively small expenditure for the bank, but
Goldman is usually loathe to boost its payout if there are
better opportunities for it to invest the money elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The third quarter's results reflected a period of slow
client activity," Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein laid some of the blame on the budget impasse in
Washington, which made companies and investors hesitant to take
risk. Wall Street banks that reported earnings earlier in the
month, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Citigroup Inc
 and Bank of America Corp, also reported lower
fixed-income trading revenue, and said that uncertainty about
the Federal Reserve's plans for monetary easing had also hurt
trading volumes.

But there's busy and then there's good busy," noted Wilson. "Busy is being stretched to the limit, trying to do a million things at once, and feeling out of control. With Visa's Good Busy campaign we are helping business owners strategically manage their time and resources, so they can ultimately focus on growing their business, and future." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the #GoodBusy campaign, Visa Canada will be posting articles and videos through its small business Twitter and Facebook feeds, with helpful business management tips related to productivity, HR, marketing and cash flow. Business owners can join the conversation and share their own tips using the #GoodBusy hashtag. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help business owners stay #GoodBusy, Visa has also launched the Visa SavingsEdge program, which automatically provides enrolled Visa Business cardholders with discounts on purchases at participating merchants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With Visa SavingsEdge, the discounts are automatically applied," said Wilson. "The savings appear as credits on cardholders' account statements and require no time commitment, helping business owners stay good busy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the Good Busy campaign Wilson will be speaking at the upcoming Art of Small Business conference in Toronto on October 21, 2013. The full-day seminar will feature discussions and presentations from a diverse group of authors and thought leaders, who will share tools, techniques and real world experience covering today's most critical small business issues.

&lt;p&gt;Oct 17 (Reuters) - IBM Corp's shares were set to
open 8 percent lower after a drop in hardware sales in the
latest quarter reinforced concerns about the company's ability
to grow as it shifts to software and cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp said on Wednesday
hardware revenue fell 17 percent in the third quarter and that
profitability in the business had declined by $1 billion so far
this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least nine brokerages cut their price targets by as much
as 9.5 percent, while analysts at UBS Investment Research
downgraded the stock to "neutral" from "buy".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think IBM's market positioning mainly in infrastructure
with database and middleware is becoming riskier as customers
shift to the cloud," Societe Generale analysts wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest technology services company reiterated
its full-year profit outlook, but analysts raised doubts about
the company's ability to convert services backlog to revenue.
IBM has reported a decline in revenue for six straight quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Software has been the growth engine for IBM and has been
one of the key reasons investors held the stock. However, it
appears that the engine may have stalled and no longer can
outgrow the broader software market," J.P. Morgan analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has been beefing its software and cloud services
offerings through acquisitions. It bought website hosting
company SoftLayer Technologies in a deal valued at more than $2
billion in June and paid about $1 billion to buy
security-software maker Trusteer in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The J.P. Morgan analysts said IBM may just not have the
right software assets to address the faster-growing segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's shares were trading at $172.69 before the bell on
Thursday. They closed at $186.73 on the New York Stock Exchange
on Wednesday.

&lt;p&gt;(Deletes "FICC net revenues up" from headline; FICC net revenues fell from a
year earlier)
    Oct 17 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs trimmed its commodity trading risk in the
third quarter from the previous three months, the bank reported on Thursday,
though revenues improved from a year earlier.
    Value-at-Risk (VaR) in commodities stood at $17 million in the third
quarter, down from $19 million in the second quarter and $22 million in the
third quarter of 2012.
    The bank said that while net revenues in its Fixed Income, Currencies and
Commodities (FICC) business were down 44 percent compared with the same period
last year at $1.25 billion, commodities were one of the few bright spots.
    "Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities operated in a challenging
environment, which was characterized by economic uncertainty, difficult
market-making conditions in certain businesses, and lower levels of activity,"
the bank said.
    "Net revenues in commodities were higher compared with the third quarter of
2012."
    Goldman, typical of Wall Street banks, groups its commodities revenue under
the fixed income category in its quarterly earnings and does not break down the
sector individually, often leaving VaR as one of its key risk-reward indicators
for commodities.
    The bank as a whole reported a slight fall in quarterly profit as weak
bond-trading volumes hit revenue in the Wall Street bank's biggest business.

&lt;p&gt;Oct 17 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's

&lt;p&gt;The fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets reported a

speculation that the central bank was about to start winding

      act on significant transactions and we believe that the firm is well 
      positioned to help our clients accomplish their objectives. As longer 
      term U.S. budget issues are resolved, we could see an improvement in 
      corporate and investor sentiment that would help lay the basis for a 
      more sustained recovery.&#8221;

			Net Revenues
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Investment Banking
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues in Investment Banking were $1.17&#160;billion, essentially 
      unchanged compared with the third quarter of 2012 and 25% lower than the 
      second quarter of 2013. Net revenues in Financial Advisory were 
      $423&#160;million, 17% lower than the third quarter of 2012, reflecting a 
      decrease in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions. Net 
      revenues in the firm&#8217;s Underwriting business were $743&#160;million, 13% 
      higher than the third quarter of 2012. This increase reflected 
      significantly higher net revenues in equity underwriting, primarily due 
      to higher net revenues from initial public offerings. Net revenues in 
      debt underwriting were essentially unchanged compared with the third 
      quarter of 2012. The firm&#8217;s investment banking transaction backlog 
      increased significantly compared with the end of the second quarter of 
      2013.&#160;(7)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Institutional Client Services
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues in Institutional Client Services were $2.86&#160;billion, 32% 
      lower than the third quarter of 2012 and 34% lower than the second 
      quarter of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution 
      were $1.25&#160;billion, 44% lower than the third quarter of 2012, reflecting 
      significantly lower net revenues in mortgages and interest rate 
      products, as well as in currencies. In addition, net revenues in credit 
      products were lower, while net revenues in commodities were higher 
      compared with the third quarter of 2012. During the third quarter of 
      2013, Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution operated 
      in a challenging environment, which was characterized by economic 
      uncertainty, difficult market-making conditions in certain businesses 
      and lower levels of activity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues in Equities were $1.62&#160;billion, 18% lower than the third 
      quarter of 2012, primarily due to the sale of the firm&#8217;s Americas 
      reinsurance business&#160;(8). Net revenues in equities 
      client execution (excluding net revenues from the firm&#8217;s Americas 
      reinsurance business) and commissions and fees were both essentially 
      unchanged compared with the third quarter of 2012. In addition, 
      securities services net revenues were lower compared with the third 
      quarter of 2012, primarily due to the sale of the firm&#8217;s hedge fund 
      administration business in 2012. Although global equity prices increased 
      during the quarter, Equities operated in an environment characterized by 
      lower levels of activity and volatility.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The net loss attributable to the impact of changes in the firm&#8217;s own 
      credit spreads on borrowings for which the fair value option was elected 
      was $72&#160;million ($47&#160;million and $25&#160;million related to Fixed Income, 
      Currency and Commodities Client Execution and equities client execution, 
      respectively) for the third quarter of 2013, compared with a net loss of 
      $370&#160;million ($225&#160;million and $145&#160;million related to Fixed Income, 
      Currency and Commodities Client Execution and equities client execution, 
      respectively) for the third quarter of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Investing  Lending
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues in Investing  Lending were $1.48&#160;billion for the third 
      quarter of 2013. Results for the third quarter of 2013 included net 
      gains of $938&#160;million from investments in equities, primarily in private 
      equities, driven by strong corporate performance and company-specific 
      events. In addition, Investing  Lending net revenues included net 
      interest income and net gains of $300&#160;million from debt securities and 
      loans, and other net revenues of $237&#160;million related to the firm&#8217;s 
      consolidated investments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Investment Management
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues in Investment Management were $1.22&#160;billion, 2% higher than 
      the third quarter of 2012 and 9% lower than the second quarter of 2013. 
      The increase in net revenues compared with the third quarter of 2012 
      reflected higher management and other fees, primarily due to higher 
      average assets under supervision and favorable changes in the mix of 
      assets under supervision, partially offset by lower transaction 
      revenues. During the quarter, total assets under supervision&#160;(3) 
      increased $36&#160;billion to $991&#160;billion. Long-term assets under 
      supervision&#160;(3) increased $35&#160;billion, reflecting market 
      appreciation of $19&#160;billion, primarily in equity assets, and net inflows 
      of $16&#160;billion, primarily in fixed income assets. In addition, liquidity 
      products&#160;(3) increased $1&#160;billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Expenses
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Operating expenses were $4.56&#160;billion, 25% lower than the third quarter 
      of 2012 and 24% lower than the second quarter of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Compensation and Benefits
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The accrual for compensation and benefits expenses (including salaries, 
      estimated year-end discretionary compensation, amortization of equity 
      awards and other items such as benefits) was $2.38&#160;billion for the third 
      quarter of 2013, 35% lower than the third quarter of 2012. The ratio of 
      compensation and benefits to net revenues for the first nine months of 
      2013 was 41.0%, compared with 43.0% for the first six months of 2013 and 
      44.0% for the first nine months of 2012. Total staff&#160;(9) 
      increased 3% compared with the end of the second quarter of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Non-Compensation Expenses
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Non-compensation expenses were $2.17&#160;billion, 9% lower than the third 
      quarter of 2012 and 4% lower than the second quarter of 2013. The 
      decrease compared with the third quarter of 2012 included a decline in 
      insurance reserves, reflecting the sale of the firm&#8217;s Americas 
      reinsurance business, and lower depreciation and amortization expense, 
      primarily reflecting lower expenses related to consolidated investments. 
      These decreases were partially offset by increased net provisions for 
      litigation and regulatory proceedings and higher brokerage, clearing, 
      exchange and distribution fees. The third quarter of 2013 included net 
      provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of $142&#160;million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Provision for Taxes
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2013 was 
      30.3%, essentially unchanged compared with 30.4% for the first half of 
      2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Capital
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of September&#160;30,&#160;2013, total capital was $245.70&#160;billion, consisting 
      of $77.62&#160;billion in total shareholders&#8217; equity (common shareholders&#8217; 
      equity of $70.42&#160;billion and preferred stock of $7.20&#160;billion) and 
      $168.08&#160;billion in unsecured long-term borrowings. Book value per common 
      share was $153.58 and tangible book value per common share&#160;(10) 
      was $143.86, both approximately 2% higher compared with the end of the 
      second quarter of 2013. Book value and tangible book value per common 
      share are based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock 
      units granted to employees with no future service requirements, of 
      458.5&#160;million as of September&#160;30,&#160;2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the quarter, the firm repurchased 10.2&#160;million shares of its 
      common stock at an average cost per share of $161.59, for a total cost 
      of $1.65&#160;billion. The remaining share authorization under the firm&#8217;s 
      existing repurchase program is 65.7&#160;million shares.&#160;(11)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On October&#160;1,&#160;2013, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and certain of its 
      subsidiaries (collectively, Berkshire Hathaway) exercised in full their 
      warrant to purchase shares of the firm&#8217;s common stock. The warrant 
      agreement required net share settlement and the firm delivered 
      13.1&#160;million shares of common stock to Berkshire Hathaway on 
      October&#160;4,&#160;2013. The impact to both the firm&#8217;s book value per common 
      share and tangible book value per common share was a reduction of 
      approximately 3% in October.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the regulatory capital requirements currently applicable to bank 
      holding companies, the firm&#8217;s Tier&#160;1 capital ratio&#160;(6) 
      was 16.3%&#160;(5) and the firm&#8217;s Tier&#160;1 common ratio&#160;(6) 
      was 14.2%&#160;(5) as of September&#160;30,&#160;2013, up from 
      15.6% and 13.5%, respectively, as of June&#160;30,&#160;2013 (in each case under 
      Basel&#160;1 and reflecting the revised market risk regulatory capital 
      requirements which became effective on January&#160;1,&#160;2013).

			Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking 
      Statements

      This press release contains &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the 
      meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities 
      Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not 
      historical facts, but instead represent only the firm&#8217;s beliefs 
      regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently 
      uncertain and outside of the firm&#8217;s control. It is possible that the 
      firm&#8217;s actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly 
      materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition 
      indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some 
      of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm&#8217;s future 
      results and financial condition, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part&#160;I, Item&#160;1A 
      of the firm&#8217;s Annual Report on Form&#160;10-K for the year ended 
      December&#160;31,&#160;2012.

      Certain of the information regarding the firm&#8217;s capital ratios, 
      risk-weighted assets, total assets, level&#160;3 assets and global core 
      excess liquidity consist of preliminary estimates. These estimates are 
      forward-looking statements and are subject to change, possibly 
      materially, as the firm completes its financial statements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Statements about the firm&#8217;s investment banking transaction backlog also 
      may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject 
      to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that 
      they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, 
      that the firm actually earns from these transactions may differ, 
      possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors 
      that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a 
      transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting 
      transactions, a decline or continued weakness in general economic 
      conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities 
      markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer 
      of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a 
      decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate 
      financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the 
      transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a 
      discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the 
      firm&#8217;s investment banking transactions, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part&#160;I,

          where the firm earns a fee for managing assets on a discretionary 
          basis. Other client assets include client assets invested with 
          third-party managers, private bank deposits and advisory 
          relationships where the firm earns a fee for advisory and other 
          services, but does not have investment discretion. Long-term AUS

            The Tier&#160;1 capital ratio equals Tier&#160;1 capital divided by 
            risk-weighted assets (RWAs). The Tier&#160;1 common ratio equals Tier&#160;1 
            common capital divided by RWAs. As of September&#160;30,&#160;2013, Tier&#160;1 
            capital was $71.05&#160;billion and Tier&#160;1 common capital was 
            $61.83&#160;billion (Tier&#160;1 capital less $9.22&#160;billion of preferred 
            stock, junior subordinated debt issued to trusts and other 
            adjustments). The firm&#8217;s RWAs under the Board of Governors of the 
            Federal Reserve System&#8217;s risk-based capital requirements were 
            approximately $437&#160;billion as of September&#160;30,&#160;2013, under Basel&#160;1 
            and reflecting the revised market risk regulatory capital 
            requirements which became effective on January&#160;1,&#160;2013. Management 
            believes that the Tier&#160;1 common ratio is meaningful because it is 
            one of the measures that the firm, its regulators and investors 
            use to assess capital adequacy. The Tier&#160;1 common ratio is a 
            non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP 
            measures used by other companies. For a further discussion of the

          Tangible common shareholders' equity equals total shareholders' 
          equity less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible 
          assets. Tangible book value per common share is computed by dividing 
          tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity by the number of common shares 
          outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees 
          with no future service requirements. Management believes that 
          tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity and tangible book value per 
          common share are meaningful because they are measures that the firm 
          and investors use to assess capital adequacy. Tangible common 
          shareholders&#8217; equity and tangible book value per common share are 
          non-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP

			Pfizer Receives European Approval For Label Update Regarding The Use 
      Of Prevenar 13 In Certain High-Risk Populations
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Label Now Includes Information on Use of Prevenar 13 in Preterm 
      Infants, Children and Adolescents with Sickle Cell Disease, and Adults 
      with HIV Infection
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today that the European Commission 
      approved updates to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for 
      the company&#8217;s pneumococcal conjugate vaccine Prevenar 13* (pneumococcal 
      polysaccharide conjugate vaccine [13-valent, adsorbed]), regarding its 
      use in certain populations at high risk of pneumococcal disease. The 
      updated label now includes information describing the use of the vaccine 
      in preterm infants, children and adolescents with sickle cell disease 
      who were previously vaccinated with the 23-valent pneumococcal 
      polysaccharide vaccine, and adults with human immunodeficiency virus 
      (HIV) infection who were previously vaccinated with the 23-valent 
      pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.1
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;People with conditions that compromise the immune system, such as HIV, 
      those with sickle cell disease, and infants born prematurely are all at 
      an increased risk of pneumococcal disease,2,3,4,5,6&#8221; said 
      Luis Jodar, Ph.D., vice president, Vaccines, Global Medicines 
      Development Group and Scientific Affairs, Pfizer. &#8220;The Prevenar 13 label 
      in the European Union now includes important information about 
      appropriate use of the vaccine for the prevention of pneumococcal 
      disease for health care professionals who care for these patients.1&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The decision to approve the SmPC for Prevenar 13 followed the European 
      Medicines Agency&#8217;s review of data submitted by Pfizer from several 
      studies assessing immunogenicity and safety of vaccination with Prevenar 
      13 in these three risk groups.7,8,9 These data are under 
      review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prevenar 13 received an expanded indication in the European Union (EU) 
      in July 2013 to include adults aged 18 to 49 years for active 
      immunization for the prevention of invasive disease caused by 
      vaccine-type Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae). Previously 
      approved in the EU for use in infants, young children and adolescents 
      aged 6 weeks to 17 years, and adults 50 years of age and older, Prevenar 
      13 is now the only pneumococcal vaccine in the EU that offers protection 
      against invasive pneumococcal disease from infancy through adulthood.1
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Pfizer is dedicated to&#160;improving&#160;public health through vaccination, and 
      to supporting&#160;health care professionals&#160;in their efforts to reduce the 
      impact of pneumococcal disease among those most at risk,&#8221; said Susan 
      Silbermann, president, Vaccines at Pfizer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Preterm Infants
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Preterm infants (gestational age 19 to 36 weeks) have an increased risk 
      for pneumococcal disease compared with infants born full term 
      (gestational age 37 to 42 weeks), according to studies.2 A 
      Phase 4 study of Prevenar 13 administered at 2, 3, 4 and 12 months to 
      approximately 100 preterm infants (born at 26 to 36 weeks) found a less 
      robust immune response among preterm infants compared to term infants. 
      An acceptable safety profile was demonstrated.7 Adverse 
      events were generally consistent with those expected in this study 
      population.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Sickle Cell Disease
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Individuals with sickle cell disease are 30 to 600 times more likely to 
      contract invasive pneumococcal disease than healthy individuals.3 
      A Phase 3, open-label, single-arm study evaluated the safety, 
      tolerability and immunogenicity of two doses of Prevenar 13 given six 
      months apart in 158 children and adolescents aged 6 years to 17 years 
      with sickle cell disease who were previously vaccinated with one or more 
      doses of the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. The study 
      showed that Prevenar 13 elicited antibody levels after the first dose 
      that were statistically significantly higher when compared with levels 
      prior to vaccination. Antibody levels after the second dose were 
      comparable to those after the first dose. An acceptable safety profile 
      was demonstrated.8 Adverse events were generally consistent 
      with those expected in this study population.

			HIV Infection
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      HIV-infected individuals are more vulnerable to invasive pneumococcal 
      disease, with an incidence that has been reported to be 6 to 324 times 
      that of uninfected adults.4 Studies estimating the risk in 
      the current setting of antiretroviral therapy use suggest the risk 
      remains 20 to 40 times higher in HIV-infected adults than the general 
      population.5,6
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A Phase 3, open-label, single-arm study assessed the safety, 
      tolerability and immunogenicity of three doses of Prevenar 13 given six 
      months apart in 331 individuals with HIV infection (with a CD4 count of 
      &#8805;200 cells/&#181;L, HIV viral load 50,000 copies/mL) aged 18 years or older 
      who had been previously vaccinated with at least one dose of 23-valent 
      pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. The study showed that Prevenar 13 
      elicited antibody levels after the first dose that were statistically 
      significantly higher when compared with levels prior to vaccination. 
      After the second and third doses of Prevenar 13, immune responses were 
      comparable or higher than those after the first dose. An acceptable 
      safety profile was demonstrated. Adverse events were generally 
      consistent with those expected in this study population.9

			About Pneumococcal Disease
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pneumococcal disease (PD) is a group of illnesses caused by the 
      bacterium&#160;S. pneumoniae, also known as pneumococcus.10 
      It includes invasive manifestations such as bacteremia (bacteria in the 
      blood) and meningitis (infection of the tissues surrounding the brain 
      and spinal cord), as well as non-invasive infections such as pneumonia.11 
      PD can affect people of all ages, but infants and young children, older 
      adults and individuals with immunocompromising or certain chronic 
      medical conditions are at heightened risk of infection.12,13

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prevenar 13, or Prevnar 13 as it is called in the United States, Canada 
      and Taiwan, was first introduced for use in infants and young children 
      in December 2009 in Europe and is now approved for such use in more than 
      120 countries worldwide, including the United States and Japan.14 
      It is&#160;the most widely used pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) in the 
      world, and more than 575 million doses of Prevenar/Prevenar 13 have been 
      distributed worldwide.14 In addition, Prevenar 13 is approved 
      for use in adults 50 years of age and older in more than 90 countries,14 
      and is also approved in the United States and European Union (EU) for 
      use in older children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years.1,15 
      Recently, Prevenar 13 was also approved in the EU for use in adults 18 
      to 49 years of age,1 making it the only pneumococcal vaccine 
      in the EU approved to help protect against invasive pneumococcal disease 
      from infancy through adulthood.

      in some infants born prematurely.15
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The most commonly reported serious adverse events in infants and 
      toddlers were bronchiolitis (an infection of the lungs) (0.9%), 
      gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach and small intestine) 
      (0.9%), and pneumonia (0.9%).15
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In children 6 weeks through 17 years, the most common side effects were 
      tenderness, redness, or swelling at the injection site, irritability, 
      decreased appetite, decreased or increased sleep, and fever. Most 
      commonly reported side effects in children 5 years through 17 years also 
      included hives.15
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In adults, immune responses to Prevnar 13 were reduced when given with 
      injected seasonal flu vaccine.15
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In adults, the common side effects were pain, redness, or swelling at 
      the injection site, limitation of arm movement, fatigue, headache, 
      muscle pain, joint pain, decreased appetite, chills, or rash.15

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has picked up support since naming Hindu nationalist Narendra Modi as its candidate for prime minister last month, but would need allies to form a government, two new opinion polls show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's largest democracy is due to hold its largest ever general election within the next six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modi, three times chief minister of the coastal state of Gujarat, was put forward by India's main opposition party in September, cementing the rise of a leader who many think is capable of turning round the economy but who remains tainted by deadly religious riots that broke out on his watch in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling Congress party has led a coalition government for nearly a decade but is headed for its worst ever performance in a general election as it battles allegations of corruption and a sluggish economy, a survey by pollsters Team Cvoter for two television networks showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey forecasts the BJP to pick up 162 seats. The last Cvoter survey conducted in August, before Modi was named, forecast the party would get 130 seats, up from the 116 it now holds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Congress tally would drop to 102 seats from the 206 it now holds in the 545-member lower house of parliament if voting in the election were to reflect the poll, conducted for the India TV and Times Now networks and released late on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A coalition led by the BJP is expected to win 186 seats, meaning the BJP would have to find new allies among regional parties if it were to form a government. To rule, a party needs the support of 272 members of parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BJP and Congress are India's largest national parties but political power has shifted in recent years to smaller regional or state-level parties, making them kingmakers during coalition building and giving them more influence over policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modi is credited with helping Gujarat's economy achieve average yearly growth in the double digits in the past decade and he is popular among many wealthy businessmen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he remains a polarizing figure, even within his own party, and some analysts believe he would struggle to cobble together a coalition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A federal government beholden to regional parties with their own diverse agendas could be fragile and unwieldy, making it harder to manage Asia's third-largest economy, whose growth rate has already slowed to a decade low after a period of policy paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, another opinion poll, released on Thursday, suggested the BJP could make major gains against regional rivals in India's northern heartland states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, home to a quarter of the population of 1.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Uttar Pradesh, which contributes more seats to parliament than any other state, the BJP will emerge as the largest party, ending years of dominance by two local politicians, the poll, carried out by Nielsen for the Economic Times newspaper, showed. It predicted 27 seats for the party out of 80 at stake, almost three times its tally in the last election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Survey respondents said riots last month that pitted Hindus against Muslims in Uttar Pradesh, killing at least 50, were likely to consolidate Hindu votes behind the party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elections are notoriously hard to predict in India, which has very complex demographics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cvoter study was based on a national sample of 24,284 randomly selected respondents. The data was collected between August 16 and October 15 - the period four weeks before and four weeks after Modi was declared as the BJP's candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nielsen poll used a sample of 8,494 respondents, a mix of voters and opinion leaders, in rural and urban areas of two states. The data was collected between September 4 and September 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Malini Menon; Writing by Frank Jack Daniel; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)&lt;/p&gt;

      IBM (NYSE:IBM) today announced third-quarter 2013 diluted earnings of 
      $3.68 per share, compared with diluted earnings of $3.33 per share in 
      the third-quarter of 2012, an increase of 11 percent. Operating 
      (non-GAAP) diluted earnings were $3.99 per share compared with operating 
      diluted earnings of $3.62 per share in the third-quarter of 2012, an 
      increase of 10 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Third-quarter net income was $4.0 billion compared with $3.8 billion in 
      the third-quarter of 2012, an increase of 6 percent. Operating 
      (non-GAAP) net income was $4.4 billion, as compared with $4.2 billion in 
      the third-quarter of 2012, an increase of 6 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total revenues for the third-quarter of 2013 of $23.7 billion were down 
      4 percent (down 2 percent, adjusting for currency) from the 
      third-quarter of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In the third-quarter we continued to expand operating margins and 
      increased earnings per share, but fell short on revenue. Where we had 
      identified high growth opportunities and pursued them aggressively --- 
      cloud, mobile, business analytics, and security --- we continued to show 
      strong growth. This underscores our strategy to continuously transform 
      the company to high value,&#8221; said Ginni Rometty, IBM chairman, president

		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are taking action to improve execution in our growth markets unit 
      and in the elements of our hardware businesses that are under

			Third-Quarter GAAP &#8211; Operating (non-GAAP) Reconciliation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Third-quarter operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings exclude $0.31 per 
      share of charges: $0.15 per share for the amortization of purchased 
      intangible assets and other acquisition-related charges, and $0.16 per 
      share for retirement-related charges driven by changes to plan assets 
      and liabilities primarily related to market performance.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) has reached a tentative $4 billion deal with the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency to settle claims that the bank misled government-sponsored mortgage agencies about the quality of mortgages it sold them during the housing boom, according to a person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and the FHFA, which is pursuing claims on behalf of finance agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have agreed on the amount as a tentative part of a potential $11 billion global settlement with government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $4 billion figure was first reported on Friday by the Wall Street Journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for JPMorgan declined to comment as did a spokeswoman for the FHFA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank and the Department of Justice have discussed a broader deal under which JPMorgan would pay $7 billion of cash and $4 billion of consumer relief, to cover claims from the FHFA and other government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is seeking a single settlement to resolve all claims from federal and state agencies over its mortgage-related liabilities stemming from the bust in house prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baring a complete breakdown in talks with the Department of Justice, a final deal between the bank and the FHFA is unlikely to happen outside of a broader pact, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, others familiar with the talks said negotiations continued between the Justice Department and JPMorgan, with the bank circulating several proposals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FHFA has sued JPMorgan over mortgage loans totaling some $33 billion. A $4 billion deal would amount to about 12 cents on the dollar, less than the 20-cent rate under an earlier settlement by Switzerland-based bank UBS AG (UBSN.VX), said Josh Rosner, managing director of Graham Fisher &amp; Co, a New York research consultancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first glance, the tentative settlement looks like "a great deal for JPMorgan," Rosner said. He cautioned that it is unclear how comparable the deals are because the loans at issue have different origins and differences between the balances owed are not known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Jamie Dimon went to Washington to meet with U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on September 26 to advance those discussions, but a deal has not been forthcoming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Dimon is intent on getting the legal issues behind the bank, a sore spot with him and other JPMorgan directors has been how much the company will have to pay for bad mortgage deals done by Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns, two troubled institutions that JPMorgan took over during the financial crisis with the encouragement from bank regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan reported its first quarterly loss under Dimon on Friday as the company recorded a $7.2 billion hit from litigation expenses largely to build its reserves to settle lawsuits over mortgages. The bank said all of its legal reserves now amount to $23 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry and Karen Freifeld in New York and Aruna Viswanatha in Washington; Editing by Gary Hill and Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

Wall Street Journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for JPMorgan declined to comment as did a
spokeswoman for the FHFA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank and the Department of Justice have discussed a
broader deal under which JPMorgan would pay $7 billion of cash
and $4 billion of consumer relief, to cover claims from the FHFA
and other government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is seeking a single settlement to resolve all
claims from federal and state agencies over its mortgage-related
liabilities stemming from the bust in house prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baring a complete breakdown in talks with the Department of
Justice, a final deal between the bank and the FHFA is unlikely
to happen outside of a broader pact, a person familiar with the
matter told Reuters on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, others familiar with the talks said
negotiations continued between the Justice Department and
JPMorgan, with the bank circulating several proposals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FHFA has sued JPMorgan over mortgage loans totaling some
$33 billion. A $4 billion deal would amount to about 12 cents on
the dollar, less than the 20-cent rate under an earlier
settlement by Switzerland-based bank UBS AG, said Josh
Rosner, managing director of Graham Fisher &amp; Co, a New York
research consultancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first glance, the tentative settlement looks like "a
great deal for JPMorgan," Rosner said. He cautioned that it is
unclear how comparable the deals are because the loans at issue
have different origins and differences between the balances owed
are not known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Jamie Dimon went to Washington to meet with U.S.
Attorney General Eric Holder on Sept. 26 to advance those
discussions, but a deal has not been forthcoming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Dimon is intent on getting the legal issues behind
the bank, a sore spot with him and other JPMorgan directors has
been how much the company will have to pay for bad mortgage
deals done by Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns, two troubled
institutions that JPMorgan took over during the financial crisis
with the encouragement from bank regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan reported its first quarterly loss under Dimon on
Friday as the company recorded a $7.2 billion hit from
litigation expenses largely to build its reserves to settle
lawsuits over mortgages. The bank said all of its legal reserves
now amount to $23 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WUHAN, China (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co (F.N) Chief Executive Alan Mulally repeatedly declined to dismiss reports that he was approached to run Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and speculation that he may be in line for a leadership role at Boeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I love serving Ford" was Mulally's repeated comment on the sidelines of an auto conference in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, when asked if he had been approached either directly or indirectly to lead either of those companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford has repeatedly said there was no change to a plan for executive appointments announced last November, which included Mulally's. Mulally was set to continue to serve as Ford CEO through the end of 2014, giving the automaker more time to gauge potential successors, notably Chief Operating Officer Mark Fields, who now oversees most of Ford's daily operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no change in the plan that we outlined in November of last year," Mulally told Reuters on Friday. However, Reuters has reported that Ford's board might be open to his departure before his current commitment expires in 15 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mulally, who is 68 years old, came to Ford from Boeing after 38 years there. He is now the third longest serving CEO in Ford's history after Henry Ford I and Henry Ford II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has been credited for leading the dramatic resurgence at the U.S. automaker since his arrival in 2006. His name has lately been mentioned in several reports, mostly speculative, that he might be a candidate for the top job at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both companies have faced well-publicized struggles lately: Boeing with its problem-plagued 787 Dreamliner commercial jetliner launch and Microsoft with a stock price that has been stagnant for a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FORD'S TRANSFORMATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Mulally, poached by Ford from Boeing after being passed over for the CEO job there, arrived in Dearborn, Michigan, to run the No.2 U.S. auto maker, the company was in precarious financial and operational shape. Mulally is credited with creating since a more open, collaborative atmosphere that allowed problems to be tackled more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He arranged for Ford to borrow $23 billion and instituted a plan, dubbed "One Ford", to simplify and unify product development. As part of that One Ford plan, Mulally sold off brands his predecessors acquired - Aston Martin, Land Rover, Jaguar and Volvo - to refocus Ford's business on two brands: Ford and Lincoln.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also has reduced its number of distinct vehicle platforms to less than 20 from more than 90, dramatically cutting manufacturing costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the automaker was able to avoid bankruptcy and the federal bailouts needed by its U.S. competitors General Motors Co (GM.N) and Chrysler Group LLC UAWREC.UL in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it still faces an array of issues including its troubled operations in Europe, the company has restored profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In China, another weak spot where Ford has been a laggard in the fast-growing market, is finally showing sign of life too. Ford is set to sell a total of more than 900,000 vehicles in China this year, outpacing Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and Honda Motor Co Ltd (7267.T), though it lags far behind Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and General Motors Co (GM.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mulally still maintains a home in Seattle, where Microsoft is headquartered and where Boeing has its major operating base, though its headquarters are in Chicago. He also has close ties to senior officials at both companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mulally already has passed the normal retirement age if 65 for most American executives, but he sports the look and demeanor of a much younger man. He said in Wuhan that he has not decided whether he might be open to an executive post at another company after leaving Ford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked that question, the famously affable executive laughed and said: "I don't know".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This story has been corrected to eliminate reference to media reports linking Mulally with Boeing in original paragraphs 1 and 7, deletes third paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Ryan Woo; Editing by Jean Yoon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 18 (Reuters) - The opening of a TransCanada
 Keystone pipeline segment should again enrich the
premiums of the front-month U.S. crude oil contract to deferred
months as the segment will move ballooning supplies of crude
from shale plays to Gulf Coast refineries, Goldman Sachs said in
a note on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;November futures moved discount to December last
week as oil supplies rose at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery
point for the U.S. oil futures contract, reversing a months-long
decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That so-called "contango" in the spread, when the first
month's price is lower than deferred months, took hold for the
first time since June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traders who had bet on increasing draws from Cushing, which
reached fever pitch during peak summer demand, got caught on the
wrong side of market as refineries went into maintenance,
lessening demand for oil and causing a larger-than-expected
increase in supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As refiners finish the maintenance period, TransCanada will
be filling its 400,000 barrel-per-day MarketLink pipeline
between Cushing, Oklahoma, and Port Arthur, Texas, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "line fill for MarketLink in early November can more
than deal with the increased Bakken production being railed into
Cushing," the note said. The end result is front-month crude
prices will rise ahead of deferred months, known as
"backwardation" reflecting that refiners will have access to and
use the light, sweet Cushing oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a result, we continue to expect the WTI-Brent spread to
narrow to -$5.00/bbl towards year end and expect a recovery in
WTI timespreads," the Goldman analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contango scenario may be a bit more drawn out, albeit
mildly, other analysts say, as refiner demand for light, sweet
crude is uncertain. For one thing, the market is waiting on BP's
Whiting, Indiana, refinery to fire up its coking plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Looking ahead, some significant refiner demand for light
crude oil from Cushing, like that from the BP Whiting refinery,
will fade in favor of heavier Canadian crude when their coker
comes on line," said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity
market strategy at BNP Paribas in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering the risk of potential supply disruptions to
global benchmark Brent, "the corollary is that WTI/Brent
discount should widen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brent's premium to U.S. oil has fluctuated in the last year,
from $23 in February to flat in July. The spread was
last trading at $8.47 per barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are more inclined to take the point of view that it can
achieve double digits again," Tchilinguirian said.&lt;/p&gt;

			GGA Software Services Delivers Cryptographically Secure Microsoft 
      SharePoint&#174; Document Repository
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Innovative security technology solution enables major pharmaceutical 
      company to isolate and exclusively share highly confidential information 
      using the versatile Microsoft SharePoint&#174; platform.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      GGA Software Services, a leading provider of scientific informatics and 
      software solutions, announced that its SharePoint Center of Excellence 
      has delivered an innovative, cryptographically secure document 
      repository built on Microsoft SharePoint for one of its global 
      pharmaceutical clients. &#8220;This unique solution enhances the collaborative 
      file-sharing power of SharePoint by providing the ability to isolate and 
      secure highly sensitive documents within the SharePoint database,&#8221; said 
      Richard Golob, GGA&#8217;s President and Chief Executive Officer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;GGA&#8217;s encryption approach for SharePoint demonstrates the innovation 
      and sophistication that have become the hallmarks of GGA&#8217;s SharePoint 
      Center of Excellence,&#8221; according to Golob. He continued, &#8220;GGA&#8217;s global 
      clients appreciate GGA&#8217;s ability to couple innovative, expert software 
      engineering with superior problem-solving skills.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While global corporations have increasingly embraced SharePoint as their 
      default collaboration platform across the enterprise, some IT and legal 
      decision-makers have been reluctant to permit the use of SharePoint for 
      collaborating around sensitive information. According to Golob, &#8220;GGA&#8217;s 
      innovative solution is designed to secure these critical documents with 
      industry-leading encryption technology while allowing the enterprise to 
      exploit the rich set of collaboration features provided by SharePoint.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Working together, GGA and its client were able to create a 
      cryptographically secure document repository within SharePoint that 
      enables only selected individuals to view and share highly sensitive 
      documents. This approach secures the documents from viewing even by 
      SharePoint and database administrators.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Golob noted that &#8220;GGA&#8217;s global pharmaceutical client is the first 
      organization to take advantage of this new encryption capability, 
      previously available only in the most expensive document management 
      solutions on the market.&#8221; The client team can now leverage the 
      economical SharePoint platform without sacrificing the security of 
      certain highly confidential material.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      GGA&#8217;s solution employs pre-network encryption to maximize the security 
      of these highly sensitive documents. Encryption of each document occurs 
      on the user&#8217;s computer before the file is transmitted over the client&#8217;s 
      network to SharePoint. Golob noted, &#8220;The unencrypted information cannot 
      be obtained by network eavesdropping, and SharePoint never handles or 
      stores the non-encrypted version of the document.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      GGA&#8217;s solution provides a simple, user-friendly experience while 
      achieving a high level of data protection by using the Microsoft Crypto 
      API with the client&#8217;s public key infrastructure (PKI) and the PKI 
      framework from Entrust. To submit a document to a SharePoint library 
      configured to store sensitive documents, the user first reviews, 
      optionally edits, and accepts a list of users who will be authorized to 
      view the document. The client-side component then converts the document 
      to Adobe PDF format, encrypts the PDF document, and submits it to the 
      SharePoint document library. Unless a person has the use of the private 
      key of one of the authorized viewers, the file that traverses the 
      network and is stored in SharePoint is unreadable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to Golob, &#8220;GGA employed Microsoft ClickOnce to ensure a 
      seamless user experience while deploying its solution to users&#8217; 
      computers.&#8221; Working completely within the SharePoint interface, the user 
      initiates the entire workflow with a single click of the mouse. Equally 
      important in a regulated environment, GGA&#8217;s solution requires no 
      server-side custom code to be deployed. Customizations can be 
      implemented using client-side JavaScript in conjunction with native 
      SharePoint web services. This approach allows for easy integration with 
      both SharePoint 2010 and 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Golob said, &#8220;GGA&#8217;s SharePoint Center of Excellence provides a global 
      collaboration resource that empowers today&#8217;s RD organizations to share 
      information more broadly than ever before.&#8221; GGA&#8217;s scalable team of 
      SharePoint professionals helps to manage a client&#8217;s SharePoint platforms 
      and to deliver the client&#8217;s solution either remotely or on-site. GGA 
      offers support for the entire SharePoint lifecycle, including 
      requirements gathering, custom SharePoint development, system deployment 
      and configuration, operational support and administration, and end-user 
      support at Levels 1-4. For additional information on GGA&#8217;s SharePoint

			Microsoft Just Edges Sony in ABI Research&#8217;s Game Console Competitive 
      Assessment; Nintendo a Distant Third
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft just edged Sony for the top position in ABI Research&#8217;s game 
      console Competitive Assessment, based on expectations for the impact of 
      Sony&#8217;s PS4 and Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox One game consoles. ABI Research 
      evaluated a number of companies across three device categories: game 
      consoles, smart set-top boxes, and TVs/Blu-ray players. Several factors 
      were used to score each company based on two main axes of Innovation and 
      Implementation. The assessment provides deep insight into consumer 
      electronics ecosystems and modern video experiences in the connected 
      home.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sony fell to second in the game console assessment in part because key 
      PlayStation 4 (PS4) differentiators like cloud gaming are still untested 
      (and won&#8217;t be fully available at launch), but largely because Microsoft 
      has shown more features on the broader entertainment front (e.g. hybrid 
      premium/OTT services). Nintendo secured the third position but a 
      significant gap remains between it and market leaders.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Senior analyst Michael Inouye commented, &#8220;With the hardware specs 
      between Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox One and Sony&#8217;s PS4 so similar this leaves 
      Nintendo&#8217;s Wii U on the outside. If not for Nintendo&#8217;s wider 
      distribution network, console heritage, and first party titles it would 
      start to find itself in closer competition with many of the new market 
      entrants.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Not since the fifth generation of consoles have there been so many 
      competing platforms, but unlike the past there is room for optimism. In 
      this analysis some new platforms scored fairly well due to relatively 
      solid foundations &#8211; e.g. Android or Valve&#8217;s Steam. Before these new 
      entrants compete on equal ground with the incumbents; however, the 
      markets (mobile in particular) will need to further develop and evolve.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Practice director Sam Rosen added, &#8220;As we look at the distribution of 
      companies in this analysis it might look as if we expect a bifurcation 
      in console gaming - a high end populated by two premium platforms and a 
      larger pool largely based on mobile ecosystems. While this might be true 
      in the short term we anticipate the market will come to look more 
      cohesive than not as technologies like cloud gaming place less emphasis 
      on the hardware and more on platforms and services.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Global Outsourced Software Testing Services Market 
      2012-2016 with Capgemini SA, IBM Corp., and Wipro Ltd. Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/t8mzc5/global_outsourced) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Outsourced Software Testing Services Market 2012-2016" report 
      to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysts forecast the Global Outsourced Software Testing Services 
      market to grow at a CAGR of 10.12 percent over the period 2012-2016. One 
      of the key factors contributing to this market growth is the need to 
      reduce operational cost and time. The Global Outsourced Software Testing 
      Services market has also been witnessing increasing use of premium tools 
      from open source. However, the lack of skilled resources could pose a 
      challenge to the growth of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The key vendors dominating this space include Accenture plc, Capgemini 
      SA, IBM Corp., and Wipro Ltd.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The other vendors mentioned in this report are Cognizant Technology 
      Solutions Corp., Computer Sciences Corp., GroupeSteria SA, HCL 
      Technologies Ltd., Hewlett-Packard Co., Hexaware Technologies, Infosys 
      Ltd., Logica plc, Micro Focus International plc, Software Quality 
      Systems AG, TCS Ltd., Tech Mahindra Ltd., Thinksoft Global Services 
      Ltd., and UST Global.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from the team said: Although 
      technical ability and understanding of the domain knowledge is extremely 
      important, software testing clients are increasingly focusing on the 
      role of processes and the team spirit and commitment of employees 
      working for third-party service providers. Clients are increasingly 
      making outsourcing teams feel as if they are key stakeholders. Therefore 
      outsourcing companies are looking at third-party employees with a view 
      to establishing a long-term relationship and are ready to invest in them 
      in terms of education, training, and team building activities. They are 
      trying to change the culture among employees by providing free English 
      classes as well as technical and soft skills training in order to build 
      a strong corporate culture. These aspects of a software testing 
      outsourcing firm are increasingly becoming more and more important to 
      client organizations when selecting an outsourced services provider.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the main growth drivers is the need to 
      reduce operational time and cost. The Global Outsourced Software Testing 
      Services market is witnessing increasing demand for software testing 
      from companies because the quality of applications is highly dependent 
      upon testing. Hence, to avoid poor execution, slow test turnaround, or 
      excessive costs in the software's lifecycle, companies are relying more 
      on testing services, thereby increasing the adoption of outsourced 
      software testing services.

		&lt;p&gt;
			The Coca-Cola Foundation Awards $8.1 Million in 
      3rd 
      Quarter Benefitting 3.8 Million People Worldwide
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			More than $3 million targets programs to fight obesity
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Foundation awarded US$8.1 million to 47 community 
      organizations during the third quarter of 2013. Through these grants, 
      3.8 million people worldwide will have increased access to personal 
      well-being, environmental and community empowerment programs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The health and well-being of our families and communities concern 
      everyone,&#8221; said Lisa M. Borders, Chair of The Coca-Cola Foundation. &#8220;We 
      are taking an active role working with grassroots community 
      organizations to find solutions to those major issues affecting our 
      world today.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;One of the Foundation&#8217;s strategic goals is to encourage access to 
      physical activity and nutritional education programs,&#8221; Borders said. 
      &#8220;More than one-third of the programs funded during this grant cycle 
      increase access for people of all ages and abilities to become more 
      physically active and healthy.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;There is solid evidence of the gaps in physical activity in Europe &#8211; 
      between countries and between population groups,&#8221; said Mogens Kirkeby, 
      President of International Sport and Culture Association (ISCA), which 
      received a $950,000 grant from The Coca-Cola Foundation to support its 
      MOVE Activation program. &#8220;We need to close those gaps and boost physical 
      activity levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Coca-Cola&#8217;s contribution will allow ISCA to develop and enhance 
      initiatives for hard-to-reach populations and thereby bring physical 
      activity into the lives of some of the least active groups in society.&#8221; 
      ISCA is a non-governmental association based in Copenhagen, Denmark. Its 
      MOVE Activation program will encourage 100 million Europeans to become 
      active by 2020 by expanding and standardizing sports and activity 
      programming.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the third quarter, the Foundation awarded $2.8 million to support 
      active healthy living initiatives, $2.5 million to support education 
      initiatives, $1.1 million to support recycling initiatives, $1.2 million 
      to support water initiatives, and $650,000 to support youth development 
      and other local community priorities. Year to date, the Foundation has 
      awarded $58.5 million worldwide.

      CV Phase 3b Studies
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today top-line results from two phase 
      3b, placebo-controlled studies with Lyrica&#174; (pregabalin) 
      Capsules CV
			in patients with fibromyalgia (FM) and painful 
      diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), respectively. The fibromyalgia 
      study, A0081275 met its primary endpoint, showing a reduction in pain 
      associated with fibromyalgia in patients who were treated concurrently 
      with antidepressant therapy for comorbid depression. Separately, the 
      painful DPN study, A0081269 did not meet its co-primary endpoints by 
      sufficiently reducing DPN pain and DPN pain on walking compared to 
      placebo.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      A large number of people living with fibromyalgia also suffer from 
      depression and take antidepressant medications. The fibromyalgia study 
      (A0081275) was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, 
      placebo-controlled, two-way cross-over study of Lyrica in the treatment 
      of FM pain in patients taking concurrent antidepressant therapy for 
      comorbid depression. The study enrolled 197 patients diagnosed with both 
      fibromyalgia and comorbid depression who were taking a stable dose of a 
      single antidepressant medicine (either a selective serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitor or a serotonin&#8211;norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) for their 
      depression for at least three months prior to the study. In each of the 
      two double-blind treatment periods, patients were randomized to receive 
      Lyrica (300 or 450 mg) or placebo twice per day during a six-week 
      treatment phase, followed by a two-week washout period, and then crossed 
      over to the opposite treatment for an additional six weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The study met its primary endpoint, showing a statistically significant 
      greater reduction in fibromyalgia pain in patients receiving Lyrica 
      compared to patients receiving placebo assessed by diary-based, daily 
      pain scores. The safety profile of Lyrica was consistent with previous 
      studies and current product labeling. The most common adverse events in 
      this study included dizziness, somnolence and constipation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Patients who have painful DPN can also have pain while walking. The 
      study in patients with painful DPN who also had pain on walking 
      (A0081269) was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, 
      placebo-controlled cross-over efficacy and safety study. The co-primary 
      endpoints were DPN pain assessed by diary-based, daily pain scores and 
      pain on walking assessed after walking 50 feet on a flat surface. The 
      study enrolled 205 patients who were randomized to receive Lyrica (150 
      or 300 mg/day) or placebo during a six-week double-blind phase, followed 
      by a two-week, washout period, and then crossed over to the opposite 
      treatment for an additional six weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Painful DPN and pain on walking were reduced in patients treated with 
      Lyrica or placebo. The study did not show a statistically significant 
      difference between Lyrica and placebo in the co-primary endpoints. The 
      safety profile of Lyrica was consistent with previous studies and 
      current product labeling. The most common adverse events in this study 
      included dizziness, somnolence and fatigue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Results from these studies are expected to be submitted for presentation 
      at upcoming scientific congresses and for publication in peer-reviewed 
      medical journals.

			About Lyrica
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lyrica&#174; is currently approved for various indications in 120 
      countries and regions globally. Lyrica is approved for five indications 
      in the U.S., of which four are in the therapeutic area of pain. These 
      indications include neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral 
      neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia (pain after shingles), neuropathic 
      pain associated with spinal cord injury, fibromyalgia and partial onset 
      seizures in adults with epilepsy who take one or more drugs for seizures.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the European Union, Lyrica is approved for four indications: 
      peripheral and central neuropathic pain, generalized anxiety disorder in 
      adults, and partial seizures with or without secondary generalization in 
      adults with epilepsy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In Japan, Lyrica is the only treatment approved for all three of the 
      following indications: post-herpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain and 
      pain associated with FM.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lyrica&#8217;s ongoing clinical development program is focused on the 
      significant unmet needs of patients with certain chronic pain conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including Lyrica, increase the risk of 
      suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking AEDs for any 
      indication. There have been post-marketing reports of angioedema and 
      hypersensitivity with Lyrica. Treatment with Lyrica may cause dizziness, 
      somnolence, dry mouth, edema and blurred vision. Other most common 
      adverse reactions include weight gain, constipation, euphoric mood, 
      balance disorder, increased appetite and thinking abnormal (primarily 
      difficulty with concentration/attention).

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co has reached a tentative $13 billion deal with the U.S. Justice Department and other government agencies to settle investigations into bad mortgage loans the bank sold to investors before the financial crisis, a source familiar with the talks said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tentative deal, the largest ever between the U.S. government and a single company, does not release the bank from criminal liability for some of the mortgages it packaged into bonds and sold to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That had been a major sticking point in the discussions, but the government refused to budge on that issue and JPMorgan felt it had no choice but to give in, according to a second source. Until recently, the most that JPMorgan was willing to pay was closer to $11 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ongoing criminal investigation underscores how even if this settlement takes some heat off JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, he still has myriad regulatory issues to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. bank sidestepped the worst of the financial crisis but now faces more than a dozen probes globally into everything from alleged bribery in China to a possible role in manipulating benchmark interest rates known as Libor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While JPMorgan investors have publicly supported Dimon, privately many have expressed frustration at his run-ins with regulators. A Senate subcommittee report in March detailed how Dimon demanded that subordinates withhold data from one of the bank's regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Earlier this month, the bank said that Dimon was no longer chairman of JPMorgan's main U.S. retail banking subsidiary, which press reports said happened at the request of the OCC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's board of directors has pressured Dimon to improve his relationship with government regulators and enforcement officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preliminary $13 billion settlement was reached after he spoke by phone on Friday night with U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to finalize the broad outlines of the deal, the first source said. Dimon went to Washington to meet with Holder on September 25, and discussed an $11 billion deal at that point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are trying to do whatever they can to get this behind them," said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates, which owns JPMorgan shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At issue in the settlement is whether the bank sold mortgages that it knew were riskier than they appeared. Investors, including government-owned mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said that the bank told them loans were better than they actually were, or that the bank was negligent in accepting information from borrowers about their income and other matters at face value instead of verifying it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 80 percent of the securities in the $13 billion settlement relate to investment bank Bear Stearns and mortgage lender Washington Mutual, which the government encouraged JPMorgan to buy after they essentially failed during the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'VERY PAINFUL'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banks bolstered JPMorgan's bond trading and consumer banking businesses, and helped propel JPMorgan to record quarterly profits. But the legal costs connected with Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual have weighed on JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the third quarter, the bank lost $380 million, its first quarterly loss since 2004, after it recorded a $7.2 billion after-tax charge for legal expenses. On a call with analysts, Dimon acknowledged that the losses from Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual were "very painful to the company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, the bank can easily afford this deal. It said earlier this month that it has set aside a total of $23 billion to cover legal settlements. In a typical quarter, it earns about $5 billion to $6 billion, and it has some $30 billion of cash on its books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department is leading the conversations between a host of government agencies and JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank. As part of the deal, the bank will continue to cooperate in criminal inquiries into people involved in the conduct at issue, said the first source, and JPMorgan itself could still face criminal charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement includes a $4 billion tentative deal with the Federal Housing Finance Agency that sources told Reuters about earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third source close to the matter characterized a broader $13 billion deal as likely, but cautioned that parts of the agreement are still being hammered out, and the settlement could conceivably fall apart. The bank's general counsel Stephen Cutler and Associate Attorney General Tony West are negotiating a statement of facts that will be part of a final agreement, the first source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Settlement talks started in September, as the Justice Department prepared to sue JPMorgan in California over mortgage securities that the bank sold in the runup to the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank and the Justice Department began discussing a broad deal that would resolve not only the inquiry into mortgage bonds it sold to investors between 2005 to 2007 that were backed by subprime and other risky residential mortgages, but also similar lawsuits from the FHFA, the National Credit Union Administration, the state of New York and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broader settlement is a product of a government working group created nearly two years ago to investigate misconduct in the residential mortgage-backed securities market that contributed to the financial crisis.

said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials at JPMorgan and the Justice Department declined
to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another source close to the discussions characterized a deal
as likely, but cautioned that parts of the agreement are still
being hammered out, and the settlement could conceivably fall
apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The record settlement could help resolve many of the legal
troubles the New York bank is facing. Earlier this month
JPMorgan disclosed it had stockpiled $23 billion in reserves for
settlements and other legal expenses to help cover the myriad
investigations into its conduct before and after the financial
crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is being hammered out by some of the most senior
officials at the Department of Justice and the largest U.S.
bank. Attorney General Eric Holder and JPMorgan Chief Executive
Jamie Dimon spoke on the phone on Friday night to finalize the
broad outlines of the broad deal, the first source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's general counsel Stephen Cutler and Associate
Attorney General Tony West are negotiating a statement of facts
that will be part of a final agreement, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long considered one of the best-managed banks, JPMorgan has
stumbled in recent years, with run-ins with multiple federal
regulators as well as authorities in several states and foreign
countries over issues ranging from multibillion-dollar trading
losses and poor risk controls to probes into whether it
manipulated a power market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, as the Justice Department prepared to sue the
bank over mortgage securities that the bank sold in the run-up
to the financial crisis, JPMorgan tried to reach a broader
settlement with DOJ and other federal and state agencies to
resolve claims over its mortgage-related liabilities stemming
from the bust in house prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon went to Washington to meet with Holder on Sept. 25,
and discussed an $11 billion settlement at that point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the problems relate to mortgage bank Washington
Mutual and investment bank Bear Stearns, two failing firms that
JPMorgan took over in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank and the Justice Department have been discussing a
broad deal that would resolve not only the inquiry into mortgage
bonds it sold to investors between 2005 to 2007 that were backed
by subprime and other risky residential mortgages, but also
similar lawsuits from the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the
National Credit Union Administration, the state of New York and

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co CEO Jamie Dimon has pleaded with and complained to the U.S. Justice Department but cannot convince the government to end its criminal probe of his bank because prosecutors are not yet certain of their findings, people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon has negotiated a tentative $13 billion deal to settle many of the U.S. investigations into mortgage bonds that JPMorgan - and the banks it bought during the financial crisis - sold to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the criminal investigation proved to be a sticking point during negotiations, the sources said, and Dimon's inability to win this point underscores the breadth of the problems his bank faces even after it resolves these mortgage suits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criminal probe relates to whether JPMorgan misrepresented the quality of the mortgages it was packaging into bonds and selling to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While JPMorgan was not about to admit wrongdoing, Dimon suspected that ending the criminal probe was a long shot and the bank was not interested in holding up all the other settlements to wait for that, one of the sources said. Civil cases require a lower burden of proof than criminal cases, and can often be wrapped up quicker than parallel criminal proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has set aside a total of $23 billion to pay for legal issues, and faces more than a dozen probes globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors did not want to end the criminal probe before they were sure of its findings, said several people familiar with the probe and other investigations of the banks. They said the investigation could take another several months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. President Barack Obama's administration has faced extensive criticism for its failure to prosecute bankers criminally for behavior that led to the financial crisis, which by some estimates has cost the United States economy nearly as much as it earns in a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama has set up a task force to investigate fraud and other activity that led to the meltdown. Former prosecutors and criminal defense lawyers not involved with the talks said that ending an early-stage criminal inquiry as part of the broader settlement could have created the appearance that JPMorgan was buying the right to flout the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that the Justice Department hopes to use its settlement with JPMorgan as a template for deals with other banks. The Federal Housing Finance Agency, one of the agencies negotiating with JPMorgan, is hoping to draw a $6 billion penalty from Bank of America, the Financial Times reported on Sunday. JPMorgan's settlement with the FHFA is expected to be closer to $4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRESSURE FROM BOARD, INVESTORS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon is under pressure from investors and the bank's board of directors to fix his frayed relationship with regulators and resolve the investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond mortgage-related probes, federal prosecutors are looking into whether JPMorgan broke laws in its handling of derivatives bets known as the "London Whale trades" that cost the bank more than $6 billion in trading losses, and more than $1 billion in regulatory fines so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, regulators are examining whether the bank gave jobs to children of executives at Chinese-owned companies to secure business in China, and whether it played any role in manipulating benchmark interest rates known as "Libor," to name a few of the more than a dozen probes it faces globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While JPMorgan and the government have agreed to broad outlines of the $13 billion agreement, many parts of the settlement are not yet finalized, including a deal to resolve lawsuits from the credit union regulator, according to another person familiar with the matter. The sources all spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are private.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tentative deal came after Dimon, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and some of their aides took part in a telephone call on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon has argued to the Justice Department that much of the conduct at issue stems from two firms the bank acquired with the encouragement of the U.S. government during the height of the crisis, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. It is unfair to penalize the bank for alleged sins that took place before it owned the two banks, Dimon has complained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has also said that the investigation will make JPMorgan reluctant to buy troubled institutions again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former U.S. officials acknowledged that they encouraged JPMorgan to buy investment bank Bear Stearns and mortgage lender WaMu, but added that the bank knew it was taking a risk with the deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking on CNBC earlier this month, former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson said that even though JPMorgan was "begged" to make the Bear Stearns and the WaMu acquisitions, the government did not make any guarantees on legal liabilities. "Jamie knew that at the time," Paulson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government has said it is taking the nature of the WaMu and Bear Stearns acquisitions into account, a source said. It is unclear how the fines the bank is expected to pay reflect that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some legal experts not involved with the talks say that JPMorgan does not have much of an argument when it comes to avoiding civil liability for Bear's and WaMu's mortgage abuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They weren't forced into it," said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON/NEW YORK Oct 20 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co
 CEO Jamie Dimon has pleaded with and complained to the
U.S. Justice Department but cannot convince the government to
end its criminal probe of his bank because prosecutors are not
yet certain of their findings, people familiar with the matter
said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon has negotiated a tentative $13 billion deal to settle
many of the U.S. investigations into mortgage bonds that
JPMorgan - and the banks it bought during the financial crisis -
sold to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the criminal investigation proved to be a sticking point
during negotiations, the sources said, and Dimon's inability to
win this point underscores the breadth of the problems his bank
faces even after it resolves these mortgage suits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criminal probe relates to whether JPMorgan
misrepresented the quality of the mortgages it was packaging
into bonds and selling to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While JPMorgan was not about to admit wrongdoing, Dimon
suspected that ending the criminal probe was a long shot and the
bank was not interested in holding up all the other settlements
to wait for that, one of the sources said. Civil cases require a
lower burden of proof than criminal cases, and can often be
wrapped up quicker than parallel criminal proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has set aside a total of $23 billion to pay for
legal issues, and faces more than a dozen probes globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors did not want to end the criminal probe before
they were sure of its findings, said several people familiar
with the probe and other investigations of the banks. They said
the investigation could take another several months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. President Barack Obama's administration has faced

to draw a $6 billion penalty from Bank of America, the
Financial Times reported on Sunday. JPMorgan's settlement with
the FHFA is expected to be closer to $4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRESSURE FROM BOARD, INVESTORS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon is under pressure from investors and the bank's board
of directors to fix his frayed relationship with regulators and
resolve the investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond mortgage-related probes, federal prosecutors are
looking into whether JPMorgan broke laws in its handling of
derivatives bets known as the "London Whale trades" that cost
the bank more than $6 billion in trading losses, and more than
$1 billion in regulatory fines so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, regulators are examining whether the bank gave jobs to
children of executives at Chinese-owned companies to secure
business in China, and whether it played any role in
manipulating benchmark interest rates known as "Libor," to name
a few of the more than a dozen probes it faces globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While JPMorgan and the government have agreed to broad
outlines of the $13 billion agreement, many parts of the
settlement are not yet finalized, including a deal to resolve
lawsuits from the credit union regulator, according to another
person familiar with the matter. The sources all spoke on
condition of anonymity because the talks are private.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tentative deal came after Dimon, U.S. Attorney General
Eric Holder and some of their aides took part in a telephone
call on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon has argued to the Justice Department that much of the
conduct at issue stems from two firms the bank acquired with the
encouragement of the U.S. government during the height of the
crisis, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. It is unfair to
penalize the bank for alleged sins that took place before it
owned the two banks, Dimon has complained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has also said that the investigation will make JPMorgan

JPMorgan to buy investment bank Bear Stearns and mortgage lender
WaMu, but added that the bank knew it was taking a risk with the
deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking on CNBC earlier this month, former Treasury
Secretary Hank Paulson said that even though JPMorgan was

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - By all accounts, JPMorgan Chase is on the verge of a record-setting $13 billion settlement with the Justice Department and other state and federal regulators that will resolve the bank's civil liability to the government for the sale of mortgage-backed securities, by JPMorgan itself and by Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still don't know precisely what admission JPMorgan will make as part of the deal, and based on the bank's shrewd blame-taking in its London Whale trade losses settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, we can assume any admissions will be tailored to limit collateral damage in private litigation. Nonetheless, regardless of how JPMorgan phrases its acceptance of responsibility, the bank's $13 billion settlement is an acknowledgment of the obvious: The mortgage-backed securities market was infested at its foundation, like a house gnawed away by termites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why are investors in private-label MBS still standing in the rubble of collapsed mortgage-backed trusts? We haven't seen a final allocation plan for the $13 billion settlement, but I haven't seen any indication that money has been set aside for private investors in JPMorgan, Bear or WaMu MBS offerings. To the contrary: Certificate holders are already asking whether the bank intends to shift the cost of the settlement's reported relief to underwater homeowners on to MBS trusts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors in private-label MBS have experienced hundreds of billions of dollars in losses. Let's look, for instance, at JPMorgan's description of the fate of mortgage-backed securities sold by the bank and its predecessors Bear and WaMu. According to JPMorgan's 2012 annual report, the three entities sold a combined $450 billion in MBS to private investors (as opposed to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) between 2005 and 2008. More than a quarter of the original face value of the securities, or $118 billion of that $450 billion, has been liquidated, with investors suffering average losses of more than 60 percent on liquidated underlying loans. By my math, that's about $71 billion in losses for private-label JPM, Bear and WaMu MBS trusts as of the filing of the bank's annual report last December - with more likely, since the report also disclosed that $39 billion in underlying mortgage loans were at least 60 days overdue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RIGGED BY SELLERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So private investors in JPMorgan MBS trusts are out at least $71 billion and possibly as much as $90 billion. Of course, JPMorgan and its predecessors aren't to blame for all of those losses. Some of them, as MBS issuers have been proclaiming since the first MBS fraud suit was filed five or so years ago, were unquestionably due to the collapse of the economy. Homeowners who otherwise would have faithfully paid their mortgages, directing revenue to MBS investors, lost their jobs and defaulted on loans. It's also true that MBS purchasers were supposed to be sophisticated investors with a high tolerance for risk and their own due diligence capabilities. To return to the termite analogy, MBS purchasers - in the view of MBS defendants - shouldn't be able to claim that they relied on assurances from a seller when they didn't take care to bring in their own home inspector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what we've learned in the last five years - partly through private MBS litigation: first, fraud suits by bond insurers and investors suing through class actions; later, fraud claims by individual investors and breach of contract suits by MBS trustees acting at the direction of certificate holders - is that the MBS process was rigged by sellers. Mortgage originators knew they were writing loans that didn't meet their stated underwriting standards. MBS sponsors disregarded reports by their own re-underwriters about deficiencies in the loans. Credit rating agencies were more concerned with capturing their share of the lucrative market in rating complex securities than in evaluating the offerings with investors in mind. The sell side knew it was peddling heaps of junk. Many (albeit not all) on the buy side didn't share that knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan settlement proves that government entities will recoup at least a chunk of what they lost as a result of the banks' deception, even though state and federal regulators took far more time than private investors to recognize systemic rot in the MBS market. By the summer of 2011, when the Federal Housing Finance Agency filed a slew of securities fraud cases based on MBS purchases by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, untold private investors had already been excluded from class actions by federal judges who generally restricted such cases to trusts in which lead plaintiffs held a stake. To settle its claims against JPMorgan and its predecessors, Fannie and Freddie's conservator will reportedly receive $4 billion as part of the JPMorgan settlement. The National Credit Union Administration, which has brought MBS fraud suits on behalf of failed credit unions, is also said to be slated for a piece of the settlement, as is the New York attorney general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private investors haven't fared nearly as well in fraud cases. MBS class actions have been a big disappointment for certificate holders, even after the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals redefined standing to permit more claims. Some certificate holders will recover pennies on the dollar of their losses through MBS class actions. But with total MBS class action settlements totaling less than $2 billion and addressing losses in a very restricted number of trusts, I'm willing to bet that most MBS holders haven't and won't see any recovery on their losses through mass litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some individual investors with big MBS losses, including several European regional banks and U.S. investors like AIG, Allstate and Mass Mutual, decided it was worth their while to file individual fraud suits, often relying on state and common law claims after time ran out on their causes of action under federal securities laws. A few of those cases, as I reported last week, have quietly settled on confidential terms. I doubt, however, that if you added up every dollar of recovery for fraud claims asserted by private MBS certificate holders (excluding bond insurers), you'd come up with the $4 billion FHFA is said to be getting to settle its fraud suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAGEY ABOUT DISCLOSURES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors' breach-of-contract claims may still bring recoveries that MBS fraud litigation has not. In these suits, as you know, certificate holders in a particular trust direct the MBS trustee to demand that banks repurchase, or put back, underlying mortgages that materially breach contractual representations about loan terms. In the last two years - after Bank of America agreed to settle put-back claims by private Countrywide MBS investors for $8.5 billion - certificate holders have swamped New York state and federal dockets with put-back suits. (Many of the cases have been filed by investor groups that bought MBS specifically to assert put-back claims.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, for one, is cagey about its disclosures on these suits. Its third-quarter earnings report suggests that it has received $1.3 billion in put-back demands from trustees of private MBS trusts, but the bank said that the disclosure excludes claims that are the subject of pending or threatened litigation - and we already know that the big institutional investors that negotiated BofA's put-back deal have targeted JPMorgan (as well as other banks). It could be that investors in private JPMorgan, Bear and WaMu MBS are demanding breach-of-contract damages for a big percentage of the $71 billion in losses they've experienced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps put-back settlements will bring private investors recoveries akin to those the government stands to see in the JPMorgan deal. Something's out of whack if private-label MBS holders can't mitigate their losses. Our securities regime is premised on a fair balance of information between buyers and sellers. That balance was off in the MBS market, no less for private investors than for the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alison Frankel; Editing by Ted Botha)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Oct 21 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday
refused to let Yahoo Inc YHOO.O delay using Microsoft Corp's
 Bing search capabilities in Taiwan and Hong Kong,
affirming an arbitrator's decision in favor of Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo Inc Chief Executive Marissa Mayer sought to slow the

Steve Ballmer's decision to retire had raised concerns,
according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson Jr upheld an
arbitrator's earlier ruling in favor of Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo and Microsoft began a 10-year search partnership in
2010, before Mayer took over as Yahoo's CEO. The two companies
hoped their combined efforts could mount a more competitive
challenge to Google Inc, the world's No.1 search engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partnership has not lived up to expectations. Google
remains the dominant search engine, with roughly two thirds of
the U.S. search market, while Microsoft and Yahoo's combined
share of the market is essentially unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo said it wanted to pause the process until Mayer had a
chance to discuss the partnership with Ballmer's successor,
according to a court filing. Microsoft said in August that
Ballmer would retire within 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mayer has criticized the partnership in the past. "We need
to see monetization working better because we know that it can
and we've seen other competitors in the space illustrate how
well it can work," Mayer said at an investor conference in
February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Yahoo were not immediately available for

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By all accounts, JPMorgan Chase is on the verge of a record-setting $13 billion settlement with the Justice Department and other state and federal regulators that will resolve the banks civil liability to the government for the sale of mortgage-backed securities, by JPMorgan itself and by Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. We still dont know precisely what admission JPMorgan will make as part of the deal, and based on the banks shrewd blame-taking in its London Whale trade losses settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, we can assume any admissions will be tailored to limit collateral damage in private litigation. Nonetheless, regardless of how JPMorgan phrases its acceptance of responsibility, the banks $13 billion settlement is an acknowledgment of the obvious: The mortgage-backed securities market was infested at its foundation, like a house gnawed away by termites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why are investors in private-label MBS still standing in the rubble of collapsed mortgage-backed trusts? We havent seen a final allocation plan for the $13 billion settlement, but I havent seen any indication that money has been set aside for private investors in JPMorgan, Bear or WaMu MBS offerings. To the contrary: Certificate holders are already asking whether the bank intends to shift the cost of the settlements reported relief to underwater homeowners on to MBS trusts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors in private-label MBS have experienced hundreds of billions of dollars in losses. Lets look, for instance, at JPMorgans description of the fate of mortgage-backed securities sold by the bank and its predecessors Bear and WaMu. According to JPMorgans 2012 annual report, the three entities sold a combined $450 billion in MBS to private investors (as opposed to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) between 2005 and 2008. More than a quarter of the original face value of the securities, or $118 billion of that $450 billion, has been liquidated, with investors suffering average losses of more than 60 percent on liquidated underlying loans. By my math, thats about $71 billion in losses for private-label JPM, Bear and WaMu MBS trusts as of the filing of the banks annual report last December  with more likely, since the report also disclosed that $39 billion in underlying mortgage loans were at least 60 days overdue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So private investors in JPMorgan MBS trusts are out at least $71 billion and possibly as much as $90 billion. Of course, JPMorgan and its predecessors arent to blame for all of those losses. Some of them, as MBS issuers have been proclaiming since the first MBS fraud suit was filed five or so years ago, were unquestionably due to the collapse of the economy. Homeowners who otherwise would have faithfully paid their mortgages, directing revenue to MBS investors, lost their jobs and defaulted on loans. Its also true that MBS purchasers were supposed to be sophisticated investors with a high tolerance for risk and their own due diligence capabilities. To return to the termite analogy, MBS purchasers  in the view of MBS defendants  shouldnt be able to claim that they relied on assurances from a seller when they didnt take care to bring in their own home inspector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what weve learned in the last five years  partly through private MBS litigation: first, fraud suits by bond insurers and investors suing through class actions; later, fraud claims by individual investors and breach of contract suits by MBS trustees acting at the direction of certificate holders  is that the MBS process was rigged by sellers. Mortgage originators knew they were writing loans that didnt meet their stated underwriting standards. MBS sponsors disregarded reports by their own re-underwriters about deficiencies in the loans. Credit rating agencies were more concerned with capturing their share of the lucrative market in rating complex securities than in evaluating the offerings with investors in mind. The sell side knew it was peddling heaps of junk. Many (albeit not all) on the buy side didnt share that knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan settlement proves that government entities will recoup at least a chunk of what they lost as a result of the banks deception, even though state and federal regulators took far more time than private investors to recognize systemic rot in the MBS market. By the summer of 2011, when the Federal Housing Finance Agency filed a slew of securities fraud cases based on MBS purchases by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, untold private investors had already been excluded from class actions by federal judges who generally restricted such cases to trusts in which lead plaintiffs held a stake. To settle its claims against JPMorgan and its predecessors, Fannie and Freddies conservator will reportedly receive $4 billion as part of the JPMorgan settlement. The National Credit Union Administration, which has brought MBS fraud suits on behalf of failed credit unions, is also said to be slated for a piece of the settlement, as is the New York attorney general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private investors havent fared nearly as well in fraud cases. MBS class actions have been a big disappointment for certificate holders, even after the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals redefined standing to permit more claims. Some certificate holders will recover pennies on the dollar of their losses through MBS class actions. But with total MBS class action settlements totaling less than $2 billion and addressing losses in a very restricted number of trusts, Im willing to bet that most MBS holders havent and wont see any recovery on their losses through mass litigation. Some individual investors with big MBS losses, including several European regional banks and U.S. investors like AIG, Allstate and Mass Mutual, decided it was worth their while to file individual fraud suits, often relying on state and common law claims after time ran out on their causes of action under federal securities laws. A few of those cases, as I reported last week, have quietly settled on confidential terms. I doubt, however, that if you added up every dollar of recovery for fraud claims asserted by private MBS certificate holders (excluding bond insurers), youd come up with the $4 billion FHFA is said to be getting to settle its fraud suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors breach-of-contract claims may still bring recoveries that MBS fraud litigation has not. In these suits, as you know, certificate holders in a particular trust direct the MBS trustee to demand that banks repurchase, or put back, underlying mortgages that materially breach contractual representations about loan terms. In the last two years  after Bank of America agreed to settle put-back claims by private Countrywide MBS investors for $8.5 billion  certificate holders have swamped New York state and federal dockets with put-back suits. (Many of the cases have been filed by investor groups that bought MBS specifically to assert put-back claims.) JPMorgan, for one, is cagey about its disclosures on these suits. Its third-quarter earnings report suggests that it has received $1.3 billion in put-back demands from trustees of private MBS trusts, but the bank said that the disclosure excludes claims that are the subject of pending or threatened litigation  and we already know that the big institutional investors that negotiated BofAs put-back deal have targeted JPMorgan (as well as other banks). It could be that investors in private JPMorgan, Bear and WaMu MBS are demanding breach-of-contract damages for a big percentage of the $71 billion in losses theyve experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps put-back settlements will bring private investors recoveries akin to those the government stands to see in the JPMorgan deal. Somethings out of whack if private-label MBS holders cant mitigate their losses. Our securities regime is premised on a fair balance of information between buyers and sellers. That balance was off in the MBS market, no less for private investors than for the government.&lt;/p&gt;

			Michael Evans to Retire from Goldman Sachs
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) announced today that J. Michael 
      Evans, a vice chairman of Goldman Sachs and global head of Growth 
      Markets, has decided to retire at the end of the year after more than 20 
      years at the firm. He will become a senior director upon his retirement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Michael&#8217;s deep commitment to the firm, his unrelenting focus on our 
      clients and his broad global market knowledge have left an extraordinary 
      mark at Goldman Sachs,&#8221; said Lloyd C. Blankfein, Chairman and CEO. &#8220;We 
      particularly appreciate the role he played developing our client 
      franchise across Asia, and his work co-chairing the Business Standards 
      Committee, which was an unparalleled effort to review our business 
      standards and practices. We are pleased that we will continue to benefit 
      from his advice and counsel as a senior director.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Evans joined Goldman Sachs in 1993 in the Investment Banking Division in 
      London and was named a partner in 1994.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As global head of Equity Capital Markets, Evans was at the center of 
      many privatizations in Europe and Asia Pacific in the 1990&#8217;s and went on 
      to play an integral role in the success of the firm&#8217;s initial public 
      offering in May 1999.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In 2001, he became co-head of the Equities Division, working in both New 
      York and London. Two years later, Evans became global co-head of the 
      Securities Division, where he helped cement our position as a leading 
      market maker and underwriter to investors and companies globally.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In 2004, he relocated to Hong Kong as Chairman of Goldman Sachs Asia 
      Pacific, a position he held for seven years. There, Evans helped shape 
      our strategy and footprint, deepen our leadership bench and develop 
      important client relationships.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Over the last three years, Evans was co-chair of the firm&#8217;s Business 
      Standards Committee, where he helped oversee the most extensive review 
      of the firm&#8217;s business standards and practices in its 144 year history. 
      The Committee&#8217;s work resulted in significant changes in how the firm 
      addresses important issues related to clients, reputational risk and 
      accountability.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Evans was named a vice chairman of Goldman Sachs in 2008. In 2011, he 
      was named global head of Growth Markets, responsible for driving our 
      strategy, resource allocation and many client relationships across the 
      firm in these important markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is a leading global investment banking,

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 21 (Reuters) - Investors poured cash back into
U.S. money market funds the day after Washington reached an
agreement to raise the federal debt ceiling temporarily and
avert a default, J.P. Morgan Securities analysts said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to Wednesday's debt deal, money funds, which are seen
as alternative to bank accounts, had heavy redemptions as
investors fretted over a possible U.S. default on the interest
rates on Treasury bills and its impact on the rest of the
short-term credit market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interest rates on one-month Treasury bills briefly rose
above 0.70 percent last week before President Barack Obama and
top Republican lawmakers reached a deal to increase the federal
borrowing cap and to end the first partial government shutdown
in 17 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than $26 billion returned to money funds on Thursday,
the day after the deal to raise the statutory debt limit to
$16.7 trillion, J.P. Morgan analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on data from iMoneynet, they estimated the one-day
rise in money fund assets was nearly 40 percent of all the cash
investors pulled from money funds in the days leading up to the
debt deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly $8 billion of the money made its way to money funds
that invest only in short-term Treasury debt, while about $9
billion returned to those that fund government and agency
securities. The rest of the inflows went into prime funds that
can invest in commercial paper and corporate debt, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House and lawmakers have agreed to work on a
long-term budget deal before the next debt ceiling deadline of
Feb. 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We suspect by early this week (money fund) balances would
be fully recovered to pre-debt ceiling levels," the J.P. Morgan
analysts wrote in their report.&lt;/p&gt;

			Goldman Sachs Asset Management to Acquire RBS&#8217; Money Market Funds
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman Sachs Asset Management (&#8220;GSAM&#8221;) announced today that it will 
      acquire the Global Treasury Funds, which are a range of money market 
      funds managed by RBS Asset Management (&#8221;RBSAM&#8221;).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      GSAM has a long history of partnering with institutions to deliver 
      liquidity solutions and over 30 years of experience managing money 
      market funds using a conservative approach. This transaction complements 
      GSAM&#8217;s strong fixed income and liquidity management businesses in Europe 
      and globally.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;GSAM&#8217;s acquisition of these money market funds emphasizes our strong 
      and continued commitment to providing liquidity solutions on a global 
      scale,&#8221; said Timothy J. O&#8217;Neill and Eric S. Lane, co-heads of the 
      Investment Management Division at Goldman Sachs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;GSAM is a global leader in liquidity management with $195 billion in 
      money market fund assets under management, 33% of which is in Europe*,&#8221; 
      said Kathleen Hughes, GSAM&#8217;s Global Head of Liquidity Sales and European 
      Head of Institutional Sales. &#8220;This acquisition has the potential to 
      nearly double the size of our Sterling-denominated offering and 
      strengthen GSAM&#8217;s position in the European market, ensuring we are well 
      positioned to deliver the scale and service that our clients have come 
      to expect.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the transaction, Scott McMunn, CEO, RBSAM said: &#8220;From 
      RBS&#8217;s perspective, this transaction represents another stage in our 
      strategic plan to focus on our core customer franchises. We are 
      confident that this represents the best deal for our clients.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RBS has decided to exit, confident that GSAM can provide its current 
      clients with high caliber money market solutions and services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Both RBS and GSAM are fully committed to continuing excellent service 
      for RBS money market fund clients and will work in partnership to ensure 
      a seamless transition. There will be no changes in how accounts will be 
      managed during the transition period and no expenses will be borne by 
      any of the funds or investors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014, 
      subject to approval by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Irish Stock 
      Exchange (the Global Treasury Funds are Irish domiciled funds), as well 
      as a fund investor vote.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's preliminary $13 billion mortgage settlement with the U.S. government could end up costing the bank closer to $9 billion after taxes, because the majority of the deal is expected to be tax deductible, two sources familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deduction also means the government is getting less than it appears in this deal. Banks can often deduct legal settlements from their taxes, but cannot get tax benefits from penalties for violating laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and the U.S. government have been negotiating the tax treatment of the settlement. The outcome could have a dramatic impact on exactly what the deal ends up costing the bank, how it is perceived by the public and whether it becomes a model for resolving government investigations of mortgage deals at other banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is negotiating the settlement with a group of government agencies led by the Justice Department, and the deal is expected to include a $2 billion penalty, one source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But another $4 billion of the deal, which will go toward aid for struggling mortgage borrowers, is tax deductible, another person familiar with the negotiations said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the remaining $7 billion will be addressed remains unclear, but most, if not all, is likely to be deductible. Much of it is intended to compensate investors for shoddy mortgage securities they purchased from JPMorgan, as well as Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, failing banks JPMorgan acquired during the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those payments would usually be deductible as a normal business expense, as would payments by an appliance manufacturer to make good on defective washing machines, said tax expert Robert Willens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If $11 billion is tax deductible, and assuming a 38 percent tax rate, the tax deduction could save JPMorgan as much as $4.18 billion, Willens said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government, however, could negotiate an exception and require that JPMorgan agree not to deduct some of those expenses from its taxable income, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is some precedent for such an exception. When Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $550 million in 2010 to resolve charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission, for example, the deal specifically forbade the bank from claiming a tax deduction on the portion of the settlement designed to compensate harmed investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A TEMPLATE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public's reaction to the government's deal with JPMorgan could help determine whether it becomes a model for concluding investigations of other big banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration has faced much criticism for bringing few marquee cases against Wall Street firms or executives for conduct that fueled the housing bubble and subsequent collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department set up a task force last year to probe that misconduct, and the JPMorgan action arose from that effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A point of tension in the negotiations, and a subject of public commentary, has been how much JPMorgan would have to pay for bad mortgage deals at Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. JPMorgan bought those two banks with the encouragement of government officials who were trying to stem the financial crisis, but the bank has also generated big profits from the Bear and WaMu acquisitions since the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $2 billion enforcement penalty would only apply to mortgage deals that JPMorgan did itself before the crisis, according to two people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There would be no penalties for mortgage bonds from Bear Stearns or Washington Mutual, just reimbursement for losses, such as those that government agencies have said they suffered, the people said. The two government mortgage finance agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said they bought mortgages from Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual that should never have been packaged into bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan experience has triggered discussions among bank merger lawyers about how they can get indemnification clauses into future bailout deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan reported a third-quarter loss, the first under CEO Jamie Dimon, on October 11 as it recorded a $7.2 billion after-tax expense to add to its legal reserves in anticipation of a settlement with the government. The pre-tax expense was $9.15 billion, the company said. That addition to its reserves was not only for the mortgage probes, and includes other legal matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company did not say how much of its previously established legal reserves might have been earmarked for the mortgage cases government agencies are investigating. After the additions, JPMorgan said its legal reserves stood at $23 billion at the end of the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Aruna Viswanatha in Washington and David Henry in New York; Editing by Dan Wilchins, Tim Dobbyn and Dan Grebler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) must pay some legal fees incurred by a former computer programmer accused of stealing code from the bank because his title of vice president made him a bank officer at the time, a New Jersey federal judge ruled Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest twist in an unusual white-collar criminal case, U.S. District Judge Kevin McNulty ordered the bank to pay for Sergey Aleynikov's defense against state charges, which has cost $700,000 thus far, according to his lawyer, Kevin Marino.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, McNulty postponed a decision on whether Goldman must also pay for the money Aleynikov spent defending himself against previous federal charges, as well as costs incurred in fighting the bank over the legal-fee dispute. Those fees exceed $3.3 million, Marino said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors first charged Aleynikov in 2009 with stealing code as he prepared to join a high-frequency startup firm in Chicago. He was convicted by a jury in 2010, but a federal appeals court overturned the verdict in February 2012, saying federal corporate espionage laws did not apply to his alleged actions, and freed him after nearly a year in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance then brought state felony charges against Aleynikov. A Manhattan state judge denied Aleynikov's bid to dismiss the case because of double jeopardy, finding that the federal and state charges were different even though the underlying allegations were the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his 34-page ruling, McNulty said Goldman's own by-laws require the bank to pay legal fees for any "officer" named as a civil or criminal defendant in connection with their role at the bank. The question, he said, was whether a "vice president" should be considered an officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman argued that vice presidents are frequently mid-level employees without the kind of managerial responsibility typically associated with an officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But McNulty said the bank's by-laws failed to define clearly who is entitled to legal fees, leaving him to rely on the "uncontroversial" notion that vice presidents are officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman might easily have chosen to be more sparing with job titles, or to confer them in some other way," he wrote. "It might have easily drafted its by-laws to restrict indemnification to a well-defined class. It did not."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge said he understood that Goldman, the alleged victim, might find it "galling" to pay for Aleynikov's defense. But he noted that Goldman has paid the legal costs for 51 of the 53 employees who have sought coverage in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That tally includes Fabrice Tourre, a former vice president found liable for securities fraud after a civil trial this year, and former director Rajat Gupta, convicted of insider trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Aleynikov is convicted of the state charges, the bank could attempt to claw back his defense fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Aleynikov v. The Goldman Sachs Group, U.S. District Court for New Jersey, No. 12-5994.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joseph Ax; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

alleged actions, and freed him after nearly a year in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance then brought state
felony charges against Aleynikov. A Manhattan state judge denied
Aleynikov's bid to dismiss the case because of double jeopardy,
finding that the federal and state charges were different even
though the underlying allegations were the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his 34-page ruling, McNulty said Goldman's own by-laws
require the bank to pay legal fees for any "officer" named as a
civil or criminal defendant in connection with their role at the
bank. The question, he said, was whether a "vice president"
should be considered an officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman argued that vice presidents are frequently mid-level
employees without the kind of managerial responsibility
typically associated with an officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But McNulty said the bank's by-laws failed to define clearly
who is entitled to legal fees, leaving him to rely on the
"uncontroversial" notion that vice presidents are officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman might easily have chosen to be more sparing with
job titles, or to confer them in some other way," he wrote. "It
might have easily drafted its by-laws to restrict
indemnification to a well-defined class. It did not."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge said he understood that Goldman, the alleged
victim, might find it "galling" to pay for Aleynikov's defense.
But he noted that Goldman has paid the legal costs for 51 of the
53 employees who have sought coverage in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That tally includes Fabrice Tourre, a former vice president
found liable for securities fraud after a civil trial this year,
and former director Rajat Gupta, convicted of insider trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Aleynikov is convicted of the state charges, the bank
could attempt to claw back his defense fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Aleynikov v. The Goldman Sachs Group, U.S.
District Court for New Jersey, No. 12-5994.&lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch Assigns Final Ratings to JPMCC Commercial Mortgage Pass Through 
      Ctfs Series 2013-INN
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to 
      the JPMorgan Commercial Mortgage Finance Corp. Commercial Mortgage Pass 
      Through Certificates, JPMCC 2013-INN:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$287,700,000 class A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$488,750,000* class X-CP 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$575,000,000* class X-EXT 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$83,600,000 class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$63,400,000 class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$66,300,000 class D 'BBB-sf; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$74,000,000 class E 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      *Notional and interest only.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The certificates in this transaction represent the beneficial interest 
      in a trust that holds a $575 million mortgage loan secured by 51 hotel 
      properties with a total of 6,844 keys located in 16 states across the 
      U.S. The loan is sponsored by a joint venture between Cerberus Capital 
      Management, L.P. and Chatham Lodging Trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Moderate Trust Leverage: Fitch's stressed DSCR and loan to value ratio 
      (LTV) for the trust component of the debt are 1.37x and 77.9%, 
      respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Single-Borrower Hotel Concentration: The transaction is primarily 
      secured by 51 extended stay, limited service, and full service hotel 
      properties. Hotel performance is considered to be more volatile due to 
      the lodging sector's operating nature.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Portfolio Performance: After experiencing two years of year-over-year 
      revenue per available room (RevPAR) declines, the portfolio's 
      year-over-year RevPAR performance turned positive beginning in 2010. 
      Subsequently, portfolio RevPAR grew 5.1% in 2011 and 10% in 2012. 
      Overall, the portfolio's TTM (as of July 2013) RevPAR performance is 
      approximately 5.3% above its previous peak performance in 2007.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Diversity: The portfolio exhibits significant geographic diversity 
      across 32 markets in 16 states. The largest state exposure is California 
      with 10 hotels representing 37.3% by allocated loan amount. No single 
      hotel contributes more than 6.8% of net cash flow (NCF). The portfolio 
      is comprised of eight different franchise flags, with the Marriott 
      extended stay brand (Residence Inn) being the majority, serving as the 
      flag for 68.8% (by loan balance) of the total portfolio.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Asset Quality and Age: The 51 properties comprising the portfolio have 
      an average age of 25 years (built from 1963 - 2006) and have generally 
      been renovated most recently between 2007 and 2012. The portfolio 
      demonstrates little performance differentiation based on property age. 
      The portfolio's assets are well maintained, with $141.8 million ($20,716 
      per key) of capital improvements spent from 2007 - 2012. In addition, 
      $96.6 million ($14,113 per key) in capital improvements are budgeted 
      through 2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch found that the pool could withstand a 77.2% decline in value and 
      an approximately 63% decrease in the most recent actual cash flow prior 
      to experiencing $1 of loss to the 'AAAsf' rated class.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings of class A (rated 'AAAsf' 
      by Fitch) and found that a 17% decline in Fitch NCF would result in a 
      one category downgrade, while a 46% decline would result in a downgrade 
      to below investment grade. The Rating Sensitivity section in the presale 
      report includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and 
      sensitivities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A detailed description of Fitch's rating analysis including key rating 
      drivers, stresses, rating sensitivity, analysis, model, criteria 
      application and data adequacy is available in Fitch's presale report 
      dated Sept. 26, 2013.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - As the U.S. government closes in on a $13 billion settlement with JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) over its mortgage practices, lawyers specializing in bank mergers are looking for ways to protect their clients from big losses in similar cases in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big chunk of the record settlement is attributed to bad mortgage loans at Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns - two banks that U.S. financial regulators encouraged JPMorgan to buy during the 2008 financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That has triggered discussions among bank merger lawyers about how they can get indemnification clauses into future bailout deals, and obtain greater protection from losses from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, which seizes and sells troubled banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the FDIC coordinates the sale of such banks, it often agrees to limit the losses that the acquiring bank may face on troubled assets. It did this, for example, in 2008 to help Citigroup Inc (C.N) buy parts of Wachovia Corp, which was ultimately bought without government assistance by Wells Fargo &amp; Co (WFC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One idea that lawyers are discussing is expanding the scope of these loss-sharing agreements with the FDIC to cover potential regulatory action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are talking about what kind of increased insurance against liabilities they can put in place," said Donald Lamson, a partner at Shearman &amp; Sterling LLP in Washington, D.C. "Banks in general are going to be more leery of going into these kinds of deals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reluctance of banks to buy failed institutions could cause headaches for regulators in future crises. While only 22 banks have failed so far this year, that pales compared with the 140 that succumbed in 2009 and 157 in 2010, a failure rate that stretched FDIC resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is expected to finalize its settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice in the coming days. It originally paid rock-bottom prices for Bear and Washington Mutual, forking out only around $3.4 billion for both and becoming the largest U.S. bank. But it has since incurred billions of dollars of legal costs and writedowns linked to both companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan now complains that it is being unfairly punished for doing a good turn for the government and economy during the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is like buying a home at foreclosure: you know you're buying at a bargain basement price, but there may be risks," said Jeffrey Manns, an associate professor at George Washington University Law School. "There is no such thing as a free lunch."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers said JPMorgan's experience is spurring them to try to carve out broader protections for bank bailouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The idea would be to make the language as broad as possible to include regulatory issues and past acts of the predecessor banks so clients are assured they are covered," said Lawrence Kaplan of Paul Hastings LLP in Washington, D.C., and previously a lawyer for the government's former Office of Thrift Supervision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that most banks will want to extend loss-sharing arrangements with the FDIC beyond the usual five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mann explained: "Lawyers are known for pessimism and being negative, but they now have to be more so in assessing the risks of potential acquisitions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitchell Raab, a partner at Olshan Frome Wolosky LLP in New York, said acquiring banks could negotiate a potential reduction in the purchase price if a takeover does not work out as planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is difficult for acquirers to fully defend against possible regulatory action arising from the past activity of the banks they buy. Lawyers said any protections they structure will have limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The FDIC can't say it will forbid the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission from taking an action against your firm over poor disclosures that were made," Lamson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the same holds true for any criminal conduct that the Justice Department or state attorneys general may pursue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only way to fully protect clients may be to convince them not to do deals in the first place, some lawyers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the decision is undertaken to do one of these deals, it should be done in a very careful way," Lamson said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 22 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc 
must pay some legal fees incurred by a former computer
programmer accused of stealing code from the bank because his
title of vice president made him a bank officer at the time, a
New Jersey federal judge ruled Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest twist in an unusual white-collar criminal
case, U.S. District Judge Kevin McNulty ordered the bank to pay
for Aleynikov's defense against state charges, which has cost
$700,000 thus far, according to his lawyer, Kevin Marino.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, McNulty postponed a decision on whether Goldman
must also pay for the money Aleynikov spent defending himself
against previous federal charges, as well as costs incurred in
fighting the bank over the legal-fee dispute. Those fees exceed
$3.3 million, Marino said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors first charged Aleynikov in 2009 with
stealing code as he prepared to join a high-frequency startup
firm in Chicago. He was convicted by a jury in 2010, but a
federal appeals court overturned the verdict in February 2012,
saying federal corporate espionage laws did not apply to his
alleged actions, and freed him after nearly a year in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance then brought state
felony charges against Aleynikov. A Manhattan state judge denied
Aleynikov's bid to dismiss the case because of double jeopardy,
finding that the federal and state charges were different even
though the underlying allegations were the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his 34-page ruling, McNulty said Goldman's own by-laws
require the bank to pay legal fees for any "officer" named as a
civil or criminal defendant in connection with their role at the
bank. The question, he said, was whether a "vice president"
should be considered an officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman argued that vice presidents are frequently mid-level
employees without the kind of managerial responsibility
typically associated with an officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But McNulty said the bank's by-laws failed to define clearly
who is entitled to legal fees, leaving him to rely on the
"uncontroversial" notion that vice presidents are officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge said he understood that Goldman, the alleged
victim, may find it "galling" to pay for Aleynikov's defense.
But he noted that Goldman has paid the legal costs for 51 of the
53 employees who have sought coverage in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That tally includes Fabrice Tourre, a former vice president
found liable for securities fraud after a civil trial this year,
and former director Rajat Gupta, convicted of insider trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Aleynikov is convicted of the state charges, the bank
could attempt to claw back his defense fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Aleynikov v. The Goldman Sachs Group, U.S.
District Court for New Jersey, No. 12-5994.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lumia 2520 tablet, along with the Lumia 1320 and 1520 phones are among the last products Nokia developed before deciding to sell the devices unit to Microsoft in a deal that is due to close in the first quarter of next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia, once the global leader in mobile phones, arrived late to the smartphone race and has struggled to catch up with Apple and Samsung, who dominate the increasingly crowded market for large-screen smartphones, known as phablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lumia tablet, which has a 10-inch screen, will also face tough competition from the likes of Apple, which is expected to unveil slimmer, faster iPads on Tuesday. The phablets, which both have 6-inch screens, will take on a multitude of similar devices from Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said the new products, which will retain the Nokia brand after the Microsoft handover, are priced low enough to attract interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lumia 2520, which comes in glossy red and white as well as matt cyan and black versions, is expected to start shipping in the fourth quarter for about $499.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The tablet is a nice design, it's a good-value proposition," Gartner analyst Annette Zimmermann said, though she doubts that Nokia's first foray into the tablet market will bring billions in sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POSSIBLE CLASH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others also questioned whether the new launch is enough to lure consumers back to Nokia and Microsoft, while Forrester analyst Thomas Husson said the Lumia 2520's position for Microsoft is unclear, particularly after the software giant launched its own tablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At midnight on Monday, Microsoft started selling its Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2 tablets. Still feeling its way in the computer hardware business, the company is banking on the lighter and faster models boosting the lackluster sales of its touch-screen devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite a more affordable price, the respective positioning of Nokia's tablet versus the Surface 2 is not obvious and will have to be dealt with after the Nokia acquisition," Husson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new devices will help Microsoft to increase the number of Windows users, but Husson said he expects it to remain a long way from "a significant installed base of consumers".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia's former chief executive Stephen Elop, hired in 2010 to turn round the company, decided in early 2011 to drop Nokia's own operating system in favor of the Microsoft's untested Windows Phone software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lumia devices have been well received by technology blogs and critics, but sales have been slow to pick up, partly because of a lack of Windows Phone apps and a limited marketing budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Ritsuko Ando; Editing by David Goodman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Lumia 2520 is Nokia's first tablet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Two 6-inch phablets to compete with Samsung&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Apple expected to launch new iPads on Tuesday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Matt Smith and Ritsuko Ando&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABU DHABI/HELSINKI, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Nokia 
unveiled its first tablet computer and new large-screen
smartphones, which will form part of Microsoft's push
in consumer devices when it takes over the Finnish company's
handset business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The products serve as a poignant way to mark the end of an
era for the former global leader in mobile phones, representing
its engineers' last-ditch attempts at regaining market share
from Apple and Samsung after its pitifully
slow start to the smartphone race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said that the Lumia 2520 tablet, along with the
Lumia 1320 and 1520 smartphones with 6-inch screens, are priced
low enough to attract interest but questioned whether they could
compete with rivals launching similar products in time for the
gift-giving holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch of the Lumia tablet with a 10-inch screen came
only hours before Apple, the trailblazer in lightweight mobile
computers, was expected to unveil new iPads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another concern voiced by analysts is that Nokia's tablet
could also clash with Microsoft's own Surface tablets once the
U.S. software company's acquisition goes through. The deal is
expected to close early next year after a Nokia shareholder vote
on Nov. 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia's new large-screen smartphones, known as phablets,
face an equally daunting task competing against a multitude of
similar devices from market leader Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Finnish company's 2011 decision adopt Windows Phone
software has failed to pay off and Apple's iOS and Google's
 Android operating systems control more than 90 percent
of the smartphone market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLENTY TO PROVE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nokia and Microsoft still have a lot to prove with respect
to Windows Phone," said Kevin Restivo, an analyst at research
firm IDC. "The new products address the demand for large-screen
devices. But for consumers ... the question is, why should I
choose Windows."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous Lumia devices have been well received by technology
blogs and critics, but sales have been slow, partly because of a
lack of Windows Phone apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDC estimates that Windows Phone's market share grew to 4.2
percent in the third quarter from 3.7 percent in the previous
three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia is targeting the top end of the market with the Lumia
1520 smartphone, hoping that potential customers agree that a
high-resolution 20-megapixel camera justifies an estimated price
tag of $749 when it goes on sale this year. The cheaper Lumia
1320 will follow next year at an estimated $339.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lumia 2520 tablet, meanwhile, will be available in
glossy red and white as well as matt cyan and black versions
when it goes on sale at an estimated $499, with Nokia saying
that it will be targeting Christmas and Thanksgiving shoppers in
the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its challenge to Apple's iPad could be enhanced by business
applications such as Microsoft Word and Excel, an optional
keyboard cover to allow full finger-and-thumb typing and two USB
ports for additional devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PORTFOLIO CLASH?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the Lumia's position in the Microsoft stable remains a
concern for some analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At midnight on Monday, Microsoft started selling its Surface
2 and Surface Pro 2 tablets. Still feeling its way in the
computer hardware business, the company is banking on the
lighter and faster models boosting the lacklustre sales of its
touch-screen devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite a more affordable price, the respective positioning
of Nokia's tablet versus the Surface 2 is not obvious and will
have to be dealt with after the Nokia acquisition," Forrester
analyst Thomas Husson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Surface 2 starts at $449 for the 32 GB version, while
the Surface Pro 2, starts at $899 for the 64 GB model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephen Elop, the former Nokia chief executive who now heads
the devices business and will return for his second stint at
Microsoft when the acquisition closes, said that the U.S.
company will adjust accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As we come together as one company we'll assess the whole
portfolio and how best to meet the needs of consumers," Elop
told Reuters at the Lumia launch event in Abu Dhabi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which now bills itself as a "devices and
services" company under a reorganisation started by CEO Steve
Ballmer this summer, is desperate to make a dent in the iPad's
dominance as sales of traditional PCs melt away. So far, it has
failed badly, taking a $900 million charge in July for unsold
Surface inventory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&#8211; No Change to Program Timelines and No Change to REMOXY Deal Economics &#8211;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			&#8211; Commercial Rights to Three Drug Assets Revert to Pain Therapeutics &#8211;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	AUSTIN, Texas, Oct. 22, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pain Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:PTIE) today reported Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has informed us that, having achieved technical milestones related to manufacturing, they will continue the development program for REMOXY&#174; (oxycodone) Extended-Release Capsules CII.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	We also were informed that, following guidance received from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) earlier this year, Pfizer will proceed with the additional clinical studies and other actions required to address the Complete Response Letter received in June 2011. These new clinical studies will include, in part, a pivotal bioequivalence study with the modified REMOXY formulation to bridge to the clinical data related to the original REMOXY formulation, and an abuse-potential study with the modified formulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The FDA did not require any further drug efficacy trials. As previously disclosed, the complete response submission is not expected to occur prior to mid-2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			REMOXY DEAL ECONOMICS ARE UNCHANGED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Pfizer is our exclusive, worldwide partner for REMOXY (except as to Australia/New Zealand). We are eligible to receive from Pfizer a $15.0 million payment upon FDA approval of REMOXY. After commercial launch, we will receive from Pfizer a royalty of 20% of net sales of REMOXY in the United States, except as to the first cumulative $1.0 billion in net sales, which royalty is set at 15%. The royalty rate outside the U.S. is 10%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, we will also receive from Pfizer a supplemental payment of 6% to 11.5% of net sales, depending on the range of total dollar sales in each year. This supplemental payment is tied to the full amount of our financial obligations to Durect Corporation (Nasdaq:DRRX), our exclusive supplier of certain excipients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			THREE ASSETS REVERT BACK TO US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Pfizer has returned to us all rights with respect to abuse-resistant formulations of hydrocodone, hydromorphone and oxymorphone. These drug assets now vest exclusively in PTI without any royalty or other obligation to Pfizer. We are now free to develop and commercialize these assets on our own or with a licensee of our choice, and may do so without notice or approval from Pfizer. Investigational New Drug (IND) applications for all three drug assets are in place with FDA. We have not yet made a decision to develop or to out-license the three drug assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			ABOUT REMOXY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Our lead drug candidate, REMOXY, is an extended-release oral formulation of oxycodone for the management of moderate-to-severe pain when a continuous, around-the-clock opioid analgesic is needed for an extended period of time. We designed REMOXY to discourage common methods of tampering and misuse.&#160;We developed REMOXY using technology from DURECT Corporation (Nasdaq:DRRX).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

			Pfizer Inc. Continues Development Program for Remoxy&#174; 
      (oxycodone) Extended-Release Capsules CII
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today that, having achieved technical 
      milestones related to manufacturing, it will continue the development 
      program for Remoxy&#174; (oxycodone) Extended-Release Capsules 
      CII. Following guidance received from the U.S. Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA) earlier this year, Pfizer will proceed with the 
      additional clinical studies and other actions required to address the 
      Complete Response Letter received in June 2011.&#160;These new clinical 
      studies will include, in part, a pivotal bioequivalence study with the 
      modified Remoxy formulation to bridge to the clinical data related to 
      the original Remoxy formulation, and an abuse-potential study with the 
      modified formulation. As previously disclosed, the complete response 
      submission is not expected to occur prior to mid-2015.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Remoxy is an investigational extended-release oral formulation of 
      oxycodone for the management of moderate-to-severe pain when a 
      continuous, around-the-clock opioid analgesic is needed for an extended 
      period of time. Remoxy was initially developed by Pain Therapeutics, 
      Inc. (NASDAQ: PTIE) using DURECT Corporation&#8217;s (NASDAQ: DRRX) ORADUR&#174; 
      technology, which is designed to discourage common methods of tampering. 
      In 2005, King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. entered into an agreement with Pain 
      Therapeutics, Inc. to develop and commercialize Remoxy. Pain 
      Therapeutics, Inc. filed the initial new drug application (NDA) for 
      Remoxy in June 2008 and received a Complete Response Letter in December 
      2008. King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. assumed full control of the development 
      of Remoxy in March 2009 and filed a resubmission of the Remoxy NDA in 
      December 2010. Pfizer obtained rights to Remoxy as part of its 
      acquisition of King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in February 2011.

&lt;p&gt;* Lumia 2520 is Nokia's first tablet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Two large-screen smartphones to compete with Samsung&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Devices to retain Nokia brand after Microsoft handover&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Apple expected to launch new iPads on Tuesday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Matt Smith&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABU DHABI, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Nokia has unveiled
its first tablet and large-screen smartphones, which will form
part of Microsoft's global push to become a leading
player in consumer devices when it takes over the Finnish
company's handset business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lumia 2520 tablet, along with the Lumia 1320 and 1520
phones are among the last products Nokia developed before
deciding to sell the devices unit to Microsoft in a deal that is
due to close in the first quarter of next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia, once the global leader in mobile phones, arrived late
to the smartphone race and has struggled to catch up with Apple
 and Samsung, who dominate the increasingly
crowded market for large-screen smartphones, known as phablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lumia tablet, which has a 10-inch screen, will also face
tough competition from the likes of Apple, which is expected to
unveil slimmer, faster iPads on Tuesday. The phablets, which
both have 6-inch screens, will take on a multitude of similar
devices from Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said the new products, which will retain the Nokia
brand after the Microsoft handover, are priced low enough to
attract interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lumia 2520, which comes in glossy red and white as well
as matt cyan and black versions, is expected to start shipping
in the fourth quarter for about $499.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The tablet is a nice design, it's a good-value
proposition," Gartner analyst Annette Zimmermann said, though
she doubts that Nokia's first foray into the tablet market will
bring billions in sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POSSIBLE CLASH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others also questioned whether the new launch is enough to
lure consumers back to Nokia and Microsoft, while Forrester
analyst Thomas Husson said the Lumia 2520's position for
Microsoft is unclear, particularly after the software giant
launched its own tablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At midnight on Monday, Microsoft started selling its Surface
2 and Surface Pro 2 tablets. Still feeling its way in the
computer hardware business, the company is banking on the
lighter and faster models boosting the lacklustre sales of its
touch-screen devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite a more affordable price, the respective positioning
of Nokia's tablet versus the Surface 2 is not obvious and will
have to be dealt with after the Nokia acquisition," Husson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new devices will help Microsoft to increase the number
of Windows users, but Husson said he expects it to remain a long
way from "a significant installed base of consumers".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia's former chief executive Stephen Elop, hired in 2010
to turn round the company, decided in early 2011 to drop Nokia's
own operating system in favour of the Microsoft's untested
Windows Phone software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lumia devices have been well received by technology
blogs and critics, but sales have been slow to pick up, partly
because of a lack of Windows Phone apps and a limited marketing
budget.&lt;/p&gt;

			J.P. Morgan Launches New Emerging Markets Fixed Income Index: The 
      J.P. Morgan Middle East Composite Index (MECISMSM)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan today announced the introduction of a new emerging markets 
      fixed income index, the J.P. Morgan Middle East Composite Index 
      (MECISM), that holistically captures the Middle Eastern U.S. 
      dollar-denominated debt market covering sovereign, quasi-sovereign and 
      corporate issuers. The MECI represents 73% of the Middle Eastern US 
      dollar external debt asset class, tracking 61 issuers and 167 
      instruments spanning 10 countries. The new addition to the J.P. Morgan 
      family of fixed income indices has a total market value of $156.5 
      billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Middle East has become an increasingly important component of the 
      emerging markets debt universe after a decade of prolific issuance. The 
      MECI will be a comprehensive and versatile benchmarking tool for 
      domestic and global investors in Middle Eastern bonds,&#8221; said Stephen 
      Dulake, J.P. Morgan&#8217;s Head of International Credit Research.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MECI closely follows the methodology of J.P. Morgan&#8217;s Emerging Markets 
      Bond Index Global (EMBI) and Corporate Emerging Markets Bond Index Broad 
      (CEMBI), which are the most widely used benchmarks for investors in U.S. 
      dollar-denominated emerging markets sovereign and corporate bonds, 
      respectively. MECI selects issuers that are domiciled in the Middle East 
      region and contains the following countries: Bahrain, Iraq, Israel, 
      Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab 
      Emirates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The MECI vastly expands the J.P. Morgan fixed income index coverage of 
      Middle Eastern debt by encapsulating several major sovereign, 
      quasi-sovereign and corporate issuers in the region which are not 
      captured in the flagship J.P. Morgan emerging markets indices such as 
      the EMBI and the CEMBI,&#8221; said Gloria Kim, J.P. Morgan&#8217;s Head of Global 
      Index Research. &#8220;It continues a legacy of premier index products 
      developed by J.P. Morgan and underscores the firm&#8217;s dedication to 
      developing emerging markets.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The MECI consists of regularly traded, liquid fixed and floating rate 
      instruments that have a minimum face amount outstanding of $300 million 
      and at least 5 years until maturity at issuance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Over 11 years of historical daily index levels and statistics are 
      available for the aggregate, credit, country and sector subindices of 
      MECI, beginning December 31, 2001. Clients and investors can access 
      index levels and statistics for the MECI SM on www.jpmorganmarkets.com.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Ecuadorean judge testified on Wednesday that he ghost-wrote rulings for a judge who ordered Chevron Corp to pay $19 billion to villagers whose land had been polluted by oil exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former judge testified at a trial in New York in which Chevron accuses U.S. lawyer Steven Donziger of bribing the Ecuadorean judges to win the award for the villagers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger has denied bribing the officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the witness stand on Wednesday, the former judge, Alberto Guerra, said he met in 2009 with Donziger and other representatives of the villagers at Honey &amp; Honey, a restaurant in Quito.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guerra said another lawyer representing the villagers had already agreed to pay him $1,000 a month to ghost-write court orders for the presiding judge, Nicolas Zambrano. Zambrano, who was also being paid, agreed to expedite the case and limit procedural avenues by which Chevron could delay it, Guerra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger was fully aware of the arrangement, Guerra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mr. Donziger thanked me for the work that I was going to do," Guerra said of the restaurant meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Randy Mastro, a lawyer for Chevron, asked Guerra if he understood he was violating Ecuadorean law by agreeing to ghost-write Zambrano's orders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It hurts me to say so, but yes," Guerra, wearing a gray suit, said calmly through an interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guerra testified that Zambrano would typically give him court documents on Friday afternoons, often outside a Quito airport. Guerra would study them and prepare court orders over the weekend before delivering them to Zambrano on Sunday afternoons, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zambrano is also expected to testify in the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Guerra started ghost-writing in the case, another lawyer for the villagers would periodically meet Guerra on a Quito street corner to deliver a blank envelope filled with $1,000, denominated in $20 and $50 bills, Guerra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. dollar is Ecuador's official currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some payments were also made directly into his savings account, Guerra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guerra is a key witness for Chevron, which is seeking to discredit the $19 billion award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron wants U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is presiding over the trial without a jury, to prevent Donziger and villagers he represents from collecting the award in U.S. courts or from profiting from it in any way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The award stemmed from environmental contamination between 1964 and 1992 at an oil field in northeastern Ecuador operated by Texaco, which Chevron bought in 2001. Chevron says Texaco cleaned up its share of waste before turning the field over to state-owned Petroecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in 2011, Zambrano awarded $18 billion to people from the Lago Agrio area, which was affected by the pollution. The court subsequently increased the award to $19 billion to cover fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mastro asked Guerra to identify Donziger in the courtroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guerra said Donziger was the person who had just smiled, before describing the dark suit Donziger was wearing. "He knows me. He has seen me. We've been together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger's lawyers are expected to cross-examine Guerra on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have questioned Guerra's credibility, saying Chevron is paying him for his testimony. In January, Chevron said it relocated Guerra's family to ensure his safety and paid him $38,000 for the costs of providing his evidence. Chevron also confirmed that it agreed to pay Guerra's family $10,000 per month for living expenses and $2,000 for housing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guerra, who had presided over the Ecuadorean case before Zambrano, also testified that he and Zambrano initially offered a similar proposal to Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Judge Zambrano and I obviously believed that Chevron was in quite a better financial situation than the plaintiffs," Guerra told Mastro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Chevron said he would relay the offer, which was rebuffed weeks later in a telephone call, Guerra said. The lawyer said that "under no circumstances would Chevron agree to any sort of agreement," Guerra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zambrano, Guerra said, was "discouraged, dispirited," before soliciting Donziger's team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Chevron Corp v.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Bernard Vaughan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 23 (Reuters) - A former Ecuadorean judge
testified on Wednesday that he ghost-wrote rulings for a judge
who ordered Chevron Corp to pay $19 billion to villagers
whose land had been polluted by oil exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former judge testified at a trial in New York in which
Chevron accuses U.S. lawyer Steven Donziger of bribing the
Ecuadorean judges to win the award for the villagers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger has denied bribing the officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the witness stand on Wednesday, the former judge, Alberto
Guerra, said he met in 2009 with Donziger and other
representatives of the villagers at Honey &amp; Honey, a restaurant
in Quito.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guerra said another lawyer representing the villagers had
already agreed to pay him $1,000 a month to ghost-write court
orders for the presiding judge, Nicolas Zambrano. Zambrano, who
was also being paid, agreed to expedite the case and limit
procedural avenues by which Chevron could delay it, Guerra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donziger was fully aware of the arrangement, Guerra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mr. Donziger thanked me for the work that I was going to
do," Guerra said of the restaurant meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Randy Mastro, a lawyer for Chevron, asked Guerra if he

the weekend before delivering them to Zambrano on Sunday
afternoons, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zambrano is also expected to testify in the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Guerra started ghost-writing in the case, another
lawyer for the villagers would periodically meet Guerra on a
Quito street corner to deliver a blank envelope filled with
$1,000, denominated in $20 and $50 bills, Guerra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. dollar is Ecuador's official currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some payments were also made directly into his savings
account, Guerra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guerra is a key witness for Chevron, which is seeking to
discredit the $19 billion award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron wants U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is
presiding over the trial without a jury, to prevent Donziger and
villagers he represents from collecting the award in U.S. courts
or from profiting from it in any way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The award stemmed from environmental contamination between

Zambrano, also testified that he and Zambrano initially offered
a similar proposal to Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Judge Zambrano and I obviously believed that Chevron was in
quite a better financial situation than the plaintiffs," Guerra
told Mastro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Chevron said he would relay the offer, which

      traditional banks &#8211; and CrowdRise, the crowdfunding site founded by 
      Edward Norton -- today announced the winners of the #RiseToThrive 
      Charity Challenge. Over the past six weeks, charities dedicated to 
      building prosperous futures for people in neighborhoods all over America 
      served by RushCard, participated in the crowdfunding challenge. 
      Participating charities raised more than $308,000 in vying for $50,000 
      in awards from RushCard.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;re thrilled that thousands of people across the country have risen 
      to the occasion and raised tons of money to support these important 
      charities,&#8221; said Russell Simmons, co-founder of RushCard. &#8220;RushCard is 
      proud to support the people and organizations that are inspiring change 
      in their communities and making a difference in our world.&#8221;

		&lt;p&gt;
      The top three charities that raised the most money received grants from 
      RushCard. Winning charities received the following grants:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        $25k grant, First Place (raised $86,150) -- Workshop 
        in Business Opportunities (WIBO), a 47-year old non-profit 
        organization dedicated to helping people in underserved communities 
        realize the American Dream through entrepreneurship
      
			
        $10k grant, Second Place (raised $69,402) &#8211; Students 
        for Service, an inspiring organization that partners with 
        non-profits in New York City to address hunger, poverty, and the 
        environment.

      Since 1996, WIBO has trained over 17,000 entrepreneurs who collectively 
      have created close to 32,000 jobs. Of the people that start businesses 
      upon graduation from the WIBO 16-Week Workshop, 54% are still in 
      business five years later compared to the average business survival rate 
      of 20%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Economic opportunity and self-sufficiency through entrepreneurship is 
      what we are all about. We realize however for some in our society, there 
      are barriers to success &#8211; access to knowledge, networks and capital,&#8221; 
      said WIBO CEO Jill Johnson. &#8220;WIBO programming helps increase the 
      likelihood of business success by helping our participants gain access 
      to all three.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The #RiseToThrive Challenge was an amazing opportunity to galvanize our 
      supporters in a short period of time in a way that would have been tough 
      for us to do on our own,&#8221; added WIBO Board Chair Dan Hoffman. &#8220;The 
      RiseToThrive Challenge worked.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;(Adds co-arrangers, rating)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NAIROBI Oct 23 (Reuters) - Kenya is in the final stages of
mandating JP Morgan as lead manager for a debut Eurobond
of up to $2 billion in size, the country's finance minister said
on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plans for the east African country to sell an international
bond have been delayed several times since 2007, mainly due to
political turmoil at home and financial crises abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are negotiating a mandate letter with JP Morgan with a
view of course to sign a contract," Henry Rotich told Reuters by
telephone. The deal is likely to be signed in a week, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The minister said among the points being finalised with JP
Morgan include co-arrangers, an issue that the government has
left to JP Morgan's discretion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The negotiations is to agree on the partners they are
bringing on board and also to sign the contract with them," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contract was likely to be signed as early as next week,
Rotich added. Kenya is rated B1/B+/B+.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Karen Freifeld&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 22 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co is
nearing an agreement worth close to $6 billion with a group of
institutional investors to settle claims over shoddy
mortgage-backed securities issued in the run-up to the financial
crisis, a source familiar with the talks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives of JPMorgan and the investors met on Friday
to discuss the settlement, though the two sides have not yet
agreed to formal terms, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential deal is separate from the preliminary $13
billion settlement JPMorgan has reached with the U.S. government
that would resolve a raft of civil actions brought by several
enforcement agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group of more than a dozen bondholders includes
BlackRock Inc, Allianz SE's Pacific Investment
Management Co and Neuberger Berman Inc, the source
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kathy Patrick, a lawyer for the investors group, did not
immediately respond to requests for comment. JPMorgan also was
not immediately available outside regular U.S. business hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patrick and her Houston-based firm, Gibbs &amp; Bruns, also
represent a group of investors that struck an $8.5 billion
settlement with Bank of America Corp in 2011 over
similar allegations stemming from the bank's Countrywide unit. A
New York state judge is weighing whether to approve that deal
after American International Group Inc and others
objected, arguing that it was too small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, the law firm said its investor clients had
instructed trustees overseeing $95 billion of securities issued
by JPMorgan's affiliates during the housing boom to investigate
whether the bonds were backed by ineligible mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm said its clients represented holders of more than
25 percent of the voting rights in the securities, which
included bonds from Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, two
firms that JPMorgan took over during the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan reported a third-quarter loss earlier this month,
the first under CEO Jamie Dimon, after recording a $7.2 billion
after-tax expense to add money to its legal reserves in
anticipation of settling the U.S. government's mortgage claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company had $23 billion in its legal reserves as of the
end of the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that
JPMorgan's tentative $13 billion settlement with the U.S.
government could end up costing the bank closer to $9 billion
after taxes, because the majority of the deal was expected to be
tax deductible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement talks were reported earlier by The Financial
Times and The Wall Street Journal.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			Exploration acquisition adds to opportunities in Australia
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today announced its Australian subsidiary 
      has acquired exploration interests in two offshore blocks located in the 
      Bight Basin, a deepwater frontier basin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Blocks S12-2 and S12-3, which span more than 8 million acres (32,375 
      square kilometers), are located approximately 275 miles (443 kilometers) 
      west of Port Lincoln off the South Australia coast. Chevron Australia is 
      the operator with a 100 percent interest.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Melody Meyer, president of Chevron Asia Pacific Exploration and 
      Production Company, said, &#8220;The acquisition of blocks S12-2 and S12-3 
      demonstrates Chevron&#8217;s continued focus on pursuing high-impact 
      exploration opportunities to expand its resource base and reinforces the 
      importance of Australia to Chevron&#8217;s global growth strategy.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Australia Managing Director Roy Krzywosinski added, &#8220;We are 
      extremely pleased to be awarded the S12-2 and S12-3 offshore blocks 
      located in the Bight Basin. The Bight Basin is similar in size to the 
      Gulf of Mexico, and these two blocks contain significant exploration 
      potential.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp cruised past Wall Street's quarterly profit and revenue forecasts on Thursday, helped by strong sales of its Office and server software to businesses, sending its shares up more than 5 percent after hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company is the latest tech firm to surprise investors with a powerful performance, coming the same day as Amazon.com Inc eased past average revenue forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology is proving one of the most resilient sectors in an uncertain economy, with 84 percent of tech companies beating earnings estimates for the latest quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts had trimmed profit targets for Microsoft over the past three months, concerned by the launch of an ambitious reorganization by retiring Chief Executive Steve Ballmer and the pricey acquisition of Nokia's handset business, even as the company's core personal computer market ebbs away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The earnings report will positively surprise the market, especially in the context of the soft expectations going in and the dismal report last quarter," said Todd Lowenstein, a portfolio manager at fund firm HighMark Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Beating on revenue and earnings handily will boost confidence that the reorganization is pivoting them in the right direction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said nothing about its board's search for a new CEO to succeed Ballmer, who announced in August his plan to retire within 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of its reinvention as a "devices and services" company, Microsoft now reports under two main groups, one covering its devices and consumer business, and one its commercial business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commercial side was the stronger in the quarter, posting a 10 percent increase in revenue, chiefly from selling Office and server software to businesses. The consumer and hardware group's revenue rose a more modest 4 percent, held back by another poor quarter for the Windows system as sales of personal computers continue to decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PCS FADE AWAY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to industry research firm Gartner, PC shipments fell 8.6 percent last quarter, confirming a worldwide trend towards tablets that has benefited Apple Inc and Google Inc but hurt traditional PC stalwarts Microsoft and Intel Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PC sales have been sliding for the last 18 months, although Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said in an interview on Thursday that there were "signs of stabilization."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of Windows software to PC makers, such as Hewlett-Packard Co, Lenovo Group and Dell Inc, to install on their machines fell 7 percent in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said its Surface tablet posted a sharp increase to $400 million in sales, largely due to rising interest in the smaller, heavily discounted Surface RT model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall for the fiscal first quarter, Microsoft posted a 17 percent increase in profit to $5.2 billion, or 62 cents per share, up from $4.5 billion, or 53 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That topped Wall Street's average forecast of 54 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, although analysts had been edging down estimates for the last three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue rose 16 percent to $18.5 billion, helped by rising sales of its Office software. Analysts had expected $17.8 billion, on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hood, who took over as CFO only in May, issued the most detailed financial guidance from the company in several years in a conference call with analysts. For the fiscal second quarter, which takes in the crucial holiday shopping season, Hood forecast revenue of $23.1 billion to $24.1 billion, ahead of analysts' average forecast of $22.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As we look forward to the second quarter, our enterprise business will remain strong, and we are also set up for fantastic holiday season with Surface, Xbox One and a host of devices from our partners," said Hood on the call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares rose to $35.60 after hours, after closing at $33.72 on Nasdaq. Before the profit figures were announced, the shares were up 21 percent over last 12 months, compared to a 24 percent gain in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Richard Chang and Ken Wills)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE Oct 24 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp cruised
past Wall Street's quarterly profit and revenue forecasts on
Thursday, helped by strong sales of its Office and server

as the company's core personal computer market ebbs away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The earnings report will positively surprise the market,

retire within 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of its reinvention as a "devices and services"
company, Microsoft now reports under two main groups, one
covering its devices and consumer business, and one its
commercial business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commercial side was the stronger in the quarter, posting
a 10 percent increase in revenue, chiefly from selling Office
and server software to businesses. The consumer and hardware
group's revenue rose a more modest 4 percent, held back by
another poor quarter for the Windows system as sales of personal
computers continue to decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PCS FADE AWAY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to industry research firm Gartner, PC shipments
fell 8.6 percent last quarter, confirming a worldwide trend
towards tablets that has benefited Apple Inc and Google
Inc but hurt traditional PC stalwarts Microsoft and
Intel Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PC sales have been sliding for the last 18 months, although
Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said in an interview
on Thursday that there were "signs of stabilization."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of Windows software to PC makers, such as
Hewlett-Packard Co, Lenovo Group and Dell Inc
, to install on their machines fell 7 percent in the
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said its Surface tablet posted a sharp increase to
$400 million in sales, largely due to rising interest in the
smaller, heavily discounted Surface RT model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall for the fiscal first quarter, Microsoft posted a 17
percent increase in profit to $5.2 billion, or 62 cents per
share, up from $4.5 billion, or 53 cents per share, in the
year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That topped Wall Street's average forecast of 54 cents,
according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, although analysts had been
edging down estimates for the last three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue rose 16 percent to $18.5 billion, helped by rising
sales of its Office software. Analysts had expected $17.8
billion, on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hood, who took over as CFO only in May, issued the most
detailed financial guidance from the company in several years in
 a conference call with analysts. For the fiscal second quarter,
which takes in the crucial holiday shopping season, Hood
forecast revenue of $23.1 billion to $24.1 billion, ahead of
analysts' average forecast of $22.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As we look forward to the second quarter, our enterprise
business will remain strong, and we are also set up for
fantastic holiday season with Surface, Xbox One and a host of
devices from our partners," said Hood on the call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares rose to $35.60 after hours, after closing
at $33.72 on Nasdaq. Before the profit figures were announced,
the shares were up 21 percent over last 12 months, compared to a
24 percent gain in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms JP Morgan 2007-FL1; Revises Rating Outlook
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed all classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Corp. Series 2007-FL1 and revised the Rating Outlook 
      on class A2 to Stable from Negative. A detailed list of rating actions 
      follows at the end of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations are primarily due to the overall stable performance of 
      the remaining collateral since Fitch's last rating action. Classes A2, 
      B, and C continue to incur interest shortfalls; as a result, these 
      classes remain at 'Asf' despite increased credit enhancement. According 
      to Fitch's global criteria for rating caps, Fitch will not assign or 
      maintain 'AAAsf' or 'AAsf' ratings for notes that it believes have a 
      high level of vulnerability to interest shortfalls or deferrals, even if 
      permitted under the terms of the documents (for more information please 
      see the full report titled 'Criteria for Rating Caps in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions', June 12, 2013 at www.fitchratings.com). 
      The non-pooled junior component certificates, which are collateralized 
      by the Resorts International loan, have also been affirmed based on 
      Fitch's loss expectation on the collateral. Fitch's performance 
      expectation incorporates prospective views regarding commercial real 
      estate values and cash flow analysis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rating action reflects Fitch's base case loss expectation of 17%. 
      Under Fitch's updated analysis, 100% of the pooled and non-pooled 
      components are modeled to default in the base case stress scenario, 
      defined as the 'B' stress. Fitch estimates that average recoveries on 
      the pooled loans will be approximately 83% in the base case. In its 
      review, Fitch analyzed servicer reported operating statements, STR 
      reports and rent rolls, updated property valuations, and recent lease 
      and sales comparisons.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rating on class A2 is expected to remain stable as continued 
      principal paydown and full recovery of the interest shortfalls are 
      anticipated. The Outlooks on classes B, C, D and E remain Negative as 
      further collateral underperformance may lead to a downgrade. If the 
      realized losses exceed current expectations on the remaining assets, 
      downgrades to these classes are possible.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the October 2013 distribution report, the transaction is 
      collateralized by five assets, including three hotels (68.8%), one 
      casino (23.6%), and one office (7.7%). All five assets are currently in 
      special servicing, including one (23.6%) real estate owned (REO) asset 
      and four (76.4%) in forbearance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch's analysis resulted in loss expectations for two A-notes, and each 
      of the B-note non-pooled components in the 'B' stress scenario. The two 
      pooled contributors to losses in the 'B' stress scenario are: Resorts 
      International (23.6%) and Malibu Canyon Corporation Center and Business 
      Park (7.7%)
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Resorts International loan was originally collateralized by four 
      casino/hotel properties located in Atlantic City, NJ, East Chicago, IN, 
      Robinsonville, MS and Tunica, MS. The Resorts East Chicago property was 
      released from the portfolio in September 2007, paying down the senior 
      trust component by approximately 47%. The loan was foreclosed in 
      November 2011 and the Atlantic City Hilton property was released. The 
      remaining two properties became REO assets. As of August 2013, the 
      occupancy rate for Bally's Tunica was 44.8% with an Average Daily Rate 
      (ADR) of $47.71; occupancy rate for Resorts Tunica was 75% with an ADR 
      of $53.92. Recent valuation of the properties indicate losses upon 
      liquidation of the assets. Ratings on Classes RS-1 through RS-7 
      represent loss expectations on the subordinate non-pooled note 
      components of the Resorts International asset.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Malibu Canyon Corporate Center and Business Park loan is secured by 
      a seven building office complex totaling 323,379 sf in Calabasas, CA. 
      The loan was transferred to the special servicer in March 2011 due to 
      imminent maturity default. A one-year forbearance agreement was signed 
      in February 2012 requiring the borrower to bring the loan reserves 
      current and continue to make these payments through the forbearance 
      period ending December 2012. The borrower has exercised the one-year 
      extension option on the forbearance. Currently, the property is 75% 
      occupied. However, the occupancy rate is expected to drop to 62% in 
      January 2014 due to lease rollover. Losses are expected upon disposition 
      of the loan.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch Rates J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs, Series 4408 Trust
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the Puttable Tax-Exempt 
      Receipts (PUTTERs) and Derivative Inverse Tax-Exempt Receipts (DRIVERs) 
      of the J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs Trust series listed below:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --PUTTERs, Series 4408- 'AA+/F1'; Stable Outlook;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The long-term 'AA+'; Stable Outlook ratings assigned to the series 4408 
      PUTTERs and series 4408A-I DRIVERs are based on the ratings that Fitch 
      has assigned to the State of Washington Various Purpose General 
      Obligation Refunding Bonds, Series R-2014A and Motor Vehicle Fuel Tax 
      General Obligation Refunding Bonds, Series R-2014B (rated 'AA+'; Stable 
      Outlook by Fitch) that have been deposited in the series 4408 trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term 'F1' rating assigned to the series 4408 PUTTERs is based 
      on the liquidity facility provided by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (rated 
      A+/F1'; Stable Outlook). The 'F1' rating assigned to the PUTTERs will 
      expire on June 30, 2014, the expiration date of the liquidity facility, 
      unless such date is extended or earlier terminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term rating assigned to the PUTTERs reflects the short-term 
      rating that Fitch maintains on the bank providing liquidity support and 
      will be adjusted upward or downward in conjunction with the short-term 
      rating of the bank, and, in some cases, the long-term rating of the 
      underlying bonds deposited in the trust. The long-term ratings assigned 
      to the PUTTERs and DRIVERs are exclusively tied to the creditworthiness 
      of the underlying bonds deposited in the trust and will reflect all 
      changes to that rating.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) may be forced to make a deal with federal authorities to avoid criminal prosecution over its handling of accounts of imprisoned swindler Bernie Madoff, The New York Times reported on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newspaper said federal prosecutors and representatives of the bank had held preliminary talks about a deferred prosecution agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under such an agreement, the government would suspend criminal charges against JPMorgan in exchange for fines and an acknowledgment that the bank could face charges if it misbehaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newspaper said people briefed on the federal inquiry were the source of its report. It said the government has not ruled out requiring JPMorgan's national banking unit to plead guilty to a criminal violation of the Bank Secrecy Act, which mandates the reporting of suspicious activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A criminal charge, depending on its nature, could prompt some clients to withdraw money from JPMorgan, and at a minimum could hurt the bank's reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Criminal charges are also possible against individual JPMorgan employees who did business with Madoff, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment. The bank has previously said that "all of our personnel acted in good faith" in handling the Madoff accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, a civil lawsuit brought against JPMorgan and other banks by Irving Picard, the trustee seeking to recover money for Madoff victims, cited internal emails in alleging that bank employees ignored "red flags" of fraud, often to win more fees and commissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was dismissed by an appellate court, which said the trustee lacked legal standing to pursue the claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government investigation of JPMorgan in the Madoff matter is separate from a tentative $13 billion deal the bank is trying to conclude over its liability for faulty mortgage securities sold in the run-up to the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In morning trading, JPMorgan shares were down 43 cents at $52.32 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry and Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE:&#160;CCE)(Euronext Paris: CCE) today 
      reported third-quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.07 on a reported 
      basis, or 82 cents on a comparable basis. Currency translation had a 
      positive impact of approximately 2 cents per share compared to the same 
      quarter a year ago. Third-quarter reported net income was $289 million, 
      or $221 million on a comparable basis. Items affecting comparability are 
      detailed on pages 10 through 13 of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net sales totaled $2.2 billion, up 5 percent on a reported basis, or up 
      2&#189; percent on a currency neutral basis. Third-quarter reported operating 
      income totaled $314 million, an increase of 2&#189; percent. On a comparable

      or 2 percent on a comparable and currency neutral basis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our return to volume growth in the quarter was driven by our operating 
      strategies, customer and consumer support of our brands, and beneficial 
      weather,&#8221; said John F. Brock, chairman and chief executive officer. 
      &#8220;While we are pleased to return to volume growth, we continue to face 
      persistent macroeconomic headwinds, a challenging consumer and customer 
      environment, and dynamic competitive conditions that are impacting our 
      near-term outlook.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Long term, we are focused on growth opportunities and realizing the 
      value of our diversified brand portfolio, executing at the highest 
      levels every day, and effectively managing each lever of our business,&#8221; 
      Mr. Brock said. &#8220;We remain fully committed to our ultimate objective &#8211;

			OPERATING REVIEW
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the third quarter, volume increased 2&#189; percent, reflecting improved 
      weather and ongoing marketing initiatives, including the &#8216;Share a Coke&#8217; 
      campaign. Sparkling drinks grew approximately 4 percent, including 
      growth of 5 percent for Coca-Cola trademark brands. This includes growth 
      of 4 percent for Coca-Cola and 23 percent for Coca-Cola Zero. CCE&#8217;s 
      portfolio of energy brands grew 15 percent, driven by growth of Monster 
      and Relentless brands. Still beverages declined 5 percent, including a 6 
      percent decline in water, lapping growth of 21 percent in the same 
      quarter a year ago. Total volume in Great Britain grew 3 percent, and 
      volume in continental Europe (including Norway and Sweden) increased 2&#189; 
      percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net pricing per case in the third quarter was up &#189; percent and cost of 
      sales per case increased 1&#189; percent. Operating expenses were down 
      approximately 1&#189; percent. These figures are comparable and currency 
      neutral.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      &#8220;Although we returned to volume growth in the third quarter, we continue 
      to manage through the current challenges of the marketplace and the 
      impact of sustained macroeconomic headwinds,&#8221; said Hubert Patricot, 
      executive vice president and president, European Group. &#8220;We will meet 
      these challenges by working closely with our customers to create value 
      growth, and by managing our resources effectively.&#8221;

			FULL-YEAR 2013 OUTLOOK
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CCE continues to expect 2013 comparable earnings per diluted share in 
      the upper half of the previously stated range of $2.45 to $2.50, 
      including a positive currency translation impact of 1&#189; percent at recent 
      rates. Including this currency impact, comparable full-year net sales 
      and operating income are now expected to grow in a low single-digit 
      range versus prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CCE continues to repurchase shares under a $1.5 billion share repurchase 
      program that began in January 2013. The company will repurchase at least 
      $1 billion of its shares by the end of 2013. The company also expects 
      its year-end net debt to EBITDA ratio to be within its long-term range 
      of 2&#189; to 3 times, reflecting the impact of its plan to return cash to 
      shareowners and incremental optimization of its capital structure. These 
      plans may be adjusted depending on economic, operating, or other 
      factors, including acquisition opportunities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company expects 2013 free cash flow of approximately $500 million 
      after including a year-over-year increase in cash restructuring expenses 
      in a range of $100 million to $125 million. Capital expenditures are 
      expected to be in a range of $300 million to $325 million. Weighted 
      average cost of debt is expected to be approximately 3 percent and the 
      comparable effective tax rate for 2013 is now expected to be in a range 
      of 26 percent to 27 percent.

      Third-Quarter 2013 Results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Third-quarter diluted earnings per share totaled $1.07 on a 
        reported basis, or 82 cents on a comparable basis, including a 
        currency benefit of approximately 2 cents.
			
			
				Net sales totaled $2.2 billion, up 5 percent on a reported basis or 
        up 2&#189; percent on a currency neutral basis, driven by volume growth of 
        2&#189; percent and a net pricing per case increase of &#189; percent.
			
			
				Operating income totaled $314 million on a reported basis, or $320 
        million on a comparable basis. Operating income grew 2&#189; percent on a 
        reported basis, 4&#189; percent on a comparable basis, or 2 percent on a 
        comparable and currency neutral basis.
			
			
				CCE will repurchase at least $1 billion of its shares in 2013, with 
        a year-end net debt to EBITDA ratio within its long-term range of 2&#189; 
        to 3 times.
			
			
				For 2013, CCE affirms comparable earnings per diluted share in the 
        upper half of a range of $2.45 to $2.50, which includes a currency 
        benefit of approximately 1&#189; percent at recent rates.
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE:&#160;CCE)(Euronext Paris: CCE) today 
      reported third-quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.07 on a reported 
      basis, or 82 cents on a comparable basis. Currency translation had a 
      positive impact of approximately 2 cents per share compared to the same 
      quarter a year ago. Third-quarter reported net income was $289 million, 
      or $221 million on a comparable basis. Items affecting comparability are 
      detailed on pages 10 through 13 of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net sales totaled $2.2 billion, up 5 percent on a reported basis, or up 
      2&#189; percent on a currency neutral basis. Third-quarter reported operating 
      income totaled $314 million, an increase of 2&#189; percent. On a comparable 
      basis, operating income totaled $320 million, an increase of 4&#189; percent, 
      or 2 percent on a comparable and currency neutral basis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our return to volume growth in the quarter was driven by our operating 
      strategies, customer and consumer support of our brands, and beneficial 
      weather,&#8221; said John F. Brock, chairman and chief executive officer. 
      &#8220;While we are pleased to return to volume growth, we continue to face 
      persistent macroeconomic headwinds, a challenging consumer and customer 
      environment, and dynamic competitive conditions that are impacting our 
      near-term outlook.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Long term, we are focused on growth opportunities and realizing the 
      value of our diversified brand portfolio, executing at the highest 
      levels every day, and effectively managing each lever of our business,&#8221; 
      Mr. Brock said. &#8220;We remain fully committed to our ultimate objective &#8211; 
      creating growth in shareowner value.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			OPERATING REVIEW
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the third quarter, volume increased 2&#189; percent, reflecting improved 
      weather and ongoing marketing initiatives, including the &#8216;Share a Coke&#8217; 
      campaign. Sparkling drinks grew approximately 4 percent, including 
      growth of 5 percent for Coca-Cola trademark brands. This includes growth 
      of 4 percent for Coca-Cola and 23 percent for Coca-Cola Zero. CCE&#8217;s 
      portfolio of energy brands grew 15 percent, driven by growth of Monster 
      and Relentless brands. Still beverages declined 5 percent, including a 6 
      percent decline in water, lapping growth of 21 percent in the same 
      quarter a year ago. Total volume in Great Britain grew 3 percent, and 
      volume in continental Europe (including Norway and Sweden) increased 2&#189; 
      percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net pricing per case in the third quarter was up &#189; percent and cost of 
      sales per case increased 1&#189; percent. Operating expenses were down 
      approximately 1&#189; percent. These figures are comparable and currency 
      neutral.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Although we returned to volume growth in the third quarter, we continue 
      to manage through the current challenges of the marketplace and the 
      impact of sustained macroeconomic headwinds,&#8221; said Hubert Patricot, 
      executive vice president and president, European Group. &#8220;We will meet 
      these challenges by working closely with our customers to create value 
      growth, and by managing our resources effectively.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			FULL-YEAR 2013 OUTLOOK
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CCE continues to expect 2013 comparable earnings per diluted share in 
      the upper half of the previously stated range of $2.45 to $2.50, 
      including a positive currency translation impact of 1&#189; percent at recent 
      rates. Including this currency impact, comparable full-year net sales 
      and operating income are now expected to grow in a low single-digit 
      range versus prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CCE continues to repurchase shares under a $1.5 billion share repurchase 
      program that began in January 2013. The company will repurchase at least 
      $1 billion of its shares by the end of 2013. The company also expects 
      its year-end net debt to EBITDA ratio to be within its long-term range 
      of 2&#189; to 3 times, reflecting the impact of its plan to return cash to 
      shareowners and incremental optimization of its capital structure. These 
      plans may be adjusted depending on economic, operating, or other 
      factors, including acquisition opportunities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company expects 2013 free cash flow of approximately $500 million 
      after including a year-over-year increase in cash restructuring expenses 
      in a range of $100 million to $125 million. Capital expenditures are 
      expected to be in a range of $300 million to $325 million. Weighted 
      average cost of debt is expected to be approximately 3 percent and the 
      comparable effective tax rate for 2013 is now expected to be in a range 
      of 26 percent to 27 percent.

&lt;p&gt;(Adds details of settlement, status of broader negotiations)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Aruna Viswanatha and David Henry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oct 25 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co has agreed to
pay $5.1 billion to settle claims that it and firms it bought
misled Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac about the quality of mortgage
securities and home loans it sold to them during the housing
boom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank and the agencies' regulator said Friday evening
that the settlement was expected to be part of a tentative $13
billion deal that JPMorgan is negotiating with federal and state
agencies over its mortgage bond liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the unusually timed announcement, which appeared to
catch other parties involved in the negotiations by surprise,
covered not only $4 billion that was expected as part of the
larger deal but also an additional $1.15 billion to cover
separate issues over home loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $4 billion portion of the payment, which was agreed on
several weeks ago according to people familiar with the
negotiations, resolves a 2-year-old lawsuit in which the
regulator accused JPMorgan of overstating the quality of loans
in mortgage securities in sold to Fannie and Freddie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency became impatient waiting for the larger
settlement and wanted to move on to resolving similar lawsuits
it brought against other banks, one person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The additional $1.1 million resolves claims that JPMorgan
breached the representations it made about the quality of
single-family mortgages it sold the government-sponsored
entities, the regulator said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negotiations on the final terms of the larger settlement are
continuing, people familiar with discussions said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the parties have agreed to the framework of the deal,
talks have slowed over whether JPMorgan can shift onto the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp liabilities of Washington Mutual,
a failed lender which JPMorgan took over during the financial
crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FHFA settlement leaves open the possibility for JPMorgan

billion enforcement penalty for JPMorgan's mortgage securities
sales which are being investigated by federal prosecutors in
California; $4 billion of consumer debt relief; and $3 billion

&lt;p&gt;Oct 25 (Reuters) - The U.S Federal Housing Finance Agency
said on Friday that JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co has agreed to
pay $5.1 billion to settle its claims that the bank and
companies it bought during the 2007-2009 financial crisis misled
housing finance agencies about the quality of mortgage

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase has reached an agreement to resolve all of its 
      mortgage-backed securities (MBS) litigation with the Federal Housing 
      Finance Agency (FHFA) as conservator for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae for 
      $4 billion. This settlement resolves the firm&#8217;s largest MBS case and 
      relates to approximately $33.8 billion of securities purchased by Fannie 
      Mae and Freddie Mac from J.P. Morgan, Bear Stearns and Washington 
      Mutual. The firm has also simultaneously agreed to resolve Fannie Mae&#8217;s 
      and Freddie Mac&#8217;s repurchase claims associated with whole loan purchases 
      from 2000 to 2008, for $1.1 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today&#8217;s settlements totaling $5.1 billion are an important step towards 
      a broader resolution of the firm&#8217;s MBS-related matters with governmental 
      entities, and reflect significant efforts by the Department of Justice 
      and other federal and state governmental agencies.

      Research and Markets: Global Graphene Market 2012-2016 with Grafoid 
      Inc., IBM Corp., and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/hb2bkz/global_graphene) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Graphene Market 2012-2016" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysts forecast the Global Graphene market to grow at a CAGR of 
      60.4 percent over the period 2012-2016. One of the key factors 
      contributing to this market growth is the growing demand for graphene 
      due to its superior attributes. The Global Graphene market has also been 
      witnessing an increase in RD spending by vendors. However, the high 
      cost of the production of graphene could pose a challenge to the growth 
      of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in 
      this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The key vendors dominating this market space are BASF SE, Grafoid Inc., 
      IBM Corp., and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The other vendors mentioned in the report are Graphene Technologies, 
      Vorbeck Corp., and XG Sciences Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from the team said: Global graphene 
      vendors such as Samsung and IBM have already invested a considerable 
      amount of time and money in their RD department for the expansion of 
      their product portfolio. These vendors are increasingly making huge 
      investments in RD, primarily to increase the number of graphene 
      applications, to provide better functionality to those applications, and 
      to meet the specific requirements of end-consumers. In addition, these 
      investments in RD are expected to enable them to capture a significant 
      market share and gain a competitive edge over other vendors in the 
      Global Graphene market in the coming years. Therefore, the increased RD 
      spending by market vendors is expected to have a positive impact on the 
      growth of the market during the forecast period.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers in this market is the 
      increasing demand for graphene in various applications. The major reason 
      for this increasing demand is the superior attributes of graphene. The 
      benefits of using graphene are expected to have a positive impact on the 
      growth of the Global Graphene market during the forecast period.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Procter &amp; Gamble Co (PG.N) is chugging along with its turnaround, posting a quarterly profit that met Wall Street's expectations and holding to its annual forecasts as the world's largest household products maker gets a lift from cost cuts and a lower tax rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of P fell nearly 1 percent to $79.93 in morning trading on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The maker of Pampers diapers and Tide detergent is trying to reinvigorate itself under Chief Executive Officer A.G. Lafley, who returned in late May to replace Bob McDonald.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lafley, who did not speak on the company's conference call on Friday, has previously said the current fiscal 2014 would be a "transition" year, after the "stepping stone" year that ended in June. He has already split P into four businesses, hoping the new structure will boost efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to think the appointment of Lafley is more temporary in nature, until a permanent successor can be named," said Morningstar analyst Erin Lash. She said she was "a bit perplexed" by P's decision to have Lafley participate only on certain calls and at major industry conferences as the company works to "instill confidence and reignite its momentum."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P said it still expected 5 percent to 7 percent growth in earnings per share this fiscal year, excluding restructuring charges. The company abandoned quarterly forecasts earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It still expects organic sales, which strip out the impact of currency changes, acquisitions and divestitures, to rise 3 percent to 4 percent this fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding Lafley's absence from the call, a P spokesman Paul Fox said: "This change reflects our focus on annual results and trends rather than quarterly results and is consistent with our recent move to fiscal guidance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHAMPOO SHOWDOWN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P held or increased market share in businesses that represent about two-thirds of its sales during the quarter, Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said. While he said he was "reasonably happy" with the results, he added: "We simply have to execute better, more consistently and more reliably."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P competes against a variety of companies, including Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) (UNc.AS). On Thursday, Unilever's results suggested that its North American market share in the high-margin personal care business suffered because of promotions that P ran on its hair care products such as Pantene shampoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Moeller refuted such assertions, saying that P's hair care product promotions were down from a year earlier. The company's market share in the category was flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N) also discussed a more promotional U.S. market when it released its results on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We see a different reality," Moeller told reporters. "Promotion is important, and we will be competitive in our promotional activities, but it is not an area where we seek to lead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In North America overall, P's share of the volume of goods that were sold on promotions was down 7 percent from a year earlier, Moeller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P said it had earned $3.03 billion, or $1.04 per share, in the first quarter ended on September 30, up from $2.81 billion, or 96 cents per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core earnings per share, which exclude restructuring charges, fell 1 percent to $1.05 and met analysts' expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales rose 2.2 percent to $21.21 billion, topping Wall Street's forecast of $21.04 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organic sales rose 4 percent. Such sales were up in every category except healthcare, where they were flat, due in part to a pet food recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beauty business was a disappointment, with organic sales growth of just 1 percent, analysts said. P blamed the sluggish growth on factors such as a decrease in skin care product sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan analyst John Faucher said he had expected 3 percent organic sales growth in the beauty division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jessica Wohl in Chicago; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Durable goods rise but ex-transport figure disappoints&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Amazon, Microsoft, Zynga rally after results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Indexes up: Dow 0.1 pct, S 0.1 pct, Nasdaq 0.4 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Rodrigo Campos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged up on Friday,
with the S 500 on track to close at an all-time high as
results from Amazon and Microsoft sent those stocks soaring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S's yearly gain was just short of the 23.5 percent
advance in 2009. A bigger gain this year would be the index's
largest in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue its $85
billion a month bond-purchase program will likely provide a
floor for stock prices into 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The market has focused on good news stories, be it revenue
or earnings, so there will be a positive impact from Microsoft
and Amazon," said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm
LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The backdrop is the lack of competition to equities from
fixed income and this extended period of low interest rates," he
said. "Investors feel they have no alternative but to be in
equities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp was the leading points gainer on
both the Nasdaq and S 500 as it cruised past Wall Street
estimates for quarterly profit and revenue Thursday. Shares rose
6.6 percent to $35.93.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon shares were posting their largest daily gain
since late April 2012 after the online retailer posted a
narrower quarterly loss and grew sales by a better-than-expected
24 percent. Shares jumped 9.6 percent to $364.16 after hitting a
record high of $368.40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average rose 14.5 points or
0.09 percent, to 15,523.71, the S 500 gained 1.5 points
or 0.09 percent, to 1,753.57 and the Nasdaq Composite 
added 15.065 points or 0.38 percent, to 3,944.025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;United Parcel Service hit a record high at $96.94
after posting a bigger quarterly profit and said it expects
online sales to boost holiday volume. Shares were up 0.2 percent
to $94.70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zynga said it expects a full-year profit after
reporting better-than-expected third-quarter results due to
cost-cutting and a renewed focus on mobile games and core
franchises. Shares jumped 12.8 percent to $3.99.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dow component DuPont jumped to a more than 13 year
high a day after announcing it will spin off its titanium
dioxide unit within 18 months, yielding to intense pressure from
Wall Street to divest the volatile business. Shares hit $62.69
and were recently up 0.3 percent at $61.54.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods outside
of transportation equipment fell in September, possibly due to
uncertainty over government spending, while a surge in aircraft
orders helped boost the headline durable goods number by 3.7
percent last month, more than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other data the Commerce Department said wholesale
inventories rose 0.5 percent in August, the biggest increase
since January. The government also said inventories rose more
than initially estimated in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. consumer sentiment dropped in October to its lowest
level since the end of last year as consumers worried
Congressional dysfunction and the resulting partial federal
government shutdown would hurt growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			Chevron Establishes Recoverable Resource in the Duvernay Shale Play
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Liquids-Rich Formation Adds to Expanding Canadian Portfolio
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today announced the successful 
      conclusion of the initial exploration phase by its Canadian subsidiary, 
      Chevron Canada Limited, in the Kaybob area of the Duvernay play, located 
      in west-central Alberta, Canada.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Canada Limited successfully concluded the initial twelve well 
      exploration drilling program in the liquids-rich portion of the Duvernay 
      shale play. Five wells have been completed and are tied into production 
      facilities, and an additional four wells are waiting on completion and 
      tie-in. The company&#8217;s acreage is well positioned in the condensate-rich 
      and volatile-oil portion of the play. Liquids yield for the completed 
      wells range from 30 to 70 percent with initial production rates up to 
      7.5 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and 1,300 barrels of 
      condensate per day.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Early results of our Duvernay exploration program are encouraging,&#8221; 
      said George Kirkland, vice chairman of Chevron Corporation. &#8220;This 
      discovery creates a foundation for future growth in Canada.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Well performance and condensate yields exceeded our expectation and 
      strengthen our plans going forward. Near term plans include 
      transitioning to a two-rig drilling program to optimize well and 
      completion design, and full field spacing requirements,&#8221; said Jeff 
      Shellebarger, president of Chevron North America Exploration and 
      Production Company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With the acquisition of Alta Energy Luxembourg S.&#224;.r.l. and affiliates&#8217; 
      acreage announced earlier this year, Chevron now has approximately 
      325,000 net acres in the Kaybob area of the Duvernay play.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron is one of the world&#8217;s leading integrated energy companies, with 
      subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company is involved in 
      virtually every facet of the energy industry. Chevron explores for, 
      produces and transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and 
      distributes transportation fuels and lubricants; manufactures and sells 
      petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; 
      provides energy efficiency solutions; and develops the energy resources 
      of the future, including biofuels. Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. copper fabricator Southwire Co dropped its legal fight against physical copper funds planned by Wall Street banks, as political and regulatory scrutiny make it unlikely the exchange-traded funds will ever be launched, according to a court filing on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southwire filed the lawsuit eight months ago after JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) and BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) got approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the first U.S. funds that would use copper as collateral against shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prospect of the copper ETFs had spooked industrial users who worried the funds would hoard a vast stockpile of metal off the market, starving them of raw material and driving up prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, U.S. politicians called for more regulation and scrutiny of the multibillion-dollar commodity trading businesses of Wall Street banks. JPMorgan and others are now trying to sell off those businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dramatic change in circumstances surrounding the funds and their owners have make it less likely than ever that they would be launched, said Monday's filing to the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rapidly changing market conditions now make it unlikely that the orders being challenged will lead to the listing and trading of shares," said Robert Bernstein, an attorney at law firm Eaton &amp; Van Winkle LLP which represents Southwire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and BlackRock declined to comment.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley is now seen in derivatives markets as less likely to default on its debt than Goldman Sachs, a reversal of long-term price trends that signals investors' confidence in the bank's efforts to make itself safer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 28 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley is now
seen in derivatives markets as less likely to default on its
debt than Goldman Sachs, a reversal of long-term price
trends that signals investors' confidence in the bank's efforts

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Congress-created conservator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, operates independently of the U.S. Justice Department, which is why FHFA was able to announce its $5.1 billion settlement of securities fraud and breach-of-contract claims against JPMorgan Chase on Friday evening, before the much-ballyhooed but as yet unsigned $13 billion global deal between the bank and the government. As you know, FHFA and its lead counsel at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart  Sullivan have been whipping JPMorgan and its fellow bank defendants for as long as the conservators cases have been before U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan. Facing a June 2014 trial date, and with no higher-court relief from Cotes rulings in sight, JPMorgan had little choice but to settle FHFAs claims that the bank and its predecessors Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual duped Fannie and Freddie about the mortgage-backed securities they were peddling. FHFA had all the leverage here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thats what makes one provision of the settlement so intriguing. In what Ive heard was one of the hardest-fought sentences in the agreement, FHFA insisted that JPMorgan waive its right to seek indemnification from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which sold Washington Mutual Bank to JPMorgan in September 2008, for the $1.153 billion WaMu piece of FHFAs $5.1 billion deal. The FDIC and JPMorgan have been fighting for years in federal court in Washington about whether the bank or the deposit insurance corporation is liable for claims based on WaMus deficient mortgage-backed securities, most notably in litigation in which Deutsche Bank, as the trustee of about 100 WaMu MBS trusts, has asserted a whopping $6 billion to $10 billion in put-backs. JPMorgans counsel at Sullivan  Cromwell, meanwhile, have sued in a related case for a sweeping declaration that the FDIC, and not the bank, is liable for all WaMu MBS claims because they werent on WaMus books when JPMorgan bought the failed bank. U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer of Washington has said shell decide in the Deutsche Bank trustee case whether JPMorgan or the FDIC is stuck with responsibility for deficient WaMu mortgage-backed securities. Discovery is under way in her court on the terms of the 2008 agreement under which JPMorgan acquired WaMu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Fridays deal, FHFA could easily have ignored any potential exposure for the FDIC. Its settlement, after all, is with JPMorgan, and if the bank subsequently sued the FDIC to get back the WaMu piece of the deal, FHFA wouldnt be affected. But instead, FHFA insisted that the bank expressly give up indemnification claims from the deposit insurance corporation for what it is paying out to Fannie and Freddie for WaMus toxic MBS. For the sake of appearances, if nothing else, thats an important concession from JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, however, a very big loophole in the FHFA settlement that will permit the bank to attempt to recoup its entire WaMu payout. The FDIC provision of the FHFA agreement bars JPMorgan from seeking indemnification from the corporation  but not from the FDICs separate $2.7 billion WaMu receivership, which consists (roughly) of the $1.9 billion JPMorgan paid for WaMu in 2008 plus another $800 million that the fund recovered through the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of WaMus holding company. In the FHFA deal, the conservator agreed to a steeper discount on Fannie and Freddies WaMu claims than those against JPMorgan and Bear Stearns. I suspect thats no coincidence: The allocation of FHFAs total recovery permits JPMorgan to attempt to get all of its $1.153 billion WaMu payout from the FDICs WaMu receivership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the FHFA walled off FDICs corporate exposure to JPMorgan indemnification claim, but it left the $2.7 billion receivership exposed to the tune of $1.153 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will have to fight off some extremely determined WaMu secured noteholders to get at that receivership cash, though. A group of hedge funds that includes Monarch, Silver Point and York Capital, owns more than $6 billion in WaMu senior notes. The noteholders are of the view that all of the money in the WaMu receivership belongs to them, as the secured creditors of a failed bank. But if JPMorgan were to win an indemnification judgment against the receivership, it would move to the front of the line for payment. A dollar to JPMorgan from the WaMu receivership is a dollar directly out of the WaMu bondholders pocket  and there are only $2.7 billion of those dollars to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The senior bondholders, moreover, have no say in the litigation that  at least as things now stand  will decide whether WaMu MBS liability belongs to JPMorgan or the FDIC. The hedge funds lawyers at Dechert and Zuckerman Spaeder moved to intervene in the Deutsche Bank trustee case in Washington, but Judge Collyer ruled they dont have standing, a decision that was affirmed in July by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. It will be up to the trustees counsel at Boies, Schiller  Flexner and Talcott Franklin and the FDICs lawyers at Hughes Hubbard  Reed to argue that JPMorgan assumed responsibility for WaMu MBS liability when it bought the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDICs entanglement with claims by private investors in WaMu mortgage-backed securities creates considerable complications for the government. You can see why the Justice Department would like to resolve the question of the FDICs indemnification as part of a global settlement with JPMorgan. The FHFA agreement offers a possible path to an agreement by restricting the bank to claims against the $2.7 billion WaMu receivership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a deal would be bad news, though, for the FDICs allies in private indemnification litigation against JPMorgan. Deutsche Bank and the MBS investors in the WaMu trusts it oversees need the FDIC to continue arguing alongside them that JPMorgan is liable for WaMus supposed MBS contract breaches. The hedge funds that hold WaMu notes need the FDIC to remember its fiduciary duty to represent their interests as WaMu creditors in any global settlement talks with JPMorgan. And some of the failed banks for which the FDIC acts as a receiver need the agency to pursue their claims as holders of JPMorgan, WaMu or Bear Stearns mortgage-backed securities. No wonder the FDIC piece of the global settlement is reportedly complicating negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the government settlement with JPMorgan does not fully resolve the issue of FDIC indemnification, the docket in the trustee case before Judge Collyer calls for final briefing to conclude in the spring of 2014. JPMorgans lawyers at Sullivan  Cromwell contend in a related case that if WaMu MBS investors havent already asserted put-back claims against the FDIC as receiver, theyre too late under the four-year statute of limitations set forth in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act. That interpretation of FIRREA would bar put-back suits by about 100 WaMu MBS trusts outside of Deutsche Banks trusteeship. But even if JPMorgan is right about the time bar and is correct that Deutsche Bank has inflated put-backs in the WaMu trusts it oversees, JPMorgan still has billions of dollars at stake in the FDIC indemnification dispute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 28 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. 
has hired Michael Boardman to run banking, financial planning
and investment management services for clients who do not
qualify for its premier asset management and private banking
services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As chief executive of Chase Wealth Management, Boardman will
oversee about 3,000 financial advisers at the company's 5,600
branches that oversee $179 billion of assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers include the segment known as the mass affluent,
with $250,000 to $5 million in deposits and investment balances,
who are branded "Private Clients" and serviced at 2,000
branches, as well as lower-tier prospects throughout the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's wealthiest individual clients, with more than $5
million of banking and investment assets, are serviced through
the private banking and brokerage units of JPMorgan's asset
management division run by Mary Erdoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boardman, 49, held a similar post at Minneapolis-based U.S.
Bancorp, where he was president of The U.S. Bank Private
Client Reserve, which included 1,300 advisers in 19 states. U.S.
Bank said Monday that Mike Ott, who has been central region
president of client reserve and was formerly head of equity
research at Piper Jaffray Cos., will replace Boardman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boardman, who will join on Nov. 18, will assume duties that
had been overseen by Barry Sommers, who since May has been chief
executive of all of the New York-based company's consumer
banking businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, Oct. 28, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On Sunday, November 10, an all-star lineup will take the stage to perform at the T.J. Martell Foundation's 5th Annual Family Day LA including Award-winning pop duo Karmin, international recording artist and American Idol finalist Jessica Sanchez, new rising pop star Megan Nicole and Universal's girl group Cimorelli. Laura Marano, singer/songwriter, UNICEF Ambassador, and star of Disney's Austin  Ally will host the family day affair alongside Disney star and Hollywood Records recording artist Coco Jones in an effort to raise funds for leukemia, cancer and AIDS research. Family Day kicks off at 12p.m. and runs until 4p.m. on the CBS Studio Center Back Lot in Studio City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Sponsored by Tone Body Wash and Citibank, the event will honor three leading lights in the music industry: Bruce Eskowitz, COO of Red Light Management, Phil Guerini, the Vice President of Programming and General Manager of Radio Disney and Michael L. Klausman, the President of CBS Studio Center and SVP of West Coast Operations and Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"The T.J. Martell Foundation is an amazing organization," says Marano. "We all know somebody who has been affected by leukemia, cancer, or AIDS, so the work that the T.J. Martell Foundation does play a significant role in all of our lives. I am extremely thrilled to work with them and host this great event!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Amy Renee Heidemann and Nick Noonan are the lovable, genre-bending pop duo, Karmin, the first fan-discovered group to translate from "viral sensation" to "stadium status." With over half a billion views and double platinum sales since their launch into the mainstream, they've blitzed the world with their perpetual touring schedule and debut TV performance on SNL leading into major appearances across radio, print, TV and film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"We are so excited to be a part of Family Day and show our support for the T.J. Martell Foundation," says Karmin, the Epic Records' duo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	18-year-old vocal powerhouse, Jessica Sanchez, captivated America on season 11 of American Idol. She has since performed concerts around the world, performed for President Obama and President Clinton and was a recurring guest star on Glee. On Family Day, Sanchez will perform some new music including her hit single "Tonight" featuring Ne-Yo from her debut album, Me, You  The Music, which debuted at No. 8 on the Pop charts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"I am honored to work with such a great organization as the T.J. Martell Foundation," says Sanchez. "We lose too many people to these diseases and we need to do what we can to find a cure. Every dollar counts!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Also performing at Family Day is another YouTube success, 20-year-old recording artist Megan Nicole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"I'm so excited to be performing at Family Day this year," shares Megan Nicole. "I'm thankful to be able to support such an important cause as we continue to work together to find a cure." The rising pop vocalist launched to stardom when her creative covers and original songs went viral on YouTube. She now has over 400 million streams, over 30 million on her first two original songs, and is touring worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Cimorelli is the latest emerging girl group from Universal's Island record label. Comprised of six sisters, the girl group has over 2 million subscribers on YouTube with over 500 million views. Their fan base has grown to such a level that they recently won a Teen Choice Award for Web Star and when they released their "Made in America" EP in June it debuted on the Top 10 worldwide on the iTunes &#174; charts. Cimorelli spent the summer touring the U.S., culminating with a performance on Good Morning America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Last month, the T.J. Martell Foundation drew over 1,500 supporters and raised over $700,000 from its 14th Annual Family Day Event in New York City. Music favorites such as Jason Mraz, Ed Sheeran, Austin Mahone, Emblem3 and Greyson Chance entertained the crowd while Disney breakout star Bridgit Mendler from the hit series "Good Luck Charlie" rounded out the line-up as the event's guest host.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Family Day is one of the music industry's signature events providing a spectacular day full of fun games, carnival activities and food to raise money for leukemia, cancer and AIDS research. Having steadily grown into one of the Martell Foundation's most successful events, Family Day has raised close to $5 million for Martell-funded research at twelve hospitals across the country. Last year's sold out event in LA featured performances by Cody Simpson and many others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IntervalZero Releases Service Pack 1 for RTX64 Real-Time Software; 
      Provides First Full Access to 64-bit Memory Range in Microsoft Windows
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			RTX64 and RTX transform Microsoft Windows into a real-time 
      operating system (RTOS)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IntervalZero today released Service Pack 1 for RTX64 2013, the 64-bit 
      version of its hard real-time software, which provides the first direct 
      access to a larger range of memory through 64-bit addressing natively in 
      Microsoft Windows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Real-time applications running on 64-bit Windows with RTX64 can access 
      128GB of non-paged memory, depending on actual mapped physical RAM size. 
      By comparison 32-bit Windows 7 has a non-paged memory limitation of 2GB. 
      Overall, 64-bit Windows&#8217; 512GB of physical memory dwarfs the 4GB 
      physical memory limitation in 32-bit Windows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;RTX64&#8217;s larger range of memory, which is visible and accessible 
      concurrently from multiple cores in a symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) 
      configuration, represents a first for the Windows RTOS world,&#8221; said 
      IntervalZero CEO Jeffrey Hibbard. &#8220;The value of increased, directly 
      accessible real-time memory within Windows, and the resulting superior 
      performance distinguishes RTX64 from virtualization alternatives and 
      32-bit based RTOS solutions.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Importantly, Windows with RTX64 will create new opportunities for 
      developers worldwide that are designing sophisticated, intelligent 
      systems in markets as diverse as industrial automation, digital 
      audio and medical.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hibbard said, &#8220;RTX64 can deliver functionality at price points 
      previously unattainable in Windows environments. Vision systems, as an 
      example, are in high demand in many industrial uses, but until now they 
      have been extremely expensive to develop. With RTX64 on Windows they 
      become much more feasible.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Just as PLCs did 10 years ago, and EtherCAT 
      did five years ago, RTX64 on Windows will drive competitive advantages. 
      A good example is that real-time network standards become accessible &#8211; AVB, 
      GigE 
      Vision and Ravenna. 
      For sure, medical markets, given bigger fields of view, will innovate; 
      motion systems will see advances as well, through more degrees of 
      freedom for small form factor assembly.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hibbard also noted that for simulation models requiring both large 
      memory pools and real time, SMP-enabled RTX64 can execute those models 
      on dedicated RTX cores, isolating real-time functions on separate cores 
      while also eliminating the need for expensive dedicated hardware.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IntervalZero&#8217;s RTX64 and RTX transform Windows into a real-time 
      operating system (RTOS) and RTX64 can scale from 1 to 63 cores for 
      dedicated real-time processing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For complex, connected embedded systems that seek to take advantage of 
      Windows&#8217; world-class HMI and that also require determinism and hard-real 
      time, RTX64 
      and RTX provide an RTOS that is tightly integrated with Windows. 
      Where Windows provides timers with a maximum resolution &#8211; smallest 
      granularity &#8211; of 1000 &#956;s (1 millisecond), RTX64/RTX lower this to 1 &#956;s 
      where supported by the hardware.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Notably, RTX64 and RTX extend the Windows operating system&#8217;s 
      capabilities &#8211; without altering or modifying the Windows Hardware 
      Abstraction Layer (HAL) &#8211; to deliver determinism and hard real- time 
      performance without relying on latency-inherent virtualization 
      approaches or unnecessarily complicated inter-process communications 
      schemes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RTX64 is a key component of the IntervalZero RTOS Platform that 
      comprises x86 and x64 multicore multiprocessors, Windows, and real-time 
      Ethernet (e.g. EtherCAT or PROFINET) 
      to outperform real-time hardware such as DSPs and radically reduce the 
      development costs for systems that require determinism or hard real-time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Highlights of the RTX64 SP1 release include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        The addition of real-time kernel (RTK) support allowing Windows 
        drivers to communicate with real-time applications. This functionality 
        gives developers greater flexibility within their application design. 
        Developers can choose to combine Windows processes (.EXE), Windows 
        kernel drivers (.SYS), real-time processes (.RTSS) and real-time 
        dynamic link libraries (.RTDLLs) to build applications that can take 
        advantage of the full feature set of the Windows operating system.
      
			
        The addition of a control panel allows for configuration of the RTX64 
        subsystem. The control panel integrates seamlessly into the Windows 
        control panel area, making RTX64 functionality searchable and 
        configurable using standard Windows search capabilities.
      
			
				Microsoft 
        Visual Studio 2012 build support is available. An application 
        wizard is available to allow for quick real-time application creation 
        with selectable common code templates using objects such as events or 
        interrupts. IntervalZero has also verified that a subset of the 
        Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 C Runtime library can be used within 
        real-time applications, allowing developers to use standard C Runtime 
        functionality within their Windows and real-time processes
      
			
        A real-time network driver &#8211; RtIGB &#8211; supporting the Intel&#174; i210 
        Ethernet controllers is now available for use with the RT-TCP/IP 
        stack. This driver expands the set of network adapters supported by 
        default within RTX64.
      
			
        Support has been added for Windows 8 and Windows Embedded Standard 8.
      
			
        A new Latency View tool allows users to view and compare system timer 
        response latencies on multiple cores at the same time. Users can also 
        add loads to stress the system to determine if it can meet their 
        application&#8217;s real-time needs.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      IntervalZero is a Microsoft 
      Embedded Gold Partner and was recognized as a leading Windows 
      Embedded Partner worldwide in 2012, 2011, 2010, and 2009. IntervalZero 
      is a member of the Intel Embedded Alliance and RTX&#8217;s value in digital

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;One in four households operates outside of the mainstream banking 
      system, resulting in unnecessary fees and interest, according to the 
      FDIC. Thanks to the work of Mission Asset Fund, CFED, and Greenlining, 
      low- and moderate-income families will gain access to credit and begin 
      building their household balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase is excited to 
      partner with these dynamic organizations to help more people in 
      underserved communities improve their financial stability and economic 
      opportunity,&#8221; said Janis Bowdler, Senior Program Director for Financial 
      Capability and Affordable Housing, JPMorgan Chase Foundation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Grants have been awarded as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;

			First Lady Michelle Obama to Give Keynote Address at Disney&#8217;s 
      &#8216;Veterans Institute&#8217; Workshop on November 14
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Complimentary &#8216;Veterans Institute&#8217; program is designed to 
      encourage and support hiring of military veterans
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Disney will share expertise from its &#8216;Heroes Work Here&#8217; initiative 
      with other companies to help them build their own veteran-hiring programs
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      First Lady Michelle Obama will give the keynote address at Disney&#8217;s 
      first-ever Veterans Institute workshop on November 14, 2013 at 
      Walt Disney World Resort. Building on its successful Heroes Work Here 
      initiative to hire, train and support military veterans, Disney is 
      hosting the free Veterans Institute workshop to inspire other 
      companies to employ servicemen and women transitioning to the private 
      sector.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The First Lady has made supporting military families and U.S. troops a 
      top priority. In 2011 Mrs. Obama and Dr. Jill Biden launched Joining 
      Forces, an initiative dedicated to connecting servicemen and women, 
      veterans, and military spouses with the resources they need to find jobs 
      at home. Through this initiative, Mrs. Obama and Dr. Biden have met with 
      military families, learned about their successes and challenges, and 
      have connected them with businesses and non-profit organizations as they 
      look for work in the private sector. Joining Forces highlights the 
      workforce potential of veterans and military spouses, expands employment 
      and career development opportunities for veterans and military spouses, 
      and helps employers create military family-friendly workplaces.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We applaud First Lady Michelle Obama&#8217;s efforts to raise awareness of 
      the strengths and unique needs of veterans and their families, and we 
      are honored to have her join Disney&#8217;s first-ever &#8216;Veterans Institute,&#8217; a 
      program designed to showcase the value of veterans, share best hiring 
      practices, and encourage greater employment opportunities for military 
      men and women transitioning into civilian life,&#8221; said Robert A. Iger, 
      Chairman and CEO, The Walt Disney Company.

			About Disney&#8217;s Heroes Work Here
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Supporting the U.S. Armed Forces has long been a Disney tradition, and 
      Disney&#8217;s Heroes Work Here continues that proud legacy with a 
      company-wide initiative to hire, train and support military veterans. 
      Disney introduced the program in March, 2012 with a commitment to hire 
      at least 1,000 veterans by 2015. Having exceeded that goal in the first 
      year alone, with 1,300 veterans hired, the company announced in March, 
      2013 that it would create opportunities for another 1,000 former service 
      members over the next two years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Disney&#8217;s Heroes Work Here initiative also features a public 
      awareness campaign to encourage employers across the U.S. to hire former 
      military service members. The campaign includes the free Veterans 
      Institute workshop at Walt Disney World on November 14, 2013, as 
      well as public service announcements 
      highlighting the skills and experience of veterans who work at Disney. 
      The PSAs direct viewers to the White House&#8217;s Joining Forces initiative (www.joiningforces.gov) 
      and have aired across Disney&#8217;s media properties including ESPN, ABC and 
      ABC Family, making more than 500 million impressions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third component of Disney&#8217;s Heroes Work Here initiative is 
      philanthropy. Disney&#8217;s philanthropic support of veteran and military 
      organizations has exceeded $1 million since the launch of Heroes Work 
      Here, and through the Disney VoluntEARS program, employees have 
      engaged in several service projects with veterans organizations in 
      communities around the country.

			New Nimble Contacts Integration to Microsoft Apps for Outlook Brings 
      Contact Management, Social Selling and Intelligent Insights across All 
      Exchange Email Messages
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nimble, the leading provider of social relationship management, today 
      announced an integration with Microsoft Office 365 and Outlook 2013. The 
      new Nimble App for Outlook will make it easy for Office and Outlook 
      users to benefit from Nimble&#8217;s full and detailed view of any contact - 
      directly from their email messages.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SMBs, increasingly overwhelmed by their email inboxes and exploding 
      number of business contacts in a noisy, social world, can now access the 
      immediately valuable Nimble Contact Record within Outlook. The 
      integration enables users to comprehensively profile contacts in or even 
      outside of their various networks, to inform engagement, and help grow 
      relationships in an authentic and meaningful way.

      Store because they clearly have an understanding of the needs of 
      small businesses across the world,&#8221; said Dene Cleaver, Senior Product 
      Manager &#8211; Office and SharePoint Store Microsoft Corp. &#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt 
      that providing contextual information about contacts helps business 
      relationships flourish, and that connecting that capability to Microsoft 
      Office within Outlook is a logical step, making Nimble a welcome 
      addition to the Office Store.&#8221;

      context mapping, contain all previous communications history, activities 
      and tasks, as well as incorporate the social profiles and streams of 
      each contact, giving users immediate, relevant insights about contacts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      know,&#8221; said Jon Ferrara, CEO of Nimble. &#8220;By putting Nimble&#8217;s powerful 
      social contact insight capabilities right into Office and Outlook 
      emails, you&#8217;re no longer flying blind. You've got all the information 
      you need to interact meaningfully to build, deepen and nurture your 
      powerful relationships.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      from within email, including:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Automatic Message History logging (incl. Team Email and Social

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase has reached an agreement to resolve all of its 
      mortgage-backed securities (MBS) litigation with the Federal Housing 
      Finance Agency (FHFA) as conservator for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae for 
      $4 billion. This settlement resolves the firm&#8217;s largest MBS case and 
      relates to approximately $33.8 billion of securities purchased by Fannie 
      Mae and Freddie Mac from J.P. Morgan, Bear Stearns and Washington 
      Mutual. The firm has also simultaneously agreed to resolve Fannie Mae&#8217;s 
      and Freddie Mac&#8217;s repurchase claims associated with whole loan purchases 
      from 2000 to 2008, for $1.1 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today&#8217;s settlements totaling $5.1 billion are an important step towards 
      a broader resolution of the firm&#8217;s MBS-related matters with governmental 
      entities, and reflect significant efforts by the Department of Justice 
      and other federal and state governmental agencies.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) global commodities trading co-head Magid Shenouda is leaving after 14 years at the bank, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters, the Wall Street firm's second senior-level departure in as many weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London-based Shenouda, who has run the commodities trading business for the past two years alongside New York-based Greg Agran, had been credited with helping build out Goldman's physical energy trading franchise, a unit of the bank under intense political and regulatory scrutiny in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shenouda's departure came just a week after the reported retirement of Peter O'Hagan, who was global head of commodities sales. The bank named two people to replace him, with Colleen Foster heading sales in the Americas and Martin Wiwen-Nilsson running operations in Europe and Asia, website SparkSpread reported earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's J Aron commodity division, a century-old enterprise the bank has said is "core" to its business, has long been considered one of the most coveted employers in the commodities business, with extensive global operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman President Gary Cohn ran J Aron for a period in the 1990s, and Isabelle Ealet, now the co-head of the securities division, was in charge for much of the 2000s. It has about 250 employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it now faces unprecedented regulatory pressure amid allegations its metals warehousing business might have inflated aluminum prices. The Federal Reserve is considering ways to pull back Wall Street's deep involvement in raw material markets, including the ownership of assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's physical metals desk has lost three key players since March as Wall Street's No. 1 bank for commodities has struggled to expand in the capital-intensive and high-risk business it first entered in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, revenues at Goldman and other banks have been shrinking as lower market volatility and tighter regulation hurt profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, commodities revenues fell more than 60 percent year-on-year in 2012 to $600 million. Compared with 2009, when the bank booked a record $4.5 billion in revenue, that was down almost 90 percent, according to its SEC filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said the numbers do not fully reflect the way it runs its business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shenouda joined Goldman in 1999 from privately held Swiss-based commodity trading house Trafigura, where he traded fuel oil. He went on to run Goldman's European crude oil and products trading business, as well as European power and gas. He was made partner at the bank in 2008, the memo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He has been responsible for driving several key acquisitions, as well as the expansion of our business activities into new regions and products, including the build-out of our Energy, Coal, Freight and Emissions franchise," the co-heads of the securities division, Ealet and Pablo Salame, said in the memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear if the bank will look to replace Shenouda, but some traders say it would be logical for his co-head, Agran, to run the business alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shenouda's plans were not immediately known. The departure was first reported by SparkSpread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Leff; Editing by Gary Hill, Richard Chang and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, helped by cuts in costs and growing sales of cancer medicines approved over the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. drugmaker, whose shares rose 1.7 percent, earned $2.59 billion, or 39 cents per share. That compared with $3.21 billion, or 43 cents per share, in last year's quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding special charges of $572 million related to restructurings, asset writedowns and other costs, Pfizer earned 58 cents per share. Analysts, on average, expected 56 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I like the quarter; it was better than we expected, mainly from cost cutting and a lower tax rate," said Herman Saftlas, an analyst with S Capital Inc. The effective tax rate fell 0.4 percent to 27.6 percent in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saftlas raised his 12-month share-price target on Pfizer to $35, from $33, saying the company will report data in coming months from trials of a number of promising experimental drugs and from studies testing new uses of its already marketed drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My feeling is they are making traction on their pipeline and if they get some good readouts from these trials, we could see Pfizer shares go higher," Saftlas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bright spot in Pfizer's earnings report was sales of its oncology drugs, which jumped 24 percent to $407 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oncology has become one of Pfizer's biggest priorities, with the introductions of Xalkori for lung cancer in 2011, Inlyta for kidney cancer in 2012 and Bosulif this year for chronic myelogenous leukemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is counting on them to become lucrative products, and is developing other cancer medicines with possibly far bigger sales potential. They include an experimental treatment for advanced breast cancer, called palbociclib, which industry analysts consider a potential blockbuster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xalkori sales almost doubled to $73 million in the quarter, while Inlyta sales nearly tripled to $83 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is also focusing on new drugs for a variety of chronic diseases. It said on Tuesday it had begun late-stage trials of bococizumab, a drug to reduce "bad" LDL cholesterol by blocking a protein called PCSK9. Amgen Inc and a partnership of Regeneron Inc and Sanofi are conducting late-stage trials of similar injectable drugs, which analysts believe could become big sellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mid-stage trials, the Regeneron and Amgen drugs slashed LDL cholesterol more than 60 percent in patients already taking statin drugs, such as Pfizer's Lipitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a very competitive segment and we're in it to be competitive," Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it is working with Eli Lilly and Co to complete development of a new type of drug for osteoarthritis and back pain, called tanezumab, whose trials have been halted several times by regulators over safety concerns. It works by blocking a protein called Nerve Growth Factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read said tanezumab could be an attractive alternative to opioids and to standard pain drugs that can cause bleeding and ulcers. He said a new category of pain drag was "desperately needed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global company sales fell 2 percent to $12.64 billion, hurt by generic competition for cholesterol fighter Lipitor and other medicines.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oct 29 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc reported
better-than-expected third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, helped
by cuts in costs and growing sales  of cancer medicines approved
over the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. drugmaker, whose shares rose 1.7 percent,
earned $2.59 billion, or 39 cents per share. That compared with
$3.21 billion, or 43 cents per share, in last year's quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding special charges of $572 million related to
restructurings, asset writedowns and other costs, Pfizer earned
58 cents per share. Analysts, on average, expected 56 cents per
share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I like the quarter; it was better than we expected, mainly
from cost cutting and a lower tax rate," said Herman Saftlas, an
analyst with S Capital Inc. The effective tax rate fell 0.4
percent to 27.6 percent in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saftlas raised his 12-month share-price target on Pfizer to
$35, from $33, saying the company will report data in coming
months from trials of a number of promising experimental drugs
and from studies testing new uses of its already marketed drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My feeling is they are making traction on their pipeline
and if they get some good readouts from these trials, we could
see Pfizer shares go higher," Saftlas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bright spot in Pfizer's earnings report was sales of its
oncology drugs, which jumped 24 percent to $407 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oncology has become one of Pfizer's biggest priorities, with
the introductions of Xalkori for lung cancer in 2011, Inlyta for
kidney cancer in 2012 and Bosulif this year for chronic
myelogenous leukemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is counting on them to become lucrative products, and
is developing other cancer medicines with possibly far bigger
sales potential. They include an experimental treatment for
advanced breast cancer, called palbociclib, which industry
analysts consider a potential blockbuster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xalkori sales almost doubled to $73 million in the quarter,
while Inlyta sales nearly tripled to $83 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is also focusing on new drugs for a variety of
chronic diseases. It said on Tuesday it had begun late-stage
trials of bococizumab, a drug to reduce "bad" LDL cholesterol by
blocking a protein called PCSK9. Amgen Inc and a
partnership of Regeneron Inc and Sanofi are
conducting late-stage trials of similar injectable drugs, which
analysts believe could become big sellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mid-stage trials, the Regeneron and Amgen drugs slashed
LDL cholesterol more than 60 percent in patients already taking
statin drugs, such as Pfizer's Lipitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a very competitive segment and we're in it to be
competitive," Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said in an
interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it is working with Eli Lilly and Co to
complete development of a new type of drug for osteoarthritis
and back pain, called tanezumab, whose trials have been halted
several times by regulators over safety concerns. It works by
blocking a protein called Nerve Growth Factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read said tanezumab could be an attractive alternative to
opioids and to standard pain drugs that can cause bleeding and
ulcers. He said a new category of pain drag was "desperately
needed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global company sales fell 2 percent to $12.64 billion, hurt
by generic competition for cholesterol fighter Lipitor and other
medicines. Wall Street had expected $12.7 billion. Sales would
have been flat if not for the stronger dollar, which lowers the
value of sales outside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of Pfizer's biggest product, Lyrica for nerve pain,
rose 10 percent to $1.14 billion. Prevnar, a vaccine against
pneumococcal bacteria that can cause pneumonia and other
infections, grew 1 percent to $959 million, a moderate
turnaround from a 3 percent decline in the prior quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sales of Lipitor, which lost U.S. patent protection in
late 2011, fell 29 percent to $533 million, as the drug faced
generics in more overseas markets. But its sales topped Wall
Street expectations by almost $55 million, Jefferies analyst
Jeffrey Holford said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer forecast full-year 2013 earnings of $2.15 to $2.20
per share, excluding special items, from its earlier view of
$2.10 to $2.20 per share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow and S 500 ended at record highs on Tuesday after economic data supported views that the Federal Reserve would keep its stimulus intact for several months and IBM (IBM.N) rallied after the company announced a stock buyback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM gave the biggest boost to the Dow, which led the day's gains.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) global commodities co-head Magid Shenouda is leaving after 14 years at the bank, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters, the Wall Street firm's second senior-level departure in as many weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London-based Shenouda, who has run the commodities business for the past two years alongside New York-based Greg Agran, had been credited with helping build out Goldman's physical energy trading franchise - a part of the bank that is under intense political and regulatory scrutiny in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shenouda's departure came just a week after the reported retirement of Peter O'Hagan, who was global head of commodities sales. The bank named two people to replace him, with Colleen Foster heading sales in the Americas and Martin Wiwen-Nilsson running operations in Europe and Asia, website SparkSpread reported earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's storied J Aron commodity division, a century-old enterprise that the bank has said is "core" to its business, long has been considered one of the most coveted employers in the commodities business, with vast global operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman President Gary Cohn ran J Aron for a period in the 1990s, and Isabelle Ealet - who is now co-head of the securities division - was in charge for much of the 2000s. It has about 250 employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it now faces unprecedented regulatory pressure amid allegations that its metals warehousing business may have inflated aluminum prices. The Federal Reserve is considering ways to pull back Wall Street's deep involvement in raw material markets, including the ownership of assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, revenues at Goldman and other banks have been shrinking. Overall commodities revenues fell in 2012 to $600 million from a record $4.5 billion in 2009, according to its SEC filings. Goldman said the numbers do not fully reflect the way it runs its business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shenouda joined Goldman in 1999 from privately held Swiss-based commodity trading house Trafigura, where he traded fuel oil. He went on to run Goldman's European crude oil and products trading business, as well as European power and gas. He was made partner at the bank in 2008, the memo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He has been responsible for driving several key acquisitions, as well as the expansion of our business activities into new regions and products, including the build-out of our Energy, Coal, Freight and Emissions franchise," the co-heads of the securities division, Ealet and Pablo Salame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shenouda's plans were not immediately known. The departure was first reported by SparkSpread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Leff; Editing by Gary Hill and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

			Kroll Bond Rating Agency Assigns Final Ratings to JPMBB 2013-C15
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) is pleased to announce the assignment of 
      final ratings to the JPMBB 2013-C15 transaction (see ratings listed 
      below). JPMBB 2013-C15 is a $1.19 billion CMBS conduit transaction 
      collateralized by 68 fixed-rate commercial mortgage loans that are 
      secured by 151 properties.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The loans were contributed by four sellers: JPMorgan Chase Bank (16 
      loans, 50.9%), Barclays Bank PLC (28 loans, 21.5%), Starwood Mortgage 
      Funding II LLC (16 loans, 16.7%), and KeyBank National Association 
      (eight loans, 10.8%). The loans have principal balances ranging from 
      $2.0 million to $119.0 million for the largest loan in the pool, which 
      is secured by Veritas Multifamily Portfolio (10.0%). The Veritas 
      Multifamily Portfolio consists of 1,230 residential units in 45 mid-rise 
      multifamily complexes located throughout San Francisco, California. The 
      five largest loans also include Miracle Mile Shops (9.2%), 1615 L Street 
      (8.4%), Hulen Mall (7.5%) and Briarcliff Office Portfolio (4.8%) and 
      represent 39.9% of the initial pool balance, while the ten largest loans 
      represent 55.8%. 63 loans (93.2%) are secured by the borrowers' fee 
      simple interests, two loans (3.5%) are secured by the borrowers&#8217; fee 
      simple and leasehold interests, and three loans (3.3%) are secured by 
      the borrowers&#8217; leasehold interests in the related properties. The 
      mortgaged properties are located in 31 states and the District of 
      Columbia. Two state concentrations each represent in excess of 15.0% of 
      the pool balance: Texas (17.3%) and California (15.4%). There is also 
      exposure to three property types with concentrations in excess of 15.0%: 
      Retail (28.8%), Office (28.2%) and Multifamily (20.4%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KBRA&#8217;s analysis of the transaction incorporated our multi-borrower 
      rating process that begins with our analysts' evaluation of underlying 
      collateral properties' financial and operating performance, which 
      determine KBRA&#8217;s estimate of sustainable net cash flow (KNCF) and KBRA 
      value using our CMBS Property Evaluation Guidelines. On an aggregate 
      basis, KNCF was 3.4% less than the issuer cash flow. KBRA capitalization 
      rates were applied to each asset&#8217;s KNCF to derive values that were, on 
      an aggregate basis, 31.8% less than third party appraisal values. The 
      pool has an in-trust KLTV of 96.0% and an all-in KLTV of 108.8%; 
      however, the all-in KLTV is skewed by preferred equity that has debt 
      like characteristics and which is associated with the Veritas 
      Multifamily Portfolio loan. Excluding the preferred equity, the pool 
      all-in cutoff KLTV would be 100.5%. The model deploys rent and occupancy 
      stresses, probability of default regressions, and loss given default 
      calculations to determine losses for each loan, which are then used to 
      assign the credit ratings.

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 68 loans secured by 151 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.193 
      billion as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, Barclays Bank PLC, 
      Starwood Mortgage Funding LLC, and KeyBank National Association.

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 76.1% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 86.1%, and asset summary reviews on 86.1% of the pool.

      The transaction has a Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
      of 1.17x, a Fitch stressed loan-to-value (LTV) of 101.7%, and a Fitch 
      debt yield of 9.08%. Fitch's aggregate net cash flow represents a 
      variance of 7.15% to issuer cash flows.

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Leverage: The Fitch DSCR of 1.17x is below the average 2012 and 
      first-half 2013 of 1.24x and 1.36x, respectively. The Fitch LTV of 
      101.7% is higher than the 2012 and first-half 2013 averages of 97.2% and 
      99.8%, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Subordinate Debt: Eight loans (21.4%) have subordinate debt, including 
      the largest loan, Veritas Multifamily Portfolio, which has a B note as 
      well as two layers of preferred equity. Three other loans in the top 10 
      (369 Lexington Avenue, Regency Park Apartments, and 2 West 46th Street) 
      all have mezzanine debt.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Concentration in Michigan: The pool has an above average concentration 
      of properties in Michigan with 13 properties (9.1%), atypical of CMBS 
      2.0 transactions. The properties are generally stable performers and 
      considered best in class assets. The largest concentration in this pool 
      is Texas (17.3%), followed by California (15.4%) and Nevada (10.1%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Multifamily Concentration: Multifamily properties comprise 20.4% of the 
      portfolio, which is greater than the first-half 2013 concentration of 
      8.9%. This consists largely of the largest loan in the pool, Veritas 
      Multifamily Portfolio (10.0%). Additionally, 5.7% of the pool is backed 
      by manufactured housing communities. The largest property types are 
      retail (28.8%) and office (28.2%

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch performed two model-based break-even analyses to determine the 
      level of cash flow and value deterioration the pool could withstand 
      prior to $1 of loss being experienced by the 'BBB-sf' and 'AAAsf' rated 
      classes. Fitch found that the JPMBB 2013-C15 pool could withstand a 
      40.08% decline in value (based on appraised values at issuance) and an 
      approximately 17.17% decrease to the most recent actual cash flow prior 
      to experiencing a $1 of loss to the 'BBB-sf' rated class. Additionally, 
      Fitch found that the pool could withstand a 49.82% decline in value and 
      an approximately 30.64% decrease in the most recent actual cash flow 
      prior to experiencing $1 of loss to any 'AAAsf' rated class.

      Fitch Rates Coca-Cola's Proposed $5B Issuance 'A+'; Outlook Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+' rating to The Coca-Cola Company's 
      (Coca-Cola) proposed multi-tranche issuance of $5 billion of notes due 
      in 2016, 2018, 2020 and 2023. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A complete 
      list of ratings is provided at the end of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The notes will be issued by Coca-Cola and will rank equally with the 
      company's senior unsecured obligations. Coca-Cola will use the net 
      proceeds from the offering to fund a redemption of the Company's $1.25 
      billion 0.75% Notes due November 2013, $1 billion Floating Rate Notes 
      due March 2014 and $900 million 3.625% Notes due March 2014, to pay 
      related fees and expenses including redemption premiums and for general 
      corporate purposes. Coca-Cola has $36.2 billion of total debt as of the 
      end of the third quarter 2013, of which $18.8 billion was commercial 
      paper.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new notes are being issued under the company's existing indenture 
      dated April 26, 1988. While the indenture's restrictive covenants 
      include limitations on secured debt and sale and leaseback transactions, 
      the prospectus for the new notes excludes those covenants. Coca-Cola is 
      not bound by any financial covenants. The 2016 floating-rate notes may 
      not be redeemed prior to maturity. The 2016, 2018, 2020 and 2023 notes 
      are callable by Coca-Cola subject to a make-whole provision.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola's ratings are supported by its position as the world's largest 
      global beverage company and the value of the Coca-Cola brand. Coca-Cola 
      has 16 $1 billion brands, including Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite, 
      Powerade, Minute Maid, and Dasani. Given the prominence of carbonated 
      soft drinks (CSDs) in Coca-Cola's beverage portfolio, the ratings 
      consider the multiyear decline in CSD volumes in the U.S., growing 
      scrutiny over artificial sweeteners and modest CSD growth in other 
      developed countries. However, this risk is mitigated by Coca-Cola's 
      market strength in developing, higher-growth geographies with low per 
      capita consumption characteristics that provides an important offset.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola's ratings reflect the company's ability to consistently 
      generate considerable cash flow from operations (CFFO) and free cash 
      flow (FCF). Coca-Cola has demonstrated good execution and resiliency 
      with topline and cash flow growth driven by increasing volume, price/mix 
      and improved operating expense leverage, despite persistent global 
      macroeconomic pressure. Coca- Cola generated $7.7 billion and $2.3 
      billion (after adjusting for dividends) of CFFO and FCF respectively for 
      the first three quarters of 2013, after generating $10.6 billion and 
      $3.3 billion for the year ended Dec. 31, 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Consequently, Fitch still expects Coca-Cola's FCF to exceed $3 billion 
      in 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola is tracking at the lower end of its long-term financial 
      targets of 3%-4% worldwide volume and 6%-8% operating income growth. 
      Despite the current macroeconomic headwinds, year-to-date volume growth 
      was 2% and operating growth was 6% excluding the effects of structural 
      considerations. The global economic recovery remains fragile, negatively 
      affecting consumer spending, with pockets of volatility across emerging 
      market regions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch is concerned about the significant growth in Coca-Cola's 
      commercial paper (CP) balance over the past year. CP reached $18.8 
      billion at the end of the third quarter, an increase of $2.5 billion 
      during 2013. This compares to $12.9 billion in 2011. The commercial 
      paper mix now represents more than 50% of the firm's overall capital 
      structure. Despite the company's strong liquidity and good market 
      access, Fitch believes this level of CP could result in modestly higher 
      financial risk over the longer term.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The growth in CP balances results from Coca-Cola's mismatch between its 
      U.S. cash outflows and its significant international cash inflows which 
      the company has been reluctant to repatriate. Coca Cola maintains a 
      comparable cash balance along with its committed bank lines to provide 
      backup to its CP borrowings. At Sept. 27, 2013, Coca-Cola's liquidity 
      position of $26.9 billion consisted of $17.3 billion of cash, $3.2 
      billion of short-term investments, and $6.4 billion of availability 
      under its committed credit lines and revolving credit facility.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola has committed to $3 billion to $3.5 billion of net share 
      repurchases in 2013, after repurchasing a net $3.1 billion in 2012. 
      Share repurchases are pacing close to FCF generation with $2.7 billion 
      of common stock repurchased during 2013. While not anticipated, a 
      material reduction in Coca-Cola's cash balance without a commensurate 
      reduction in debt could result in a negative rating action.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola's leverage was 2.7x on a total debt to operating EBITDA basis 
      as of Sept. 27, 2013, up from 2.2x a year ago. Fitch considers leverage 
      above 2.0x as weak for the rating category but ratings incorporated the 
      fact that Coca-Cola's net leverage at Sept. 27, 2013 was 1.2x. Fitch 
      believes Coca-Cola should address its large CP balance in the 
      near-to-intermediate term with any reduction in cash matching any 
      corresponding reduction in CP levels. With the expected refinancing of 
      debt maturing in 2013 and 2014, Coca-Cola nearest longer-term debt 
      maturities are not until 2015 with $2.5 billion and 2016 with $1.7 
      billion coming due.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ratings also consider the potential of future acquisitions given the 
      company's transaction history. Fitch recognizes Coca-Cola's acquisitions 
      could be partially funded with debt but believes the company would 
      likely restore credit measures back in line within a reasonable 
      timeframe given its excess cash generation and cash flow growth. For 
      large transactions, Fitch would expect Coca-Cola to curtail share 
      repurchases.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch does not make a rating distinction between Coca-Cola Company and 
      Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. (CCR) issued obligations, since default 
      risk is very low at this level on the rating scale. CCR's notes are 
      structurally superior to the notes issued by Coca-Cola.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATINGS SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, 
      lead to positive rating include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola's ratings could be positively affected by the company 
      attaining total debt to operating EBITDA below 1.5x in combination with 
      a stated commitment to maintain stronger credit protection measures.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, 
      lead to negative rating include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola's ratings would be negatively affected by a large 
      debt-financed acquisition or share repurchase program or a reduction in 
      cash and cash equivalents without a commensurate reduction in CP 
      balances. While Coca-Cola has more CP outstanding than capacity under 
      its various committed facilities, the company has consistently 
      maintained a large cash balance, and the combination of cash and 
      facility availability provide adequate backup for the $18.8 billion of 
      CP.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, further negative pressure from increased declines with CSD 
      volumes in the U.S., greater than expected volatility in emerging market 
      regions, aggressive excise taxes increases in multiple regions, shift in 
      focus from pricing to volume and margin erosion from channel mix shifts 
      could also affect ratings.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The co-head of Goldman Sachs' (GS.N) global commodities business, Magid Shenouda, is leaving the bank after 14 years, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London-based Shenouda, who has run the commodities business for the past two years alongside New York-based Greg Agran, joined the firm as an executive director in oil trading in 1999, and had run European oil as well as power and gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He has been responsible for driving several key acquisitions, as well as the expansion of our business activities into new regions and products, including the build-out of our Energy, Coal, Freight and Emissions franchise," the co-heads of the securities division, which includes commodities, said in the memo. They are Isabell Ealet, who had run commodities until 2011, and Pablo Salame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shenouda's plans were not immediately known. The departure was first reported by SparkSpread. Goldman Sachs has also recently replaced Peter O'Hagan, who was global head of commodities sales, SparkSpread said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Leff; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
CHICAGO, October 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+'
rating to The 
Coca-Cola Company's (Coca-Cola) proposed multi-tranche issuance
of $5 billion of 
notes due in 2016, 2018, 2020 and 2023. The Rating Outlook is
Stable. A complete 
list of ratings is provided at the end of this release.
The notes will be issued by Coca-Cola and will rank equally with
the company's 
senior unsecured obligations. Coca-Cola will use the net
proceeds from the 
offering to fund a redemption of the Company's $1.25 billion
0.75% Notes due 
November 2013, $1 billion Floating Rate Notes due March 2014 and
$900 million 
3.625% Notes due March 2014, to pay related fees and expenses
including 
redemption premiums and for general corporate purposes.
Coca-Cola has $36.2 
billion of total debt as of the end of the third quarter 2013,
of which $18.8 
billion was commercial paper.
The new notes are being issued under the company's existing
indenture dated 
April 26, 1988. While the indenture's restrictive covenants
include limitations 
on secured debt and sale and leaseback transactions, the
prospectus for the new 
notes excludes those covenants. Coca-Cola is not bound by any
financial 
covenants. The 2016 floating-rate notes may not be redeemed
prior to maturity. 
The 2016, 2018, 2020 and 2023 notes are callable by Coca-Cola
subject to a 
make-whole provision. 
KEY RATING DRIVERS
Coca-Cola's ratings are supported by its position as the world's
largest global 
beverage company and the value of the Coca-Cola brand. Coca-Cola
has 16 $1 
billion brands, including Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite,
Powerade, Minute Maid, 
and Dasani. Given the prominence of carbonated soft drinks
(CSDs) in Coca-Cola's 
beverage portfolio, the ratings consider the multiyear decline
in CSD volumes in 
the U.S., growing scrutiny over artificial sweetners and modest
CSD growth in 
other developed countries. However, this risk is mitigated by
Coca-Cola's market 
strength in developing, higher-growth geographies with low per
capita 
consumption characteristics that provides an important offset.
Coca-Cola's ratings reflect the company's ability to
consistently generate 
considerable cash flow from operations (CFFO) and free cash flow
(FCF). 
Coca-Cola has demonstrated good execution and resiliency with
topline and cash 
flow growth driven by increasing volume, price/mix and improved
operating 
expense leverage, despite persistent global macroeconomic
pressure. Coca- Cola 
generated $7.7 billion and $2.3 billion (after adjusting for
dividends) of CFFO 
and FCF respectively for the first three quarters of 2013, after
generating 
$10.6 billion and $3.3 billion for the year ended Dec. 31, 2012.
Consequently, Fitch still expects Coca-Cola's FCF to exceed $3
billion in 2013. 
Coca-Cola is tracking at the lower end of its long-term
financial targets of 
3%-4% worldwide volume and 6%-8% operating income growth.
Despite the current 
macroeconomic headwinds, year-to-date volume growth was 2% and
operating growth 
was 6% excluding the effects of structural considerations. The
global economic 
recovery remains fragile, negatively affecting consumer
spending, with pockets 
of volatility across emerging market regions.
Fitch is concerned about the significant growth in Coca-Cola's
commercial paper 
(CP) balance over the past year. CP reached $18.8 billion at the
end of the 
third quarter, an increase of $2.5 billion during 2013. This
compares to $12.9 
billion in 2011. The commercial paper mix now represents more
than 50% of the 
firm's overall capital structure. Despite the company's strong
liquidity and 
good market access, Fitch believes this level of CP could result
in modestly 
higher financial risk over the longer term. 
The growth in CP balances results from Coca-Cola's mismatch
between its U.S. 
cash outflows and its significant international cash inflows
which the company 
has been reluctant to repatriate. Coca Cola maintains a
comparable cash balance 
along with its committed bank lines to provide backup to its CP
borrowings. At 
Sept. 27, 2013, Coca-Cola's liquidity position of $26.9 billion
consisted of 
$17.3 billion of cash, $3.2 billion of short-term investments,
and $6.4 billion 
of availability under its committed credit lines and revolving
credit facility.
Coca-Cola has committed to $3 billion to $3.5 billion of net
share repurchases 
in 2013, after repurchasing a net $3.1 billion in 2012. Share
repurchases are 
pacing close to FCF generation with $2.7 billion of common stock
repurchased 
during 2013. While not anticipated, a material reduction in
Coca-Cola's cash 
balance without a commensurate reduction in debt could result in
a negative 
rating action.
Coca-Cola's leverage was 2.7x on a total debt to operating
EBITDA basis as of 
Sept. 27, 2013, up from 2.2x a year ago. Fitch considers
leverage above 2.0x as 
weak for the rating category but ratings incorporated the fact
that Coca-Cola's 
net leverage at Sept. 27, 2013 was 1.2x. Fitch believes Coca-
Cola should 
address its large CP balance in the near-to-intermediate term
with any reduction 
in cash matching any corresponding reduction in CP levels. With
the expected 
refinancing of debt maturing in 2013 and 2014, Coca-Cola nearest
longer-term 
debt maturities are not until 2015 with $2.5 billion and 2016
with $1.7 billion 
coming due. 
Ratings also consider the potential of future acquisitions given
the company's 
transaction history. Fitch recognizes Coca-Cola's acquisitions
could be 
partially funded with debt but believes the company would likely
restore credit 
measures back in line within a reasonable timeframe given its
excess cash 
generation and cash flow growth. For large transactions, Fitch
would expect 
Coca-Cola to curtail share repurchases.
Fitch does not make a rating distinction between Coca-Cola
Company and Coca-Cola 
Refreshments USA, Inc. (CCR) issued obligations, since default
risk is very low 
at this level on the rating scale. CCR's notes are structurally
superior to the 
notes issued by Coca-Cola.
RATINGS SENSITIVITIES
Positive: Future developments that may, individually or
collectively, lead to 
positive rating include: 
Coca-Cola's ratings could be positively affected by the company
attaining total 
debt to operating EBITDA below 1.5x in combination with a stated
commitment to 
maintain stronger credit protection measures.
Negative: Future developments that may, individually or
collectively, lead to 
negative rating include:
Coca-Cola's ratings would be negatively affected by a large
debt-financed 
acquisition or share repurchase program or a reduction in cash
and cash 
equivalents without a commensurate reduction in CP balances.
While Coca-Cola has 
more CP outstanding than capacity under its various committed
facilities, the 
company has consistently maintained a large cash balance, and
the combination of 
cash and facility availability provide adequate backup for the
$18.8 billion of 
CP. 
In addition, further negative pressure from increased declines
with CSD volumes 
in the U.S., greater than expected volatility in emerging market
regions, 
aggressive excise taxes increases in multiple regions, shift in
focus from 
pricing to volume and margin erosion from channel mix shifts
could also affect 
ratings.
Fitch currently rates Coca-Cola as follows:
The Coca-Cola Company
--Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A+';
--Bank credit facilities 'A+';
--Senior unsecured debt 'A+';
--Short-term IDR 'F1';
--CP 'F1'.
Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. and Coca-Cola Refreshments
Canada, Ltd. (CCR)
--Long-term IDR 'A+';
--Senior unsecured debt 'A+'.
The Rating Outlook is Stable.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif., Oct. 29, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Huntington Beach City School District, Chevron and the non-profit MIND Research Institute today announced a public-private partnership that's expanding a proven computer-based math program, featuring a penguin named JiJi, to all of its schools. Chevron executives presented a $92,500 check to district leaders at a celebration this morning at Hawes Elementary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Blended learning, which is gaining popularity nationwide, uses self-paced, computer-based learning to augment traditional teaching methods. Some Huntington Beach schools already use the ST Math instructional software in a blended learning environment to create a deeper understanding of math concepts. The Chevron grant, combined with district funding, enables the expansion of the ST Math program to all of HBCSD's schools &#8211; reaching a total of more than 7,000 students at nine elementary and middle schools.&#160; The grant provides MIND Research's visually based ST Math instructional software, teacher training and year-round educational support to the schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Chevron is committed to supporting schools in our community and especially preparing them for success in science, technology, engineering and math," said Hector Infante, Public and Government Affairs Manager at Chevron. "Over the years, we've been impressed with the impact MIND Research Institute's ST Math program has had at schools throughout Orange County, so we're excited to continue expanding our partnership."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Research shows that early math skills are the number one predictor of later academic success, high school graduation rates and college matriculation. The ST Math program has been proven to double students' growth in math proficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"We're grateful for Chevron's generosity in helping us expand the successful ST Math program," said Gregg Haulk, Superintendent of Huntington Beach City School District. "It's great to see our students become confident problem solvers, who not only excel in math but learn to love it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	With this new grant, Chevron's total giving to support MIND Research Institute's programs exceeds $775,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Our work wouldn't be possible without partners like Chevron and Huntington Beach City Schools who share our vision of transforming math education," said Matthew Peterson, Ph.D., co-founder and chief operating officer of MIND Research. "Together, we're making a meaningful impact on students lives today and preparing them for a future full of opportunities and success."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	MIND's ST Math program provides visual, computer-based math games that support deep understanding of concepts covered by California math standards at each grade level. Because the program doesn't rely on language proficiency or prior math proficiency, it's accessible for English Language Learners and children with learning disabilities. Students use ST Math for 45 minutes on the computer, twice a week under their teacher's supervision, in a blended learning environment. The teachers are trained on how to connect the visual puzzles to their conventional symbolic texts, and coached on how to guide children through challenging sections by getting them to express their thinking, rather than simply showing them the solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			About Chevron&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Chevron is one of the world's leading integrated energy companies, with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company is involved in virtually every facet of the energy industry. Chevron explores for, produces and transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes transportation fuels and lubricants; manufactures and sells petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides energy efficiency solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future, including biofuels. Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif. More information about Chevron is available at www.chevron.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			About MIND Research Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	MIND Research Institute is an education nonprofit dedicated to ensuring that all students are mathematically equipped to solve the world's most challenging problems. MIND's distinctive visual approach to math and problem-solving is the basis of its innovative, research-proven ST Math&#174; programs for elementary and secondary schools. MIND's programs currently reach over 500,000 students and 21,000 teachers in more than 1,780 schools in 30 states. For more information, visit www.mindresearch.net.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

extending the S 500's string of record highs, as economic data
supported views the Federal Reserve will keep its stimulus
intact for several months and IBM gained after it
announced a buyback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic data showed consumer spending rose in September,
but auto sales fell, indicating sluggish economic growth in the
third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other data showed consumer confidence fell sharply in
October as a result of the partial government shutdown while
producer prices unexpectedly fell in September, pointing to
muted inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It added to evidence of sluggish economic growth just as the
Fed begins a two-day policy meeting. Expectations are high that
officials are unlikely to shift monetary policy this week as
they wait for more evidence of how badly Washington's budget
battle has hurt the U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ghosts of tapering are not coming this Halloween,"
said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer for equities at
Charles Schwab Corp. "The government shutdown pushed the
tapering discussion further out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's likely to keep a floor under stock for the near term
at least, though longer term earnings and, in particular,
lackluster revenue growth may be a concern, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM Corp was the top boost to both the Dow and the
S 500, hitting a session high of $181.99 after the company
authorized a $15 billion stock buyback. Shares were last up 2.3
percent at $181.39.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average was up 102.10
points, or 0.66 percent, at 15,671.03. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
Index was up 8.35 points, or 0.47 percent, at 1,770.46.
The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 9.75 points, or 0.25
percent, at 3,949.88.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S hit an intraday record of 1,770.88.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limiting some of the day's gains, Apple shares were
down 1.3 percent at $522.78, a day after the iPad maker's
results disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another decliner was JPMorgan Chase, down 0.4
percent at $52.49 after a person familiar with the situation
said the preliminary $13 billion deal set by the bank's CEO and
the U.S. attorney general has hit a stumbling block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Thomson Reuters data through Tuesday morning,
of the 281 companies in the S 500 companies that have posted
earnings, 68.7 percent have topped profit expectations, above
both the long-term average of 63 percent and the 66 percent beat
rate over the past four quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, only 52.5 percent have beaten revenue estimates,
below the 61 percent rate since 2002 and slightly above the 49
percent rate over the past four quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc rose 1.7 percent to $31.26 to help lift
the Dow and S after the drug company better-than-expected
third-quarter earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cummins Inc slumped 6 percent to $126.80 as the
worst performer on the S 500 after the maker of engines and
other vehicle components, reported lower-than-expected quarterly
profit on Tuesday and cut its full-year outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The housing market was a bright spot, as home prices rose
0.9 percent in August, more than had been expected, according to
the S/Case Shiller index. Among homebuilders, Lennar 
was up 1 percent at $37.18.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Infosys says in process of resolving visa investigation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Company reserved $35 million for settlement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Harichandan Arakali&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Indian IT firm Infosys Ltd
 said on Tuesday it was in the process of reaching a
settlement with the U.S. government over the company's alleged
misuse of temporary business visas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities have been investigating India's
second-largest information technology services exporter since
2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal had earlier said that the United
States was expected to announce a resolution in the case on
Wednesday. A resolution had yet to be finalised, Infosys said in
a statement on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In response to reports attributed to Justice Department
officials, Infosys is in the process of completing a civil
resolution with the government regarding its investigation of
visa issues and I-9 documentation errors," the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I-9 forms document verification of the identity of employees
and their authorisation to work in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The resolution has not been finalized," Infosys said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Infosys denies any claims of systemic visa fraud, misuse of
visas for competitive advantage, or immigration abuse," the
company said in an addition to its statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indian IT outsourcing firms like Infosys use thousands of
visas to bring in employees, mainly from India, a practice that
has come under intense scrutiny as it is seen by some U.S.
policymakers as hurting the American job market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Infosys said it had set aside a reserve
of $35 million as it worked towards a resolution for the U.S.
government's investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

Samsung and Apple

 (Adds latest industry rankings estimates in paragraph 4)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ritsuko Ando&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Nokia predicted a
more profitable future for its NSN networks equipment business
on Tuesday, raising hopes for growth in what will be the Finnish
firm's main business after its former flagship phones division
is sold to Microsoft for $5.2 billion in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third-quarter results also showed growth in Lumia
smartphone sales, although analysts said Microsoft will still
face a tough time in pushing its way into the competitive
consumer devices market with the Nokia deal, which is due to
close some time in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of Lumia smartphones rose 19 percent
quarter-on-quarter to 8.8 million units, thanks to the launch of
more models and what the company said was strong demand,
particularly for the Lumia 520.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was still a distant third in the smartphone race,
however, with total sales of nearly 15 million including its
Asha range of devices, while Apple sold over 33.8 iPhones in the
same quarter. Market leader Samsung Electronics is
variously estimated to have shipped between 85 and 88.4 million
smartphones in the period, according to new reports this week
from analysts Juniper Research and Strategy Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to see competitive challenge at the higher-end
of the market, both in terms of pricing and required marketing
support," Nokia's finance chief Timo Ihamuotila told investors
on a conference call, saying such concerns were what drove it to
sell the handset business to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greger Johansson, analyst at research firm Redeye, said
Microsoft will be taking over a business that is still
struggling to increase sales volumes and profitability. The
phone division's operating margin was a negative 1.6 percent in
the last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I still think it is not obvious they are going to turn that
side around," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stripping out the business being sold to Microsoft, Nokia
said its underlying group operating margin in the third quarter
would have been 11.5 percent, 7.7 percentage points higher than
the actual underlying margin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phone division's operating margin was running at a loss
of 1.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISING MARGINS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Nokia rose over 7 percent to mark the year's high
of 5.42 euros, a rise of 85 percent so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inge Heydorn, fund manager at Sentat Asset Management, said
investors were impressed by Nokia's forecast for NSN's profit
margin to improve in the fourth quarter to around 12 percent,
plus or minus 4 percentage points, from 8.4 percent in the third
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The share reaction is justified with the superb margin
forecast," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unit's core operating profit fell 33 percent in the
third quarter from a year ago to 218 million euros ($301
million), on sales down 24 percent at 5.2 billion euros. This
was below the average profit forecast of 228 million given in a
Reuters poll, as the impact of earlier cost cuts waned and major
contracts were completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Nokia said it expects NSN's sales to show "solid" growth
in the final three months of the year, helped by stronger
spending by European telecoms carriers on high-speed LTE
wireless broadband networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think LTE will accelerate in Europe starting from Q4
this year," Rajeev Suri, the head of NSN, told investors on a
conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors said the outlook vindicated Nokia for its decision
in early September to sell the handsets business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are beginning to have a direction, and the Microsoft
deal looks like a smart move from a shareholder's point of
view," said Mika Heikkila, fund manager at asset management
company Taaleritehdas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said the outlook soothed fears of an industry-wide
slowdown. Swedish network equipment rival Ericsson 
reported weaker than expected results last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this report will calm things down. It gives more
information on how they will be going forward, it shows Nokia is
coming back," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NSN, which will account for around 90 percent of the group's
sales after Microsoft completes its acquisition of the handset
business, sells a range of mobile broadband equipment to network
operators and has transformed itself over the past year from an
unprofitable venture into a source of cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been cutting costs and turning down low-margin
contracts to focus instead on more profitable deals to help
build high-speed wireless broadband networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had the Microsoft deal already been completed Nokia said it
would have ended the third quarter with net cash of 7.5 billion
euros, instead of an actual 2.4 billion euros, with NSN
contributing 1.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia said it was still considering how to use the cash it
will receive from Microsoft. Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb
recently took a position in Nokia, saying he expected a
"meaningful portion of the excess" be returned to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources familiar with the matter have said Nokia's board is
also considering a possible acquisition of ailing rival
Alcatel-Lucent's wireless business. Nokia declined to
comment on a possible deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While analysts said the latest results showed Nokia might be
capable of a deal at least some investors remain wary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm always scared if somebody goes to buy a French
company," said Heikkila. "They still have protectionism, and
companies are not allowed to dismantle structures the way they
should be."

&lt;p&gt;* Pfizer rises after results, boosting the Dow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* IBM climbs on buyback, dividend announcement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Retail sales dip in Sept, shutdown weighs on confidence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Indexes: Dow 0.50 pct, S 0.32 pct, Nasdaq flat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chuck Mikolajczak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on
Tuesday, as soft economic data supported expectations the U.S.
Federal Reserve will keep its stimulus measures intact for
several months, while gains in Pfizer and IBM helped the Dow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic data showed consumer spending rose in September,
but auto sales fell, indicating sluggish economic growth in the
third quarter. Other data showed consumer confidence fell
sharply in October as a result of the partial government
shutdown while producer prices unexpectedly fell in September,
pointing to muted inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Fed surprised me by not tapering in September and the
key reason they cited was the fact inflation is running very
moderately, and they still have lots of room on the inflation
front," said Doug Foreman, co-chief investment officer at Kayne
Anderson Rudnick Investment Management in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Certainly the data today didn't give them anything
different to think about that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed begins a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday, with
officials unlikely to make any shift to monetary policy this
week as they wait for more evidence of how badly Washington's
budget battle has hurt the U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The housing market was a bright spot, as home prices rose
0.9 percent in August, more than had been expected, according to
the S/Case Shiller index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average rose 77.22 points or
0.5 percent, to 15,646.15, the S 500 gained 5.61 points
or 0.32 percent, to 1,767.72 and the Nasdaq Composite 
dropped 0.112 points or 0 percent, to 3,940.017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equities have rallied as expectations for when the Fed will
begin to trim its $85 billion monthly bond-buying program have
been pushed further out. The S 500 is on track for its ninth
gain in the past 10 sessions, rising over 4 percent during that
span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc rose 1.6 percent to $31.23 to help lift
the Dow and S after the pharmaceutical company
better-than-expected third-quarter earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple weighed on the Nasdaq after the iPad maker's
results late Monday disappointed some investors. Shares rose as
much as 1.8 percent in early trading but were last down 0.9
percent to $524.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM Corp was the top boost to both the Dow and the
S 500, hitting a session high of $181 after the company
announced its quarterly dividend and authorized a $15 billion
stock buyback. Shares were recently up 1.8 percent to $180.51.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cummins Inc slumped 8.5 percent to $122.30 as the
worst performer on the S 500 after the maker of engines and
other vehicle components, reported lower-than-expected quarterly
profit on Tuesday and cut its full-year outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Thomson Reuters data though Tuesday morning, of
the 281 companies in the S 500 companies that have posted
earnings, 68.7 percent have topped profit expectations, above
both the long-term average of 63 percent and the 66 percent beat
rate over the past four quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, only 52.5 percent have beaten revenue estimates,
below the 61 percent rate since 2002 and slightly above the 49
percent rate over the past four quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Kors rose 1 percent to $77.17 after
Standard &amp; Poor's said the company would be added to the S 500
as of Nov. 1, replacing NYSE Euronext.&lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: M-Commerce Market in US to 2016 Featuring ISIS,

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/wqrp3x/mcommerce_market) 
      has announced the addition of the "M-Commerce 
      Market in US 2012-2016" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysts forecast the M-Commerce market in the US to grow at a CAGR 
      of 32.38 percent over the period 2012-2016.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the key factors contributing to this market growth is the high 
      adoption of smartphones. The M-Commerce market in the US has also been 
      witnessing the increasing demand for the digital purchase of goods. 
      However, the requirement of large-scale investments could pose a 
      challenge to the growth of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Offers are always introduced to attract customers. Many retailers are 
      introducing mobile coupons that provide various offers and benefits for 
      consumers who shop through m-commerce. This encourages consumers to 
      purchase goods through m-commerce. As there is a demand for the virtual 
      wallet among smartphone users, the availability of mobile coupons will 
      encourage them to make mobile purchases.

			IBM Board Approves Quarterly Cash Dividend; Authorizes $15 Billion 
      for Stock Repurchase
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The IBM (NYSE: IBM) board of directors today declared a regular 
      quarterly cash dividend of $0.95 per common share, payable December 10, 
      2013 to stockholders of record November 8, 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With the payment of the December 10 dividend, IBM will have paid 
      consecutive quarterly dividends every year since 1916.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The board today also authorized $15 billion in additional funds for use 
      in the company&#8217;s stock repurchase program. IBM said it will repurchase 
      shares on the open market or in private transactions from time to time, 
      depending on market conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This amount is in addition to approximately $5.6 billion remaining at 
      the end of September 2013 from a prior authorization. With this new 
      authorization, IBM will have approximately $20.6 billion for its stock 
      repurchase program. IBM expects to request additional share repurchase 
      authorization at the October 2014 board meeting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Ginni Rometty, IBM chairman, president and chief executive officer said,

&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI (Reuters) - Nokia predicted a more profitable future for its NSN networks equipment business on Tuesday, raising hopes for growth in what will be the Finnish firm's main business after its former flagship phones division is sold to Microsoft for $5.2 billion in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third-quarter results also showed growth in Lumia smartphone sales, although analysts said Microsoft will still face a tough time in pushing its way into the competitive consumer devices market with the Nokia deal, which is due to close some time in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of Lumia smartphones rose 19 percent quarter-on-quarter to 8.8 million units, thanks to the launch of more models and what the company said was strong demand particularly for the Lumia 520.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was still a distant third in the smartphone race, however, since Apple sold over 33.8 iPhones in the same quarter while market leader Samsung Electronics shipped 88.4 million smartphones in the period, according to research firm Strategy Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to see competitive challenge at the higher-end of the market, both in terms of pricing and required marketing support," Nokia's finance chief Timo Ihamuotila told investors on a conference call, saying such concerns were what drove it to sell the handset business to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greger Johansson, analyst at research firm Redeye, said Microsoft will be taking over a business that is still struggling to increase sales volumes and profitability. The phone division's operating margin was a negative 1.6 percent in the last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I still think it is not obvious they are going to turn that side around," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stripping out the business being sold to Microsoft, Nokia said its underlying group operating margin in the third quarter would have been 11.5 percent, 7.7 percentage points higher than the actual underlying margin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phone division's operating margin was running at a loss of 1.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISING MARGINS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Nokia rose over 7 percent to mark the year's high of 5.42 euros, a rise of 85 percent so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inge Heydorn, fund manager at Sentat Asset Management, said investors were impressed by Nokia's forecast for NSN's profit margin to improve in the fourth quarter to around 12 percent, plus or minus 4 percentage points, from 8.4 percent in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The share reaction is justified with the superb margin forecast," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unit's core operating profit fell 33 percent in the third quarter from a year ago to 218 million euros ($301 million), on sales down 24 percent at 5.2 billion euros. This was below the average profit forecast of 228 million given in a Reuters poll, as the impact of earlier cost cuts waned and major contracts were completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Nokia said it expects NSN's sales to show "solid" growth in the final three months of the year, helped by stronger spending by European telecoms carriers on high-speed LTE wireless broadband networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think LTE will accelerate in Europe starting from Q4 this year," Rajeev Suri, the head of NSN, told investors on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors said the outlook vindicated Nokia for its decision in early September to sell the handsets business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are beginning to have a direction, and the Microsoft deal looks like a smart move from a shareholder's point of view," said Mika Heikkila, fund manager at asset management company Taaleritehdas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said the outlook soothed fears of an industry-wide slowdown. Swedish network equipment rival Ericsson reported weaker than expected results last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this report will calm things down. It gives more information on how they will be going forward, it shows Nokia is coming back," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NSN, which will account for around 90 percent of the group's sales after Microsoft completes its acquisition of the handset business, sells a range of mobile broadband equipment to network operators and has transformed itself over the past year from an unprofitable venture into a source of cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been cutting costs and turning down low-margin contracts to focus instead on more profitable deals to help build high-speed wireless broadband networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had the Microsoft deal already been completed Nokia said it would have ended the third quarter with net cash of 7.5 billion euros, instead of an actual 2.4 billion euros, with NSN contributing 1.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia said it was still considering how to use the cash it will receive from Microsoft. Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb recently took a position in Nokia, saying he expected a "meaningful portion of the excess" be returned to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources familiar with the matter have said Nokia's board is also considering a possible acquisition of ailing rival Alcatel-Lucent's wireless business. Nokia declined to comment on a possible deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While analysts said the latest results showed Nokia might be capable of a deal at least some investors remain wary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm always scared if somebody goes to buy a French company," said Heikkila. "They still have protectionism, and companies are not allowed to dismantle structures the way they should be."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=0.7254 euros)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Jussi Rosendahl, Simon Johnson and Olof Swahnberg; Editing by Greg Mahlich)&lt;/p&gt;

The early adopters and beta testers have been over the moon about their results and growing account balances," added Dalton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The early trading history has shown this to be an excellent product," said Ali Khan, CTO of ITM Financial. "We saw the blog post about the release spike by 600 Facebook 'Likes' in 48 hours after the indicator started trading and our binary options app get very popular.."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Binary International, which offers binary options trading to people around the world, has sponsored the release and is also excited by the recent surge in interest in the CAD/JPY currency pair on their binary options trading platform.  "We see the indicator released by ITM Financial as a great way for new binary options traders to get used to trading, start with just one currency pair.  Traders can then come in on our $100,000 demo accounts and test the software, practice trading, and get used to how the binary market works, without risking any of their own money," added Ray West of Binary International.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The release of the CAD/JPY indicator follows the very successful release of the "TradeElite v1.0" trading indicator, that specialized in finding positive trades based on short time frames like 60 seconds.  The "TradeEllite v.1.0" trades across all access classes and can also be downloaded for free from Binary International. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ITM Financial is a forex binary startup out of Boston Massachusetts.

			Carlsbad-Based Skin Care Company Trademarks &#8220;Functional Skin Care&#8482;&#8221; 
      for Flagship Brand, SkinAgain&#8482;, and Other Partners
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visage Pro USA, LLC, a contract, private label skin care company, 
      recently announced it has successfully trademarked the term &#8216;Functional 
      Skin Care&#8482;&#8217;&#160;for use in marketing one of its flagship skin care 
      brands, SkinAgain&#8482;. Visage Pro is a US based company, focused on 
      innovation, development and production of skin care formulas for some of 
      the world&#8217;s most important cosmetic brands. Visage Pro offers both US 
      and Swiss production and has a vast array of stock cosmetic formulations 
      available for private labeling.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Some companies claim to have powerful cosmetic skin care products but 
      the term &#8216;cosmeceutical&#8217; has no meaning under the law according to the 
      US FDA,&#8221; says Sherrie Berry, Founder of SkinAgain. &#8220;There is an 
      abundance of deceitful marketing hype in the skin care industry. Skin 
      care lines unknowingly put their name on what they believe are powerful 
      and effective creams, when in reality the product formula contains less 
      than 0.2% of an active ingredient in the formula.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      By securing the trademark for Functional Skin Care&#8482;, Visage Pro 
      clients can choose formulas with confidence, knowing their product is 
      guaranteed to contain the most potent and highest recommended percentage 
      of effective active ingredients available while also being fragrance-, 
      paraben-, gluten-, dye- and cruelty-free. Whether it&#8217;s a serum, cream, 
      mask or spot treatment, SkinAgain and Visage Pro&#8217;s other private label 
      partners can rest assured that their products live up to the Functional 
      Skin Care&#8482; standard.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The SkinAgain&#8482; line is meticulously formulated to Functional Skin Care&#8482; 
      standards with optimal ingredient blends. The brand's Youth 
      product,
			designed
			to effectively diminish the 
      appearance of fine lines, dark spots and wrinkles, contains a biomimetic 
      peptide blend, Medullaris leaf extract, Cyathea Rumex Occidentalis and 
      extract Vibro Alginolyticus Ferment Filtrate. Rescue 
      contains a unique pairing of Aloe Vera, Burdock root, cooling cucumber 
      and biocompatible peptides to help soothe and maintain healthy skin in 
      cancer patients suffering from post-radiation treatments.
			The 
      heavy dose of Palmitoyl Tripeptide-8 used in Relief 
      has been shown to help reduce itching and redness commonly caused by 
      skin irritations. Highly concentrated antioxidant ingredients like green 
      tea, gingko biloba, Vitamin E, unroasted shea butter extract and avocado 
      seed extract used in Vanish 
      help effectively reduce the appearance of cellulite and scarring.

      Fitch: JPM Settlement Sets High Bar for Future FHFA Deals
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JP Morgan Chase's (JPM) $4 billion settlement with the Federal Housing 
      Finance Agency (FHFA) sets a relatively high bar for other banks seeking 
      to reach similar agreements, according to Fitch.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Settlements by the larger institutions named in the complaint may pave 
      the way for more deals. However, we also believe that other banks 
      involved in the FHFA litigation may need to increase the size of their 
      litigation reserves to reflect the comparative amounts of recent 
      settlements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPM's settlement represents close to 12% of the approximately $33 
      billion original face value of the private-label, mortgage-backed 
      securities (PLS) cited in the FHFA complaint. These include securities 
      issued by JPM, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. The relative size of 
      the settlement is only slightly lower than UBS's $885 million payment 
      earlier this year, which represented roughly 14% of the original face 
      value.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In our view, these amounts are substantial, particularly given the level 
      of to-date losses on the underlying PLS. This reflects the more 
      aggressive stance taken by the federal government in resolving 
      litigation against the banks involving precrisis matters.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch believes that Bank of America (BofA) has the largest potential 
      exposure out of the 17 banks cited in FHFA's lawsuits. Including 
      securities issued by Countrywide and Merrill Lynch, the bank has 
      approximately $57 billion in original face value of PLS cited by FHFA. 
      It is challenging to estimate the exposure for any individual 
      institution, and BofA's other mortgage-related negotiations and 
      settlements may also influence the outcome of this litigation. However, 
      using the JPM and UBS settlements as a proxy, Fitch estimates BofA's 
      figure could range between $5 billion and $8 billion, should the bank 
      decide to settle. We do not believe a settlement of this size would 
      affect BofA's current ratings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Most institutions do not provide detailed information on the size of 
      litigation reserves, making it difficult to project future reserve 
      increases. JPM has recently disclosed $23 billion of litigation reserves 
      as of Sept. 30, 2013, including a $9.3 billion provision added in 
      third-quarter 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Proceeds from the settlements are paid directly to Fannie Mae and 
      Freddie Mac, which pay out most of their net income to the Treasury in 
      the form of a dividend.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For additional thoughts on the potential size of future settlements, see

			Presentation Details&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Mobile and Web transactions are significantly impacting mainframe and DB2 workloads, but many traditional APM tools don't provide teams with the visibility they need to understand how distributed and mainframe applications interact. Distributed teams can't track performance into the mainframe and mainframe teams are blind to the impact of distributed code on mainframe transactions and workload. Session attendees will learn how next generation APM can uncover new DB2 tuning opportunities to reduce MIPS consumption, accelerate MTTR and postpone hardware and software upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			About the Speaker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 29 (IFR) - The Coca-Cola Co, rated Aa3, AA-/A+,
announced a new five-part benchmark US dollar bond on Tuesday,
sources on the deal told IFR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drinks giant is coming to market with a three-year fixed
rate note and three-year floater, as well as fixed-rate tenors
of five, seven and 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial price thoughts have been set in the area of
Treasuries plus 35bps, 50-55bp, 70bp and 80bp for the fixed rate
tranches in maturity order. Guidance on the three-year floater
is Libor plus the equivalent spread on the three-year fixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is Coca-Cola's first appearance in the US dollar bond
market since February, when it raised USD2.5 billion in a
three-part transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and
Morgan Stanley are joint bookrunners on the new bond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI Oct 29 (Reuters) - The Indian unit of JPMorgan Asset
Management and Religare Invesco Asset Management Co Pvt Ltd
separately filed with India's markets regulator on Tuesday to
start Europe-focused funds, as fund houses look to tap into
rising investor interest in overseas assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both JPMorgan and joint venture Religare Invesco would
launch their products as fund of funds schemes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's India fund will invest into units of JPMorgan
Funds - Europe Dynamic Fund, which was managing
about $332.7 million in assets as of end-September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Religare fund will primarily invest in the units of
Invesco Pan European Equity Fund, which manages
about $2.01 billion as per Lipper data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to data from the Association of Mutual Funds in
India, funds investing abroad have grown their assets under
management by more than 10 percent to 23.7 billion rupees this
year, as investors look for higher returns abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, an executive at Franklin Templeton's India unit
told Reuters the asset manager was considering launching a
Europe-focused fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index has gained
11.3 percent since the end of June due to improving economic
growth, while India's NSE index has gained 6.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funds in Lipper's Europe Equity sector topped the table for
global net inflows last month, marking a fifth straight month of

			IBM Leverages MotioCI to Save Money and Improve Satisfaction in 
      World&#8217;s Largest Cognos Environment
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Within a year of implementing MotioCI, the IBM Business Analytics Center 
      of Competency has recouped hundreds of thousands of dollars in labor 
      savings. The use of MotioCI has enabled governed self-service BI, 
      facilitated an agile BI development process, and improved customer 
      satisfaction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The IBM Business Analytics Center of Competency (BACC) manages IBM&#8217;s 
      enterprise-wide business analytics environment and standardizes 
      processes which guide adopters to efficiently deliver business analytics 
      solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The BACC oversees IBM&#8217;s internal business analytics (BA) strategic 
      roadmap which involves centralizing its BA infrastructure, reducing 
      implementation and operational costs, and evolving streamlined BA 
      processes and practices. Over the past several years, the IBM BACC has 
      consolidated hundreds of departmental BI installations into a single 
      production Cognos platform hosted on a massively scalable private 
      analytics cloud, named &#8220;Blue Insight.&#8221; By mid-2013, the population of 
      Blue Insight users had grown to include over 200 globally diverse 
      business teams comprised of over 4,000 Cognos developers, 5,000 testers, 
      and over 400,000 named users. Blue Insight was hosting over 30,000 
      Cognos report specs, drawing data from over 600 different source 
      systems, and servicing an average of 1.2 million report executions each 
      month. As the adoption rate of the Blue Insight platform continued to 
      accelerate, the BACC operations team found itself spending more and more 
      time servicing administrative requests from these Cognos business teams. 
      Frequent administrative requests involved: 1) Content promotions- the 
      promotion of Cognos content between environments, 2) Data recovery &#8211; the 
      restoration of accidentally deleted Cognos content, 3) Issue resolution 
      &#8211; helping with root cause analysis of defects in the authored BA 
      content, etc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      After an in-depth review of commercial options for automating 
      version control and content 
      deployment in Cognos environments, the IBM BACC selected MotioCI as 
      the solution for streamlining many of the day-to-day Cognos 
      administrative tasks that were devouring so much time from the 
      operations team.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The key benefits the IBM BACC has gained from implementing MotioCI 
      include: 1) Reduced Cognos administration and support costs, 2) Balanced 
      governance and autonomy, 3) Improved development processes by enabling 
      Agile BI methods, and 4) Governed self-service BI.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We calculated an annual number based on experience thus far and 
      determined that MotioCI should give us savings of about $155,000 over 
      the course of a year. We hope to be able to expand our savings upwards 
      as we transition all of our business teams to the self-service model,&#8221; 
      said Meleisa Holek, Manager, IBM Business Analytics Enablement Team.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In recent years, IBM has transitioned many of its internal projects to a 
      more agile approach. Key tenants of this approach include the enablement 
      of rapid deployment of content, a tight feedback loop with end-users, 
      and the avoidance of IT bottlenecks. Moving to the &#8220;self-service&#8221; model 
      has enabled IBM&#8217;s own Cognos authors to promote their Cognos content in 
      a controlled and repeatable fashion, all the while keeping their 
      development cycles moving at the brisk pace that they need.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With the Cognos product alone, there is no easy way to allow different 
      teams to manage themselves in a governed manner - where they&#8217;re 
      prevented from impacting other business teams,&#8221; said David Kelly, 
      Project Manager, IBM BACC. &#8220;MotioCI has helped us move along the 
      self-service roadmap and we&#8217;re growing quite rapidly. By the end of this 
      year, most of our projects will be able to do much of the management 
      themselves - from promotions to scheduling to security to whatever they 
      want to do within their space. This will allow the operations team to 
      focus on some of the other service areas we&#8217;re looking to expand.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

five months as consumer lending rates rose and shoppers eyed
sluggish economic growth ahead, a survey showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa said its U.S. domestic payment volume dropped to 8
percent of global volumes in September from 11 percent in
August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard have been trying to capture new business
in emerging markets where more customers are signing up for
cards and digital payments instead of cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net income attributable to Visa fell to $1.19 billion, or
$1.85 per Class A share, from $1.66 billion, or $2.47, a year
earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average, had expected the company to earn $1.85
per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total operating revenue rose 9 percent to $2.97 billion but
came in short of analysts' expectation of $3.02 billion due to a
strong U.S. dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa's results were hit by a $574 million income tax
provision, compared with a benefit of $74 million a year
earlier. The company gave no reason for the bigger tax bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa's payment volumes rose 13 percent to $1.1 trillion in
the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foster City, California-based Visa's shares have risen 35
percent since the beginning of the year, outperforming the
broader S 500 Index, which has gained around 24
percent. They closed at $203.82 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Oct 30 (Reuters) - JP Morgan has put its
chief currency dealer in London, Richard Usher, on leave, a
source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mirrors developments at Standard Chartered,
which has also put one of its senior FX traders on leave,
according to a source familiar with the matter. Matt Gardiner
joined StanChart from Swiss bank UBS only last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usher, head of spot G10 currency trading, joined JP Morgan
from Royal Bank of Scotland in May 2010. He remains a
full-time employee at JP Morgan and has not been suspended. But
he hasn't been at his desk for around two weeks, the source
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usher could not be reached for comment, and JP Morgan
declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan is one of several banks cooperating with the
Financial Conduct Authority in Britain and other regulators
around the world looking into allegations of currency
manipulation in the $5.3 trillion-a-day global market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was unclear whether JP Morgan's decision to put Usher on
leave had anything to do with this investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usher is still listed as "active" on the UK Financial
Conduct Authority's register, and is listed as one of the 13
members of the Bank of England's Joint Standing Committee's
chief dealers group at the end of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bank of England declined to comment, however, on whether
he was still on that committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland said on Wednesday it had
sought to reassure clients about the foreign exchange rates they
were being offered and rival Barclays said it was
cooperating regulators scrutinising the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oct 30 (Reuters) - Coal miner Walter Energy Inc said
prices on steel-making coal are improving and will continue to
firm next year due to strong demand in Asia, sending its shares
up 3.3 percent despite a larger-than-expected quarterly loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news cheered Walter investors, who have endured a 55
percent drop in the stock this year as weak demand for steel has
hit prices of metallurgical coal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It appears that the market for their product, which is met
coal, is seeing some signs of positive life," Sterne Agee
analyst Mike Dudas said, adding that the company had done a good
job of controlling costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter rival Arch Coal Inc on Tuesday cut its
production outlook for steel-making coal for the second time
this year due to weak prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Walter Energy Chief Executive Walt Scheller said
prices were showing sustainable improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's good to see the market moving in a positive
direction," he told analysts on a conference call. "And met coal
prices should further improve in 2014 assuming continued strong
demand in Asia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy reported a net loss of $100.7 million, or
$1.61 per share, for the third quarter ended Sept. 30. ()&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's net loss was $1.1 billion, or $16.97 per
share, in the year-ago quarter as it took a $1.1 billion
impairment charge related to its acquisition of Western Coal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding one-time items, the third-quarter loss was $1.30
per share, bigger than the average analyst estimate of $1.02,
according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue fell nearly 26 percent to $455.8 million, primarily
because of lower prices of metallurgical coal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher metallurgical coal sales volumes and lower costs
partially offset the impact of low prices, Walter Energy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cash costs as a percentage of sales for metallurgical coal
fell 10.8 percent in the third quarter, Walter Energy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metallurgical coal accounted for 84 percent of total coal
sales volume in the third quarter, up from 74 percent a year
earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it expected metallurgical coal output to
rise in the fourth quarter from the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy, which also produces thermal coal used in
power generation, said in August that it was aiming to raise
$250 million from asset sales over nine months. It has yet to
announce any such sales, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, with operations in North America and the United
Kingdom, has slashed capital spending and cut its quarterly
dividend earlier this year to 1 cent per share from 12.5 cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy shares were up 51 cents, or 3.3 percent, at

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) ranked first in a small business customer satisfaction survey in three of four regions of the United States, a sharp improvement from 20th place nationally two years ago, research firm J.D. Power and said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank raised its ranking through changes to its customer service, which was previously slow to fix problems. Clients complained about having to deal with a different staff member every time they called the bank so JPMorgan assigned relationship managers to many customers, giving them a single point of contact, said Scott Geller, JPMorgan's chief executive for its small business unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top ranking may also have been because of a simpler factor, namely branch hours and locations, said Jim Miller, senior director of banking at J.D. Power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small businesses still have a lot of cash and paper checks to deposit, so they need convenient branches, Miller said. He noted that in the Northeast, where JPMorgan ranked fifth, the bank that was first is the one that keeps its branches open for the most hours each week, Toronto-Dominion Bank's TD Bank. (TD.TO)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has continued to spend money to add and remodel branches in recent years even as other banks have closed offices to cut costs and take advantage of customers doing more of their transactions with mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank, which lends to small businesses through its 5,600 Chase branches, ranked above other lenders in the Midwest, West and South, J.D. Power said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A couple of years ago they were performing near the bottom," said Jim Miller, senior director of banking at J.D. Power. "They have made a dramatic improvement in a short time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's Geller said he is setting out to learn how TD Bank beat his bank in the Northeast in the survey. "We will give a good hard look at TD's results," Geller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry in New York. Editing by Dan Wilchins and Andrew Hay)&lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch Rates Coca-Cola Enterprise's Euro 350 Million Issuance 'BBB+'; 
      Outlook Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to Coca-Cola Enterprises, 
      Inc.'s (CCE's) 10-year 2.625% EURO350 million notes. The Rating Outlook 
      is Stable. The notes are issued by CCE and will rank equally with the 
      company's senior unsecured obligations. CCE expects to use the net 
      proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include refinancing 
      of commercial paper and the repayment of indebtedness.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CCE's ratings reflect its stable cash flows, strong market position, and 
      exclusive right to manufacture, sell and distribute Coca-Cola brand 
      beverages in Western Europe. Coca-Cola products have leading market 
      share that allows for premium pricing of the Coca-Cola brands within 
      CCE's non-alcoholic ready-to-drink portfolio for each of its 
      territories. In the LTM period, CCE generated approximately $8.1 billion 
      of net sales with almost 65% coming from its largest two markets, Great 
      Britain and France.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings incorporate CCE's net debt-to-EBITDA target range of 2.5x to 
      3.0x, increased leverage, and the firm's good free cash flow (FCF) 
      generation. Fitch views the low-to-mid end of CCE's leverage goal as 
      appropriate for the 'BBB+' rating. CCE is managing through the difficult 
      economic environment in Western Europe characterized by lower consumer 
      spending, higher unemployment and the negative impacts from austerity 
      programs. Currently CCE does not anticipate any material effects from 
      potential new excise tax measures in 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the first three quarters ended Sept. 27, 2013, net sales 
      increased 1% to $6.2 billion. Volumes, which decreased 2% during the 
      first half, improved in the third quarter to 2.5% reflecting better 
      weather and successful execution of summer marketing programs. For the 
      full year, CCE expects volume will be flat to up modestly which Fitch 
      believes is reasonable. Cost of sales per case increased 1.5% in the 
      third quarter and 2.0% for the first nine months of 2013 but net pricing 
      per case only rose 0.5% for the quarter and year-to-date period as CCE 
      has taken a more modest and balanced approach to pricing this year given 
      current economic and competitive conditions. CCE's long-term pricing 
      target is 2 - 3% as the company expects pricing to cover cost of goods 
      sold increases in 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Liquidity
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At June 28, 2013, CCE had good liquidity of $1.5 billion inclusive of 
      $488 million of cash and full availability under the firm's $1 billion 
      multi-currency credit facility expiring in September 2017. FCF for the 
      LTM period ended Sept. 27, 2013 was $311 million. Given that the option 
      to acquire The Coca-Cola Company's German operations has expired, CCE 
      increased the target for share repurchases to at least $1 billion during 
      2013 to be funded with FCF, debt and cash. Share repurchases totaled 
      $888 million for the first three quarters of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch views CCE's 2013 reduced guidance of low single-digit sales 
      growth, low single-digit operating income growth, and FCF of $450 
      million - $500 million as achievable. FCF, which Fitch defines 
      differently as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and 
      dividends, averaged $353 million for 2011 and 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CCE's FCF will be modestly below historical levels in 2013 due to a $125 
      million one-time cash restructuring charge for 2013 and higher dividend 
      payments following a 25% increase in the firm's dividend earlier this 
      year. Consequently, Fitch expects annual dividend payments in excess of 
      $200 million for 2013 with paid dividends of $161 million for the first 
      nine months of 2013. CCE paid $187 million in dividends for 2012. 
      Capital expenditures are expected to approximate $325 million during 
      2013, moderately below the $378 million spent in 2012. Cash 
      restructuring charges should reduce materially in 2014. As a result, 
      Fitch expects FCF should improve moderately for 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Credit Metrics
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CCE's credit metrics are in line with Fitch's expectations. At September 
      27, 2013, total debt-to-operating EBITDA was 2.9x and operating 
      EBITDA-to-gross interest expense was 13.5x. Fitch currently expects 
      total debt-to-operating EBITDA at the upper end of the 2x range for 
      2013. This translates to the lower half of CCE's 2.5x - 3.0x net 
      leverage target. Longer-term Fitch expects CCE will manage to the 
      midpoint of its net leverage targets. Fitch views sustained gross 
      leverage of 3.0x or less as acceptable for the current ratings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Consequently, given the increase in leverage, Fitch believes CCE's 
      cushion within the ratings has lessened. The increased share repurchases 
      and dividends have caused net leverage to increase materially from 
      historical levels of less than 2.0x. The higher long-term leverage is a 
      concern as Fitch anticipates that acquisitions could occur, but in the 
      near term are not probable. This could pressure the ratings in the event 
      of a large debt-financed transaction as leverage (total debt-to-EBITDA) 
      would increase above 3x.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch believes CCE greatly values its current 'BBB+' and 'F2' long-term 
      and short-term ratings. As a result, expectations are that CCE would use 
      FCF to quickly reduce leverage back within its targeted range in a 
      12-to-18-month timeframe. In addition, Fitch expects CCE would limit 
      share buybacks if leverage increased as a result of an acquisition 
      and/or any material deterioration in future operating performance 
      occurred.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At Sept. 27, 2013, CCE had $594 million of debt maturing over the next 
      12 months, including $400 million senior notes due in November 2013 and 
      $100 million in February 2014. Material maturities in 2015 are $475 
      million. A significant portion of CCE's debt obligations remain 
      dollar-denominated. With this Euro-based offering, Fitch expects the 
      company will continue to narrow the currency mismatch between the firm's 
      debt balances and its cash flow.

      RATING SENSITIVITIES

		&lt;p&gt;
      Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a 
      positive rating action include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Gross debt-to-operating EBITDA consistently below 2.3x or net leverage 
      below management's targeted range of 2.5x to 3.0x due to operating 
      income growth and continued strong FCF generation that results in debt 
      reduction;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Significant additional geographic diversification concurrent with 
      lower leverage and/or an equity stake and board representation by The 
      Coca-Cola Company.
    &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      --Gross debt-to-operating EBITDA sustained above 3.0x;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Persistent declines in volumes concurrent with material margin 
      compression and significantly lower FCF that could be driven by the 
      mature economies, increased excise taxes and/or obesity concerns;

      Research and Markets: Global Antivirus Software Package Market, 2016: 
      Avast Software, Avira Holding, ESET, Microsoft  Symantec Dominate the 
      Industry
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/f4tdst/global_antivirus) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Antivirus Software Package Market, 2016" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Global Antivirus Software Package market to grow at a CAGR of 
      13.4 percent over the period 2012-2016.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from the team said: The increasing 
      number of attacks and threats has prompted antivirus software vendors to 
      develop new products or improve existing products to adapt to the 
      changing technological environment. Additionally, changing customer 
      requirements and increased competition among vendors are other reasons 
      for the availability of improved applications for customers at lower 
      cost. This trend is expected to continue in the future.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the main drivers impacting this market 
      is the significant increase in the use of smartphones, which is 
      affecting the demand for and usage of antivirus software.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the key challenges faced by the 
      market is the declining demand for PCs. The reason for the decline is 
      the increased use of tablets and smartphones, which can impact the 
      demand for antivirus software.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 30 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co 
ranked first in a small business customer satisfaction survey in
three of four regions of the United States, a sharp improvement
from 20th place nationally two years ago, research firm J.D.
Power and said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank raised its ranking through changes to its customer
service, which was previously slow to fix problems. Clients
complained about having to deal with a different staff member
every time they called the bank so JPMorgan assigned
relationship managers to many customers, giving them a single
point of contact, said Scott Geller, JPMorgan's chief executive
for its small business unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top ranking may also have been because of a simpler
factor, namely branch hours and locations, said Jim Miller,
senior director of banking at J.D. Power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small businesses still have a lot of cash and paper checks
to deposit, so they need convenient branches, Miller said. He
noted that in the Northeast, where JPMorgan ranked fifth, the
bank that was first is the one that keeps its branches open for
the most hours each week, Toronto-Dominion Bank's TD Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has continued to spend money to add and remodel
branches in recent years even as other banks have closed offices
to cut costs and take advantage of customers doing more of their
transactions with mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank, which lends to small businesses through its 5,600
Chase branches, ranked above other lenders in the Midwest, West
and South, J.D. Power said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A couple of years ago they were performing near the
bottom," said Jim Miller, senior director of banking at J.D.
Power. "They have made a dramatic improvement in a short time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's Geller said he is setting out to learn how TD
Bank beat his bank in the Northeast in the survey. "We will give
a good hard look at TD's results," Geller said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real-time equity news [E U]
U.S. stock market report  
1128 ET 30Oct2013 Goldman Sachs: Buy calls ahead of analyst days in November 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  

Derivative strategists at Goldman Sachs Group advised investors to buy calls on
a group of stocks ahead of the companies' analyst days due to the potential for
large stock moves on these events. Among the names with upcoming analyst day
events in November, Goldman highlighted calls on General Electric, Mead
Johnson Nutrition Co, Monsanto Co, Denbury Resources Inc
, Halliburton Co, McDonald's Corp and Xerox Corp 
as particularly attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The options market often misses the potential for volatility on analyst
days," Goldman strategists wrote in their Weekly Options Watch on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their analysis of more than 3,800 analyst days since 2002, the
strategists found that in many cases these events can be as stock moving as
earnings. They estimate buying calls ahead of analyst day events between 2002
and 2013-to-date has returned an average profit of 23 percent compared with the
average plus 1 percent move in stocks. The return exceeds the 8 percent return
for a similar call-buying trade before earnings over the same period.
"Year-to-date, this strategy has returned 38 percent, and is on track to
potentially be the most profitable year in our study," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman strategists said buying the closest to the money call five days
before the analyst day and selling one day after was profitable in 11 of the
past 12 years. Of the more than 3,800 analyst day events Goldman recorded over
this time period, 2,639 events passed their liquidity threshold. "We believe the
combination of low implied volatility and increasing growth expectations have
boosted the profitability of this trade," the report said.  November has
historically been the most active month in terms of the number of analyst days.
Goldman identified 49 companies with analyst days due over the next month, 31 of
which have tradable options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters Messaging: doris.frankel.reuters.com@reuters.net&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;0932 ET 30Oct2013 Total option open interest increases by 4.93 mln contracts

			Mintz Levin&#8217;s Immigration Practice Launches Innovative On-Line Tool 
      To Process DS-160 Visa Applications
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Immigration 
      Practice of Mintz, 
      Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C. has launched an 
      innovative on-line tool to process DS-160 Nonimmigrant Visa 
      Applications. The state-of-the art system provides clients with a 
      step-by-step tutorial to assist them in completing the complex 
      application.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The DS-160 Nonimmigrant Visa Application form is for temporary travel to 
      the United States and for K (fianc&#233;(e)) visas. Consular Officers use the 
      information entered on the DS-160 to process the visa application and, 
      combined with a personal interview, determine an applicant&#8217;s eligibility 
      for a nonimmigrant visa.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We developed this user friendly tool to help our clients navigate what 
      can be a very frustrating and complicated process,&#8221; said Susan 
      J. Cohen, Chair of Mintz Levin&#8217;s Immigration Practice. &#8220;The response 
      we&#8217;re getting has been overwhelmingly positive. Clients appreciate the 
      ease with which they can complete the application and the fact that the 
      tutorial can be accessed 24/7 by anyone around the globe.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mintz Levin provides comprehensive immigration legal services to 
      employers and companies of all sizes as well as to accomplished 
      entrepreneurs, scientists, investors, and individuals seeking to live 
      and work in the United States. We have a track record of success 
      representing clients before government agencies involved in immigration 
      and naturalization matters, including US Citizenship and Immigration 
      Services (USCIS), the State Department (including consular offices 
      abroad), and the Department of Labor (DOL).

      Research and Markets: Global IT Services and BPO in Government Sector to 
      2016: CapGemini, IBM, Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro Dominate the 
      Industry
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/gjtkbq/global_it) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      IT Services and BPO in Government Sector 2012-2016" report to 
      their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Global IT Services and BPO in the Government sector to grow at a 
      CAGR of 4.97 percent over the period 2012-2016.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With digitized information social media becoming more popular, 
      governments also need to have a presence on social media. Across the 
      world, governments are now using social media platforms engage 
      effectively with their citizens and communicate in real time. Social 
      media can enhance government outreach activities and help manage 
      perceptions about policies. Government agencies are using Facebook, 
      Twitter, and other social sites to inform and interact with people.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For instance, New York City council launched social streams on Facebook, 
      Twitter, Tumblr and Foursquare to enable public engagement on the 
      provision of government services to emergency response. Therefore, 
      government organizations have started to invest in social media 
      activities as an essential part of IT services portfolio. This trend is 
      expected to continue in future years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major growth drivers is cost 
      reduction by a significant amount after adopting outsourcing facilities 
      for various functions. One reason for the reduction in cost is that the 
      government body can save money on training or recruiting people with the 
      necessary technical expertise. With the help of outsourcing the 
      government can actually focus on other core functions without needing to 
      have the infrastructure for the particular service.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges is issues 
      pertaining to data security. The Government sector often deals with 
      private and confidential information and hence governments hesitate to 
      adopt outsourcing services because they will have to share the 
      information with private players.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hines, the international real estate firm, announced today that Pontiac 
      Land Group of Singapore has joined Hines and the Goldman Sachs Real 
      Estate Principal Investment Area in the ownership of 53 W. 53rd 
      Street, the iconic residential condominium development to be constructed 
      adjacent to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). In addition to their equity 
      investment, Pontiac Land secured $860 million of construction financing 
      to be funded by a consortium of Asian banks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The sweeping 72-story, 750,000-square-foot tower, designed by Pritzker 
      Prize-winning architect Jean Nouvel, will house 145 highest-end 
      condominium residences, designed by world-renowned architect Thierry 
      Despont. In addition, the building&#8217;s lower floors will include 36,000 
      square feet of new exhibition spaces distributed over three floors, 
      designed for MoMA by architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hines and Goldman Sachs acquired the 18,000-square-foot site, located 
      between 53rd and 54th streets just west of MoMA, for $125 million from 
      the museum in 2007. Following an international architectural 
      competition, Nouvel was selected as the design architect. The tower was 
      originally proposed to be 1,250 feet tall; and, as part of the Special 
      Permit process in 2009, the height was reduced to 1,050 feet. All 
      discretionary approvals necessary to build the project are in place and 
      construction is expected to begin in mid 2014 with initial occupancy in 
      late 2018. Lend Lease has been designated as the general contractor and 
      Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group will handle the project&#8217;s marketing 
      and sales, which are expected to begin in 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The tower will include an extensive package of amenities including 
      breathtaking New York City and Central Park views, spectacular common 
      areas, a high-performance fitness facility including a 75-foot lap pool 
      and full-time concierge service.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "We are delighted to partner with Hines and Goldman Sachs on this 
      landmark&#160;project. We have long admired MoMA's contribution to the city 
      and the world, and we are pleased that this project will expand their 
      galleries and enhance the visitor experience," commented Kwee Liong Tek, 
      director of Pontiac Land Group and international art collector.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hines Chairman Gerald D. Hines commented, &#8220;Jean Nouvel&#8217;s exciting tower 
      will surely become an international design icon, as well as a favorite 
      of New Yorkers. The location deserved a significant piece of skyline 
      sculpture, and this project will deliver. Also, we think it will be a 
      great investment for Hines and our partners, as well as for future 
      homeowners. Pontiac Land is known for superior developments, and we are 
      so happy to partner with them on their inaugural U.S. investment.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Pontiac Land's longstanding partnerships with our local banks have 
      enabled us to participate in this important deal. We are confident in 
      the recovery of the U.S. economy, the largest in the world, and believe 
      in the resilience and potential of the New York property market. The 
      U.S. will continue to be an investment destination of choice for us, so 
      it was important for our first investment to be stellar," said Michael 
      Su, CEO of Pontiac Land Group.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The building&#8217;s one-of-a-kind architecture and its privileged proximity 
      to MoMA will make this development an extremely desirable address,&#8221; said 
      Tommy Craig, Hines senior managing director and head of the firm&#8217;s New 
      York office.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Glenn D. Lowry, MoMA&#8217;s director, commented, &#8220;The Museum of Modern Art is 
      pleased to see the tower project moving ahead, and we look forward to 
      working with the Hines team and the museum&#8217;s own architects to create 
      new and engaging public spaces in which our visitors will explore modern 
      and contemporary art.&#8221;

      Gorevic Among 100 Most Intriguing Entrepreneurs at 2013 Builders + 
      Innovators Summit
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is recognizing Teladoc CEO Jason Gorevic as one

      Before joining Teladoc in 2009, Gorevic worked in various capacities at 
      WellPoint, Inc., including senior vice president and chief marketing and

      "I&#8217;m honored to be recognized among these remarkable entrepreneurs," 
      said Gorevic. "During a time when health care costs are at an all-time 
      high, it is important to make available new innovative solutions that 
      ensure patients get the quality care they need, when they need it. I&#8217;m 
      proud to help lead a company that&#8217;s committed to providing quality 
      health care solutions at an affordable price."

      entrepreneurs of 2013," said David Solomon, co-head of investment 
      banking at Goldman Sachs. "This is the second year for the summit and 
      our goal remains the same. We pair seasoned and emerging entrepreneurs 
      -- the builders and innovators -- from a diverse set of industries to 
      discuss how to make vital, enduring companies that reshape industries 
      and boost the world's economies through innovation."

Walter Energy Announces Third Quarter 2013 Results
&lt;/h1&gt;

Metallurgical Coal Cost of Sales per Ton Declined 10.8% Compared With Third Quarter 2012

&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;BIRMINGHAM, AL--(Marketwired - October 30, 2013) -
 Walter Energy Inc. (NYSE: WLT) (TSX: WLT), a leading, publicly traded "pure-play" producer of metallurgical ("met") coal for the global steel industry, today announced results for the quarter ended September 30, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are pleased with the progress we made in the third quarter in reducing costs, improving productivity and increasing met coal sales," said Walt Scheller, Chief Executive Officer. "We also continued to take proactive steps to strengthen our balance sheet and enhance our financial flexibility through a debt offering and related reduction of near-term debt maturities. Demand for our products has remained firm, and we have recently seen an improvement in met coal pricing. We look forward to improved financial performance in the fourth quarter and in 2014." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consolidated Financial Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy reported a net loss of $100.7 million, or $1.61 loss per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2013, compared with a net loss of $1.1 billion, or $16.97 loss per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2012. The net loss in the third quarter of 2013 included a gain from the early extinguishment of debt and foreign exchange gains. Excluding these items, the net loss for the quarter was $1.68 per diluted share. The third quarter of 2012 loss included non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $1.1 billion, or $17.05 per share, primarily related to the 2011 acquisition of Western Coal and a pre-tax charge of $40.0 million associated with the abandonment of a natural gas exploration project. Third quarter 2012 adjusted net income excluding these charges was $29.8 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third quarter 2013 consolidated revenues totaled $455.8 million, a decrease from $612.0 million in the third quarter of 2012, primarily due to lower met coal prices in 2013. Higher met coal sales volume in the third quarter of 2013 as compared to 2012 partially offset the decline in met coal sales pricing. Results for the current-year period also reflected the favorable impact of lower production costs, including improved met coal cost performance and continued reductions in selling, general and administrative ("SGA") expenses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the third quarter of 2013, the Company recognized non-cash deferred income tax charges of $24.0 million, primarily related to revaluation of Canadian and U.K. deferred tax liabilities as the result of changes to the statutory corporate tax rates in each jurisdiction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") for the third quarter of 2013 totaled $28.8 million. Excluding the gain from the early extinguishment of debt and the foreign exchange gains, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totaled $21.3 million. Third quarter 2012 adjusted EBITDA, excluding the non-cash goodwill and other asset impairment charges, totaled $116.6 million. These charges and adjustments are shown in the Company's "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" included with this release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metallurgical Coal Sales Volume and Pricing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third quarter of 2013 met coal sales volume, including both hard coking coal ("HCC") and low-volatility ("low-vol") pulverized coal injection product ("PCI"), was 2.8 million metric tons ("MMTs"), representing an increase of 0.2 MMTs compared with the third quarter of 2012. HCC sales volume was 2.3 MMTs in the third quarter of 2013, an increase of 5.3% compared with the third quarter of 2012. Low-vol PCI sales volume totaled 0.5 MMTs, an increase of 19.3% in the third quarter of 2013 compared with the prior-year comparable quarter. Met coal sales volume was approximately 84% of total coal sales volume in the third quarter of 2013 compared with 74% in the prior year period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The selling price for HCC averaged $133.72 per metric ton (MT), down from the third quarter of 2012 average pricing of $196.66 per MT. Low-vol PCI pricing averaged $121.76 per MT in the third quarter of 2013 compared with $160.37 per MT in the prior year comparable quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metallurgical Coal Cash Cost of Sales&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Met coal cash cost of sales for the third quarter 2013 averaged $117.95 per MT, down 10.8% compared with the third quarter of 2012. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metallurgical Coal Production&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Met coal production was 2.8 MMTs in the third quarter of 2013, comprised of 2.3 MMTs of HCC and 0.5 MMTs of low-vol PCI. Met coal production in the 2013 third quarter decreased 16.6% compared with third quarter of 2012 production of 3.3 MMTs, largely driven by planned reductions in low-vol PCI production at the Company's Brule and Willow Creek mines, making up its Brazion operations, as well as other curtailments. Production at the Wolverine mine was lower due to a period of unfavorable mining conditions. These declines were partially offset by strong low and mid-vol production at the Company's Alabama mines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Met coal cash cost of production averaged $77.56 per MT in the third quarter of 2013, down $12.05 per MT or 13.4%, compared with the prior-year comparable quarter. This reduction came primarily from the Company's Alabama low and mid-vol mines, which decreased by $18.19 per MT, or 21.9%, in the third quarter of 2013 as compared with the third quarter of the prior year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Expenses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SGA expenses totaled $21.9 million in the third quarter 2013, compared with $32.5 million in the third quarter of the prior year. Third quarter 2013 SGA expenses exclude $5.3 million of operations-related direct administrative charges included in cost of sales resulting from a change in accounting practices.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interest expense for the third quarter of 2013 totaled $63.5 million compared with $30.5 million in the third quarter of 2012, with the increase in the current-year period primarily driven by an increase in long-term debt, higher interest rates and a non-cash charge of $13.2 million, including the amortization of debt issuance costs applicable to prepaid debt.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital Expenditures &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Company's capital expenditures totaled $28.5 million in the third quarter of 2013, compared with $85.3 million in the third quarter of 2012. Capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2013 totaled $108.7 million compared with $331.3 million in the first nine months of 2012. Lower capital spending in 2013 reflects the Company's focus on disciplined capital spending in light of the current market conditions. The Company remains on track to meet its capital expenditure target of approximately $150 million in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquidity &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available liquidity was $614.0 million at the end of the third quarter of 2013, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $293.1 million plus $320.9 million of availability under the Company's $375 million revolving credit facility, net of outstanding letters of credit of $54.1 million.&#160;During the quarter, the Company issued $450 million of senior secured notes, due 2019. Proceeds from the notes were used to extinguish $250 million of the Company's Term Loan A debt, with the remainder available for general corporate purposes. The Company has no material debt maturities until June of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outlook&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Met coal production is expected to increase in the fourth quarter of 2013 as compared to the third quarter, as the Wolverine mine is moving into a more favorable phase in its mining cycle. The Company remains on track to achieve its full-year met coal production target of approximately 11 MMTs and an overall 15% reduction in year-over-year met coal production costs on a per ton basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use of Non-GAAP Measures &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This release contains the use of certain U.S. non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) measures. These non-GAAP measures are provided as supplemental information for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

						(2) Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 reflects increases in interest rates on our outstanding debt obligations due to the Second, Third and Fifth Amendments to the 2011 Credit Agreement, increases in interest associated with the issuance of the $500.0 million 9.875% senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2012, the $450.0 million 8.5% senior notes in the first quarter of 2013, the $450.0 million 9.5% senior secured notes in the current quarter and the accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs associated with Term Loans A and B debt&#160;prepayments of $11.2 million.
						&#160;
					
					
						(3) Other income in the current period primarily relates to a gain of $4.3 million recognized upon the prepayment of $250 million of our Term Loan A debt using proceeds from the issuance of $450.0 million 9.5% senior secured notes in the current quarter.

						(1) Average Cash Cost of Sales per Ton is based on reported Cost of Sales and includes items such as freight, royalties, manpower, fuel and other similar production and sales cost items but excludes depreciation, depletion and post retirement benefits. Average Cash Cost of Production per Ton is based on period costs of mining and includes items such as manpower, fuel and other similar production items but excludes depreciation, depletion and post retirement benefits. Average Cash Cost per Ton is a non-GAAP financial measure which is not calculated in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute or superior to financial measures calculated in conformity with GAAP. We believe Average Cash Cost per Ton is a useful measure of performance and we believe it aids some investors and analysts in comparing us against other companies to help analyze our current and future potential performance. Average Cash Cost of Sales per Ton may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

						(1) EBITDA from continuing operations is defined as earnings excluding discontinued operations before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, and depreciation and depletion expense. EBITDA from continuing operations is a financial measure which is not calculated in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute or superior to financial measures calculated in conformity with GAAP. We believe that EBITDA from continuing operations is a useful measure as some investors and analysts use EBITDA from continuing operations to compare us against other companies and to help analyze our ability to satisfy principal and interest obligations and capital expenditure needs. EBITDA from continuing operations may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

						(2) EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, and depreciation and depletion expense. EBITDA is a financial measure which is not calculated in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute or superior to financial measures calculated in conformity with GAAP. We believe that EBITDA is a useful measure as some investors and analysts use EBITDA to compare us against other companies and to help analyze our ability to satisfy principal and interest obligations and capital expenditure needs. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

						(3) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude restructuring charges (benefits), asset impairment, proxy contest expenses and other miscellaneous items, gain on early extinguishment of debt, and loss on ineffective portion of derivative instruments. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance in accordance with GAAP, and we believe items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant to a reader in understanding and assessing our financial condition. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation, nor as an alternative to net income, income from operations, cash flows from operations or as a measure of our profitability, liquidity or performance under generally accepted accounting principles. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA presents a useful measure of our ability to incur and service debt based on ongoing operations. Furthermore, analogous measures are used by industry analysts to evaluate our operating performance. Investors should be aware that our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

						(4) Adjusted net income (loss) is defined as net loss excluding income from discontinued operations, restructuring charges (benefits), asset impairment, proxy contest expenses and other miscellaneous items, gain on early extinguishment of debt, and loss on ineffective portion of derivative instruments, net of tax. Adjusted net income (loss) is not a measure of financial performance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and we believe items excluded from Adjusted net income (loss) are significant to a reader in understanding and assessing our results of operations. Therefore, Adjusted net income (loss) should not be considered in isolation, nor as an alternative to net income (loss) under generally accepted accounting principles.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Nate Raymond&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 31 (Reuters) - A New York lawyer testified on
Thursday that he quit a team that was suing Chevron Corp 
over environmental pollution in Ecuador in 2010 for "ethical"
reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The testimony appeared to bolster Chevron's effort to
prevent the lawyer who headed the litigation, Steven Donziger,
from pursuing enforcement of a $19 billion award against
Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Shinder, a partner at the law firm Constantine
Cannon, said Donziger had approached him starting in late 2009
about helping enforce any award the Ecuadorean court issued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shinder said he quit after just eight days into his formal
retention after learning that a report by an expert appointed by
the Ecuadorean court had actually been written by a consulting
firm working for the plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wanted no part of it," Shinder said in federal court in
New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The testimony came in the third week of the non-jury trial
before U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in which Chevron claims
that Donziger and others engaged in fraud and bribery to obtain
the award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, a judge in Ecuador awarded $18 billion to people
from the village of Lago Agrio, who had for years been pursuing
litigation over environmental contamination from 1964 and 1992
at an oil field operated by Texaco, which Chevron bought in
2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The award was later increased to $19 billion to cover fees.
But as Chevron no longer has assets in Ecuador, the Ecuadoreans
have been forced to look overseas and have pursued enforcement
actions in Canada, Argentina and Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, has refused to
pay. It filed the New York lawsuit in 2011 claiming the award
was the product of fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At trial Thursday, Shinder, whom Chevron subpoenaed to
testify, said Donziger approached him about joining the case in
October 2009 as Donziger began preparing to fight to enforce an
anticipated judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While no award had been issued, a court-appointed expert had
in April 2008 issued a report recommending the judge hold
Chevron liable for up to $16.3 billion in damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expert, Richard Stalin Cabrera Vega, revised his
recommendation in November 2008 to $27 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STRATUS CONSULTING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has long contended that Cabrera's report was
ghostwritten by a consulting firm, Stratus Consulting Inc,
working for the plaintiffs. Shinder said Donziger had sought to
assure him Chevron's claims were "trumped up" and inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He denied the allegations, but did say to me that, 'You
have to understand, they do things differently in Ecuador,'"
Shinder said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2010, Shinder's firm agreed to represent the
plaintiffs in cases Chevron had filed in the United States
seeking evidence in aid of the Ecuador litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after, Shinder said he flew out to Colorado at
Donziger's expense to meet employees at Stratus, including
co-founder Douglas Beltman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Near the end of his two-hour conversation with Beltman,
Shinder said the "truth came out" as he admitted Stratus had
written portions of Cabrera's report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After discussing the matter with other lawyers at his firm,
Shinder said he told Donziger he would be withdrawing, primarily
for "ethical reasons."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It bothered me and still bothers me that we'll never know
if there was a case against Chevron," Shinder said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stratus Consulting, once a co-defendant in the New York
case, settled with Chevron in April. It has also disavowed any
and all findings and conclusions of reports it issued in the
Ecuador litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Chevron Corp v. Steven Donziger et al, U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York, No.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a change, JPMorgans rollercoaster negotiations with state and federal regulators to resolve the banks liability for rotten mortgage-backed securities did not make news Wednesday. Has there ever been more public dealmaking between the Justice Department and a target? It feels as though the public has been made privy to every settlement proposal and rejection, as if were all watching a soap operatic reality show. Will there be a reunion episode if the bank and the Justice Department end up finalizing the reported $13 billion global settlement, with Eric Holder and Jamie Dimon shouting imprecations at each other?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America filled the MBS news vacuum Wednesday. Its quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed that the bank  under Justice Department investigation for its securitization practices  has bumped up its estimate of litigation losses in excess of its reserves to $5.1 billion. The filing also said that staff lawyers from the New York attorney generals office have recommended a civil suit based on Merrill Lynchs mortgage-backed securities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BofA also had some good news, though. Late Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer of Los Angeles granted tentative approval to the banks $500 million Countrywide MBS class action settlement, despite objections to the deal from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (on behalf of 19 failed banks that owned Countrywide MBS) and several other institutions. Perhaps even more importantly, on Wednesday, two significant objectors to BofAs proposed $8.5 billion put-back settlement with private Countrywide MBS investors dropped their challenges to the deal. In separate letters to New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick, who has presided over a sporadic but nearly concluded trial on the settlement, three Federal Home Loan Banks and two Cranberry Park investment vehicles asked to withdraw from the proceeding. The remaining objectors, led by AIG, Triaxx and the FHLB of Pittsburgh, filed a strong post-trial brief summarizing their evidence that the proposed settlement was obtained through a conflicted, back-room, closed-door process and cannot be endorsed without running roughshod over the absent certificateholders interests. But the objectors ranks are dwindling, and late withdrawals by MBS certificate holders that actually helped try the opposition case has to increase the pressure on Justice Kapnick to bless the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you step back from all of these incremental developments, you see two banks traveling opposite roads to the same hoped-for final destination: a resolution of all their liability for deficient mortgage-backed securities. JPMorgan is concentrating first on a deal with regulators, not with private investors. BofA, meanwhile, is inching toward an end to claims by private investors but has balked at paying out more money to regulators. Last week, as you surely remember, Bank of America lost its gamble on a trial of Justice Department allegations that Countrywides short-lived, high-speed Hustle underwriting system defrauded Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. A federal jury in Manhattan found the bank liable on one civil fraud charge; U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff has yet to determine damages. BofA also hasnt settled the Federal Housing Finance Agencys securities suits before U.S. District Judge Denise Cote of Manhattan, unlike JPMorgan, which agreed last week to pay $5.1 billion to end the FHFA litigation against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a large extent, these different approaches were forced upon the banks. Because of Countrywides egregious mortgage practices, Bank of America was an early magnet for MBS claims. Countrywide was first targeted in an MBS class action all the way back in 2007, before it was even acquired by BofA. MBIA launched its enormous litigation against BofA in 2008, and the Gibbs  Bruns institutional investor group that instigated BofAs put-back settlement sent a demand notice to Countrywide MBS trustee Bank of New York Mellon in 2010  two years before Gibbs  Bruns sent similar breach-of-contract notices to trustees for other banks that issued mortgage-backed securities, including JPMorgan. Its hard even to remember now that Bank of America reached billion-dollar put-back deals with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on the last day of 2010. By the time state and federal officials finally got serious about MBS fraud in early 2012, BofA was already battered and bruised by private mortgage-backed securities litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan wasnt, despite its acquisitions of Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, which had their own MBS sins to answer for. JPMorgan was known as the bank that had best weathered the financial crisis, and though it had also been sued by bond insurers soon after the crisis and was later targeted in fraud suits by large individual MBS investors, the bank was a ripe target for government officials who wanted attention for their MBS efforts. The first MBS civil suit by the N.Y. AG, filed a year ago, was against JPMorgan. A month later, the bank was the first defendant (along with Credit Suisse) to settle SEC claims of systemic securitization failures. And when Judge Cote set a trial schedule in the FHFA securities suits, JPMorgan was in an early tranche, facing a June 2014 trial date. In contrast to BofA, JPMorgan was more swamped by regulatory concerns (MBS and otherwise) than by private MBS litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is not ignoring claims by private investors. There have been reports, including one from my colleagues at Reuters, that the bank is close to a $6 billion put-back settlement with the Gibbs  Bruns institutional investor group. I doubt, however, that JPMorgan will be able to obtain the kind of global put-back deal with investors that BofA negotiated in its proposed $8.5 billion Countrywide settlement. When the Countrywide settlement was announced in June 2011, only one put-back suit had been filed on behalf of a Countrywide trust, by a single investor (the hedge fund Baupost, via an MBS vehicle called Walnut Place). JPMorgan, on the other hand, is facing multiple put-back suits by a range of certificate holders (including Baupost), in addition to the sweeping breach-of-contract case under way in federal court in Washington, in which WaMu MBS trustee Deutsche Bank has sued on behalf of about 100 trusts. Given the controversy over BofAs attempt to resolve claims of absent certificate holders through its $8.5 billion settlement, I dont see how JPMorgan can expect to push through a similar deal on repurchase claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also dont see much benefit to the bank in throwing a few billion dollars to private investors as part of the Justice Department settlement. (Both The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal have reported such a payment to be under discussion in the proposed $13 billion deal.) The Justice Department cant settle investor claims its not a party to. JPMorgan might be able to buy a reduction in its payout to private claimants through the Justice Department settlement, but it cant buy an end to private MBS litigation, whether its put-back claims or fraud suits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as we move beyond the five-year anniversary of the financial crisis, JPMorgan seems to be on the verge of resolving its MBS regulatory exposure but probably faces a long slog with private investors. BofA appears to be closer than JPMorgan to wrapping things up with private investors but further from a final reckoning with the Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And someday, when this is all over, well know which strategy cost less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Research and Markets: Big Data Market in Europe 2012-2016, with IBM, HP, 
      Teradata and SAP AG Dominating the Industry
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/j9r5zv/big_data_market) 
      has announced the addition of the "Big 
      Data Market in Europe 2012-2016" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Big Data market in Europe to grow at a CAGR of 31.96 percent 
      over the period 2012-2016.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the key factors contributing to this market growth is big data's 
      ability to analyze data to predict future accurately. The Big Data 
      market in Europe has also been witnessing the adoption of in-memory 
      computing. However, the lack of awareness of big data's potential could 
      pose a challenge to the growth of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As the hardware costs incurred by organizations are declining across the 
      globe and there is increased demand for real-time computing, in-memory 
      computing is expected to become popular in the near future. Analysts at 
      TechNavio predict that 35-40 percent of medium-sized and large 
      enterprises around the world will adopt in-memory computing by 2016. 
      In-memory computing will help global organizations gain competitive 
      advantage and differentiate their offerings from those of their 
      competitors. Recently, organizations have benefitted hugely from 
      real-time computing such as fraud detection, inventory management, 
      genome analysis, point of sale management, and others, and it is likely 
      that in-memory computing will create endless opportunities for global 
      businesses in the next few years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers is the ability to 
      analyze historical data and make accurate future predictions. Big data 
      solutions enable IT managers to quickly derive insights from their 
      collected data and improve the quality of their decisions. In addition, 
      data analytics helps organizations develop an innovative business 
      strategy and improve their overall operational efficiency. It also helps 
      in identifying the risks and opportunities in organizations, enabling 
      them to plan and perform accordingly.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that the lack of awareness about the full 
      potential of big data technology is one of the major challenges 
      confronting this market. IT managers are facing difficulties in finding 
      and analyzing the right data from the piles of data that have been 
      stored. Moreover, it is difficult for them to manage data from multiple 
      sources.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Exxon Mobil shares rise after results beat Wall Street
forecast&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Indexes on pace for strong monthly gains&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Chicago PMI well above expectations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Jobless claims fall slightly less than expected&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Dow up 0.2 pct, S 500 up 0.3 pct, Nasdaq up 0.4 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Luke Swiderski&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Oct 31 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged up on
Thursday, though trading was subdued a day after a Federal
Reserve policy announcement that kept its stimulus plan in
place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Thursday's rise was modest, stocks were headed for
strong gains in October. The Dow was up about 3 percent as the
month drew to a close, while the S 500 was up about 5 percent
and the Nasdaq rose 4.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Exxon Mobil Corp, the world's largest
publicly traded oil company, helped support the Dow and S 500,
rising 1.7 percent to $90.50 after the company reported adjusted
third-quarter earnings that beat expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. central bank on Wednesday said it will keep buying
$85 billion of bonds per month, noting weaker economic signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it removed a phrase from a previous statment expressing
worries about credit conditions after a spike in bond yields,
which investors interpreted as a sign the Fed could begin
tapering earlier than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Fed removed that language, and that leaves tapering on
the table for December," said Michael O'Rourke, chief market
strategist at JonesTrading, referring to the Fed's eventual
trimming of asset purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed's accommodative monetary policy in recent years has
contributed to stocks' rally, and investors worry about the
timing of a pullback by the Fed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average inched up 27.50
points, or 0.18 percent, to 15,646.09. The S 500 added
4.84 points, or 0.27 percent, to 1,768.15. The Nasdaq Composite
 rose 13.75 points or 0.41 percent, to 3,998.89.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expedia jumped almost 18 percent to $58.61 and
ranked as the S 500's best percentage gainer on the S 500 a
day after reporting third-quarter earnings that exceeded
expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limiting gains, Visa Inc lost 2.9 percent to $197.97,
making it the biggest drag on the Dow a day after the world's
largest credit and debit card company reported a 28 percent drop
in quarterly profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday's economic data was mixed. A gauge of business
activity in the Midwest execeeded expectations in October, while
weekly initial jobless claims dipped in the latest week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Labor Department's October employment report will be an
important source of clues about the economy and future Fed
action. Until the figures, due Nov. 8, are released "we're going
to drift. We need something to send us higher", said Brian
Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook reported strong growth in its mobile
advertising business late on Wednesday, though it said it didn't
plan to boost the frequency of ads shown to users. Facebook's
stock was up 3.2 percent at $50.60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 355 companies in the S 500 that had reported
earnings through Thursday morning, 68.2 percent have topped Wall
Street's expectations, above both the 63 percent beat rate since
1994 and the 66 percent beat rate for the past four quarters,
according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue has been mixed, however, with 53.6 percent of
companies besting expectations, well shy of the 61 percent beat
rate since 2002 but above the 49 percent rate for the past four
quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Global Storage Market to 2016: Dell, EMC, HP, IBM, 
      NetApp  Symantec Dominate the Industry
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/mjxwsd/global_storage) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Storage Market 2012-2016" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Storage market to grow at a CAGR of 7.83 percent over the 
      period 2012-2016.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Storage hardware solutions are becoming very important among enterprises 
      to support their increasing needs of data storage. The storage software 
      vendors are developing solutions that are specific to the hardware being 
      used for the storage of data; software solutions are being developed 
      specific to the architecture of the storage infrastructure. This 
      facilitates better optimization of storage space and better management. 
      Enterprises are witnessing a growing trend of bundled hardware and 
      software solutions being provided by the storage vendors for better 
      infrastructure performance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, the increasing growth of structured and 
      unstructured data is a major growth driver in this market. Structured 
      data has a pre-defined data structure whereas unstructured data has no 
      specific internal data structure. Enterprise applications are generating 
      large volumes of information, and this is expected to continue in the 
      future. The majority of corporate data sources include the data 
      generated from the enterprise applications, along with newly-generated 
      cloud-based data, social network data, and device data.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the main challenges is the 
      increasing availability of open-source storage software. Although the 
      open-source vendors lack technical expertise and have lower storage 
      management capabilities, there is a growing demand for such software 
      from the small enterprises which procure the solution to meet their 
      storage management needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The key vendors dominating this market space include:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Dell Inc.
      
			
        EMC Corp.

&lt;p&gt;OTTAWA (Reuters) - Consumers may join class action lawsuits against Microsoft Corp and Infineon Technologies AG over allegations of unfair pricing for computer products, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high court refused to allow a class action to proceed against Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM) and Cargill Inc over alleged price-fixing on high-fructose corn syrup used in soft drinks and baked goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court, in linked decisions on Microsoft and Infineon, certified separate class actions against the companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases dealt primarily with whether consumers have the right to join a class action even if they were only indirect purchasers, not buying directly from the companies involved. None of the cases were at the point of establishing liability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The class suing Microsoft is any British Columbia residents who bought Microsoft operating systems or applications software for their own use from 1994 on. Typically, once the principle is established, suits could be launched in other provinces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit in Quebec against Infineon alleges that it conspired to inflate the price of a broadly used product, dynamic random-access memory chips (DRAM), used in computers made by companies such as Dell Inc and Hewlett-Packard Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies argued that if both the consumers and the retailers or intermediaries who sold those products were allowed to recover damages, the companies risked having to pay the same damages twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Microsoft and Infineon cases, the court said the risk of duplicate recoveries could be managed by the courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the decision on ADM and Cargill, the court agreed that while class actions by consumers can proceed in principle, consumers would not be able to identify what sweetener was used in each fruit drink or baked good they consumed over the years.

&lt;p&gt;By Randall Palmer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OTTAWA Oct 31 (Reuters) - Consumers may join class action

      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The report, the Global Digital Marketing Software market 2012-2016, has 
      been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs from 
      industry experts. The report covers the market in the Americas, and the 
      EMEA and APAC regions; it also covers the Global Digital Marketing 
      Software market landscape and its growth prospects in the coming years. 
      The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in 
      this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The emergence of SaaS-based digital marketing solutions has enabled 
      organizations to increase their efficiency and reduce the cost of 
      deploying valuable IT infrastructure. However, organizations are still 
      analyzing the feasibility and relevance of cloud computing solutions in 
      their IT operations. The SaaS-based model for digital marketing offers a 
      pay-per-use model, along with one-time set up fee for the software, 
      maintenance, upgradation, and lifetime support. Hence, the Global 
      Digital Marketing Software market is witnessing a trend where many 
      vendors in the market have begun to offer their solutions through the 
      SaaS-based model to expand their services and enter new markets. In 
      addition, digital marketing solutions are becoming increasingly popular, 
      as they enable businesses to securely store, access, and maintain 
      digital records, images, text, and data. This is leading to an increased 
      adoption of SaaS-based solutions during the forecast period.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), the world's largest publicly traded oil company, reported higher-than-expected quarterly results on Thursday as output rose for the first time in more than two years, but refining weakness hurt earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and other large oil companies struggling to boost production in recent years have spent heavily on new projects. In the first nine months of this year, Exxon alone spent $33 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is their first year-over-year (production) increase in more than two years," said Brian Youngberg, an energy company analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. "It does show that they are hopefully making some progress stemming the decline that they've shown the last couple of years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon last reported a quarterly gain in production in the second quarter of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter oil and natural gas output rose 1.5 percent from a year earlier to 4 million barrels oil equivalent per day, helped by the start-up of new projects, the Irving, Texas, company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural gas from Australia's Kipper Tuna Turrum project and accelerated output from projects in Nigeria and Canada also contributed to the higher production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profit in the third quarter was $7.87 billion, or $1.79 per share, compared with $9.57 billion, or $2.09 per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average had expected $1.77 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Weaker margins, mainly in refining, decreased earnings by $2.4 billion," Exxon said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil companies with refining units, such as Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), have seen profit hurt in the quarter as demand for fuels like gasoline and diesel waned and global refining capacity grew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's refining unit had a profit of $592 million in the latest quarter, down sharply from $3.2 billion a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's shares rose 1 percent to $89.68 in morning New York Stock Exchange trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anna Driver; Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) is looking into building a rail terminal in Edmonton, Canada to move crude from its Kearl tar sands field to refineries in the United States, the company said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production from the Kearl field is expected to ramp up to a peak by 2015, when Exxon would hope to move the crude via pipeline, including the proposed, but politically controversial Keystone XL pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said that out of prudence, it is looking at other logistical options to transport Kearl crude, including construction of a terminal in Edmonton to load the oil on rail cars for shipment to U.S. refineries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

			Community Leader and JPMorgan Chase Executive Dennis Bassett 
      Announces Retirement
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase announced today the retirement of Dennis Bassett, 
      Chairman of Chase for Indiana, and the embodiment of a community banker 
      for the past 40 years. Bassett, 65 has served as the firm&#8217;s top 
      executive in the state for 10 years; a term that will conclude at the 
      end of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Dennis&#8217; focus on serving customers, cultivating exceptional employees 
      and providing leadership in the community throughout his career helped 
      solidify Chase&#8217;s position in the market,&#8221; said Tony Maggiore, President 
      of the Midwest, Chase Middle Market Banking. &#8220;He&#8217;s been a valuable 
      contributor to the success of JPMorgan Chase. We will miss his insight, 
      energy, warmth and integrity.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Bassett began his banking career in 1973 with Indiana National Bank and 
      has since served as chief executive officer of Bank One of Indiana, 
      president of Huntington Bank in Indiana, and in executive positions at 
      Chase&#8217;s predecessor banks through four significant mergers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Managing a portfolio of middle market companies was Bassett&#8216;s start in 
      the commercial banking world. It helped him hone the attributes that 
      would define his leadership &#8211; astute analytical abilities, clear and 
      frequent communication, and the ability to partner and build deep 
      relationships.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It has been a privilege to serve this community. Indiana has remarkable 
      businesses, distinguished cultural and philanthropic organizations and 
      the greatest people in the world; especially the men and women of 
      JPMorgan Chase,&#8221; said Bassett. &#8220;I&#8217;m proud of the work we have done 
      together &#8211; in business, philanthropically and civically. Together we 
      have built a strong, vibrant community and positioned it to thrive for 
      generations to come.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Beyond his role as the leader of Chase in Indiana, Bassett serves the 
      community as a trustee of Butler University; Central Indiana Corporate 
      Partnership, Indiana State Chamber of Commerce, Greater Indianapolis 
      Progress Committee, Indiana Sports Corp., Indianapolis Symphony 
      Orchestra, Center for Leadership Development, and Arts Council of 
      Indianapolis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      He also has served on the boards of the Indiana Neighborhood Housing 
      Partnership, Greater Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce, Peyback 
      Foundation, BehaviorCorp and he chaired Youthlinks Golf Charity for six 
      years. He was the board president of the Sharon L. Bassett Foundation 
      since its inception.

			Coca-Cola Promotes Columbus&#8217; Sustainability Efforts with Recycle  Win
		&lt;/p&gt;

				Over $13,000 in Piggly Wiggly Gift Cards used as incentives to

		&lt;p&gt;
      In an effort to promote recycling, the Columbus Georgia Consolidated 
      Government, in partnership with Coca-Cola and Piggly Wiggly is 
      introducing the Coca-Cola Recycle  Win program &#8211; a nationally 
      recognized sustainability initiative which offers tips on recycling and 
      rewards to selected residents for proper recycling.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To implement and promote recycling, The Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola 
      Bottling Co. Consolidated have invested over $150,000 in the Coca-Cola 
      Recycle  Win program, which includes a direct mail educational packet 
      sent to all single-family households in Columbus by mid November.
			The 
      educational packet contains images highlighting which materials SHOULD 
      go in recycling containers as well as a &#8220;Give it Back&#8221; sticker, which 
      residents must place on their recycling container to opt in for a chance 
      to win a $50 Piggly Wiggly gift card.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Recycling is not only good for the environment, but it is good for our 
      communities&#8217; budget. Recycling extends the life of landfills and saves 
      tax dollars now and for years to come,&#8221; said Columbus Mayor Teresa 
      Tomlinson. &#8220;The partnership with Coca-Cola provides an opportunity to 
      bring together a public/private partnership that supports our efforts to 
      promote recycling with this unique education program.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Partnering with Coca-Cola for Recycle  Win, takes Columbus&#8217; 
      sustainability efforts to a whole new level. We want to encourage 
      recycling which makes the city more efficient and, with Coca-Cola 
      Recycle  Win, potentially puts a reward in your pocket,&#8221; said Pat 
      Biegler, Director of Public Works, Columbus Consolidated Government.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Gloria Weston-Smart, Executive Director, Keep Columbus Beautiful added, 
      &#8220;After seeing Coca-Cola Recycle  Win impact recycling in other 
      communities, I knew this was something we wanted to bring to Columbus. 
      Bottom line, it encourages everyone to recycle, and for those people 
      already recycling, to recycle more. We appreciate Coke's role in this 
      public-private partnership and the opportunity to come together for a 
      "Greener" Columbus.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Coca-Cola is excited to bring the Coca-Cola Recycle  Win program to 
      Columbus,&#8221; said Lauren Steele, senior vice president, corporate affairs, 
      Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated. &#8220;The Coca-Cola Company believes it 
      is essential to educate everyone on the importance of recycling and 
      recycling properly. We also believe that recycling should be a rewarding 
      experience, and what better way to encourage people to recycle than by 
      giving them an opportunity to be a winner!&#8221; Steele, a long-time 
      proponent of recycling added, &#8220;Coca-Cola Recycle  Win enhances 
      Columbus&#8217; reputation as a leader in this country&#8217;s sustainability 
      efforts.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Recycle  Win Recycling Street Team will be visiting area 
      neighborhoods starting in mid November and plans to award a total of 
      260, $50 Piggly Wiggly Gift Cards throughout the six-month program.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Piggly Wiggly is proud to team up with Coca-Cola to promote recycling 
      in Columbus,&#8221; said Gil Milligan, Piggly Wiggly Operations Manager. 
      &#8220;Sustainability is a core value at Piggly Wiggly and we encourage 
      residents of Columbus, Georgia to participate in the Coca-Cola Recycle  
      Win program for the chance to earn a $50 Piggly Wiggly gift card.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;* Investors focus on Fed comments, indexes near highs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Facebook volatile after results, Exxon shares higher&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Jobless claims fall slightly less than expected&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Indexes down: Dow 0.3 pct, S 0.3 pct, Nasdaq 0.4 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ryan Vlastelica&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Oct 31 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell modestly on
Thursday, with investors cautious with indexes near record
levels as they digested recent comments from the Federal
Reserve, though some strong corporate earnings provided a reason
to buy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimism about earnings was boosted by Exxon Mobil Corp
, one of the largest U.S. companies by market cap, which
reported adjusted third-quarter earnings that beat expectations,
sending shares 1.1 percent higher to $89.78.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expedia also advanced following its results,
topping the S 500 percentage gainers, while Facebook Inc
 fluctuated between steep gains and losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed said Wednesday it had a weaker growth outlook for
the U.S. economy, though it held steady with its stimulus
program, which has fueled the S's 23 percent surge this year.
That rally has come amid weaker-than-expected economic data and
an earnings season marked by weak revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nobody was surprised by the lack of action by the Fed, but
there was a lack of clarity that was disappointing," said Rex
Macey, who helps oversee $20 billion as chief investment officer
at Wilmington Trust in Atlanta, Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is reason for caution at these levels, but nobody
seems to be euphoric, so I don't think people need to get too
defensive at this point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average was down 48.61
points, or 0.31 percent, at 15,570.15. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
Index was down 4.95 points, or 0.28 percent, at 1,758.36.
The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 15.18 points, or
0.39 percent, at 3,915.44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow has gained 2.9 percent in October, while the S has
added 5 percent and the Nasdaq is up 3.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data on Thursday showed jobless claims fell slightly less
than expected in the latest week, dropping 10,000 to 340,000.
The Chicago Purchasing Manager's Index came in at 65.9, far
ahead of expectations for a reading of 55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While investors have been concerned by weak data pointing to
slowing economic growth, strong data has also been viewed as a
reason to sell, given that the Fed has said it would begin to
slow its stimulus when economic growth meets its targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook reported strong growth in its mobile advertising
business late on Wednesday, though it said it didn't plan to
boost the frequency of ads shown to users. Trading was volatile,
with shares soaring during the premarket session but then
turning sharply negative. They last traded at $48.38, down 1.3
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expedia jumped 18 percent to $59.98 a day after reporting
third-quarter earnings that beat expectations, while Starbucks
Corp fell 1.7 percent to $79.44 in the wake of a
disappointing outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of 313 companies in the S 500 that reported earnings
through Wednesday morning, 68.4 percent topped Wall Street
expectations, above the 63 percent beat rate since 1994 and the
66 percent rate for the past four quarters, according to Thomson
Reuters data. Only 53.7 percent of companies have topped revenue
expectations, well below the 61 percent average since 2002.&lt;/p&gt;

$2.4 billion," Exxon said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil companies with refining units, such as Exxon and Royal
Dutch Shell, have seen profit hurt in the quarter as
demand for fuels like gasoline and diesel waned and global
refining capacity grew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's refining unit had a profit of $592 million in the

&lt;p&gt;OTTAWA Oct 31 (Reuters) - Consumers may join a class action
lawsuit against Microsoft Corp over alleged unfair
pricing, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the high court refused to allow a class action to
proceed against Archer Daniels Midland Co and Cargill
Inc over alleged price-fixing on high-fructose corn syrup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court, in its decision on Microsoft, certified a
class action suit against the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases are Pro-Sys Consultants Ltd et al. v. Microsoft
Corp et al. (B.C.) (34282) and Sun-Rype Products Ltd et al. v.
Archer Daniels Midland Co et al. (B.C.) (34283).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Correct second paragraph to read first nine months, not first
three)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* EPS $1.79 v Street view $1.77&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Output up 1.5 percent, first gain since 2011 2nd qtr&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Shares edge up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Anna Driver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oct 31 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp, the world's
largest publicly traded oil company, reported
higher-than-expected quarterly results on Thursday as output
rose for the first time in more than two years, but refining
weakness hurt earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon and other large oil companies struggling to boost
production in recent years have spent heavily on new projects.
In the first nine months of this year, Exxon alone spent $33
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is their first year-over-year (production) increase in
more than two years," said Brian Youngberg, an energy company
analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. "It does show that they
are hopefully making some progress stemming the decline that
they've shown the last couple of years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon last reported a quarterly gain in production in the
second quarter of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil and natural gas output rose 1.5 percent from a year
earlier to 4 million barrels oil equivalent per day, helped by
the start-up of new projects, the Irving, Texas, company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural gas from Australia's Kipper Tuna Turrum project and 
accelerated output from projects in Nigeria and Canada also
contributed to the higher production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profit in the third quarter was $7.87 billion, or $1.79 per
share, compared with $9.57 billion, or $2.09 per share, a year
earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average had expected $1.77 per share, according
to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Weaker margins, mainly in refining, decreased earnings by
$2.4 billion," Exxon said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil companies with refining units, such as Exxon and Royal
Dutch Shell, have seen profit hurt in the quarter as
demand for fuels like gasoline and diesel waned and global
refining capacity grew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's refining unit had a profit of $592 million in the
latest quarter, down sharply from $3.2 billion a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's shares rose in premarket trading to $89, up
slightly from Wednesday's New York Stock Exchange close of
$88.81.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anna Driver; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick and

			EXXONMOBIL'S CHAIRMAN REX W. TILLERSON COMMENTED:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;ExxonMobil&#8217;s third quarter results reflect our continued progress 
      across a diverse set of profitable growth opportunities, which positions 
      us well to deliver shareholder value.
			We maintain a long-term 
      perspective on our business with a relentless focus on operational 
      excellence and disciplined investing.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;Third quarter earnings were $7.9&#160;billion, down 18% from the third 
      quarter of 2012.
			Production of oil and natural gas increased from 
      a year earlier as new projects were brought on line and 
      maintenance-related downtime decreased.
			Significantly weaker 
      refining margins as a result of increased industry capacity negatively 
      impacted ExxonMobil&#8217;s Downstream earnings.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;Capital and exploration expenditures were $10.5&#160;billion in the third 
      quarter and $32.6&#160;billion for the first nine months of 2013, in line 
      with anticipated spending plans.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;The Corporation distributed $5.8&#160;billion to shareholders in the 
      third quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares 
      outstanding.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			THIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Earnings of $7,870&#160;million decreased $1,700&#160;million or 18% from the 
        third quarter of 2012.
      
			
        Earnings per share (assuming dilution) were $1.79, a decrease of 14% 
        from the third quarter of 2012.
      
			
        Capital and exploration expenditures were $10.5&#160;billion, up 15% from 
        the third quarter of 2012, in line with anticipated spending plans.
      
			
        Oil-equivalent production increased 1.5% from the third quarter of 
        2012. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects 
        and divestments, production increased 2.7%, with liquids volumes up 
        5.3%.
      
			
        Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $13.6&#160;billion, including 
        proceeds associated with asset sales of $0.2&#160;billion.
      
			
        Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding were $3&#160;billion.
      
			
        Dividends per share of $0.63 increased 11% compared to the third 
        quarter of 2012.
      
			
        The Esso Australia Pty Ltd operated Kipper Tuna Turrum project 
        commenced natural gas production from the Tuna field and oil 
        production from the Turrum field. The project is the largest domestic 
        oil and gas development on Australia&#8217;s eastern seaboard and will help 
        secure Australia&#8217;s energy future.
      
			
        As announced on August 8, 2013, Imperial Oil Limited and ExxonMobil 
        Canada Ltd. have acquired ConocoPhillips&#8217; interest in the Clyden oil 
        sands lease, approximately 95 miles south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. 
        The Clyden lease contains 226,000 gross acres and is a high-quality 
        addition to Imperial&#8217;s portfolio of oil sands in-situ opportunities.

			Third Quarter 2013 vs. Third Quarter 2012
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Upstream earnings were $6,713&#160;million in the third quarter of 2013, up 
      $740&#160;million from the third quarter of 2012. Higher liquids and natural 
      gas realizations increased earnings by $440&#160;million. Production volume 
      and mix effects increased earnings by $20&#160;million. All other items, 
      including favorable tax and foreign exchange impacts, partly offset by 
      higher operating expenses, increased earnings by $280&#160;million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On an oil-equivalent basis, production increased 1.5% from the third 
      quarter of 2012. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC 
      quota effects and divestments, production increased 2.7%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Liquids production totaled 2,199&#160;kbd (thousands of barrels per day), up 
      83&#160;kbd from the third quarter of 2012. Excluding the impacts of 
      entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, liquids 
      production was up 5.3%, as lower downtime and project ramp-up in Canada 
      and Nigeria were partially offset by field decline.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Third quarter natural gas production was 10,914&#160;mcfd (millions of cubic 
      feet per day), down 147&#160;mcfd from 2012. Excluding the impacts of 
      entitlement volumes and divestments, natural gas production was down 
      0.3%, as field decline was mostly offset by lower downtime and project 
      ramp-up.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations were $1,050&#160;million, $417&#160;million 
      higher than the third quarter of 2012. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were 
      $5,663&#160;million, up $323&#160;million from the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Downstream earnings were $592&#160;million, down $2,598&#160;million from the 
      third quarter of 2012. Weaker margins, mainly in refining, decreased 
      earnings by $2.4&#160;billion. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by 
      $150&#160;million. All other items, including lower gains on asset sales and 
      foreign exchange impacts, decreased earnings by $380&#160;million. Petroleum 
      product sales of 6,031&#160;kbd were 74&#160;kbd lower than last year's third 
      quarter reflecting divestment-related impacts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Earnings from the U.S. Downstream were $315&#160;million, down $1,126&#160;million 
      from the third quarter of 2012. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings of 
      $277&#160;million were $1,472&#160;million lower than last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chemical earnings of $1,025&#160;million were $235&#160;million higher than the 
      third quarter of 2012 due primarily to higher commodity margins. Third 
      quarter prime product sales of 6,245&#160;kt (thousands of metric tons) were 
      298&#160;kt higher than last year's third quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Corporate and financing expenses were $460&#160;million for the third quarter 
      of 2013, up $77&#160;million from the third quarter of 2012, reflecting 
      unfavorable tax impacts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the third quarter of 2013, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 
      34&#160;million shares of its common stock for the treasury to reduce the 
      number of shares outstanding at a cost of $3.0&#160;billion. Share purchases 
      to reduce shares outstanding are currently anticipated to equal 
      $3&#160;billion in the fourth quarter of 2013. Purchases may be made in both 
      the open market and through negotiated transactions, and may be 
      increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.

        earnings by $9.0&#160;billion.
      
			
        Earnings per share decreased 27% to $5.46. Excluding net gains from 
        divestments, earnings per share decreased 2%.
      
			
        Oil-equivalent production was down 1.4% from 2012. Excluding the 
        impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, 
        production was up 0.4%.
      
			
        Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $35.6&#160;billion, including 
        proceeds associated with asset sales of $0.9&#160;billion.
      
			
        The Corporation distributed over $20&#160;billion to shareholders in the 
        first nine months of 2013 through dividends and share purchases to 
        reduce shares outstanding.
      
			
        Capital and exploration expenditures were $32.6&#160;billion, up 19% from

		&lt;p&gt;
      Upstream earnings for the first nine months of 2013 were 
      $20,055&#160;million, down $2,078&#160;million from the first nine months of 2012. 
      Higher gas realizations, partially offset by lower liquids realizations, 
      increased earnings by $350&#160;million. Lower sales volumes decreased 
      earnings by $400&#160;million. All other items, including lower net gains 
      from asset sales, mainly in Angola, and higher expenses, reduced 
      earnings by $2.0&#160;billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      On an oil-equivalent basis, production was down 1.4% compared to the 
      same period in 2012. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC 
      quota effects and divestments, production was up 0.4%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Liquids production of 2,192&#160;kbd increased 13&#160;kbd compared with 2012. 
      Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and 
      divestments, liquids production was up 1.3%, as project ramp-up and 
      lower downtime were partially offset by field decline.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Natural gas production of 11,818&#160;mcfd decreased 431&#160;mcfd from 2012. 
      Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes and divestments, natural 
      gas production was down 0.8%, as field decline was partially offset by 
      lower downtime, higher demand, and project ramp-up.

      Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations for 2013 were $3,005&#160;million, up 
      $684&#160;million from 2012. Earnings outside the U.S. were $17,050&#160;million, 
      down $2,762&#160;million from the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Downstream earnings of $2,533&#160;million decreased $8,889&#160;million from 2012 
      driven by the absence of the $5.3&#160;billion gain associated with the Japan 
      restructuring. Lower margins, mainly refining, decreased earnings by 
      $2.2&#160;billion. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $430&#160;million. 
      All other items, including higher operating expenses, unfavorable 
      foreign exchange impacts, and lower divestments, decreased earnings by 
      $970&#160;million. Petroleum product sales of 5,851&#160;kbd decreased 346&#160;kbd 
      from 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      U.S. Downstream earnings were $1,602&#160;million, down $1,276&#160;million from 
      2012. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings were $931&#160;million, a decrease of 
      $7,613&#160;million from last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chemical earnings of $2,918&#160;million were $22&#160;million lower than 2012. 
      The absence of the gain associated with the Japan restructuring 
      decreased earnings by $630&#160;million. Higher margins increased earnings by 
      $520&#160;million, while volume and mix effects increased earnings by 
      $80&#160;million. All other items increased earnings by $10&#160;million. Prime 
      product sales of 17,986&#160;kt were down 270&#160;kt from 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Corporate and financing expenses were $1,276&#160;million in the first nine 
      months of 2013, down $289&#160;million from 2012, as favorable tax impacts 
      were partially offset by the absence of the Japan restructuring gain.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Gross share purchases through the first nine months of 2013 were 
      $12.7&#160;billion, reducing shares outstanding by 141&#160;million shares.

			Cautionary statement

		&lt;p&gt;
			Statements relating to future plans, projections, events or 
      conditions are forward-looking statements.
			Actual results, 
      including project plans, costs, timing, and capacities; capital and 
      exploration expenditures; resource recoveries; and share purchase 
      levels, could differ materially due to factors including: changes in oil 
      or gas prices or other market or economic conditions affecting the oil 
      and gas industry, including the scope and duration of economic 
      recessions; the outcome of exploration and development efforts; changes 
      in law or government regulation, including tax and environmental 
      requirements; the outcome of commercial negotiations; changes in 
      technical or operating conditions; and other factors discussed under the 
      heading "Factors Affecting Future Results" in the &#8220;Investors&#8221; section of 
      our website and in Item 1A of ExxonMobil's 2012 Form 10-K.
			We 
      assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date.

			Frequently used terms
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			This press release includes cash flow from operations and asset 
      sales, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.
			Because of the 
      regular nature of our asset management and divestment program, we 
      believe it is useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with 
      the sales of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales and 
      returns of investments together with cash provided by operating 
      activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business 
      and financing activities.
			A reconciliation to net cash provided 
      by operating activities is shown in Attachment II.
			References to 
      quantities of oil or natural gas may include amounts that we believe 
      will ultimately be produced, but that are not yet classified as &#8220;proved 
      reserves&#8221; under SEC definitions.
			Further information on 
      ExxonMobil's frequently used financial and operating measures and other 
      terms is contained under the heading "Frequently Used Terms" available 
      through the &#8220;Investors&#8221; section of our website at exxonmobil.com.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Reference to Earnings
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			References to corporate earnings mean net income attributable to 
      ExxonMobil (U.S. GAAP) from the consolidated income statement.
			Unless 
      otherwise indicated, references to earnings, Upstream, Downstream, 
      Chemical and Corporate and Financing segment earnings, and earnings per 
      share are ExxonMobil's share after excluding amounts attributable to 
      noncontrolling interests.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The term &#8220;project&#8221; as used in this release can refer to a variety of 
      different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as 
      in any government payment transparency reports.
