&lt;p&gt;Windows Azure, Microsoft's public cloud computing platform, became generally available in 21 countries on Monday, Microsoft bloggers said. SQL Azure, offering cloud-based relational database capabilities, also became available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows Azure features compute, storage, hosting, and management capabilities. Microsoft first revealed Azure in October 2008. The platform has been available in a Community Technology Preview phase. As of 12 AM Greenwich Mean Time on February 2, Microsoft begins charging for Azure, the Azure Team blog said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ InfoWorld's Paul Krill got the scoop last week that the Sun Cloud service that had been planned by Sun Microsystems will not see the light of day. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since January 2010, thousands of customers have moved from CTP to production and partners like Origin Digital, GXS, tradefacilitate and 3M are actively building and deploying solutions to the Windows Azure platform. Starting today, they, along with all of our partners, will be able to begin selling their solutions to their customers, ultimately enabling them to reach new markets and increase their revenue," the Azure blog said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers who have not yet upgraded Windows Azure CTP accounts to paid commercial subscriptions will have service disabled and their data on Windows Azure Storage will be made read-only. SQL Azure CTP customers who have not yet upgraded can keep using existing databases but cannot create new ones. On March 1, SQL Azure CTP accounts that have not been upgraded will be deleted. Windows Azure Storage CTP accounts that have not been upgraded will be deleted on April 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Microsoft Windows Azure cloud reaches general availability stage," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc is likely to slash its chief executive's bonus from the record $67.9 million he got two years ago, but Lloyd Blankfein's pay package could still fuel criticism the bank has been "tone deaf" in its approach to the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efforts to deflect criticism and keep regulators at bay has already prompted Goldman to change its bonus strategy, curbing compensation in the fourth quarter of 2009 and eliminating cash bonuses for top managers, instead paying them in stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman still may face a storm of criticism when it announces the bonuses of its top executives even as it seeks to trim the headline numbers after a year of record profits. The announcement could come at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have made a number of moves to try to ameliorate the issues," said Alan Johnson, a Wall Street compensation consultant. "I would be shocked if it didn't have an impact on his and everybody else's total."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson estimated that Blankfein will get a bonus of more than $40 million for 2009, a year in which Goldman reported record earnings of $13.39 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would fall well below the $67.9 million he received in 2007. Blankfein took no bonus in 2008 during the worst of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Times of London reported on Monday that Blankfein could receive a bonus of up to $100 million, thumbing his nose at President Barack Obama and his recent crackdown on the banking industry. The newspaper cited bankers who were in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum as its sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman spokesman Lucas van Praag denied the report, calling it "speculative nonsense," although he acknowledged that Goldman's board had yet to make a final decision on executive compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate report in the Wall Street Journal said at least one unnamed London banker in Davos was willing to wager millions of pounds that Blankfein, a staunch defender of Wall Street, would be out of a job within two years -- an anecdote that van Praag called "effluent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SIDESTEPPING CONTROVERSY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reports on Blankfein and Goldman's quick retorts underscore the sensitivities at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Underneath that cool exterior, it is apparent that there is some very great sensitivity at Goldman about executive compensation these days," said Scott Tangney, a consultant with public relations firm Makovsky + Co, who added that he expects Goldman to pay Blankfein at a lower level than 2007 and other years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because of the government pressure and the public scrutiny, it has already forced Goldman to handle executive compensation in a very different way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman last month sidestepped controversy over its ballooning bonus pool by cutting off compensation after three quarters and giving $500 million to charity. Before the shift, Goldman was on pace to surpass its record payout of $20 billion in 2007. But the actual figure was $16.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While political pressure could affect high-profile executives like Blankfein, it leaves open the possibilities for outsized paydays for lesser-known executives and star traders who helped the firm set a record profit in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2008, when most of Wall Street was at death's door, 953 Goldman employees made at least $1 million apiece, according to a report by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo. There were 21 Goldman employees who made at least $8 million each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 2009, executives like David Heller, Harvey Schwartz, Edward Eisler, and Pablo Salame, all of whom lead units that oversee bond, stock, currency and commodity sales and trading, could see mega payouts after the firm reported $23.3 billion in revenues from fixed income, currency and commodities trading in 2009, up from $3.7 billion in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paydays for them of more than $20 million each would not be surprising, headhunters and recruiters said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Lipstein, a recruiter at Boyden Global Executive Search, said he would expect "a huge payout for their stars."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's bonuses are expected to come largely in stock rather than cash, following a trend on Wall Street to change pay designs and curb risk-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, those changes are likely to fall on deaf ears to an angry public focused on the big numbers, said Sarah Anderson, a fellow with the Institute for Policy Studies, which is critical of Wall Street, and co-author of the recent study "America's Bailout Barons."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are claiming to have made changes, but for the ordinary taxpayers who have contributed very much to the recovery of the markets, they aren't seeing it as substantial change," Anderson said. "They are seeing it as business as usual."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year's free preview of Windows 7 will start nagging users to pay for the operating system in two weeks, and begin automatically shutting down PCs in one month, Microsoft reminded customers today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft unveiled the schedule for Windows 7 Release Candidate's retirement in May 2009, when it issued the early look to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, it said Windows 7 RC would expire June 1, 2010. Before that date, however, users are to receive warnings of the impending end. Starting on Feb. 15, Windows 7 RC will display notices every few hours that the machine will periodically shut down beginning on March 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of March 1, PCs running Windows 7 RC will automatically shut down every two hours. Those shutdowns will come without warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To avoid any data loss, I suggest making plans to move to a released version of Windows 7 before the automatic shutdowns start [on March 1]," said Microsoft spokesman Brandon LeBlanc in an entry on the Windows 7 blog today. "During these shutdowns, your work will not be saved."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From March 1 to June 1, the automatic shutdowns will continue. On June 1, Windows 7 RC is tagged as "not genuine" -- Microsoft's term for counterfeit -- and boots to a solid black screen that shows a Windows Activation screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make matters tougher for users still running the free version, Microsoft does not allow in-place upgrades from the RC to a paid copy. Instead, users must back up their data, do a clean install -- Microsoft calls it a "custom install" -- that erases the contents of the hard drive before it installs the operating system, then restore the backed-up data and reinstall all applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has previously confirmed that customers can use the less-expensive upgrade editions of Windows 7 to migrate from the RC to a paying copy. Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade , for example, lists for $110.99 on Amazon.com, a $69 savings over the $179.99 for Windows 7 Home Premium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp reported a fourth-quarter profit on Monday that topped Wall Street expectations as natural gas projects boosted results at the largest U.S. oil company's exploration arm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, Exxon's net income fell 23 percent as weak demand for fuel in the global economic slowdown caused a loss in its refining business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's shares rose 3 percent, outperforming a 2.2 percent gain in the Chicago Board Options Exchange index of oil companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil and gas production increased nearly 2 percent in the quarter to 4.18 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day -- better than some analysts had expected -- helped by production from Exxon's massive liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in Qatar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Natural gas production in Asia Pacific and the Middle East was up 31 percent," Pavel Molchanov, analyst at Raymond James, said. "That's where a lot of the growth came from. They had those big liquefaction terminals start up in Qatar in the second half of the year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon is also investing in natural gas closer to home. The company has said it plans to buy XTO Energy Inc for about $30 billion in stock in a big bet on North America's fast-growing natural gas industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the company declined to provide any details of the planned XTO acquisition on its earnings conference call, it did say the deal is still expected to close in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underscoring Exxon's interest in developing fields with so-called unconventional gas trapped in substances like rock, the company said it has amassed 5.5 million unconventional gas acres worldwide and is accelerating development of the Marcellus Shale in the eastern United States with a joint-venture partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REFINING LOSS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon and other companies that process oil into gasoline, diesel and heating oil have seen refining margins crushed as crude prices climbed more than 30 percent in a quarter where industrial demand was depressed by economic weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net income in the quarter was $6.05 billion or $1.27 per share, compared with $7.82 billion, or $1.54 per share in the same period a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street analysts had expected a profit of $1.19 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The two things I like to see drive an earnings beat are better production and better margins, Phil Weiss, oil analyst at Argus Research, said. "They certainly got the production."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's worldwide refining unit had a loss of $189 million, compared with a year-ago profit of $2.41 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, No. 2 U.S. oil company Chevron Corp posted a 37 percent drop in quarterly profit, while top U.S. refiner Valero Energy Corp sank to a quarterly loss and slashed its dividend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's chemical earnings were $716 million, up sharply from $155 million in the 2008 fourth quarter. The company's exploration arm earned $5.78 billion, up from $5.63 billion a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue in the quarter rose 6 percent to $89.84 billion,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploration and capital spending totaled $27.1 billion in 2009, up nearly 4 percent from a year ago. The company has said it expects to spend $25 billion to $30 billion each year over the next 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon shares closed $1.75 higher at $66.18 on the New York Stock Exchange and rose slightly to $66.25 in after hours trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BP Plc will report on Tuesday and Royal Dutch Shell Plc will release results on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Matt Daily in New York; Editing by Dave Zimmerman and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

Microsoft Rides High on Windows 7

Microsoft Corporation (Nasdaq: MSFT) reported second quarter 2010 earnings that
beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16 cents, or 27.12%. Revenue beat by 6.4%. 

MSFT's revenue surprise was driven by growing attach rates and inventory builds
for Microsoft's Windows 7 operating system on consumer PC platforms. 

Eleven of the 32 analysts polled by Zacks have made upward revisions to their
earnings estimates on MSFT over the past 30 days, as checks indicated very
strong attach rates for the Windows 7 OS during the last quarter. 

The surprise history is also very encouraging. Microsoft earnings have beaten
the Zacks consensus by an average of 10.46% during the four preceding quarters.
Further, the positive surprise from MSFT has been growing in each successive
quarter, having beaten the Zacks Consensus by 25.00% in the Sep 2009 quarter. 

However, Microsoft's second quarter earnings excluding the recognition of
deferrals related to Windows 7 would reduce earnings by $0.19, resulting in a
miss of $0.03. This could be the reason for the slight downward movement in the
MSFT share price despite the huge quarter. 

December 2009 was a very strong quarter for Microsoft, in which the Windows
attach rate started climbing. We believe this is a very significant quarter for
MSFT, as the adoption in the new-age netbook market was strong. We think
Microsoft is poised to benefit from new product cycles in both the enterprise PC
and server markets. MSFT has also entered into a three-year agreement with
Hewlett Packard Company (NYSE: HPQ) for its cloud computing solutions. 

MSFT is also making strides in the still-small Online Services Business, where
an agreement with HP ensures that Bing will be the default search engine on most
of its PCs. Bing`s U.S. market share continues to inch upwards, with the search
engine growing slightly stronger than Google Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG) in December
(ComScore). Although the agreement with Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq: YHOO) is still
pending regulatory approval, this could help the company acquire additional
expertise in the space. 

AZN Misses, Guidance Disappoints

Yesterday, AstraZeneca`s (NYSE: AZN) fourth quarter earnings came in at $1.42
per American Depositary Shares (ADS), well below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of
$1.57. However, earnings increased 13.6% compared to the year-ago period.
Revenues increased 4% at constant exchange rates (CER) to $8.9 billion compared
to the same period last year. 

The primary reasons for the increase in revenues were strong US sales of
Toprol-XL benefiting from the withdrawal of a generic, US sales of H1N1 vaccine
and robust growth in emerging markets. For the full year, AstraZeneca reported
revenues and EPS of $32.8 billion (7% growth at CER) and $6.32, (23% growth at
CER), respectively. AstraZeneca recorded strong sales across all geographies
during the quarter. Sales in North America, Emerging Markets and Established
Markets increased (at CER) by 4%, 10% and 2%, respectively. 

AstraZeneca has outlined a tough scenario for 2010. The company expects core
earnings per ADS in the range of $5.75 - $6.15. Although the guidance is in line
with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.97 per ADS, it is lower than $6.32
reported in 2009. Moreover, due to the potential loss of market exclusivity of
Arimidex and Pulmicort Respules in the US, the company expects a mid
single-digit decline in revenue based on CER in 2010. Shares were down 5.4% at
the end of the day following the disappointing guidance.

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

Fastest Economic Growth in Years

While some folks think lightly of such inventory-led economic growth, it is
nothing to scoff at. The slowdown in inventory liquidations at the start of the
turnaround, as we saw this quarter, helps bring back production facilities to
work, giving a shot in the arm to the rest of the consumer-centric economy. But
it is true that we need other sectors to start taking the economic growth baton
from inventory liquidation in the coming quarters. 

We are seeing some early signs of that recovery. The all-important consumer
spending has been up and signs of life are clearly visible in industrial
production numbers. Even the housing sector -- the epicenter of this downturn --
is showing some signs of economic growth. 

We have seen ample evidence of this turnaround in every sector of the economy
this earnings season, with company after company coming up with
better-than-expected numbers. This morning, Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) came out
with record revenue and provided a robust outlook, while last night Amazon
(Nasdaq: AMZN) reported impressive numbers. And Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) and Intel`s
(Nasdaq: INTC) record numbers just a few days back are still fresh in our
memory. And it is not only about the tech sector -- we are seeing signs of
stability in the banking sector as well, regulatory uncertainties
notwithstanding. 

All in all, we are increasingly getting more confident in our outlook for
sustainable economic growth. We see enough signs of latent strength to help
propel this economy on its own once the stimulus starts tapering off in the
second half of the year. 

Chevron Misses on Weak Refining

Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) posted weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter 2009
earnings, pulled down by sharply lower downstream results on the back of
depressed refining margins. This was partially offset by higher commodity prices
and growing production in its upstream segment. 

Earnings per share (excluding foreign-currency effects) came in at $1.57, below
the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.69. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2008,
Chevron`s adjusted earnings per share fell 17.4% (from $1.90 to $1.57). However,
quarterly revenue of $48.7 billion was up 7.7% from the year-earlier level,
driven by robust E results. 

Chevron`s quarterly miss didn`t come as a major surprise. Though there were no
estimate revisions in either direction over the last 7 days, earnings estimates
for the company have been trending slightly down over the past month, with the
quarterly Zacks Consensus Estimate going down by a penny. Overall, 8 out of the
15 analysts covering the stock pulled back on fourth quarter projections during
that time, while 3 raised their estimates. 

With respect to earnings surprises, Chevron has had a bearish run over the last
four quarters (including the quarter under discussion). This is the company`s
3rd negative surprise in the past 4 quarters.

&lt;p&gt;Mark A. Humphrey to Retire after Distinguished Career with the Company
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)today named Matthew J. Foehr as corporate vice
president and comptroller, effective April 1. Foehr succeeds Mark A. Humphrey,
who is retiring from the position after 34 years with the company. 

In his new role, Foehr`s responsibilities will encompass corporate-wide
accounting, financial reporting and analysis, and internal controls. Foehr, who
is currently vice president of finance for Chevron`s Global Upstream and Gas
business, will also oversee Finance Shared Services in his new capacity. 

"Matt`s extensive finance and risk management background across many corporate
finance organizations, as well as from our principal upstream and downstream
business operations, makes him eminently qualified to become our corporate
comptroller," said John Watson, Chevron`s chairman and chief executive officer. 

Foehr, 52, joined Chevron in 1982 on the company`s MBA Development Program.
Since that time, he has advanced through a number of finance positions of
increasing responsibility in the corporation`s comptroller, investor relations
and treasury departments. Foehr also has held senior finance positions in the
company`s upstream exploration and production organization, as well as Chevron`s
downstream refining, retail marketing and credit card operations. In 2003, Foehr
was appointed vice president of finance for Chevron`s Global Downstream
business. He assumed his current role overseeing the Global Upstream and Gas
finance function in 2007. 

Commenting on Humphrey, who is retiring from Chevron after a distinguished
34-year career, Watson said, "Mark provided a steady hand during a time of
significant regulatory change for corporate finance. He was a central member of
our global finance team, and we wish Mark and his family well in his
well-deserved retirement." 

Humphrey, 57, has been corporate vice president and comptroller since 2005.
After joining Chevron as a financial analyst in 1976, he advanced through a
number of finance positions of increasing responsibility throughout the
corporation. In 1997, he was appointed audit general manager and in 1998 he
became vice president of finance for Chevron Products Company. In 1999, he was
named general manager of the company`s Finance Shared Services organization. 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company`s success is
driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and other energy products; manufactures and sells
petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides
energy efficiency solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future,
including biofuels. Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif. More information about

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc is likely to slash its chief executive's bonus from the record $67.9 million he got two years ago, but Lloyd Blankfein's pay package could still fuel criticism the bank has been "tone deaf" in its approach to the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efforts to deflect criticism and keep regulators at bay has already prompted Goldman to change its bonus strategy, curbing compensation in the fourth quarter of 2009 and eliminating cash bonuses for top managers, instead paying them in stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman still may face a storm of criticism when it announces the bonuses of its top executives even as it seeks to trim the headline numbers after a year of record profits. The announcement could come at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have made a number of moves to try to ameliorate the issues," said Alan Johnson, a Wall Street compensation consultant. "I would be shocked if it didn't have an impact on his and everybody else's total."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson estimated that Blankfein will get a bonus of more than $40 million for 2009, a year in which Goldman reported record earnings of $13.39 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would fall well below the $67.9 million he received in 2007. Blankfein took no bonus in 2008 during the worst of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Times of London reported on Monday that Blankfein could receive a bonus of up to $100 million, thumbing his nose at President Barack Obama and his recent crackdown on the banking industry. The newspaper cited bankers who were in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum as its sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman spokesman Lucas van Praag denied the report, calling it "speculative nonsense," although he acknowledged that Goldman's board had yet to make a final decision on executive compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate report in the Wall Street Journal said at least one unnamed London banker in Davos was willing to wager millions of pounds that Blankfein, a staunch defender of Wall Street, would be out of a job within two years -- an anecdote that van Praag called "effluent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SIDESTEPPING CONTROVERSY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reports on Blankfein and Goldman's quick retorts underscore the sensitivities at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Underneath that cool exterior, it is apparent that there is some very great sensitivity at Goldman about executive compensation these days," said Scott Tangney, a consultant with public relations firm Makovsky + Co, who added that he expects Goldman to pay Blankfein at a lower level than 2007 and other years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because of the government pressure and the public scrutiny, it has already forced Goldman to handle executive compensation in a very different way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman last month sidestepped controversy over its ballooning bonus pool by cutting off compensation after three quarters and giving $500 million to charity. Before the shift, Goldman was on pace to surpass its record payout of $20 billion in 2007. But the actual figure was $16.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While political pressure could affect high-profile executives like Blankfein, it leaves open the possibilities for outsized paydays for lesser-known executives and star traders who helped the firm set a record profit in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2008, when most of Wall Street was at death's door, 953 Goldman employees made at least $1 million apiece, according to a report by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo. There were 21 Goldman employees who made at least $8 million each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 2009, executives like David Heller, Harvey Schwartz, Edward Eisler, and Pablo Salame, all of whom lead units that oversee bond, stock, currency and commodity sales and trading, could see mega payouts after the firm reported $23.3 billion in revenues from fixed income, currency and commodities trading in 2009, up from $3.7 billion in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paydays for them of more than $20 million each would not be surprising, headhunters and recruiters said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Lipstein, a recruiter at Boyden Global Executive Search, said he would expect "a huge payout for their stars."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's bonuses are expected to come largely in stock rather than cash, following a trend on Wall Street to change pay designs and curb risk-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, those changes are likely to fall on deaf ears to an angry public focused on the big numbers, said Sarah Anderson, a fellow with the Institute for Policy Studies, which is critical of Wall Street, and co-author of the recent study "America's Bailout Barons."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are claiming to have made changes, but for the ordinary taxpayers who have contributed very much to the recovery of the markets, they aren't seeing it as substantial change," Anderson said. "They are seeing it as business as usual."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

"effluent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SIDESTEPPING CONTROVERSY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The reports on Blankfein and Goldman's quick retorts
underscore the sensitivities at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Underneath that cool exterior, it is apparent that there is
some very great sensitivity at Goldman about executive

public relations firm Makovsky + Co, who added that he expects
Goldman to pay Blankfein at a lower level than 2007 and other
years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Because of the government pressure and the public scrutiny,

 (Updates to late afternoon trading, changes byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Angela Moon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Feb 1 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Monday as
better-than-expected data on the manufacturing sector and
earnings from Exxon Mobil reassured investors that economic
growth is on track, after stocks suffered their worst month in
almost a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apple Inc shares (AAPL.O) rose 0.8 percent to $193.62,
buoying the Nasdaq. The semiconductor index .SOXX was up 2.6
percent, following an analyst's upgrade of the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index
showed the sector grew in January at a faster rate than
expected. The ISM report followed strong manufacturing data
from China, Australia and the euro zone. [ID:nN01363414] and
[ID:nLDE6100W3]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's stock rose 2.8 percent to $66.26 after the largest

back-to-back losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The market is starting to focus more on profits, putting
into perspective positive economic news like the ISM, while
putting aside politics and bad earnings we saw" in January,
said Burt White, managing director and chief investment officer

or 0.95 percent, to 2,167.73.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of industrial materials companies gained on the
strong global manufacturing data, with aluminum company Alcoa
Inc (AA.N) up 4 percent at $13.24, and U.S. Steel Corp (X.N) up
6.1 percent to $47.11. The Dow Jones industrials metals and

includes three repeat nominees
BOSTON--(Business Wire)--
Gridiron Club of Greater Boston president Steve Grogan announced today that
sixteen NCAA Division One players are semi-finalists for thefifty-eighth Walter
Brown Award, presented annually to the best American-born college hockey player
in New England. 

The candidates include eleven players from Hockey East, three from the ECAC
Hockey League, and two from Atlantic Hockey. The slate comprises 11 forwards,
one goalie, and four defensemen. Five teams - Yale, New Hampshire,
Massachusetts, Boston University, and Boston College - each have two nominees. 

Massachusetts junior James Marcou,(Kings Park, NY); UMass-Lowell senior Kory
Falite (Billerica, MA); and Yale senior Sean Backman (Cos Cob, CT), all
forwards, were semifinalists for last year`s award, which was won by Boston
University`s Matt Gilroy. Marcou, who currently leads the nation in scoring with
40 points in 28 games, was also in the running two years ago as a freshman. 

The only goaltender on the 2010 semifinalists` list is Vermont sophomore Rob
Madore (Pittsburgh, PA). Defensemen are Boston College senior Carl Sneep
(Nisswa, MN); Boston University sophomore David Warsofsky (Marshfield, MA); New
Hampshire sophomore Blake Kessel (Verona, WI); and Providence senior Mark Fayne
(Sagamore Beach, MA.) 

The remaining forwards from Hockey East schools are Boston College junior Brian
Gibbons (Braintree, MA); Boston University junior Nick Bonino (Unionville, CT);
Massachusetts sophomore Casey Wellman (Brentwood, CA); and New Hampshire senior
Bobby Butler (Marlborough, MA).

and Quinnipiac senior Eric Lampe (Madison, WI.) 

Semifinalists from Atlantic Hockey are Sacred Heart senior Nick Johnson
(Windsor, CT) and Bentley University senior Marc Menzione(Darien, IL.). 

"The balance and competitiveness we`ve seen throughout college hockey in the
East this year has been superb, and that balance was especially evident during
the process of nomination and evaluation for the Walter Brown Award," remarked
Gridiron Club Hockey Awards Committee chairman Tim Costello. "Not every player
who received serious consideration was able to make the cut." 

The Gridiron Club will announce the winner of the 58th Walter Brown Award in
mid-March.

&lt;p&gt;DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Sempra Energy (SRE.N) may carve up commodities joint venture RBS Sempra, people familiar with the matter said, as pressure on U.S. banks to limit proprietary trading has forced JPMorgan to rethink its plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is still in talks to buy RBS Sempra's global oil business and all assets outside North America, while Sempra Energy in talks to buy out all of the North American power and gas business, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sempra owns 49 percent of RBS Sempra, with Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) owning the remaining 51 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has been in exclusive talks to buy all of RBS Sempra for about $4 billion, but the United States' plans to stop proprietary trading by banks have prompted it to rethink its plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North American power and gas is also the area of commodities where JPMorgan is strongest and would have most overlap with RBS Sempra. That stems from its acquisition of Bear Stearns in March 2008, when it bulked up with Bear Energy, which included the Williams Power Co. and traded power, natural gas and other commodities and owned physical assets like power plants and gas pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"PROP TRADING" BAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is keen to expand its commodities arm and has been growing aggressively in recent years under Blythe Masters, who has said she wants to become a top-tier franchise globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is keen to take on the top three commodities firms -- Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Barclays (BARC.L) -- and a purchase of all of RBS Sempra would have achieved that goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But banks are coming under increasing pressure to limit any speculative activity, and RBS Sempra does conduct so-called "prop trading" with its own money, rather than for a client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plans by U.S. President Barack Obama to ban banks from prop trading should not derail JPMorgan's deal to buy RBS Sempra's oil operations and all businesses outside North America, several sources have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Union is forcing RBS to sell its 51 percent stake in RBS Sempra. Sempra Energy had been in talks to sell its 49 percent as part of the deal, but may now take full control of the U.S. power and gas assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBS Sempra's Chief Executive Kaushik Amin resigned on Friday, and had been replaced by co-chief executives Mike Beck and Michael Goldstein, people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amin declined comment when reached on his New York telephone number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interim CEOs had updated senior management on the progress of talks over the weekend, but gave no reason why Amin had left, one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An RBS spokesman said "constructive discussions" regarding the sale of RBS Sempra were still under way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan started exclusive talks with RBS and Sempra on about January 20, after seeing off rival suitor Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), which is not expected to have re-entered any talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Barani Krishnan in New York, Emma Farge in London and Edward Taylor in Frankfurt; Editing by Hans Peters and Sharon Lindores)&lt;/p&gt;

Libertyville, Illinois, said the market was bouncing from an
oversold condition and the better-than-expected ISM reading
still must translate into real growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Whether this is still inventory replenishment or whether
this is hoping for future growth, we'll see," he said. "I think
the jury is still out as to whether we actually get the
growth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI gained 95.00

strong global manufacturing data, with aluminum company Alcoa
Inc (AA.N) up 3.5 percent at $13.17, and U.S. Steel Corp (X.N)
adding 4.5 percent to $46.41. The Dow Jones Industrials metals
and mining index .DJUSIM rose 4.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In January's pullback, the materials and technology sectors
were the biggest losers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rebound was more muted on the Nasdaq as Amazon.com Inc
(AMZN.O) fell 7.3 percent $116.31 after the online retailer all
but waved the white flag in a dispute with publisher Macmillan
that could lead to the online retailer raising prices on some
of its e-books. [ID:nN31156514]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Nasdaq's gain also was curbed by Warner Chilcott
WCRX.O, whose shares fell 7.2 percent to $25.36 after Morgan
Stanley downgraded the stock to "equal weight" from
"overweight," saying one of the pharmaceutical company's
largest products may not be safe from generic competition.
[ID:nSGE6102KS]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reaction to U.S. President Barack Obama's fiscal 2011
budget proposal was muted. Investors expressed concern about
the size of the budget deficit, but were as yet unclear about
which elements of the president's proposed budget will make it
into law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The president's proposed budget projected the deficit
soaring in 2010 to a post-World War Two high of $1.56 trillion
-- or 10.6 percent of gross domestic product -- but falling to
half that level by the time his term ends in 2012. His budget
proposal is subject to change by Congress. [ID:nN31157907].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, a top European Union official said Greece's
fiscal cutback plans were ambitious but achievable, relieving
some of the anxiety that drove investors away from risky
assets, including stocks, in recent weeks. [ID:nLDE6100QW]

 (Adds background, detail)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Luke Pachymuthu and Steve Slater&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DUBAI/LONDON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and
Sempra Energy (SRE.N) may carve up commodities venture RBS
Sempra, people familiar with the matter said, as pressure on
U.S. banks to limit proprietary trading forces JPMorgan to
rethink its plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan is still in talks to buy RBS Sempra's global oil
business and all assets outside North America, while Sempra
Energy is in talks to buy out all of the North American power
and gas business, the sources said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sempra owns 49 percent of RBS Sempra, with Royal Bank of
Scotland (RBS.L) owning the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan has been in exclusive talks to buy all of RBS
Sempra for about $4 billion, but the United States' plans to
stop proprietary trading by banks have prompted it to rethink
its plans, sources said. [ID:nLDE60U0D6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; North American power and gas is also the area of commodities
where JPMorgan is strongest and would have most overlap with RBS
Sempra. That stems from its acquisition of Bear Stearns in March
2008, when it bulked up with Bear Energy, which included the
Williams Power Co and traded power, natural gas and other
commodities and owned physical assets like power plants and gas
pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "PROP TRADING" BAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan is keen to expand its commodities arm and has been
growing aggressively in recent years under Blythe Masters, who
has said she wants her part of the bank to become a top-tier
franchise globally. [ID:nN25140786]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank is keen to take on the top three commodities firms
-- Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Barclays
(BARC.L) -- and a purchase of all of RBS Sempra would have
achieved that goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But banks are coming under increasing pressure to limit
speculative activity and RBS Sempra does conduct proprietary
trading with its own money rather trading than for a client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plans by U.S. President Barack Obama to ban banks from
proprietary trading should not derail JPMorgan's deal to buy RBS
Sempra's oil operations and all businesses outside North
America, several sources have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The European Union is forcing RBS to sell its 51 percent
stake in RBS Sempra. Sempra Energy had been in talks to sell its
49 percent as part of the deal, but may now take full control of

had left, one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An RBS spokesman said "constructive discussions" regarding
the sale of RBS Sempra were still under way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan started exclusive talks with RBS and Sempra on
about Jan. 20, after seeing off rival suitor Deutsche Bank
(DBKGn.DE), which is not expected to have re-entered any talks.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has assigned initial long-term and short-term Issuer Default
Ratings (IDRs) of 'A+' and 'F1+', respectively, to Goldman Sachs Bank, USA
(BUSA). A complete list of ratings is shown below. 

BUSA is a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
(Goldman). Fitch's ratings of BUSA primarily reflect its ownership by Goldman
and are augmented by its revenue diversity, high market share in key products,
significant liquidity, and solid asset quality. Since BUSA's ratings are both
driven by and linked to those of its parent company, any changes in Goldman's
ratings would directly impact the ratings of BUSA. At Sept. 30, 2009, BUSA had
$116.6 billion of risk-weighted assets, $21.3 billion of regulatory capital, and
$35.5 billion of deposits. 

The assignment of the '1' institutional Support rating acknowledges the
commonality of clients, products, and infrastructure that Goldman and BUSA
enjoy. In addition, there are formal arrangements in place by Goldman to provide
the necessary resources for BUSA to maintain capital sufficiency and to fulfill
its financial obligations. In addition to guarantees covering payment
obligations, credit losses on transferred assets, derivative losses, and
non-FDIC guaranteed deposits, Goldman holds $5 billion of subordinate debt
issued by BUSA. There is also an agreement in place whereby Goldman pledges
collateral valued at a minimum of 5% of BUSA's aggregate value of unfunded
credit lines and transferred assets. Fitch believes the parent is willing and
able to provide direct funding to BUSA should the need arise. 

In November 2008, Goldman converted into a bank holding company. Since that
time, a number of subsidiaries and assets have been moved into BUSA. Other than
this organizational change, Fitch notes no significant changes in Goldman's
business platform, funding profile or risk appetite. Fitch believes U.S.
financial institutions in general, however, will be subject to increased
oversight and regulation. For traditional investment banks such as Goldman that
recently converted to bank holding companies, this means acclimating to an
altered competitive landscape while adapting to an evolving regulatory
environment. 

BUSA is the product of the merger between Goldman Sachs Bank USA, a Utah-based
industrial loan company and Goldman Sachs Trust Company, a New York-chartered
trust company. As of Nov. 28, 2008, BUSA converted into a New York State
chartered bank. GS Group contributed assets to BUSA totaling $117 billion.
Transactions between GS Group, BUSA and other Goldman subsidiaries and
affiliates are regulated by the Federal Reserve Board. The type, frequency, and
size of affiliated transactions may be limited, and are generally required to be
arms-length. 

This rating action reflects the application of Fitch's current criteria which is
available on Fitch's website at 'www.fitchratings.com' and specifically
includes: 

--'Master Global Financial Institutions Criteria' (Dec. 29, 2009); 

--'Bank Holding Companies' (Dec. 29, 2009) 

Fitch has assigned the following ratings: 

Goldman Sachs Bank, USA 

--L-T IDR of 'A+'; 

--Long-term senior debt of 'A+'; 

--Long-term deposits of `AA-'; 

--Short-term IDR of 'F1+'; 

--Short-term debt of `F1+'; 

--Short-term deposits of `F1+'; 

--Support '1'; 

--Long-term debt guaranteed by TLGP 'AAA'; 

--Short-term debt guaranteed by TLGP 'F1+'. 

The Outlook is Stable.

EXXONMOBIL'S CHAIRMAN REX W. TILLERSON COMMENTED: 

"Despite continuing difficult global economic conditions, ExxonMobil delivered
strong business results and built on our long-term focus. Our full year 2009
earnings excluding special items were $19,420 million despite significantly
lower commodity prices and weak product margins.

"Our financial strength provided us with the foundation to continue investing in
new energy supplies to help meet global energy demand and to fuel economic
growth. Capital and exploration spending was $27.1 billion in 2009, another
record year, and in line with our longer term plan.

"Underscoring our commitment to creating sustainable, long-term value,
ExxonMobil and XTO Energy announced a $41 billion agreement in the fourth
quarter 2009 that will enhance ExxonMobil`s position in the development of
unconventional resources. ExxonMobil and XTO resources will combine to provide
numerous opportunities to supply new affordable and reliable energy resources on
a global basis.

"In addition to our robust investment program, we distributed a total of $26
billion to shareholders in 2009 through dividends and share purchases to reduce
shares outstanding. This reflects a 7% increase in annual per share dividends
and an overall reduction in shares outstanding of 5% and reaffirms our
commitment to creating value for shareholders.

"ExxonMobil`s fourth quarter earnings excluding special items were $6,050
million, a decrease of 23% from the fourth quarter of 2008. Lower refining and
fuels margins and lower natural gas realizations were partly offset by higher
crude oil realizations."

FOURTH QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS

* Earnings were $6,050 million, a decrease of 23% or $1,770 million from the
fourth quarter of 2008. 
* Earnings per share were $1.27, a decrease of 18%. 
* Capital and exploration expenditures were $8.3 billion, up 21% from the fourth
quarter of 2008. 
* Oil-equivalent production increased nearly 2% from the fourth quarter of 2008.
Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and
divestments, production was up over 3%. 
* Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $8.9 billion, including asset
sales of $0.3 billion. 
* Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding were $2.0 billion. 
* Exxon Mobil Corporation and XTO Energy Inc. announced an all-stock transaction
valued at $41 billion. The agreement, subject to regulatory clearance and XTO
shareholder approval, will enhance ExxonMobil`s position in the development of
unconventional natural gas and oil resources and enhance our ability to create
sustainable, long-term value. XTO has a diverse resource base equivalent to 45
trillion cubic feet of gas which includes shale gas, tight gas, coal bed methane
and shale oil and possesses extensive unconventional technical capabilities and
operating expertise. 
* Project participants agreed to proceed with development of the Papua New
Guinea (PNG) liquefied natural gas (LNG) project. The PNG LNG project will
include gas production and processing facilities, onshore and offshore
pipelines, and liquefaction facilities with capacity of 6.6 million tons per
year. 
* Exxon Mobil Corporation and Qatar Petroleum agreed to develop a world-scale
petrochemical complex in Ras Laffan Industrial City, Qatar. The complex will
include a 1.6 million ton-per-year steam cracker, two 650 thousand ton-per-year
polyethylene plants, and a 700 thousand ton-per-year ethylene glycol facility.
The plant is expected to start up in late 2015.

Fourth Quarter 2009 vs. Fourth Quarter 2008

Upstream earnings were $5,780 million, up $146 million from the fourth quarter
of 2008. Higher crude oil realizations increased earnings $1.8 billion while
lower gas realizations reduced earnings by $1.2 billion. Lower gains from asset
sales decreased earnings by $600 million. 

On an oil-equivalent basis, production increased nearly 2% from the fourth
quarter of 2008. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota
effects and divestments, production was up over 3%. 

Liquids production totaled 2,393 kbd (thousands of barrels per day), down 79 kbd
from the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes,
OPEC quota effects and divestments, liquids production was essentially flat, as
increased production from projects in Qatar was offset by field decline. 

Fourth quarter natural gas production was 10,717 mcfd (millions of cubic feet
per day), up 868 mcfd from 2008. Project ramp-up in Qatar was partly offset by
decline in Europe. 

Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations were $1,011 million, $312 million higher
than the fourth quarter of 2008. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were $4,769 million,
down $166 million. 

Downstream earnings were a loss of $189 million, down $2,603 million. Lower
margins drove the majority of the decline, reducing earnings $2.2 billion. Fewer
gains from asset sales also contributed to the decrease. Petroleum product sales
of 6,489 kbd were 272 kbd lower than last year's fourth quarter, mainly
reflecting asset divestments and lower demand. 

The U.S. Downstream recorded a loss of $287 million, down $267 million from the
fourth quarter of 2008. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings of $98 million were $2,336
million lower. 

Chemical earnings of $716 million were $561 million higher than the fourth
quarter of 2008. Stronger margins improved earnings by $190 million while higher
sales volumes increased earnings $190 million. All other items, primarily lower
hurricane costs, increased earnings by $180 million. Fourth quarter prime
product sales of 6,675 kt (thousands of metric tons) were 1,049 kt higher than
the prior year primarily due to improved demand and the absence of last year`s
hurricane impacts. 

Corporate and financing expenses were $257 million, down $126 million from
fourth quarter 2008, mainly due to favorable tax items. 

During the fourth quarter of 2009, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 33 million
shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $2.4 billion.
These purchases included $2.0 billion to reduce the number of shares
outstanding, with the balance used to offset shares issued in conjunction with
the company's benefit plans and programs. Shares outstanding were reduced from
4,747 million at the end of the third quarter to 4,727 million at the end of the
fourth quarter. First quarter 2010 share purchases are continuing at a pace
consistent with fourth quarter 2009 share reduction spending of $2.0 billion.
However, total purchases for the quarter may be less due to trading restrictions
during the proxy solicitation period for the XTO merger. Purchases may be made
in both the open market and through negotiated transactions, and may be
increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice. 

Full Year 2009 vs. Full Year 2008

Earnings of $19,280 million ($3.98 per share) decreased $25,940 million from
2008. Earnings for 2009 included an after-tax special charge of $140 million
related to the Valdez litigation. Earnings for 2008 included an after-tax
special gain of $1,620 million from the sale of a natural gas transportation
business in Germany and after-tax special charges of $460 million related to the
Valdez litigation. Excluding these special items, 2009 earnings decreased by
$24,640 million. 

FULL YEAR HIGHLIGHTS

* Earnings excluding special items were $19,420 million, down 56%. 
* Earnings per share excluding special items decreased 52% to $4.01, reflecting
lower earnings and the continued reduction in the number of shares outstanding. 
* Earnings were down 57% from 2008. Earnings for 2009 included a special charge
of $140 million for interest related to the Valdez punitive damages award.
Earnings for 2008 included a special gain of $1,620 million from the sale of a
natural gas transportation business in Germany and special charges of $460
million related to the Valdez punitive damages award. 
* On an oil-equivalent basis, production increased 11 koebd (thousand of oil
equivalent barrels per day) from last year. Excluding the impacts of entitlement
volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production was up about 2%. 
* Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $29.9 billion, including $1.4
billion from asset sales. 
* The Corporation distributed a total of $26.0 billion to shareholders in 2009
through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. This
reflects a 7% increase in annual per share dividends and an overall reduction in
shares outstanding of 5% versus 2008. 
* Capital and exploration expenditures were $27.1 billion, up 4% versus 2008.

Upstream earnings, excluding special items, were $17,107 million, down $16,675
million from 2008. Lower crude oil and natural gas realizations decreased
earnings $15.2 billion while higher operating costs reduced earnings by $1.4
billion. 

On an oil-equivalent basis, production increased by 11 koebd compared to 2008.
Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and
divestments, production was up about 2%. 

Liquids production of 2,387 kbd declined less than 1% from last year. Excluding
the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, liquids
production was up nearly 2%, as the ramp-up of project volumes in the U.S.,
Qatar and West Africa was partly offset by field decline. 

Natural gas production of 9,273 mcfd increased 178 mcfd, or 2%, from 2008.
Higher volumes from Qatar were partly offset by field decline. 

Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations for 2009 were $2,893 million, a decrease
of $3,350 million. Earnings outside the U.S. excluding special items were
$14,214 million, down $13,325 million. 

Downstream earnings of $1,781 million were $6,370 million lower than 2008.
Weaker margins decreased earnings $5.1 billion. Lower asset divestment activity
reduced earnings about $1.0 billion. Petroleum product sales of 6,428 kbd
decreased from 6,761 kbd in 2008, mainly reflecting asset divestments and lower
demand. 

U.S. Downstream earnings were a loss of $153 million, down $1,802 million.
Non-U.S. Downstream earnings were $1,934 million, $4,568 million lower than last
year. 

Chemical earnings of $2,309 million decreased $648 million from 2008. Weaker
margins reduced earnings by $340 million while lower volumes reduced earnings
$190 million. Prime product sales of 24,825 kt were down 157 kt from 2008. 

Corporate and financing expenses excluding special items were $1,777 million, up
$947 million, mainly due to lower interest income. 

In 2009, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 277 million shares of its common
stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $19.7 billion. These purchases
included $18.0 billion to reduce the number of shares outstanding, with the
balance used to offset shares issued in conjunction with the company`s benefit
plans and programs. Shares outstanding were reduced from 4,976 million at the
end of 2008 to 4,727 million at the end of 2009, a decrease of 5.0%.

Cautionary statement

Statements in this release relating to future plans, projections, events or
conditions are forward-looking statements.Actual results, including benefits
resulting from the XTO transaction; project plans, costs, timing, and
capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; and share purchase levels,
could differ materially due to factors including: the timing and conditions of
regulatory clearance for the XTO merger; our ability to integrate the businesses
of XTO and ExxonMobil effectively after closing; changes in long-term oil or gas
prices or other market or economic conditions affecting the oil and gas
industry; unforeseen technical difficulties; political events or disturbances;
reservoir performance; the outcome of commercial negotiations; wars and acts of
terrorism or sabotage; changes in technical or operating conditions; and other
factors discussed under the heading "Factors Affecting Future Results" in the
"investors" section of our website and in Item 1A of ExxonMobil's 2008 Form
10-K. We assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date.
References to quantities of oil or natural gas may include amounts that we
believe will ultimately be produced, but that are not yet classified as "proved
reserves" under SEC definitions.

Frequently used terms

Consistent with previous practice, this press release includes both earnings
excluding special items and earnings per share excluding special items.Both are
non-GAAP financial measures and are included to help facilitate comparisons of
base business performance across periods.Reconciliation to net income
attributable to ExxonMobil is shown in Attachment II.The release also includes
cash flow from operations and asset sales.Because of the regular nature of our
asset management and divestment program, we believe it is useful for investors
to consider sales proceeds together with cash provided by operating activities
when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing
activities. A reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities is
shown in Attachment II.Further information on ExxonMobil's frequently used
financial and operating measures and other terms is contained under the heading
"Frequently Used Terms" available through the "investors" section of our website
at exxonmobil.com.

Accounting guidance adopted in first quarter 2009

Effective January 1, 2009, ExxonMobil adopted the authoritative guidance on
consolidation as it relates to noncontrolling interests. The guidance changed
the accounting and reporting for minority interests, which were recharacterized
as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity.The guidance
required retrospective adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements
for existing minority interests.All other requirements will be applied
prospectively. The adoption of the accounting guidance did not have a material
impact on the Corporation`s financial statements.

References to total corporate earnings mean net income attributable to
ExxonMobil (U.S. GAAP) from the income statement.Unless otherwise indicated,
references to earnings, special items, earnings excluding special items,
Upstream, Downstream, Chemical and Corporate and Financing segment earnings, and
earnings per share are ExxonMobil's share after excluding amounts attributable
to noncontrolling interests.

Effective January 1, 2009, ExxonMobil adopted the authoritative guidance for
earnings per share as it relates to determining whether instruments granted in
share-based payment transactions are participating securities.The guidance
required that all unvested share-based payment awards that contain
nonforfeitable rights to dividends should be included in the basic Earnings Per
Share (EPS) calculation. Prior-year EPS numbers have been adjusted
retrospectively on a consistent basis with 2009 reporting. This guidance did not
affect the consolidated financial position or results of operations.

January manufacturing index at 10 a.m. (1500 GMT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Japan's Nikkei average finished flat on Monday as

&lt;p&gt;First-of-Its-Kind Integration with Microsoft Applications Transforms the Way
Legal Research is Conducted
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
LexisNexis&#174;, a leading global provider of content-enabled workflow solutions,
today announced Lexis&#174; for Microsoft Office - a new set of research capabilities
that will enable legal professionals to access content and services from
LexisNexis and other sources while operating directly within Microsoft Office
applications. Legal professionals can now find, analyze and act upon legal
content while working within Microsoft Office Outlook, Microsoft Word and
Microsoft Office SharePoint Server. 

Input from hundreds of customers and other legal professionals shaped the
development of Lexis for Microsoft Office, which was specifically designed to
address their need to work more efficiently and productively, and ultimately
serve clients better. Customers can now access vital information from the
LexisNexis&#174; services, the open Web as well as designated law firm or corporate
files in one place and with the click of a button - eliminating time and energy
intense searches across disparate sources and applications. 

"Lexis for Microsoft Office is a significant leap forward in the transformation
of legal technology - both in what it delivers and how it is being created,"
said Michael F. Walsh, CEO of LexisNexis U.S. Legal Markets. "Working closely
with our customers, we`ve created a whole new way to access and use the trusted
information they need directly from their day-to-day desktop applications. This
frees them to focus on legal reasoning and strategy, responding faster to client
issues and questions, and confidently managing legal matters." 

How it Works

While reviewing a Word document or an Outlook e-mail message, Lexis for
Microsoft Office users can seamlessly access content and resources from
LexisNexis, the open Web, or their law firm or corporate files. Key features
include:

* "Search" - A single search box that delivers one-click access to the vast
collection of legal content from LexisNexis, the open Web and the user`s
internal company information database. Results from all sources are displayed in
a window next to the active document. 
* "Background" - This function provides background information on "entities"
such as people, companies, organizations and cases mentioned in the text of a
Word document or Outlook message. It automatically indexes the working document
with hyperlinks to relevant information from internal, LexisNexis and Web
resources. Upon clicking the hyperlink, the information is displayed in a side
pane within the Microsoft Office applications. The Background feature will also
display full Shepard`s&#174; reports and apply Shepard&#8217;s&#174; SignalTM indicators
directly to the cases cited within the text of the document. Full text versions
of case law, news and information cited within an e-mail message or Word
document can also be accessed through the lexis.com resources directly within
the Microsoft software application. 
* "Suggest" - Similar to the Background function, this functionality interacts
with any text in a Word document or Outlook message. By manually highlighting
text, the user can prompt a search that will pull up relevant information from
internal, LexisNexis and Web resources. The content is displayed in a side pane
within the application.

While using SharePoint Server and Microsoft SharePoint Workspace, subscribers
also have the ability to store, organize and share documents on a related topic
from a SharePoint site. SharePoint can also act as an internal company database
from which Lexis for Microsoft Office pulls information. 

"With the increasing importance for law firms to bring meaning to content more
quickly and cost effectively, Lexis for Microsoft Office provides a powerful new
tool for legal professionals to access their information through a familiar,
easy-to-use and integrated environment," said Brian Zeve, U.S. professional
services industry managing director, Microsoft Corp. 

Lexis for Microsoft Office will launch for Microsoft Office 2007 in spring 2010,
and will be available with Microsoft Office 2010. To access and use these
capabilities, users will require a current LexisNexis subscription.

&lt;p&gt;DUBAI/LONDON Feb 1 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) is
rethinking its purchase of RBS Sempra and could pick up only the
joint venture's oil operations and all the non-U.S. businesses,
a source familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; But the U.S. power and gas businesses might be sold to
Sempra Energy (SRE.N), the source said, which jointly owns RBS
Sempra with Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan has been in exclusive talks to buy all of RBS
Sempra for about $4 billion, but U.S. plans to stop proprietary
trading by banks have prompted it to rethink its plans.
[ID:nLDE60U0D6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The plans by U.S. President Barack Obama should not derail
the deal to buy RBS Sempra's oil operations and all businesses
outside the United States, several sources have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The European Union is forcing RBS to sell its 51 percent
stake in RBS Sempra. Sempra Energy had been in talks to sell its
49 percent as part of the deal, but may now take full control of
the U.S. power and gas assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An RBS spokesman said "constructive discussions" regarding
the sale of RBS Sempra were still under way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan declined to comment.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc may tie up with one or more generic drug makers in Japan as it targets demand in the growing market, which it plans to enter after 2010, an executive at its Japan unit said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiroshi Matsumori, corporate officer at Pfizer Japan, told Reuters in an interview that Pfizer would capitalize on its brand name and business expertise in Japan to compete with rivals such as Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan's government is promoting greater use of generic drugs to help lower spending on healthcare as the population ages, prompting firms like Pfizer and Teva, the world's No.1 generic drug maker, to enter a market seen growing to around $5 billion next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teva started marketing its drugs in Japan last month, targeting a 10 percent share of the Japanese market by 2015, while Pfizer will enter the market as early as next year as part of its global move to help offset a series of patent expirations on its key drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest challenge for foreign players starting business in Japan, where standards are exceptionally high, is branding, which we have already achieved as a patent drug maker. We are completely different from those starting from scratch," Matsumori said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our goal is not a top market share. However, I believe our aim to take leadership in promoting old, yet good drugs would make us the leader in sales as a result," Matsumori said, referring to generic drugs as well as drugs that have seen patent expirations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he sees Pfizer grabbing a market share of slightly less than 10 percent by around 2020 when he expects use of generic drugs in Japan to reach levels seen in the United States and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think Teva's target (for a 10 percent share) is not crazy but may be a little stretched," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Teva, which is using a joint venture with Japanese drugmaker Kowa Co to enter the market, Pfizer prefers to form an alliance without a joint venture, Matsumori said, adding that he has met with four or five partner candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan's government aims for generic drugs to make up 30 percent of the drug market by sales volume in the year to March 2013, up from about 17 percent in the year ended in March 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese thinktank Fuji Keizai forecasts that the sales of generic drugs in Japan will increase to 448 billion yen ($4.98 billion) next year from an estimated 392 billion yen last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teva has projected that the market's size will reach 1 trillion yen by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=90.03 Yen)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Yumiko Nishitani; Editing by Chris Gallagher)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's 10-month-old search engine Bing, which has struggled to make headway against Google, can be a viable runner-up and make money online eventually, according to one of its top executives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest software company has lost more than $5 billion over the past four years trying to build an online business, but hopes to reverse that trend once it completes a search advertising partnership with Yahoo Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As soon as we close and implement the Yahoo deal, we have achieved a milestone: for advertisers, we are a credible No. 2," Yusuf Mehdi, senior vice president of Microsoft's online audience business, said in an interview on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Really now, the goal is about share gain. If we grow share, we will grow our way into profitability, and we have confidence we can do that," said Mehdi, who is charged with making Bing and the MSN portal a financial success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft now has 10.7 percent of the U.S. search marketplace, according to ComScore, up from 8 percent before Bing's launch in June. But it still trails Google's 65.7 percent and Yahoo's 17.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming U.S. regulators soon approve a deal that makes Bing the underlying search engine for Yahoo, Microsoft will then effectively control almost 30 percent of the search market: a key number for advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At 30 points we are now a credible option, so that number matters," said Mehdi. "The nice thing is we can say (to advertisers) you can be close to 30 percent share in one easy buy. That 30 percent carries a lot of weight in the marketplace."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once advertisers start to catch on, Mehdi said, Microsoft will be on its way to making money online, a goal that has eluded the company for many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no question we intend to make a profit," said Mehdi, speaking at the gleaming new office tower in Bellevue, Washington, six miles from Microsoft's campus in Redmond, that serves as Bing's headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly there's a huge return in the search marketplace that can more than make up the investments we've put in to this point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROFIT IN SIGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact size of the global search ad marketplace is hard to gauge, but Google's annual revenue of more than $23 billion indicate that it is large and growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest part of moving into profit "is just getting the scale," said Mehdi. "We're built out to be a much larger player. We've spent the money and built out in such a way that we can be a player at scale. Every day that we grow a tenth of point of share, that moves us further up the curve."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mehdi declined to comment on whether Microsoft would attempt to strike a deal with newly independent AOL Inc on powering its searches, which are now done by Google, but said he was always talking to potential partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the Bing application was a hit on Apple Inc's mobile devices, but refused to be drawn on recent reports that Apple is considering making it the default search application on its iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And he added that Microsoft has no plans to spin off or sell MSN, saying there was a "great synergy" between Bing and MSN for advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A long-planned relaunch of MSN -- cleaning up the look of the portal and offering the choice of custom home pages focusing on entertainment, news, sports, money or lifestyle -- had been postponed to March from earlier in the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To get that right, it takes some time, so we've delayed it a little bit to make sure we get the features right," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mehdi did not say what constitutes success in the search marketplace for Microsoft. The company has internal goals, but he said there was no "magical number" that Bing has to hit to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Its very early. We have a very long way to go before we have what I think of as the success we want to have."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mehdi acknowledged that Bing's gains have not so far reduced Google's hold on the market, which has actually increased 0.7 percentage points since Bing's launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ultimately we want to be a major player at scale, so we're going to have to grow against Google at some point," said Mehdi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But "we're still outmanned and outgunned by Google, they still have way more engineers than we do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Edwin Chan and Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft on Tuesday released a template for applying its Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) methodology to agile software development projects built with the Visual Studio development environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downloadable template, offered in a beta release, enables developers to apply SDL to the Microsoft Solutions Framework (MSF) for&#160; Agile Software Development process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Microsoft last year offered security guidelines fpr melding SDL with agile processes. | ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The MSF for Agile Software Development plus SDL Process Template for Visual Studio Team System (VSTS) 2008 lets developers integrate the SDL-Agile secure development methodology directly into the Visual Studio development environment," a Microsoft representative said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MSF+Agile+SDL template lets code checked into the VSTS source repository be analyzed to ensure it complies with SDL secure development practices. Workflow tracking items are created for manual SDL processes such as threat modeling to ensure that security activities are not accidentally skipped or forgotten, according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A beta template applying the agile and SDL process to the Visual Studio 2010 software development process will be offered shortly after the platform is released in April. Final releases of both templates are due in the second quarter of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also is offering a white paper that explains how SDL can be implemented with limited resources and applied to other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft on Tuesday also said it will expand its SDL Pro Network, which was set up in 2008. Pro Network members are security specialists who offer services to adopt SDL. Specifically, Microsoft will announce a Tools membership category to complement the Consulting and Training categories, with Tools members being companies that can deploy security tools such as static analysis tools for the implementation phase of SDL and dynamic and binary analysis tools for the SDL verification phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Microsoft links security guidelines to agile development," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Income, Spending &amp; Savings Rise

Lower Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) means that people are holding on
to their wallets and not going out to shop at Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) or if they
are, they are not spending as much. Part of the reason was that their ability to
do so out of current income was crimped by less money coming in. However, part
of it is a deliberate decision on the part of consumers to try to repair their
damaged balance sheets by holding on to more of what they earn. 

While I would like to see faster growth in both Income and spending, over the
long term it is imperative that income rise more than spending, which is exactly
what happened in December. The fact that both were lower than in November is a
negative, but the upward revisions to November were a good thing to see
(although I wish the income number was up more than the spending number in
November). All in all, I would count this as a moderately positive report. 

Digital River Beats, Profits Fall

Digital River, Inc. (Nasdaq: DRIV) reported revenues of $104.9 million in the
fourth quarter of 2009, up 26% from a year ago exceeding management`s guidance
of $94 million - $98 million. The growth in revenues was driven by series of one
time promotions of Microsoft Windows 7 in the fourth quarter. This resulted in
Microsoft Corporation (Nasdaq: MSFT) generating approximately 11.8% of total
revenues in 2009. 

Net income came in at $15.3 million or 40 cents per share beating the Zacks
Consensus Estimate of 33 cents. This compared to a net income of $19.8 million
or 48 cents in the fourth quarter of 2008. 

Management expects to further expand its relationship with Microsoft and is
looking forward to a successful Office 2010 launch, scheduled for the first half
of 2010. 

Indian 3G Auction Postponed Again

The impending 3G spectrum auction, which was originally scheduled to take place
in late 2008/early 2009, was initially delayed due to disputes between the
Indian government and the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) regarding the
spectrum pricing structure. To expedite the spectrum auction process, DoT
increased the floor price for bidding for 3G auction to INR35 billion (US$716
million) per operator from the initial price of INR20.2 billion (US$415
million). Moreover, the floor bidding price for WiMax (broadband wireless
access) spectrum auction has been set at INR17.5 billion (US$360 million). 

DoT announced in August 2009 that it will issue four 3G and three WiMax spectrum
slots nationwide. DoT currently has the required spectrum to auction two 3G
slots with the Ministry of Defence holding the necessary airwaves to auction the
remaining two. The 3G and WiMax auctions are expected to fetch at least INR 250
billion (US$5.4 billion). The Indian government was keen to hold the auction in
the current fiscal year (ending March 31, 2010) to bridge the high fiscal
deficit, which now seems a distant possibility. 

The government has already allotted 3G licenses to the state-owned mobile
operators Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd ("BSNL") and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd
("MTNL") who have launched their 3G services in selected markets in early 2009.
Private operators are currently offering 2G services to their subscribers. 

The leading participants in the auction will be the top private telecom firms --
Bharti Airtel, Reliance Communications, Idea Cellular, Tata Teleservices and
Vodafone Essar, the Indian subsidiary of Vodafone (NYSE: VOD). The operators
desperately need to roll out data-intensive services as they experience
contracting revenue and margins on voice services. The limited number of
available license slots for auction is expected to increase the bidding price. 

In addition to the Indian operators, the government is allowing international
carriers to participate in the auctions, a move that will intensify competition
in the Indian wireless market, which is the second largest in the world (after
China). 

Foreign operators such as Telenor SA, NTTDoCoMo (NYSE: DCM) and Emirates
Telecommunications are expected to bid for the 3G licenses.

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Bank Failures Inch to 15 in 2010

The six bank failures would cost the federal deposit insurance fund roughly
$1.86 billion. The failure of First Regional Bank is expected to cost the
federal deposit insurance fund $825.5 million, First National Bank is expected
to cost about $260.4 million, Community Bank and Trust is estimated to cost
$354.5 million, Florida Community Bank is expected to cost $352.6 million,
Marshall Bank is expected to cost about $4.1 million and American Marine Bank is
estimated to cost about $58.9 million. 

Raleigh, North Carolina-based First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co. will assume the
deposits and $2.17 billion of the assets of First Regional Bank. Carrollton,
Georgia-based Community &amp; Southern Bank agreed to buy the deposits and assets of
First National Bank of Georgia, Orangeburg, S.C.-based SCBT, N.A will assume the
assets and deposits of Community Bank and Trust, Cavalier, N.D.-based United
Valley Bank will buy the assets and deposits of Marshall Bank, Miami-based
Premier American Bank, N.A. will buy the deposits and $499.1 million of the
assets of Florida Community Bank and Tacoma, Washington-based Columbia State
Bank is expected to assume the assets and deposits of American Marine Bank. 

Bank failures started this year with the failure of Bellingham, Washington-based
Horizon Bank. Washington Federal Inc. (Nasdaq: WFSL) will assume all of the
deposits of Horizon Bank. Increasing loan losses on commercial real estate are
expected to cause hundreds more bank failures in the next few years. The FDIC
anticipates bank failures to cost about $100 billion over the next three years. 

The failure of Washington Mutual in 2008 was the largest in U.S. banking
history. It was acquired by JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM). The other major
acquirers of failed institutions since 2008 include Fifth Third Bancorp (Nasdaq:
FITB), U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) and Zions Bancorp (Nasdaq: ZION).

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Exxon Beats but Net Sinks

ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) reported fourth quarter 2009 earnings of
$1.27 per share, compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.20 and
year-earlier earnings of $1.54. 

Weak refining and marketing (R) margins hit all the super majors hard in the
fourth quarter. Like Exxon, Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX), ConocoPhillips
(NYSE: COP), Hess Corporation (NYSE: HES) were all affected by poor R margins.


However, with a sound cash position, solid credit profile and diverse asset
base, both in terms of business mix as well as geographical footprint, Exxon
remains better positioned than any of its peers. 

The weak margins at XOM caused a 23% drop in earnings from the year-earlier
quarter to $6.05 billion. Upstream earnings were up nearly 2.5% year-over-year
to $5.78 billion, driven by higher crude oil realizations, partially offset by
lower natural gas realizations. 

The production of oil and natural gas averaged 4.18 million oil-equivalent
barrels per day, up approximately 2% year over year. When adjusted for the
impact of entitlement volumes and OPEC quota restrictions, production was up
about 3%. Exxon`s refinery throughput averaged 5.38 million barrels per day, up
more than 1% from the year-earlier level. 

Exxon's total refined product sales of 6.49 million barrels per day were down 4%
year over year, reflecting the depressed demand environment. Total product sales
in XOM's Chemicals business increased almost 19% year over year. 

Cash flow from operations and asset sales totaled $8.9 billion, down from $12.3
billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. Capital expenditures totaled $8.26
billion during the quarter, up 21% year-over-year. We are currently Neutral on
ExxonMobil shares. 

In-Line Quarter for Humana

Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) reported fourth quarter and full-year results for fiscal
2009. 

Humana reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.48 per share, in line with the
Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company earned $1.03 per share for the year-ago
quarter. Results were helped by lower prescription drug plan (PDP) claim
expenses in the reported quarter. 

Consolidated revenues for the quarter came in at $7.63 billion compared to $7.49
billion in the year-ago quarter, up approximately 2% with total premium and
administrative service fees rising 2% from the prior-year quarter primarily
because of increases in both average membership and per-member premiums for the
company`s Medicare Advantage products. 

The latest quarter`s consolidated benefit ratio, which reflects the percentage
of benefit expenses in premium revenues, decreased to 81.8% from 83.3% in the
prior-year quarter. The decrease of 150 basis points was primarily attributable
to a 240 basis points decrease in the Government Segment benefit ratio,
partially offset by the rise of 130 basis points in the Commercial Segment
benefit ratio.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Large, complex financial firms should give regulators access to comprehensive data on all of their exposures and on major counterparties, to allow for the orderly wind-down of failing institutions, a senior Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) executive said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Managing Director Gerald Corrigan told a group of banking professionals and U.S. regulators that the government needs the authority to dismantle large failing firms, to reduce the perception that some institutions are "too big to fail."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This so-called resolution authority is part of a broad financial regulation overhaul moving through Congress. It also includes creating a consumer agency to police financial products, establishing a systemic risk regulator, and enhanced policing of financial firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corrigan said large, troubled firms should be prepared to hand over large amounts of information so regulators can fully understand their lines of business and exposures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I mean everything, across all products, across all geographies, across all entities, the whole nine yards," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he acknowledged the difficulty of taking down a failing financial giant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a reason why it's never been done -- because it is damn hard to do," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corrigan is scheduled to testify on Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee on financial regulation reform. On Tuesday he declined to discuss what limits, if any, should be placed on a bank's proprietary trading activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration has proposed limits on commercial banks' proprietary trading and their market share of liabilities. If enacted, such limits could have a big impact on Goldman's operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corrigan did say U.S. regulators need to focus on how risk contagion and asset bubbles begin, rather than just focusing on how individual firms pose risks to the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the Federal Reserve should be the agency that tries to seek out systemic risk throughout the U.S. financial system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The key is conditioning people, starting with the Fed itself, to think contagion," Corrigan said. "What are the potential things that can trigger contagion-type products?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In outlining a set of "guided principles" to be included in his testimony, Corrigan said lawmakers need to move ahead with the creation of a systemic risk regulator and said financial institutions should be subject to more rigorous capital and liquidity standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also called for substantial enhancements in risk monitoring and risk management by banking supervisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you don't get risk monitoring right, you don't have a chance on getting the risk management right," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by John Poirier; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MONTERREY, Mexico &amp; CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to Coca-Cola Femsa S.A.B. de C.V.'s
(KOF) proposed USD400 million senior unsecured notes due 2020. Proceeds from the
issuance are expected to be used to refinance existing debt and for general
corporate purposes. 

Fitch currently rates KOF as follows: 

--Foreign currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A'; 

--Local currency IDR 'A'; 

--National scale long-term rating 'AAA(mex)'; 

--National scale short-term rating 'F1+(mex)'; 

--Local certificados bursatiles 'AAA(mex)'; 

The Rating Outlook for KOF is Stable. 

On Jan. 15, 2010, Fitch upgraded KOF's ratings, reflecting its low leverage and
increasing cash flow diversification, which has reduced its dependence upon its
Mexican operations. The stability of the company's results during 2009 was also
factored into the rating upgrades. KOF's ratings continue to reflect its strong
business position and strategic relationship with The Coca-Cola Company (KO)
(rated 'A+' by Fitch). 

The 'A' foreign currency rating of KOF exceeds Fitch's 'A-' Mexico country
ceiling rating due to KO's 31.6% ownership stake in KOF and KO's long history of
financially supporting its key bottlers. The geographic diversification of the
company's cash flows were also factored into the decision to rate the company
above the 'A-' country ceiling of Mexico. 

For the last twelve months (LTM) ended Sept. 30, 2009 KOF generated MXN19.2
billion of EBITDA and MXN16.7 billion of funds from operations (FFO). These
figures compare with MXN17.1 billion of EBITDA and MXN12.7 billion of FFO during
2008. The growth in EBITDA was primarily driven by volume growth of 8.1% and a
weakening of the Mexican peso versus the Brazilian real. The LTM EBITDA margin
as of Sept. 30, 2009 was 19.2%, a decline from 20.6% during 2008 and 20.8%
during 2007. Margins should remain under pressure as input costs are expected to
remain high in the following months, most significantly sweeteners, as sugar
prices experienced a sharp rise during the second half of 2009. The integration
of the financial results of Brazilian bottler, Refrigerantes Minas Gerais, Ltda.
(Remil)during 2009, have also lowered margins as have the increase in
concentrate prices in Mexico. 

Since the Panamco acquisition in May 2003, KOF has reduced its total debt by
over USD1.6 billion and its net debt by close to USD2 billion. As of Sept. 30,
2009, KOF had MXN15.7 billion (approximately USD1.2 billion) of total debt and
MXN8.9 billion (approximately USD663 million) of cash. The company's leverage,
as measured by total debt-to-LTM EBITDA was 0.8 times (x), an improvement from
1.1x as of Dec. 31, 2008. Interest coverage remained high at 9.6x. Financial
indicators should continue to strengthen as the company continues to repay debt
with internally generated cash. 

Liquidity risk is manageable. KOF had MXN8.9 billion (USD663 million) of cash
and marketable securities as of Sept. 30, 2009 compared to short-term debt
obligations of MXN5.2 billion. During the next five years, the company faces
annual debt amortizations no higher than MXN4.5 billion in a given year. During
the past five years its annual free cash flow has averaged MXN6.6 billion. The
proposed issuance of the ten year USD400 million Yankee bond in February 2010
will improve its debt profile. Proceeds from the bond issue will be applied
towards paying USD222 million of maturing debt in 2010 and for general corporate
purposes. 

Coca-Cola Femsa's debt profile is well-balanced between dollar- and
peso-denominated debt. At Sept. 30, 2009, KOF had 32% of its total debt
denominated in U.S. dollars, 55% denominated in Mexican pesos, 4.3% in Colombian
pesos, 7.9% in Argentine pesos and 1.1% in Venezuelan Bolivars. Given that the
company generates close to 50% of its EBITDA in Mexican pesos, the
peso-denominated debt eliminates a good portion of currency fluctuation risk.
KOF's strategy includes maintaining a maximum limit of USD200 million in dollar
net debt exposure by keeping excess cash in dollars and/or swapping dollar debt
into pesos via plain vanilla forwards and swaps. Post the Yankee bond issuance,
KOF's gross dollar debt will rise from USD376 million to USD776 but its net
dollar debt exposure will remain USD200 million. 

KOF's main activity is the production, distribution and marketing of Coca-Cola
products in its franchise territories. With sales of over 2.1 billion unit cases
(UC) per year, KOF is the largest Coca-Cola bottler in Mexico and Latin America,
and the second largest in the world in terms of sales volume, representing 10%
of the total worldwide volumes in the Coke system. In recent years, the company
has expanded its geographic and product reach through the acquisitions of Jugos
del Valle and Remil.

&lt;p&gt;  OSPREY, FL, Feb 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Dialectic Networks (DN), an IT support company  since 2005, today
announced its re-emergence as an LLC and now an  IBM/System x reseller
and IT services company focused on enabling a  "savings triangle" for its
customers by utilizing the latest developments  in open source software,
modular  data center designs, and cloud  computing using trusted IBM
hardware and software.

    With energy costs rising as well as the growing demand for highly
available  compute and storage capacity that can quickly scale, modular
and/or  portable modular data center (PMDC) environments offer
cutting-edge  technology that deliver optimum return on investment. DN
helps implement  these environments, which offer reduced up-front capital
and on-going  operational expenses vs. more traditional 'brick and
mortar' installations. Together with virtualized  environments and cloud
computing solutions, DN's total cost of  ownership designs will result in
less front-end construction costs, lower  overall costs for power and
cooling, and lower costs to manage with time  and labor-saving
efficiencies. 

    "Our customers are looking to scale into a high availability system
instead  of a single-dedicated server that isn't fault tolerant," said
Lee Hansen,  chief executive officer of Dialectic Networks. "With our new
modular data center solutions,  Dialectic Networks helps companies scale
out to having redundant systems  either via private or public cloud
environments in a fully functional data  center from virtually anywhere
using the latest technology. By utilizing  open source software, the
savings to our customers are maximized and have  allowed us to become
'The Open, Cloud, and Containerized Data Center  Experts'."

    DN integrates the physical components, software, and infrastructure and 
offers implementation services for private/public/or hybrid cloud
computing  environments to its customers, including migration and
software management.  It generally recommends x86 servers and storage
from a full range of IBM  rack-mounted servers/blades, including
iDataPlex servers for increased  density and XIV storage for reliability
and power savings. The company also  specializes in complete server
virtualization solutions with open-source  software expertise.

    The new PMDC's can house up to 2,016 high-end, state-of-the-art servers
and  compatible storage in many flexible configurations in a single
container,  and additional containers can be integrated quickly as
needed. They come  with options for multiple carrier fiber connectivity,
appropriate data  center infrastructure including fully redundant
power/cooling and  environmental insulation and security, and are
available in deploy-ready  shipping containers of 20, 40, or 53 feet in
length to meet the demand of  rapidly growing IT infrastructure needs.

    About Dialectic Networks

    Dialectic Networks LLC (DN) is an IBM/System x reseller and IT Services 
Company of virtualized / cloud computing solutions and was one of the
first  IBM value-added resellers (VAR's) to offer a commercially
available  portable modular data center (PMDC) environment with cloud
computing  capabilities in North America. The company combines the
emergence and  convergence of the PMDC infrastructure with
virtualization, cluster  computing, and advanced management software --
building blocks for cloud  computing -- to revolutionize compute power
and storage solutions. With  over 30 years of combined experience in
leveraging open source solutions  for their customers, DN's focus is on
delivering exponential value to the  customer through the utilization of
these new technologies, creating a new  data center paradigm that drives
down costs while increasing performance in  the data center. For more

45 percent increase in use of investment service
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Chase today announced that its Health Savings Account (HSA) business has grown

million in deposits. Chase now has more than 500,000 account holders who hold
over $740 million in their HSAs.

health plans and by offering its HSA program directly to employers. Chase gained
700 new clients in 2009, ranging from Fortune 500 companies to small businesses
across the U.S.

Customers are taking advantage of the long-term savings benefit the HSA offers.
Chase saw a 45 percent increase in customers who began investing their balances
in one or more of the mutual funds offered through its investment program.

The bank developed a comprehensive adoption kit to help companies educate their
employees on how to take advantage of account features, maximize their tax

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) is likely to slash its chief executive's bonus from the record $67.9 million he got two years ago, but Lloyd Blankfein's pay package could still fuel criticism the bank has been "tone deaf" in its approach to the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efforts to deflect criticism and keep regulators at bay has already prompted Goldman to change its bonus strategy, curbing compensation in the fourth quarter of 2009 and eliminating cash bonuses for top managers, instead paying them in stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman still may face a storm of criticism when it announces the bonuses of its top executives even as it seeks to trim the headline numbers after a year of record profits. The announcement could come at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have made a number of moves to try to ameliorate the issues," said Alan Johnson, a Wall Street compensation consultant. "I would be shocked if it didn't have an impact on his and everybody else's total."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson estimated that Blankfein will get a bonus of more than $40 million for 2009, a year in which Goldman reported record earnings of $13.39 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would fall well below the $67.9 million he received in 2007. Blankfein took no bonus in 2008 during the worst of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Times of London reported on Monday that Blankfein could receive a bonus of up to $100 million, thumbing his nose at President Barack Obama and his recent crackdown on the banking industry. The newspaper cited bankers who were in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum as its sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman spokesman Lucas van Praag denied the report, calling it "speculative nonsense," although he acknowledged that Goldman's board had yet to make a final decision on executive compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate report in the Wall Street Journal said at least one unnamed London banker in Davos was willing to wager millions of pounds that Blankfein, a staunch defender of Wall Street, would be out of a job within two years -- an anecdote that van Praag called "effluent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SIDESTEPPING CONTROVERSY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reports on Blankfein and Goldman's quick retorts underscore the sensitivities at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Underneath that cool exterior, it is apparent that there is some very great sensitivity at Goldman about executive compensation these days," said Scott Tangney, a consultant with public relations firm Makovsky + Co, who added that he expects Goldman to pay Blankfein at a lower level than 2007 and other years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because of the government pressure and the public scrutiny, it has already forced Goldman to handle executive compensation in a very different way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman last month sidestepped controversy over its ballooning bonus pool by cutting off compensation after three quarters and giving $500 million to charity. Before the shift, Goldman was on pace to surpass its record payout of $20 billion in 2007. But the actual figure was $16.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While political pressure could affect high-profile executives like Blankfein, it leaves open the possibilities for outsized paydays for lesser-known executives and star traders who helped the firm set a record profit in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2008, when most of Wall Street was at death's door, 953 Goldman employees made at least $1 million apiece, according to a report by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo. There were 21 Goldman employees who made at least $8 million each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 2009, executives like David Heller, Harvey Schwartz, Edward Eisler, and Pablo Salame, all of whom lead units that oversee bond, stock, currency and commodity sales and trading, could see mega payouts after the firm reported $23.3 billion in revenues from fixed income, currency and commodities trading in 2009, up from $3.7 billion in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paydays for them of more than $20 million each would not be surprising, headhunters and recruiters said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Lipstein, a recruiter at Boyden Global Executive Search, said he would expect "a huge payout for their stars."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's bonuses are expected to come largely in stock rather than cash, following a trend on Wall Street to change pay designs and curb risk-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, those changes are likely to fall on deaf ears to an angry public focused on the big numbers, said Sarah Anderson, a fellow with the Institute for Policy Studies, which is critical of Wall Street, and co-author of the recent study "America's Bailout Barons."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are claiming to have made changes, but for the ordinary taxpayers who have contributed very much to the recovery of the markets, they aren't seeing it as substantial change," Anderson said. "They are seeing it as business as usual."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  CAMBRIDGE, MA, Feb 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
WebLayers, Inc. today announced new I.T. governance software for  IBM
WebSphere  MQ, the market leading messaging middleware. 

    Complementing the IBM  WebSphere middleware portfolio, the WebLayers
distributed governors for  IBM WebSphere MQ ensure that configuration and
deployment of customers'  messaging infrastructures are in accordance
with established guidelines and  best practices. This helps customers
more easily adhere to IT policies as  well as security and regulatory
compliance mandates.

    The new governors from WebLayers scan the IBM WebSphere MQ Queue Managers 
and related queues to better ensure that they are in compliance. This is
achieved through IT governance that enables users to gain a more 
comprehensive view of the way that the queue manager was configured and
to  mitigate potential risks before they expose the infrastructure to 
vulnerabilities such as security breaches or inaccurate data
transmissions.

    As a long-standing IBM Business Partner, WebLayers has developed an 
extensive library of policies dedicated to IBM middleware including more 
than 90 IBM WebSphere MQ policies that can also be extended throughout
the  infrastructure to include external third parties as well as
mainframe  environments. More specifically, the new WebLayers software
for IBM  WebSphere MQ comes with out-of-the-box policies for deploying
WebSphere MQ  Queue Managers, Transmission Queues, Channels and Messages.
Additional  features include the ability to create custom policies,
validate existing  services, and capture and display metrics related to
design time flaws and  policy violations using sophisticated data
analytics.

    "It's no secret that IBM WebSphere MQ is the preferred messaging
middleware  that dominates the financial services sector based on its
ability to  provide secure, guaranteed delivery of messages regardless of
the size and  complexity of the infrastructure," said Jeff Papows,
president and CEO,  WebLayers. "To help IBM maintain and extend this
position, WebLayers will  continue to commit resources in the best
interest of customers who want to  fortify their IBM-based middleware
through the value that automated  governance delivers in cost savings and
software development efficiencies."

    WebLayers software recognizes potential policy violations prior, during
or  post deployment to diffuse potential production issues. This helps 
customers proactively halt the proliferation of erroneous configurations 
that can compromise the integrity of IBM WebSphere MQ transactions and 
expose customers to risk.

    About WebLayers

    WebLayers provides the industry's most comprehensive I.T. governance 
platform available today. By centralizing and distributing policy 
management throughout the entire software life cycle on multiple IT
domains  including mainframes, WebLayers substantially reduces the costs
associated  with IT governance. WebLayers also offers the largest
collection of  industry-proven policies, including extensions for
industry standards  including insurance, manufacturing and finance, which
speeds governance  implementation and enforcement from design time
through production.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN JOSE, CA, Feb 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
SPYRUS today announced the Secure Pocket Drive, a new class of USB
encryption device pre-loaded with the Microsoft Windows Embedded Standard
2009 operating system. Secure Pocket Drive turns a commodity microSD card
into a militarized security device. Windows Embedded Standard 2009
delivers the power, familiarity, and reliability of the Windows operating
system in a componentized form, enabling mobile workers in the public
sector around the world to plug the Secure Pocket Drive into untrusted
home computers, kiosks, and public computers. The host PC supplies only
the keyboard, mouse, display, and a minimum of 512MB of RAM. The host
PC's hard drive is not even used, preventing data contamination or
leakage. Trusted Mobility(TM) in a pocket has arrived.

    "Microsoft is excited to work with SPYRUS and help organizations in the
public sector meet customer requests from around the world," said Ashwin
Kulkarni, senior product manager for Windows Embedded at Microsoft Corp.
"Leveraging Windows Embedded Standard 2009, SPYRUS' high-assurance Secure
Pocket Drive provides end users with secure access to vital information
when and where they need it."

    SPYRUS developed its first hardware-based pre-boot authentication system
for Windows over 10 years ago. Secure Pocket Drive builds on this system,
using advanced hardware security techniques to provide the most secure,
trusted operating environment for the mobile user, with nothing left
behind after the drive is removed. Secure Pocket Drive uses a patented
solution that includes a secure boot loader to authenticate and check the
integrity of the device using on-board hardware security, and it will not
boot the Windows Embedded Standard 2009 operating system if the device
has been tampered with. After pre-boot authentication, Secure Pocket
Drive loads the componentized Windows Embedded Standard 2009 and allows
access to the user's applications and data files. End users can safely
and securely perform multiple functions, including network/internet
browsing and scheduling in the Windows Embedded Standard 2009
environment. Because everything is running directly from the Secure
Pocket Drive, using untrusted and potentially malware-infected computers
is not an issue.

    The Secure Pocket Drive uses FIPS 140-2 Level 3 tamper-resistant epoxy
potting with built-in anti-tamper and self-destruct mechanisms to protect
against unauthorized access to the device and data. The protected sectors
of the device's memory, the Windows Embedded Standard 2009, and all data
and application files are encrypted with advanced, hardware-based XTS-AES
256-bit encryption, fully compliant with the newly approved NIST SB800-38E
security standard. Finally, Suite B On Board(TM) hardware security (ECDSA
P-384, EC-DH, AES-256, SHA-384) supports the full set of Suite B
cryptographic algorithms for all security services.

    Secure Pocket Drive can be customized to meet enterprise-specific
requirements. SPYRUS is able to deliver unprecedented scalable, flexible
solutions for portable data security for the remote or traveling user.
Secure Pocket Drive will be available pre-configured with 2GB, 4GB, 8GB,
or 16GB microSD cards.

    "SPYRUS has been working with Microsoft Windows Embedded for our secure
USB security device for several years," said Tom Dickens, Chief Operating
Officer for SPYRUS. "All security for the Secure Pocket Drive is designed,
developed, and manufactured in the U.S.A., mitigating risks from untrusted
parts entering the supply chain, a problem of increasing concern to
governments worldwide. The Secure Pocket Drive brings Security to the
Edge(TM) for a Windows Embedded Standard 2009-based operating environment
that is securely protected, self-contained, and portable, making it the
only truly secure Trusted Mobility(TM) solution to meet the growing
demands for protection in cyberspace."

    About SPYRUS, Inc.

    SPYRUS holds patents in the U.S. and abroad that enable solutions for
secure authentication, secure communication, and full disk encryption, as
well as patents relating to data protection and rights management for
digital content. Secured by SPYRUS(TM) security technology is designed,
developed, and manufactured in the USA to meet FIPS 140-2 standards.
SPYRUS products support the strongest commercially available cryptographic
algorithms, including elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), AES, and SHA-2,
collectively known as Suite B. In December 2007, the Hydra PC Personal
Encryption Device became the first, and as yet the only, commercially
available USB encryption device to be approved for protecting U.S.
Government tactical classified data at the Secret level and below, when
used in accordance with the approved operational security doctrine. SPYRUS
is headquartered in San Jose, California. See www.spyrus.com for more

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc, the world's biggest drugmaker, said it expects its China business to grow by at least 25 percent this year and is forging partnerships to increase its share of the nation's fast-growing pharmaceuticals market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"(Pfizer's business in) China is growing by 25 to 28 percent, while overall (growth) in emerging markets is 12 to 14 percent," Jean-Michel Halfon, Pfizer's president of emerging markets for its biopharmaceutical business, told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The market will continue to grow fast in China because of the growing middle-class population and, more importantly, healthcare reforms the Chinese government has implemented," Halfon said. "We anticipate very strong growth there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer identified China, Brazil, India, Mexico, Russia and Turkey as key emerging markets and regarded China as the most important. The company said it expected revenue in China to grow by at least 25 percent in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to do substantially better than that," said Allan Gabor, regional president for Pfizer's emerging markets in North Asia, Pakistan and Indochina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China is expected to become the world's third-largest pharmaceutical market by 2011, from ninth in 2003, according to prescription drug sales data provider IMS Health Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has a 2.2 percent share of China's highly fragmented pharmaceutical market, where multinationals compete with a staggering 6,000 domestic drugmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our market share will go up for sure because our commitment is to grow faster than the market average," said Gabor. "It will be higher than what it is today as we continue to execute our long-term strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, Pfizer said it planned to increase its presence in fast-growing underdeveloped markets and expected them to eventually yield solid profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TO EXPAND SALES TEAM, FORGE PARTNERSHIPS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it planned to increase its representatives in China -- many of them trained doctors -- by 39 percent to 3,200 in 252 cities by 2011, up from 2,300 in 177 cities last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These representatives would market Pfizer vaccines, anti-cancer drugs, anti-cholesterol medicine Lipitor, anti-hypertension drug Norvasc and antibiotic Zithromax, among other products, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are medical information specialists and they are for sure trained in biosciences when we hire them," Gabor said. "Many of them are doctors already and their job is to take the science and make it available and understandable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another strategy was forging partnerships with universities, medical associations, government agencies and other drugmakers to expand Pfizer's business, Halfon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is teaming up with Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd's to help sell the latter's blockbuster Actos diabetes drug in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Pfizer posted a disappointing profit and gave lackluster forecasts, with projected 2010 earnings below an average forecast by analysts, saying the strengthening dollar would crimp earnings. It underscored a generally uninspiring results season for the pharmaceutical industry, being squeezed by the loss of patent protection on many previous blockbuster drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have said big pharmaceutical players face a tougher time in 2010, following windfall profits in 2009 from a swine flu pandemic that has turned out to be less deadly than feared.&lt;/p&gt;

Pfizer's emerging markets in North Asia, Pakistan and Indochina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer has a 2.2 percent share of China's highly fragmented
pharmaceutical market, which apart from multinationals also

&lt;p&gt;IBM announced Wednesday that it plans to buy MDM (master data management) vendor Initiate Systems. Terms of the deal, which is scheduled to close in the first quarter, were not disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Master data refers to classes of information such as products or suppliers that are common to a number of systems and applications within a company. MDM software is used to make sure master data entities are kept consistent and accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initiate&#8217;s particular strengths lie in the health care and government sectors, IBM said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vendors have been moving to add MDM capabilities to their lineups. Just last week, IBM rival Informatica announced the acquisition of Siperian. IBM's move was not unexpected. Altimeter Group analyst Ray Wang recently predicted Big Blue would buy Initiate as a response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competitors responded quickly to IBM's announcement Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By acquiring a niche vendor like Initiate, they bolster their portfolio of industry-specific tools that help integrate data, but do little to provide a stronger information management platform for their customers," Kalido CEO Bill Hewitt said in a statement. "This acquisition will be delivered like so many others; with dozens of IBM global services consultants to 'knit' the patchwork of tools together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Informatica weighed in as well, stating it has "the unique advantage of remaining the vendor neutral provider" of MDM, as well as strong relationships with the world's top systems integrators. In addition, Siperian's software was already integrated with Informatica's, while IBM is pushing overlapping approaches to MDM "that seem sure to cause customer confusion," the statement claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a conference call Wednesday, an IBM executive painted the Initiate deal in decidedly rosier terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acquisition is "all about growth and synergy," said Arvind Krishna, general manager of information management at IBM. There are multiple styles of MDM that address different scenarios, and IBM expects customers will ultimately deploy more than one MDM system, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initiate Systems' technology includes a "strong and proven" customer data-integration platform as well as "best-in-class data de-duplication, security and privacy," Altimeter Group's Wang said in a blog post Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now IBM has to weave Initiate's technology into its other MDM platforms, which include offerings aimed at PIM (product information management) and CDI (customer data integration), Wang wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More acquisitions in the MDM space could follow, with potential buyers including EMC, Hewlett-Packard, SAP, Microsoft and Oracle, according to Wang. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MDM technology is becoming a foundational element of enterprise IT and vendors' software stacks, particularly as companies seek to tie their own systems and data to the broader Internet, he added in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I'm going to take a Twitter profile and tie that back to a customer account, I&#8217;m going to need some kind of MDM," he said. It's crucial as we move toward a social world."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next month, IBM will release a beta version of a software application designed to keep track of how information flows across different systems, sending alerts when source data has been altered or isn't properly ingested into some target system or report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A lot of our customers have had challenges monitoring the quality of information," said Steven Adler, IBM's program director for information governance. This new product will "help govern the use of information by people, which is totally dependent on operational awareness." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marketed under the company's InfoSphere line of data management software, the InfoSphere Business Information Monitor is designed to track how well data moves from databases to business intelligence or other enterprise software. It sends out RSS or e-mail alerts when something goes awry, said Michael Curry, IBM's director of strategy for information management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For instance, if there was a quality issue with a data feed that was received from upstream, [the software] would make sure the business person looking at the report actually understood that quality issues were there and that the information may not be as trustworthy as they thought," Curry said. "It is aware that the data in a report or process is actually linked back to a lot of points in an information supply chain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software is based off of real-time enterprise database-monitoring software developed by Waltham, Massachusetts-based Guardium, a company that IBM acquired last November. IBM Research labs also contributed some code to the final product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting up the software involves placing agents on database servers and other originating points of data. The software monitors these platforms for changes either to the data itself or to the underlying data structure. If a table is dropped, for instance, the software can alert the users of that database. An administrator predefines the metrics for measuring quality and for setting up alerts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software can monitor most relational databases, including IBM's DB2, Oracle, SQL Server and Sybase databases. It can monitor for data quality issues in data warehouses such as Teradata's, or any database accessible through the ODBC (Open Database Connectivity). It can also work with ERP (enterprise resource planning) software such as SAP's and Oracle's, as well as with many business intelligence platforms, including IBM's own Cognos, SAP's Business Objects, Oracle's Hyperion and other business intelligence applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM also plans to offer a software development kit that can be used to create custom agents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A preview of InfoSphere Business Information Monitor will be available in March, though IBM would not comment on when the final product would be available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also in line with its growing stable of information governance tools, IBM will release a second product next month, called Optim Data Redaction, that can automatically copy a set of documents and redact sensitive information, based on pre-chosen keywords. It will work on most popular office formats. IBM's Research arm created the software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM will release Optim Data Redaction in March. IBM did not provide the price for this software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help customers deploy information governance-driven systems, IBM has set up a virtual support team of consultants, called the IBM Global Business Services' Information Governance Center of Excellence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa Inc posted a stronger-than-expected profit on Wednesday, helped by rising debit card processing volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company's shares rose 2.6 percent in after-hours trading to $85.75, a stark contrast to a year ago, when it traded at $47.54.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weakness in the economy has spurred more U.S. consumers to pay using their debit cards instead of their credit cards, Visa executives said.

That translates to revenue in the quarter ended in December. Credit card payment volume was flat over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transaction volume in the quarter ended in December rose 14 percent, Visa said, which should translate to higher revenue next quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa said it expected annual net revenue growth of between 11 percent and 15 percent. In October, the company said it expected revenue in the lower end of that range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa, which does not lend at all, pulled off a record U.S. IPO almost two years ago as investors seized on its growth potential and lack of direct exposure to the global credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Dan Wilchins; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  TAMPA, FL, Feb 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Walter Energy (NYSE: WLT), a leading U.S. producer and exporter of
premium hard coking coal for the global steel industry, today reported
income from continuing operations of $33.3 million, or $0.62 per diluted
share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2009, compared to $97.0 million, or
$1.77 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2008.

    "Our premium hard coking coal business demonstrated its resilience last
year, as we produced and sold more of our Blue Creek coal in 2009 than in
2008, despite historic lows in global steel capacity utilization," said
Walter Energy Chief Executive Officer Victor P. Patrick. "As we look to
2010, we see significant upside potential as we expect to increase sales
to record levels and to achieve record average realized pricing."

    Fourth Quarter 2009 Financial Results

    Net sales and revenues for the fourth quarter 2009 totaled $236.3 million
compared to $365.5 million in the prior-year period. Operating income
totaled $36.9 million for the quarter, down $91.1 million versus the
prior-year period. Revenues were impacted by lower coking coal and
metallurgical coke pricing and sales volumes. Lower coking coal pricing
contributed to 43 percent of the decrease in revenues, while lower coking
coal volumes caused 44 percent of the decrease. In addition, approximately
61 percent of the decline in operating income resulted from lower coking
coal pricing, with the remainder primarily due to a decrease in coking
coal volumes.

    Fourth quarter 2009 results from continuing operations include pre-tax
charges of $4.5 million associated with the closure of Walter Coke's fiber
plant, completing the last transaction in the disposition of the Company's
non-energy businesses. Results for the quarter also included favorable tax
benefits of $9.7 million related to non-taxable Medicare Part D subsidies
and the favorable effect of a state tax rate change. Results in 2008
included a pre-tax credit of $26.9 million for a black lung excise tax
refund claim and a pre-tax charge of $32.4 million related to impairment
of Taft Coal Sales &amp; Associates' mineral interests.

    Full-Year 2009 Financial Results

    For the full year 2009, net sales and revenues were $966.8 million, a
decrease of $182.9 million versus the prior year. Approximately 52 percent
of the decrease is attributed to lower metallurgical coke pricing and
volumes, while the remainder is primarily due to lower coking coal pricing
and lower volumes. The variance in coking coal sales volumes was due to
lower sales of purchased coal.

    Total year operating income was $202.2 million, down $139.0 million versus
the prior year, primarily due to lower coking coal, metallurgical coke and
natural gas pricing and lower metallurgical coke volumes, with lower
pricing of these products making up 55 percent of the decrease in
operating income.

    Underground Mining

    Coking coal sales volumes were 1.4 million tons in the fourth quarter at
an average selling price of $126.48 per short ton FOB Port, versus 1.7
million tons at an average price of $167.19 in the prior-year period. The
lower sales volumes reflect the impact of approximately 200,000 tons of
coal that shipped in early January 2010 due to transportation delays in
December. Pricing in the fourth quarter 2009 includes the impact of 0.1
million tons at 2008-2009 carryover pricing of approximately $315 per
metric ton, while the sales in the prior-year period included 0.5 million
tons at that pricing level.

    Total coking coal production in the quarter was 1.4 million tons, down 0.4
million tons versus the prior-year period. Coking coal production at Mine
No. 4 totaled 0.6 million tons in the fourth quarter, down 0.1 million
tons compared to the prior year primarily due to a longwall move in the
current-year period. Mine No. 7 produced 0.7 million tons in the fourth
quarter, 0.3 million tons less than the fourth quarter last year, which
included the operation of two longwalls for the full period. The
current-year period reflects the operation of two longwalls for two weeks,
as the Mine No. 7 East Expansion longwall began in mid December.

    Average mine production costs for the period were $67.44 per ton, or
$15.16 higher than in the prior-year period. At No. 4, production costs
were $61.35 per ton, an increase of $9.76 per ton over the prior year.
Production costs at No. 7 were $72.36 per ton compared to $52.74 per ton
in the prior-year period. Production costs at both mines were higher than
in the prior-year period primarily as a result of reduced production
volumes.

    The natural gas business sold 1.4 billion cubic feet of gas at an average
price of $4.09 per thousand cubic feet in the fourth quarter 2009 compared
to 1.8 billion cubic feet an average price of $7.92 per thousand cubic
feet in the prior-year period.

    Surface Mining

    The surface mining segment reported net sales and revenues of $26.0
million in the fourth quarter 2009, compared to $24.1 million in the
prior-year period, primarily resulting from higher contract prices.
Operating income in the fourth quarter 2009 was $6.4 million, compared to
operating income of $3.4 million in the fourth quarter 2008, excluding
the impairment charge at Taft.

    Steam and industrial coal sales were 326,000 tons during the fourth
quarter compared to sales of 362,000 tons in the prior-year period.
Production totaled 300,000 tons in the fourth quarter versus prior-year
production of 348,000 tons, reflecting lower demand in the 2009 period.

    Walter Coke

    Walter Coke generated net sales and revenues of $37.4 million in the
fourth quarter 2009, compared to $48.4 million in the prior-year period.
Excluding the charge associated with the closure of Walter Coke's fiber
plant, the business generated $4.4 million in operating income in the
fourth quarter 2009 versus $12.2 million in the prior year. Lower revenue
and operating income compared to the prior-year period were driven by
reduced volume and pricing on lower domestic steel demand.

    Fourth quarter 2009 metallurgical coke sales were 88,317 tons at an
average price of $312.11 per ton. In the prior year, Walter Coke sold
97,927 tons at $391.28 per ton.

    Corporate and Other

    At Dec. 31, 2009, the Company had available liquidity of $401.6 million,
including cash of $165.3 million and $236.3 million available under its
credit facility. Total net debt outstanding at Dec. 31, 2009 was $11.2
million compared to $95.0 million at Sept. 30, 2009.

    Capital expenditures were $29.0 million in the fourth quarter, totaling
$96.3 million for the year.

    Walter Energy's business outlook includes the following:

Total coking coal sales are expected to total approximately 8.0
million tons in 2010. Pricing on all 2008-2009 carryover tons is at
original contract of approximately $315 per metric ton FOB Port
(approximately $286 per short ton FOB Port). Pricing on the 2009-2010
benchmark tons is at approximately $129 per metric ton FOB Port
(approximately $117 per short ton FOB Port). The remainder of coking coal
sales volume for 2010 is unpriced. Given the current market environment,
the Company expects to achieve record average realized pricing for the
year.

    Coking coal production is expected to total 1.7 to 1.8 million tons in the
first quarter, with production costs expected to average between $55 and
$60 per ton.

    Walter Coke should return to full capacity by the end of the first quarter
and expects full-year 2010 sales to total 380,000 - 400,000 tons. In
addition, returning to full production should improve cost leverage after
the first quarter.

    Walter Minerals expects to produce and sell 1.3 - 1.4 million tons of
steam and industrial coal in 2010, with all expected sales volumes priced.
Overall results for 2010 are expected to remain consistent with the
results in 2009.

    The Company expects 2010 full-year capital expenditures of approximately
$110 million, including maintenance capital of approximately $80 million.

(1) The Company recorded a $3.6 million restructuring and impairment charge
in the fourth quarter 2009 related to the closure of Walter Coke's fiber
plant.  In addition, inventory write-downs of $0.9 million are included in
cost of sales related to this closure, for total closure costs recognized
of $4.5 million. During the fourth quarter 2008, the Company recorded a
$32.4 million impairment charge related to mineral interests at Taft Coal
Sales &amp; Associates.

(2) Interest income in 2008 includes $17.1 million of interest on a Black
Lung Excise Tax refund claim.   Total amount of the claim recorded in 2008
was $26.9 million.  Of this amount, $23.2 million was received in 2009.

(3) In the fourth quarter 2009, the Company recognized two large, unusual
tax benefits resulting in a net tax benefit on pre-tax income.  The tax
benefits included (1) a permanent tax benefit of $5.9 million for
non-taxable OPEB Medicare Part D subsidies and (2) a $3.8 million net tax
benefit on certain deferred tax assets relating to a change in the
effective state tax rate resulting from the decision to move the Company's
headquarters to Birmingham, AL.  Excluding these items, the Company's
fourth quarter 2009 effective tax rate was 26.5%.  This rate is lower than
the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter 2008 primarily due to greater
benefits from permanent percentage depletion deductions in 2009.

(4) Discontinued operations includes the results of Financing, Homebuilding
and Kodiak Mining, Co. ("Kodiak"), for all periods presented.  On April 17,
2009, Financing was spun off to shareholders and merged with Hanover
Capital Mortgage Holdings, Inc., creating Walter Investment Management
Corporation, a publicly traded real estate investment trust.  The Company
announced the closure of its Homebuilding business in January 2009 and
continues to liquidate the remaining assets.  The Company's Kodiak mining
operations were closed in December 2008.

(5)Discontinued operations for 2008 includes a tax benefit of $167.0
million resulting from the deemed liquidation, for tax purposes, of the
Homebuilding group.

(1) The previous year's presentation has been revised to reflect a change
in reportable segments from Natural Resources to Underground Mining and
Surface Mining and to exclude Kodiak, Financing and Homebuilding which
are reported as discontinued operations. Underground Mining includes
the Company's deep underground metallurgical coal operations from the
No. 4 and No. 7 mines, and its natural gas operations.  Surface Mining
includes the operations of Tuscaloosa Resources, Inc., Taft Coal Sales
&amp; Associates and Walter Minerals.

(2) The Company recorded a $32.4 million impairment charge related to
mineral interests at Taft Coal Sales &amp; Associates during the 2008
fourth quarter.

(3) The Company recorded a $4.5 million charge in the 2009 fourth quarter
related to the closure of Walter Coke's fiber plant.

(4) The increase in the Operating Loss - Other in the fourth quarter 2009
as compared to the prior year period is primarily due to costs related
to the decision to relocate the Company's headquarters to Birmingham,
AL, as well as increased benefits costs, including pension and other
retirement benefits.

(1) The Company recorded a $3.6 million restructuring and impairment charge
in the fourth quarter 2009 related to the closure of Walter Coke's
fiber plant.  In addition, inventory write-downs of $0.9 million are
included in cost of sales related to this closure, for total closure
costs recognized of $4.5 million. During the fourth quarter 2008, the
Company recorded a $32.4 million impairment charge related to mineral
interests at Taft Coal Sales &amp; Associates.

(2) The effective tax rate for 2009 is significantly lower than the
effective tax rate in 2008 primarily due to an increase in benefits
from percentage depletion deductions, an increase in non-taxable OPEB
Medicare Part D subsidies earned, and an increase to certain deferred
tax assets relating to a change in the effective state tax rate
resulting from the decision to move the Company's headquarters to
Birmingham, AL.

(3) Discontinued operations includes the results of Financing,
Homebuilding and Kodiak Mining, Co. ("Kodiak"), for all periods
presented.  On April 17, 2009, Financing was spun off to shareholders
and merged with Hanover Capital Mortgage Holdings, Inc., creating
Walter Investment Management Corporation, a publicly traded real estate
investment trust.  The Company announced the closure of its
Homebuilding business in January 2009 and continues to liquidate the
remaining assets.  The Company's Kodiak mining operations were closed
in December 2008.

(4) Discontinued operations for 2008 includes a tax benefit of $167.0
million resulting from the deemed liquidation, for tax purposes, of
the Homebuilding group.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa Inc posted a stronger-than-expected profit on Wednesday, helped by rising debit card processing volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company's shares rose 2.6 percent in after-hours trading to $85.75, a stark contrast when it traded at a 52-week low a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa, operator of the world's largest credit and debit payment network, receives fees whenever consumers use one of its credit or debit cards. As consumers increasingly pay using plastic, the company's revenue rises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The operator of world's largest credit and debit payment network said quarterly profit was $763 million, or $1.02 a share, in its fiscal first quarter, ended Dec 31, compared with profit of $574 million, or 74 cents per class A share, in the same quarter a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That beat analysts' average forecast for earnings of 91 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue was $1.96 billion, compared with $1.74 billion in the same quarter a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue rose in part because payment volume on Visa debit cards for the quarter ended in September rose 8 percent to $268 billion.

 (Adds estimates, payment volume information)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Feb 3 (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) posted a
stronger-than-expected profit on Wednesday, helped by rising
debit card processing volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's shares rose 2.6 percent in after-hours
trading to $85.75, a stark contrast when it traded at a 52-week
low a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa, operator of the world's largest credit and debit
payment network, receives fees whenever consumers use one of
its credit or debit cards. As consumers increasingly pay using
plastic, the company's revenue rises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The operator of world's largest credit and debit payment
network said quarterly profit was $763 million, or $1.02 a
share, in its fiscal first quarter, ended Dec 31, compared with
profit of $574 million, or 74 cents per class A share, in the
same quarter a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That beat analysts' average forecast for earnings of 91
cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue was $1.96 billion, compared with $1.74 billion in
the same quarter a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue rose in part because payment volume on Visa debit
cards for the quarter ended in September rose 8 percent to $268
billion. That quarter translates to revenue in the quarter
ended in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa said it expected annual net revenue growth of between
11 percent and 15 percent. In October, the company said it
expected revenue in the lower end of that range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa, which does not lend at all, pulled off a record U.S.
IPO almost two years ago as investors seized on its growth
potential and lack of direct exposure to the global credit
crisis.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights RightNow Technologies (Nasdaq: RNOW) as the
Bull of the Day and AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) the Bear of the Day. In
addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on BP plc (NYSE: BP),
ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

RightNow Technologies (Nasdaq: RNOW) is a leading provider of on-demand customer
relationship management (CRM) software solutions designed to optimize customer
service operations for businesses of all sizes. 

Competition continues to increase with Oracle and SAP moving aggressively into
the on-demand customer relationship management market. However, RightNow
management also continues to expand the company's product reach. We also expect
margins to improve along with the growth of top line. 

Demand for the company's products remains strong despite the discontinuation of
recurring revenues. Our long-term recommendation for RightNow is OUTPERFORM. 

Bear of the Day: 

Our Underperform recommendation on AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) takes into
account the significant international presence of its fossil fuel power plants
in several emerging markets, thereby exposing it to both foreign currency and
political risk. 

The company's predominantly long-term contracts preempt any rate base growth in
the near term for its regulated utilities. Also, with lower electricity demand
due to a tepid global economy, the fate of spot wholesale markets is not
encouraging. 

As a result, we expect shares of AES Corporation to Underperform the broader
equity markets in general and the utilities and merchant generators in
particular. 

Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog: 

BP Misses on Refining Weakness

BP plc (NYSE: BP) reported its fourth quarter 2009 results of $1.37 per ADS
(American Depositary Share), below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.49, but
significantly above the year-earlier loss of $1.06. Weak downstream results,
partly offset by upstream strength, accounted for the earnings miss. 

More important than the earnings miss is the company`s relatively weak outlook
for oil and natural gas production in 2010, which is weighing on the share price
today in an otherwise positive day for the sector. The year-over-year
improvement reflected increased production volumes, improved oil prices and
stronger cost controls were the reasons behind the remarkable results. However,
these positives were partially offset by tumbled natural gas prices. 

BP`s quarterly earnings slipped by 8% in relation to the Zacks Consensus
Estimate. The company`s experience of earnings surprise for the preceding four
quarters varies between a negative 34.9% and a positive 54.1%, with the average
being positive of 9.6%. 

While the company`s refineries were working at a significantly higher rate, the
weak refining margin environment negatively affect BP`s results as with rivals
like ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX).

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Four free stock picks are being made available today on Zacks.com. The
industry`s leading independent research firm highlights one Zacks #1 Rank Strong
Buy or a Zacks #2 Rank Buy stock for each of the four main styles of investing:
Aggressive Growth, Growth &amp; Income, Momentum, and Value. 

The four highlighted picks are: Atheros Communications, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATHR), 3M
Co. (NYSE: MMM), Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) and Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:
WHR). 

Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Four daily picks

Zacks #1 Rank Stocks have nearly tripled the S 500 since 1988, producing an
average annual return of +26%. Performance has been notable even during volatile
and down times. For example, during the last bear market, 2000-2002, the market
tumbled -37.6% - but Zacks #1 Rank stocks gained +43.8%. 

Here is a summary of today's selected stocks that are now highly rated by Zacks:

Aggressive Growth -Atheros Communications, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATHR) 

Atheros Communications, Inc. analysts can not raise estimates fast enough
following the recent quarterly report. Despite missing estimates last quarter,
growth projections are in the double digits for the next few years.

How to Regularly Access Picks from the Zacks Rank Discovery for
Free:http://at.zacks.com/?id=88

Underlying the four free stock picks is a simple truth that first appeared in a
Financial Analysts Journal article published in 1979. Leonard Zacks, a Ph.D. in
Mathematics from M.I.T. found that "earnings estimate revisions are the most
powerful force impacting stock prices." Zacks #1 Rank is awarded to a stock when
analysts sharply upgrade their estimates of what the company will earn.

 (Updates to close)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Angela Moon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Feb 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks mostly fell on
Wednesday as Pfizer's disappointing outlook weighed on the
health sector, and President Obama's pledge to complete banking
and healthcare reform revived fears of increased regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; President Barack Obama reiterated his commitment to
overhaul the healthcare system and impose stricter regulatory
reforms on Wall Street, underscoring the political risk that
has driven U.S. stocks lower in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Political factors are definitely putting a cloud over the
market again, and (this) is probably going to put a lid on a
rally for awhile until we get some clarity on these reforms,"
said Scott Marcouiller, senior equity market strategist at
Wells Fargo in St. Louis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) fell 2.3 percent to close at $18.62,
leading a broad decline in several health-related sectors after
the world's biggest drugmaker's quarterly earnings missed
estimates and the company forecast profits below expectations.
For details see [ID:N02107070].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trucking companies' shares were hit after Ryder System Inc
(R.N) and C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc (CHRW.O) reported
weaker-than-expected profits. [ID:nN03150751] and
[ID:nSGE6110JK]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ryder tumbled 7.7 percent to end at $34.45, and C.H.
Robinson lost 6.8 percent to close at $53.54. The Dow Jones
transportation average .DJT lost 1.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI slipped 26.30
points, or 0.26 percent, to end at 10,270.55. The Standard 
Poor's 500 Index .SPX fell 6.04 points, or 0.55 percent, to
end at 1,097.28. But the Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC inched
up just 0.85 of a point, or 0.04 percent, to close at
2,190.91.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Expectations of more government scrutiny sparked fears that
corporate profits would be crimped, driving the SP 500 down
nearly 7 percent in the second half of January. But markets had
recovered with a two-day rally that began this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Nasdaq ended flat, but outperformed other indexes,
helped by major tech companies, including Apple Inc APPL.O
and Google (GOOG.O). Shares of Apple rose 1.7 percent to close
at $199.23 and Google gained 1.8 percent to $540.82.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Economic data also renewed concerns about lackluster
growth. The Institute for Supply Management's index showed the
U.S. services sector grew less than expected in January,
overshadowing an ADP Employer Services report that said job
losses in the private sector slowed in January. [ID:nN03361980]
[ID:nN03150829]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banking stocks dropped as concerns resurfaced about the
administration's intent to limit trading activities at some big
banks. Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which has a large trading arm,
fell 0.6 percent to $27.89. The KBW bank index .BKX slid 2.4
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Health insurers' stocks also fell, with Cigna Corp (CI.N)
down 1.4 percent at $34.76, and UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N)
off 2.1 percent at $33.32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Morgan Stanley Healthcare Payor Index .HMO fell 1.6
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MetLife Inc (MET.N) shares slid 4.3 percent to $34.80 as
the biggest U.S. life insurer faced a possible credit
downgrade, a day after the company confirmed it was in talks,
but it had not reached a deal to buy a unit of American
International Group Inc (AIG.N). [ID:nN03175264]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York-traded shares of Toyota Motor (7203.T) (TM.N)
slid 6 percent to close at $73.49 on the NYSE after the Obama
administration stepped up the pressure to address a range of
safety issues, deepening the crisis for the world's largest
automaker following its massive January recall of cars and
trucks due to faulty accelerator pedals. [ID:nSGE612025]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Total volume of 8.09 billion shares traded on the New York
Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, well
below last year's estimated daily average of 9.65 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by
a ratio of slightly more than 3 to 2, while on the Nasdaq,
about three stocks fell for every two that rose.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Top global drugmakers Pfizer Inc and Roche Holding AG posted disappointing profits and gave lackluster forecasts on Wednesday, sending their shares lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reports underscore a generally uninspiring results season for the pharmaceutical industry, which is being squeezed by the loss of patent protection on many previous blockbuster drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker, projected 2010 earnings below analysts' average forecast, saying the strengthening dollar would crimp earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also cut its profit and revenue forecasts for 2012, when it will face generic rivals to cholesterol medicine Lipitor. The U.S. patent on the world's top-selling drug lapses in November 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares fell 2.5 percent to $18.59, and weighed on the overall market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors "don't so much like seeing the guidance coming down but I think in the out year they have a good chance of exceeding that," said Tony Scherrer, portfolio manager at Smead Capital Management, which holds about 340,000 Pfizer shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roche missed full-year profit forecasts due to disappointing sales of key cancer drugs. The Swiss drugmaker confirmed its outlook for 2010 of double-digit earnings growth but said sales would rise at a mid-single-digit rate, which Bernstein analysts said was disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roche shares slipped 0.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, AstraZeneca Plc warned that earnings would fall this year and said it would slash an additional 8,000 jobs as it faces U.S. generic competition to two key drugs. U.S. drugmakers Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Eli Lilly and Co forecast 2010 earnings to rise in line with Wall Street estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PFIZER FALLS SHORT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York-based Pfizer reported for the first time quarterly results that included Wyeth, bought last year for $67 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have made steady progress. One day does not make a trend," Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio said in an interview, referring to Wednesday's decline in Pfizer shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer reported a fourth-quarter profit of $767 million, or 10 cents per share, compared with $266 million, or 4 cents per share, in the year-earlier period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 49 cents per share, a penny short of the average estimate of analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's revenue rose 34 percent to $16.5 billion, above Wall Street expectations of $15.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it expects full-year 2010 earnings of $2.10 to $2.20 per share. Analysts on average had expected $2.27 per share. The strengthening dollar, which weakens the value of overseas sales, will crimp earnings 6 cents per share more than Pfizer had expected, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 57 percent of Pfizer's $50 billion in revenue last year came from international markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall, Pfizer's business update was not what we hoped for since we assumed more flexibility on costs (primarily SGA), non-operating expense, and viewed potential share repurchase activity as upside," Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global Lipitor sales rose 1 percent in the quarter to $3.18 billion, as moderate U.S. declines were offset by gains overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of Lyrica -- used to treat seizures, nerve pain and fibromyalgia -- rose 17 percent to $820 million. Sales of impotence treatment Viagra rose 9 percent to $549 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer cut its 2012 revenue view to between $66 billion and $68.5 billion, from a forecast of $70 billion provided a year ago, in part due to a divestiture tied to the Wyeth deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its 2012 profit outlook was cut to between $2.25 and $2.35 per share, excluding special items. A year ago, it had forecast $2.42 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said the disappointing profit forecasts in 2010 and 2012 were largely due to unexpectedly high spending. But D'Amelio said increased spending to license products, as well as to market and advertise them, is essential to build sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are clearly spending, with all the capital discipline we always have, because we see opportunities to grow the business," D'Amelio said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ROCHE ALSO DISAPPOINTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roche is better placed than many of its rivals, given its limited exposure to generic competition, but it just missed on profit forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core earnings per share rose 10 percent in 2009 to 12.19 Swiss francs ($11.52), just behind the average forecast of 12.33 francs in a Reuters poll after big sellers Avastin, MabThera and Herceptin netted less than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers were working off surplus stock following its buyout of U.S. biotech group Genentech, hurting sales, but Roche expects that process to be finished by the end of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roche raised its 2010 sales forecast for flu drug Tamiflu to 1.2 billion from 700 million francs, in contrast to vaccine makers, who will now make less money than expected as the swine flu pandemic fades and countries cut orders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain's GlaxoSmithKline will report fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday and is expected to paint a picture of a difficult year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merck, which reports earnings on February 16, may stand out from peers with promising experimental drugs gained in its $41 billion purchase of Schering-Plough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Katie Reid and Sam Cage in Basel, Switzerland, and Ben Hirschler in London; editing by Maureen Bavdek, Gunna Dickson, Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Increased expenses hurt Pfizer's fourth-quarter earnings and are expected to weigh on results through 2012, but company Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio said responsible spending is helping build demand for its medicines in developed and emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We're clearly spending, with all the capital discipline we always have, because we see opportunities to grow the business," D'Amelio said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares fell as much as 3.3 percent on Wednesday after fourth-quarter earnings failed to match analysts' forecasts and the company projected results this year and in 2012 below expectations -- shortfalls that analysts ascribed largely to ramped up spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;D'Amelio cited fourth-quarter spending to license drugs and to advertise medicines used by U.S. primary care doctors, such as nerve-pain treatment Lyrica, and Lipitor -- the world's top-selling cholesterol fighter which begins facing generic competition in late 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We increased our marketing expenses in emerging markets," he said, with good results for Pfizer brands that didn't come from the company's recent purchase of Wyeth. "It's the first quarter where that unit had double-digit (sales) growth. Clearly we think the incremental investment contributed to that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We reported very strong double-digit growth in Brazil, Russia, India and China," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it expects spending this year of $19 billion to $20 billion for sales, general and administrative expenses, about $2 billion more than Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez had contemplated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;D'Amelio said Pfizer, the world's biggest drugmaker, believes the investments will pay off, as it strives to expand deeper into existing markets and enter new ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Relative to 2010 spending, the most important thing is that we see opportunities to invest in the business. We can grow not just in 2010, but in 2012 and beyond."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM announced Wednesday that it plans to buy MDM (master data management) vendor Initiate Systems. Terms of the deal, which is scheduled to close in the first quarter, were not disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Master data refers to classes of information such as products or suppliers that are common to a number of systems and applications within a company. MDM software is used to make sure master data entities are kept consistent and accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vendors have been moving to add MDM capabilities to their lineups. Just last week, IBM rival Informatica announced the acquisition of Siperian. IBM's move was not unexpected. Altimeter Group analyst Ray Wang recently predicted Big Blue would buy Initiate as a response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One MDM competitor responded quickly to IBM's announcement Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By acquiring a niche vendor like Initiate, they bolster their portfolio of industry-specific tools that help integrate data, but do little to provide a stronger information management platform for their customers," Kalido CEO Bill Hewitt said in a statement. "This acquisition will be delivered like so many others; with dozens of IBM global services consultants to 'knit' the patchwork of tools together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM executives are expected to discuss the deal further during a conference call Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(More to follow)&lt;/p&gt;

a penny short of the average estimate of analysts, according to
Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's revenue rose 34 percent to $16.5 billion, above
Wall Street expectations of $15.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it expects full-year 2010 earnings of
$2.10 to $2.20 per share. Analysts on average had expected
$2.27 per share. Pfizer said the strengthening dollar will
crimp earnings 6 cents per share more than it had expected, as
it weakens the value of overseas sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About 57 percent of Pfizer's $50 billion in revenue last
year came from international markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Overall, Pfizer's business update was not what we hoped
for since we assumed more flexibility on costs (primarily
SGA), non-operating expense, and viewed potential share
repurchase activity as upside," Leerink Swann analyst Seamus
Fernandez said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global Lipitor sales rose 1 percent in the quarter to $3.18
billion, as moderate U.S. declines were offset by gains
overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales of Lyrica -- used to treat seizures, nerve pain and
fibromyalgia -- rose 17 percent to $820 million. Sales of
impotence treatment Viagra rose 9 percent to $549 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer cut its 2012 revenue outlook to between $66 billion
and $68.5 billion, from an earlier forecast of $70 billion
provided a year ago, in part due to a divestiture tied to the
Wyeth deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its 2012 profit outlook was cut to between $2.25 and $2.35
per share, excluding special items. A year ago, it had forecast
$2.42 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have made steady progress. One day does not make a
trend," Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio said in an
interview, referring to Wednesday's sharp decline of Pfizer
shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Roche is better placed than many of its rivals, given its
limited exposure to generic competition, but it failed to
deliver for the bulls and just missed on profit forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Core earnings per share rose 10 percent in 2009 to 12.19
Swiss francs ($11.52), just behind the average forecast of
12.33 francs in a Reuters poll after big sellers Avastin,
MabThera and Herceptin netted less than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Customers were working off surplus stock of products
following its buyout of U.S. biotech group Genentech, hurting
sales, but this process was expected to be finished by the end
of 2009, Roche said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Roche raised its 2010 sales forecast for flu drug Tamiflu
to 1.2 billion from 700 million francs, in contrast to vaccine
makers, who will now make less money than expected as the swine
flu pandemic fades and countries cut orders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Britain's GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) will report
fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday and is expected to paint a
picture of a difficult year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merck (MRK.N), which reports earnings on Feb. 16, may stand
apart from the field because of promising experimental drugs
gained in its $41 billion purchase of Schering-Plough.

  (Updates to late morning)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Rodrigo Campos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Feb 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks declined on
Wednesday after disappointing results from Pfizer and transport
companies, while slower-than-expected expansion in the services
sector also weighed on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) fell 1.6 percent to $18.75 and led a
broad decline in several healthcare sectors after the world's
biggest drugmaker said quarterly earnings missed estimates and
forecast profits below expectations. For details see
[ID:N02107070].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Health insurers dropped, with Cigna Corp (CI.N) down 2.7
percent to $34.30, and UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) off 2.6
percent at $33.15. The Morgan Stanley Healthcare Payor Index
.HMO fell 1.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Logistics companies weighed on the transport sector after
Ryder System Inc (R.N) and C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc (CHRW.O)
reported weaker-than-expected profits. [ID:nN03150751] and
[ID:nSGE6110JK]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ryder fell 8.7 percent to $34.08, and C.H. Robinson tumbled
6.2 percent to $53.90, while the Dow Jones transportation
average .DJT lost 1.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are concerns about earnings in healthcare ... and
some of the policies that (the Obama administration is) looking
at," said Dennis Cajigas, senior market strategist at
Lind-Waldock in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A healthcare overhaul has stalled in the U.S. Congress
afterDemocrats lost the Senate seat in Massachustts,  injecting
uncertainty about the extent and strength of any reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Until Wednesday's open, the SP healthcare index .GSPA
ranked as the best performing sector in the SP 500 so far this
year. The index was off 1.3 percent on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 23.51 points,
or 0.23 percent, to 10,273.34. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index
.SPX dropped 4.95 points, or 0.45 percent, to 1,098.37. The
Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC lost 1.23 points, or 0.06
percent, to 2,188.83.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Institute for Supply Management said its services index
rose to 50.5 in January from 49.8 in December, below the 51.0
median forecast of economists surveyed by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A report by ADP Employer Services showed the pace of U.S
job losses in the private sector slowed in January, as
employers reported the smallest payroll decline in nearly two
years. [ID:nN03150829]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The closely watched government jobs report due Friday is
expected to show continued improvement in U.S. employment.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said Tuesday it is looking into battery problems apparently affecting Windows 7 notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users have complained of battery issues -- including premature warnings that the power is exhausted, as well as more dire demands to replace the battery -- for months, long before Windows 7 went final.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft claimed that the problem was in the Windows 7 tool that decided when the battery had been drained, or was unable to hold a charge. "We are investigating this issue in conjunction with our hardware partners, which appears to be related to system firmware (BIOS)," a Microsoft spokeswoman said today, referring to the firmware that boots the PC and initializes the hardware components. "The warning received in Windows 7 uses firmware information to determine if battery replacement is needed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very long thread on Microsoft's support site dedicated to Windows 7 battery problems kicked off in early June 2009, and remains active; more than a dozen new messages were posted on Tuesday, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some users on that thread agree with Microsoft that the warnings are spurious, others believe that the new operating system has permanently crippled their batteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have tried charging the battery while the computer is off or in another OS, and it does not work," said someone identified as "DanLee81" today. "It will charge for a few minutes, then stop. The battery will say it's full when it actually only has a few minutes of charge, and when you take out the A/C, it will either last for a few minutes, or completely shut off your laptop. This behavior happens in all [OSes] after Windows 7 damages the battery, not just within Windows 7."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others reported that their batteries underperformed, even after they abandoned Windows 7 and returned their notebooks to running Windows XP or Vista, or switched to Linux . "Rolling back does not work either," said "Dreklia" in another message on Tuesday. "I feel rip[ped] off!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, Windows 7 claimed that brand new notebooks were unable to hold a charge. "Until yesterday it used [to] state that I had 7 hours battery life after a full charge; today after a full charge, it states that I have 4 hours left," said "tigger1962" of a three-week-old Toshiba Satellite T110. "I've only had it on now 15 minutes and my charge has now gone down to 2 hours 24 minutes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users reported a wide variety of affected makes and models, including laptops from Acer, Dell , Hewlett-Packard, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laptop owners are not the only ones who have noticed battery irregularities in Windows 7. Last summer, reviewers for several publications and sites said that Windows 7 slashed battery life by almost a third when compared to XP. That ran counter to Microsoft's promise that Windows 7 would actually increase battery endurance .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it was looking for a common cause to the battery complaints. "We are working with our partners to determine the root cause and will update the [support] forum with information and guidance as it becomes available," the spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, ONTARIO, Feb 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Honourable Vic Toews, Minister of Public Safety, made the following
statement today in response to the seizure of approximately 34 kilograms
of cocaine at the Huntingdon Border Crossing by Canada Border Services
Agency (CBSA) and the arrest by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)
Federal Drug Enforcement Branch of an individual allegedly involved in
drug trafficking.

    "I would like to commend the work of the CBSA and RCMP in the cocaine
seizure and arrest at the Huntingdon Border," said Minister Toews. "By
working together, these law enforcement agencies are keeping drugs off of
our streets and out of our communities.

    Our Government established the National Anti-Drug Strategy and invested
$102 million over five years to help law enforcement to combat the
production and distribution of illegal drugs.

    We have also taken steps against organized crime, gangs, illegal guns and
drugs including:

    - investing $400 million over five years for a Police Officer Recruitment
Fund;

    - hiring over 1,500 new RCMP;

    - supporting programs to prevent youth from joining gangs; and

    - passing legislation cracking down on serious gun crimes and murders
connected to organized crime.

    Our message is clear - the production, trafficking and distribution of
illegal drugs in our communities will not be tolerated. We are committed
to giving law enforcement the tools they need to keep our communities
safe."

announced the addition of the "Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. - SWOT Framework
Analysis" company profile to their offering. 

SWOT Analysis, is a strategic planning tool used to evaluate the Strengths,
Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats involved in a project or in a business
venture. It involves specifying the objective of the business venture or project
and identifying the internal and external factors that are favorable and
unfavorable to achieving that objective. 

The aim of any SWOT analysis is to identify the key internal and external
factors that are important to achieving the objective. SWOT analysis groups key
pieces of information into two main categories: 

Internal factors - The strengths and weaknesses internal to the organization.
External factors - The opportunities and threats presented by the external
environment. 

The internal factors may be viewed as strengths or weaknesses depending upon
their impact on the organization's objectives. What may represent strengths with
respect to one objective may be weaknesses for another objective. The factors
may include all of the 4P's; as well as personnel, finance, manufacturing
capabilities, and so on. The external factors may include macroeconomic matters,
technological change, legislation, and socio-cultural changes, as well as
changes in the marketplace or competitive position. The results are often
presented in the form of a matrix.

&lt;p&gt;Feb 3 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs added McDonald's Corp
(MCD.N) to its Americas conviction buy list, saying it expects
earnings growth at the company in 2010, driving multiple
expansion and share outperformance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Shares of McDonald's were up nearly 3 percent at $64.79 in
trading before the bell Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an environment where discounting is crucial in boosting
traffic, McDonald's offers a rare combination of positive
same-store sales and accelerating margin gains, Goldman wrote
in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The sustainability and degree of these earnings drivers
are underappreciated in consensus estimates in our view,"
Goldman added, and it raised its price target on the stock by
$2 to $75.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, Goldman removed CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N) from
the list on valuation, but kept its "buy" rating on the stock,
saying it continues to see solid upside over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of CVS were down marginally at $33.10 in pre-market
trade.

 (Adds product sales, lowered 2012 forecasts)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) posted
fourth-quarter earnings slightly below analysts' expectations
and gave a disappointing forecast for 2010 and 2012, sending
its shares down nearly 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's biggest drugmaker said on Wednesday that
quarterly profit rose to $767 million, or 10 cents per share,
from $266 million, or 4 cents per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 49 cents per share.
Analysts on average had expected 50 cents, according to Thomson
Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue rose 34 percent to $16.5 billion, above Wall Street
expectations of $15.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, which completed its $67 billion purchase of Wyeth
in October, said the results included 2.5 months of the
acquisition's sales in the United States and 1.5 months from
overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer forecast full-year 2010 earnings of $2.10 to $2.20
per share. Analysts on average had expected $2.27, according to
Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said the strengthening dollar, which reduces
the value of overseas sales, would crimp earnings this year 6
cents per share more than it had expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said it expected revenue this year of $67 billion to
$69 billion, roughly in line with Wall Street's forecast of
$67.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the company cut its 2012 revenue outlook to between $66
billion and $68.5 billion, from an earlier forecast of $70
billion provided a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said it trimmed the forecast because it has sold off
about half of Wyeth's Fort Dodge U.S. animal health business,
folded Pfizer's HIV drug business into a venture with
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and returned Wyeth's rights to a
constipation drug being developed by Progenics Pharmaceuticals
Inc (PGNX.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In view of the lowered revenue projection, Pfizer said it
was cutting its 2012 profit outlook to between $2.25 and $2.35
per share, excluding special items. A year ago, it had forecast
$2.42 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Pfizer were down 2.7 percent at $18.72 in trading
before the market opened.

&lt;p&gt;Feb 3 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded Dick's Sporting
Goods Inc (DKS.N) to "buy" from "neutral," saying the retailer
offers good unit growth prospects and the stock's valuation
provides an attractive entry point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Dick's Sporting has solid free cash flow for a growth
retailer and is effectively reducing its net debt balance, a
move that will position it to fund store build-outs as landlord
financing remains tight, Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Fassler
wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dick's Sporting remains a best-in-class merchant, with  the
ability to manage inventory deftly, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst expects gross margin recovery in 2010 as the
firm cycles investment in its Golf Galaxy clearance. The severe
margin pressure associated with clearance and merchandise
repositioning is essentially complete, Fassler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fassler, who has a price target of $27 on the stock, said
the sporting goods retailer's decision to reinvest in
infrastructure is reflected in his forecasts, which stand above
consensus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We could see further upside to our 2010 projection," he
added.

&lt;p&gt;New Restaurant Slated to Open in Late 2010
DALLAS--(Business Wire)--
Pollo Campero, an international Latin chicken quick-service restaurant chain,
has partnered with franchisee Levy Campero to deliver a new restaurant concept
in Downtown Disney&#174; Marketplace at Walt Disney World&#174; Resort. The restaurant
will feature Pollo Campero`s signature Latin chicken, as well as a new
restaurant concept featuring fresh, healthy food. 

"This is an exciting opportunity for Pollo Campero to introduce its famous
chicken, along with our newest fresh restaurant concept of salads and wraps, to
visitors from all over the world," said Adam Cummis, president of Levy Campero.
"We are thrilled to collaborate with one of the strongest brands in the world to
showcase our Latin delicacies and look forward to a long working relationship." 

Walt Disney World guests will be able to savor combinations of freshly prepared
Campero Latin chicken, unique, flavorful side dishes such as yuca fries and
sweet plantains, and Latin drinks including horchata and tamarindo. The menu
also will include nutritious and delicious meals such as chef-prepared salads,
sandwiches and wraps using simple recipes derived from only the freshest
ingredients. 

"We`re pleased to offer this new Latin-style restaurant to our guests at
Downtown Disney," said Keith Bradford, vice president of Downtown Disney. "Its
diversity of offerings and well-balanced options are the perfect addition to our
current blend of dining experiences." 

"For decades, Walt Disney World has introduced its guests to rich cultural
experiences," said Juan Jose Gutierrez, chief executive officer of Pollo
Campero. "We will build on the park`s rich cultural heritage, helping visitors
discover the unique tastes and togetherness of family-style Latin dining." 

Pollo Campero`s food is freshly prepared each day. Fried and grilled chicken is
marinated, sending the distinctive Campero flavor all the way to the bone. Fried
chicken is hand-breaded in seasoned flour and slowly pressure-cooked without
trans-fats, resulting in a flavorful and juicy meal. Grilled chicken features
the taste of lime and orange juices, red bell peppers, and a special blend of
Latin herbs and spices. The new fresh concept menu will feature fresh salads,
sandwiches, fruits, and healthy snacks, as well as vegetarian, gluten-free,
sugar-free, low-sodium or organic offerings. 

This new family-oriented location at one of America`s beloved destinations -
Walt Disney World - exemplifies Pollo Campero`s drive to become one of the top
50 quick-service restaurant brands in the United States. Pollo Campero has spent
decades building a brand while retaining the values and service of a family-run
business. By combining its efforts with Levy Campero, Pollo Campero has opened
new doors including the expansion into Walt Disney World Resort.

&lt;p&gt;World`s Best-Selling Microsoft Security Appliances Undergo Complete Refresh
FREMONT, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Celestix Networks has released their flagship MSA series security appliances
with Microsoft`s new Forefront Threat Management Gateway 2010 (TMG) and with
complete refreshes of Celestix` appliance hardware platforms and Celestix
appliance engine software. 

Celestix reengineered their MSA series security appliances to integrate with
Microsoft`s 64-bit TMG software and Windows Server 2008 operating system. TMG
provides the strong flexibility its predecessor ISA Server 2006 did by
supporting deployment scenarios for application-layer firewall, proxy and
caching. In addition to these features, TMG has new features including built-in
URL filtering, web anti-virus/anti-malware support, HTTPS inspection
capabilities, and vulnerability-based intrusion detection/prevention. Microsoft
has also added enhanced support for array management, load balancing and ISP
redundancy. 

The new MSA appliances also introduce Celestix` next-generation Comet appliance
engine software. Celestix reengineered their appliance engine from the ground up
to deliver the fully integrated appliance experience familiar to existing
Celestix customers. Comet takes full advantage of the new 64-bit architecture to
provide datacenter-ready features such as a web user interface (for headless
operation), integrated save/restore of Last Good Version (for disaster
recovery), and a rebuilt software update engine to provide a comprehensive view
of patching. 

Celestix reengineered their new 6th-generation hardware platforms to maximize
the performance of Microsoft`s 64-bit Windows 2008 OS and TMG 2010 with added
processing power and memory. For smaller customers or branch offices, Celestix
is introducing the Scorpio X4 platform which will support the increased content
filtering requirements of small businesses. Enterprise customers will welcome
the throughput-centric Hydrus H2 platform, which will enable Fortune 1000
datacenter environments. As much as sheer power and throughput are often coveted
by network administrators, Celestix continues to strike the right balance of
power, security and economy by minimizing space and power requirements while
producing its trademarked sleek, elegant appliance design. 

"We`ve taken the years of experience and expertise invested in Microsoft
security and streamlined each individual component in our new MSA appliances.
The new features that Microsoft Forefront Threat Management Gateway 2010
provides (such as URL filtering and anti-malware) gave us the perfect product
with which to showcase our new platforms," said Neil Matz, Celestix vice
president of product management.

favorably impacted by approximately $3.3 billion, or 7%, due to the addition of
the legacy Wyeth products, $247 million, or 1%, due to legacy Pfizer products,
and unfavorably impacted by $1.8 billion, or 4%, due to foreign exchange. U.S.
revenues were $21.7 billion, an increase of 7% compared with full-year 2008.
International revenues were $28.3 billion, an increase of 1% compared with last
year, and reflected 8% operational growth and a 7% unfavorable impact of foreign
exchange. U.S. revenues represented 43% compared with 42% of the total last
year, and international revenues represented 57% compared with 58% of the total

* Calculation not meaningful 

For fourth-quarter 2009, revenues from Biopharmaceutical were $14.6 billion, an
increase of 30% compared with $11.2 billion in the year-ago quarter.
Operationally, revenues increased $2.9 billion, or 26%, of which $2.5 billion,
or 22%, was attributable to legacy Wyeth products, primarily Premarin in the
Primary Care unit, Enbrel and Prevnar in the Specialty Care unit, Effexor in the
Established Products unit as well as Enbrel and Prevenar in the Emerging Markets
unit. Additionally, the favorable impact of foreign exchange increased revenues
by 4% or $419 million. 

For fourth-quarter 2009, revenues from Diversified were $1.8 billion, an
increase of 83% compared with $1.0 billion in the year-ago quarter.
Operationally, revenues increased $778 million, or 78%, of which $764 million,
or 77%, was attributable to legacy Wyeth products, primarily Centrum, Advil and
Robitussin in Consumer Healthcare and certain Nutrition products. Additionally,
the favorable impact of foreign exchange increased revenues by 5% or $45
million. 

Reported Net Income(1)and Reported Diluted EPS(1)

For fourth-quarter 2009, Pfizer posted reported net income(1) of $767 million,
an increase of 188% compared with $266 million in the prior-year quarter, and
reported diluted EPS(1) of $0.10, an increase of 150% compared with $0.04 in the
prior-year quarter. Results for fourth-quarter 2009 compared with the same
period in 2008 were favorably impacted by increased revenues as well as the
non-recurrence of the pre-tax and after-tax charge of $2.3 billion in the
year-ago quarter related to the resolution of certain investigations concerning
Bextra and various other products in addition to the favorable impact of lower
costs incurred in connection with our cost-reduction initiatives in 2009. These
factors were largely offset by significant purchase accounting adjustments and
acquisition-related costs associated with the Wyeth acquisition. In addition,
the effective tax rate in fourth-quarter 2009 was favorably impacted by the tax
benefits related to the sale of one of our biopharmaceutical companies, Vicuron
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and the jurisdictional mix of certain expenses incurred
in connection with the acquisition of Wyeth. The fourth-quarter 2008 effective
tax rate was negatively impacted by the unfavorable tax implications of the
aforementioned charge related to Bextra and various other products. 

For full-year 2009, Pfizer posted reported net income(1) of $8.6 billion, an
increase of 7% compared with $8.1 billion last year, and reported diluted EPS(1)
of $1.23, an increase of 3% compared with $1.20 in 2008. These results were
impacted by increased revenues and the aforementioned fourth-quarter factors as
well as the non-recurrence of a $640 million after-tax charge related to the
resolution of certain litigation involving the Company`s non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory pain medicines in third-quarter 2008. These factors were
partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and higher net
interest expense. Additionally, the effective tax rate on reported results
increased to approximately 20% in full-year 2009 from approximately 17% in
full-year 2008, primarily due to the increased tax cost associated with certain
business decisions executed to finance the Wyeth acquisition. 

Additionally, reported diluted EPS(1) in fourth-quarter and full-year 2009 was
impacted by the increased number of shares outstanding in comparison with the
corresponding periods in 2008 resulting primarily from shares issued to
partially fund the Wyeth acquisition. 

Adjusted Income(2) and Adjusted Diluted EPS(2)

Fourth-quarter 2009 adjusted income(2) was $3.8 billion, a decrease of 13%
compared with $4.4 billion in the year-ago quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS(2)
was $0.49, a decrease of 25% compared with $0.65 in the year-ago quarter. For
full-year 2009, adjusted income(2) was $14.2 billion, a decrease of 13% compared
with $16.4 billion in full-year 2008, and adjusted diluted EPS(2) was $2.02, a
decrease of 17% compared with $2.42 in the prior year. Both adjusted income(2)
and adjusted diluted EPS(2) were favorably impacted by higher revenues and
negatively impacted by increased expenses, primarily due to the addition of the
legacy Wyeth operations and increased investment in high-growth and in-line
product opportunities, as well as higher net interest expense and an increase in
the effective tax rate on adjusted income(2). 

The effective tax rate on adjusted income(2) increased to approximately 28% in
fourth-quarter 2009 from approximately 24% in fourth-quarter 2008, and to
approximately 30% in full-year 2009 from approximately 22% in full-year 2008,
primarily due to the increased tax cost associated with certain business
decisions executed to finance the Wyeth acquisition. In addition, the effective
tax rate on adjusted income(2) for full-year 2008 was positively impacted by a
favorable income tax adjustment. 

Additionally, adjusted diluted EPS(2) in fourth-quarter and full-year 2009 was
impacted by the increased number of shares outstanding in comparison with the
corresponding periods in 2008 resulting primarily from shares issued to
partially fund the Wyeth acquisition. 

In fourth-quarter 2009, adjusted cost of sales(2) as a percentage of revenues
was 17.5% compared with 11.7% in fourth-quarter 2008. For full-year 2009,
adjusted cost of sales(2) as a percentage of revenues was 15.4% compared with
14.6% in full-year 2008. These increases primarily reflect the change in the mix
of products and businesses as a result of the Wyeth acquisition. Excluding the
impact of foreign exchange, adjusted cost of sales(2) as a percentage of
revenues was 14.4% in fourth-quarter 2009 and 14.8% in full-year 2009. 

Adjusted SI expenses(2) were $5.3 billion in fourth-quarter 2009, an increase
of 52% compared with $3.5 billion in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted SI
expenses(2) were $14.7 billion in full-year 2009, an increase of 4% compared
with $14.0 billion in the prior year. These increases were attributable to the
addition of the legacy Wyeth operations and increased investment in high-growth
and in-line product opportunities. Foreign exchange increased fourth-quarter
2009 adjusted SI expenses(2) by $135 million compared with the year-ago
quarter, and decreased full-year 2009 adjusted SI expenses(2) by $385 million
compared with full-year 2008. 

Adjusted R expenses(2) were $2.8 billion in fourth-quarter 2009, an increase
of 27% compared with $2.2 billion in the prior-year period. For full-year 2009,
adjusted R expenses(2) were $7.7 billion, an increase of 3% compared with $7.5
billion in the prior year. These increases were attributable to the addition of
the legacy Wyeth operations, continued investment in the late-stage development
portfolio and business-development transactions in the Established Products
unit. Foreign exchange increased fourth-quarter 2009 adjusted R expenses(2) by
$17 million compared with the year-ago quarter, and decreased full-year 2009
adjusted R expenses(2) by $145 million compared with full-year 2008. 

Overall, foreign exchange increased adjusted total costs(13) by $720 million, or
10%, in fourth-quarter 2009 compared with the prior-year period. For full-year
2009, foreign exchange decreased adjusted total costs(13) by $520 million, or
2%, compared with the prior year. 

As announced in January 2009, Pfizer implemented a cost-reduction program that
is expected to achieve cost savings of approximately $3 billion, at 2008 average
foreign exchange rates, compared with 2008 adjusted total costs(13) of $28.6
billion. Approximately $1 billion of these savings is anticipated to be
reinvested in the business, resulting in an expected $2 billion net cost
reduction. Additionally, as a result of the Wyeth acquisition, Pfizer expects to
generate synergies of approximately $4 billion, which is expected to result in
$2 to $3 billion in net cost savings after reinvestment in the business. In the
aggregate, Pfizer expects to generate gross cost reductions of approximately $7
billion, resulting in net cost reductions of approximately $4 to $5 billion, by
the end of 2012, at 2008 average foreign exchange rates, in comparison with the
2008 pro-forma adjusted total costs(13) of Pfizer and the former Wyeth
operations. For full-year 2009, operational improvements resulting from the
Pfizer stand-alone cost-reduction initiatives resulted in a decrease in adjusted
total costs(13) of approximately $200 million, despite significant
fourth-quarter 2009 investment in many high-growth and in-line product
opportunities, including business-development transactions in the Established
Products unit and incremental promotional efforts in the U.S. and emerging
markets, among other items. The operational improvements were driven partially
by the reduction in workforce as well as manufacturing and research and
development site exits. At the closing of the Wyeth acquisition, the combined
workforce totaled approximately 120,700, an increase from the Pfizer stand-alone
workforce of approximately 75,100. As of year-end 2009, the workforce was
approximately 116,500, a decline of 4,200 since the closing on October 15, 2009.


Executive Commentary

"During the fourth quarter, we closed the Wyeth acquisition and immediately
began the integration of our operations, advancing the transformation of the
company," stated Jeff Kindler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We are
pleased with the rapid pace of the integration and our ability to quickly
realize the benefits of our combined organization." 

"Our results this quarter clearly demonstrate the ability of our colleagues to
remain focused and deliver solid operational performance, while working to close
the Wyeth acquisition and to ensure a successful integration," Kindler
continued. "We remain excited about our more diverse in-line product and
pipeline portfolio, which we expect will result in improved opportunities for
the company in 2010 and beyond." 

Frank D`Amelio, Chief Financial Officer, stated, "Our 2010 financial guidance
and 2012 financial targets balance the achievement of our projected cost
reductions, including from the integration of Wyeth, with the expected increased
investment to drive longer-term, top and bottom line performance. These goals
reflect our continued confidence in the business and our ability to capitalize
on near- to mid-term growth opportunities through a meaningful reallocation of
investment. Additionally, our 2012 targets assume a modest level of planned
business-development activities."

2012 Financial Targets

Pfizer has also provided financial targets for 2012. Given the longer-term
nature of these targets, they are subject to greater variability and less
certainty as a result of potential material impacts related to foreign exchange
fluctuations, macroeconomic activity including inflation, industry-specific
challenges including changes to government healthcare policy, among others. In
comparison with the targets previously provided on January 26, 2009, these
updated targets reflect the impact of the completed and pending divestitures of
Animal Health assets as required by regulatory authorities in connection with
their approvals of the Wyeth acquisition, the shift in revenues for human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) products to the joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline
plc (ViiV Healthcare Limited) and the elimination of Relistor revenues due to
Wyeth`s return of its rights to the licensor, which in the aggregate reduced the
revenue target by approximately $1.5 billion. 

For 2012, at current exchange rates(14), Pfizer is targeting reported revenue
between $66.0 to $68.5 billion, reported diluted EPS(1) between $1.58 and $1.73
and adjusted diluted EPS(2) between $2.25 and $2.35. Adjusted R expenses(2)
are targeted to be between $8.0 to $8.5 billion, adjusted operating margin(2) is
projected to be in a range of the high 30%s to low 40%s and adjusted other
(income)/deductions(2) are targeted to be between $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion
in deductions. The effective tax rate on adjusted income(1) is targeted at
approximately 30% while the operating cash flow is expected to be at least $19.0
billion.

        Certain amounts and percentages may reflect rounding adjustments.                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                  
 1.     The above financial statements present the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. Subsidiaries operating outside the United  
        States are included for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended November 30 of each year. Wyeth's results are included in our consolidated financial statements    
        commencing from the acquisition date of October 15, 2009, in accordance with Pfizer's domestic and international year-ends. Therefore, our 2009 results of operations     
        include approximately two-and-a-half months of the fourth calendar quarter of 2009 in the case of Wyeth`s U.S. operations and approximately one-and-a-half months of the  
        fourth calendar quarter of 2009 in the case of Wyeth`s international operations. Cost of sales for 2009 includes the significant impacts of purchase accounting           
        adjustments associated with inventory acquired from Wyeth that was sold in 2009. Amortization of intangible assets for 2009 includes the amortization of intangible assets 
        acquired from Wyeth since the acquisition date.                                                                                                                           
 2.     On January 1, 2009, we adopted the provisions of a new accounting standard that provides guidance for the accounting, reporting and disclosure of noncontrolling          
        interests, previously referred to as minority interests. The adoption of these provisions resulted in reclassifications of prior-period amounts to conform to the fourth  
        -quarter and twelve-month 2009 presentations, primarily related to the presentation of noncontrolling interests.                                                          
 3.     In 2009, we recorded $68 million of Acquisition-related in-process research and development charges (IPR) due to the resolution of a contingency associated with our    
        2008 acquisition of CovX. During 2008, we expensed $633 million of IPR, primarily related to our acquisitions of Serenex, Inc., Encysive Pharmaceuticals, Inc., CovX,   
        Coley Pharmaceutical Group, Inc. and a number of animal health product lines from Schering-Plough Corporation, as well as two smaller acquisitions related to Animal      
        Health. As a result of adopting the provisions of a new accounting standard for business combinations, for acquisitions completed after January 1, 2009, we record        
        acquired IPR on our consolidated balance sheet as indefinite-lived intangible assets.                                                                                   
 4.     Amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets that contribute to our ability to sell, manufacture, research, market and distribute our products is included  
        in Amortization of intangible assets as these intangible assets benefit multiple business functions. Amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets that are  
        associated with a single function is included in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses or Research and development expenses, as appropriate.  
 5.     Other (income)/deductions--net for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2009 includes a gain related to ViiV Healthcare Limited, a newly formed joint venture with     
        GlaxoSmithKline plc, which is focused solely on research, development and commercialization of HIV medicines. The full year ended December 31, 2008, includes charges of  
        approximately $900 million, recorded in the third quarter of 2008, associated with the resolution of certain litigation involving our non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain 
        medicines, and charges of approximately $2.3 billion, recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008, resulting from an agreement-in-principle to resolve previously disclosed    
        investigations regarding past off-label promotional practices concerning Bextra, as well as certain other investigations.                                                 
 6.     (Benefit)/Provision for taxes on income includes tax benefits in the full year ended December 31, 2009 of approximately $556 million related to the sale of one of our    
        biopharmaceutical companies (Vicuron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), which were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009, and $174 million related to the final resolution of the   
        agreement-in-principle referred to above in note 5, which were recorded in the third quarter of 2009. This resolution resulted in the receipt of information that raised  
        our assessment of the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of our tax position. The full-year ended December 31, 2008 includes tax benefits of approximately  
        $305 million related to favorable tax settlements and of approximately $426 million related to the sale of one of our biopharmaceutical companies (Esperion Therapeutics  
        Inc.), both recorded in the second quarter of 2008.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

1. Change in Reported Revenues

Reported revenues increased 34% in fourth-quarter 2009 and 4% in full-year 2009,
compared to the same periods in 2008. The fourth quarter 2009 increase was due
to operational growth of 30%, of which 27% was due to the addition of the legacy
Wyeth products and 3% was due to legacy Pfizer products, and the favorable
impact of foreign exchange of 4%. Full-year 2009 reported revenues were
favorably impacted by 7% due to the addition of the legacy Wyeth products, and
by 1% due to legacy Pfizer products. These increases were partially offset by
the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on full-year 2009 revenues of
approximately 4%. 

2. Change in Reported Cost of Sales

Reported cost of sales increased 130% in fourth-quarter 2009, compared to the
same period in 2008, and increased 10% in full-year 2009, compared to full-year
2008. The increases primarily reflect purchase accounting adjustments associated
with the Wyeth acquisition and the addition of Wyeth manufacturing costs. In
addition, the impact of foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on reported
cost of sales in the quarter and full-year periods. These increases were
partially offset by lower costs recorded in reported cost of sales related to
our cost-reduction initiatives in both the fourth-quarter and full-year 2009
periods. 

Reported cost of sales includes charges related to our cost-reduction
initiatives of $31 million for fourth-quarter 2009, $175 million for full-year
2009, $225 million for fourth-quarter 2008, and $745 million for full-year 2008.
Cost-reduction initiative charges incurred after the Wyeth acquisition, other
than accelerated depreciation, are included in Restructuring charges and certain
acquisition-related costs.

Reported cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased 9.9 percentage
points to 23.8% in fourth-quarter 2009, compared to the same period in 2008, and
reported cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased 1.0 percentage
point to 17.8% in full-year 2009, compared to full-year 2008, reflecting the
aforementioned factors. 

3. Change in Reported Selling, Informational &amp; Administrative (SI) Expenses,
Reported Research &amp; Development (R) Expenses and Reported In-Process R
Charges (IPR)

Reported SI expenses increased 47% in fourth-quarter 2009, compared to the
same period in 2008, and increased 2% in full-year 2009, compared to full-year
2008. The increase in fourth-quarter 2009 primarily reflects the addition of
Wyeth operating costs, the increased investment in high-growth and in-line
opportunities, and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, partially offset
by lower costs recorded in reported SI related to our cost-reduction
initiatives. The increase in full-year 2009 primarily reflects the addition of
Wyeth operating costs and the increased investment in high-growth and in-line
opportunities, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange and
lower costs recorded in reported SI related to our cost-reduction
initiatives.In addition, full-year 2009 included certain insurance recoveries
related to legal defense costs. 

Reported SI expenses include charges related to our cost-reduction initiatives
of $37 million for fourth-quarter 2009, $219 million for full-year 2009, $143
million for fourth-quarter of 2008, and $413 million for full-year 2008.
Cost-reduction initiative charges incurred after the Wyeth acquisition, other
than accelerated depreciation, are included in Restructuring charges and certain
acquisition-related costs.

Reported R expenses, excluding IPR, increased 22% in fourth-quarter 2009,
compared to the same period in 2008, and decreased 1% in full-year 2009,
compared to 2008. The increase in fourth-quarter of 2009 is primarily due to the
addition of Wyeth operating costs and continued investment in the late-stage
development portfolio and business-development transactions in the Established
Products unit, partially offset by lower costs recorded in reported R related
to our cost-reduction initiatives. The full-year 2009 decrease was primarily due
to lower purchase accounting adjustments related to our merger with Pharmacia,
lower costs recorded in reported R associated with our cost-reduction
initiatives and the favorable impact of foreign exchange. This decrease was
partially offset by the addition of Wyeth operating costs, continued investment
in the late-stage development portfolio, business-development transactions in
the Established Products unit, and a $150 million milestone payment to
Bristol-Myers Squibb in first-quarter 2009 in connection with the collaboration
on apixaban. 

Reported R expenses include charges related to our cost-reduction initiatives
of $13 million for fourth-quarter 2009, $91 million for full-year 2009, $85
million for fourth-quarter 2008, and $433 million for full-year 2008.
Cost-reduction initiative charges incurred after the Wyeth acquisition, other
than accelerated depreciation, are included in Restructuring charges and certain
acquisition-related costs.

Reported IPR charges of $68 million in 2009 relate to the resolution of a
contingency associated with our 2008 acquisition of CovX. IPR charges of $633
million in 2008 primarily relate to the acquisitions of Serenex, Inc., Encysive
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., CovX, Coley Pharmaceutical Group, Inc. and a number of
animal health lines from Schering-Plough Corporation, as well as two smaller
acquisitions related to Animal Health. As a result of adopting the provisions of
a new accounting standard for business combinations, for acquisitions completed
after January 1, 2009, we record acquired IPR on our consolidated balance
sheet as indefinite-lived intangible assets.

 * Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.                                                                               
 (a)    Net interest expense was $338 million in fourth-quarter 2009 compared to net interest income of $284 million in the same period in 2008 and net interest expense was $487 
        million in full-year 2009 compared to net interest income of $772 for full-year 2008. Interest expense increased in 2009 due to our issuance of $13.5 billion of senior   
        unsecured notes on March 24, 2009 and $10.5 billion of senior unsecured notes on June 3, 2009, primarily related to the acquisition of Wyeth. Interest income decreased in 
        2009 due to lower interest rates, partially offset by higher average cash balances.

 (c)    2009 amounts primarily represent gain on sales of certain equity investments.                                                                                             
 (d)    In third-quarter 2008, we recorded litigation-related charges of approximately $900 million associated with the resolution of certain litigation involving our non        
        -steroidal anti-inflammatory pain medicines and in fourth-quarter 2008, we recorded charges of approximately $2.3 billion resulting from an agreement-in-principle to     
        resolve previously disclosed investigations regarding past off-label promotional practices concerning Bextra and certain other investigations.

5. Effective Tax Rate

The effective tax rate on reported Income from continuing operations before
provision for taxes on income for fourth-quarter 2009 was favorably impacted by
a tax benefit of $556 million related to the sale of one of our
biopharmaceutical companies, Vicuron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., as well as the
jurisdictional mix of certain expenses incurred in connection with the Wyeth
acquisition. The effective tax rate of 63.1% in the fourth-quarter of 2008 was
negatively impacted by legal settlement provisions, which were either not
deductible or deductible at lower tax rates. 

The effective tax rate on reported Income from continuing operations before
provision for taxes on income for full-year 2009 was 20.3% and 17.0% for
full-year 2008. The higher tax rate in 2009 is primarily due to the increased
tax costs associated with certain business decisions executed to finance the
Wyeth acquisition, partially offset by the favorable impacts discussed above as
well as a tax benefit of $174 million recorded in the third quarter of 2009
related to the final resolution of an agreement-in-principle with the U.S.
Department of Justice to settle investigations of past promotional practices
concerning Bextra and certain other investigations. This resulted in the receipt
of information that raised our assessment of the likelihood of prevailing on the
technical merits of our tax position. The higher tax rate in 2009 was also
partially offset by the decrease in IPR charges, which generally are not
deductible for tax purposes. 

The effective tax rate on adjusted income(1) was 28.3% in fourth-quarter 2009,
23.5% in fourth quarter 2008, 29.5% in full-year 2009 and 22.0% in full-year
2008. The higher tax rates on adjusted income(1) in 2009 are primarily due to
the increased tax costs associated with certain business decisions executed to
finance the Wyeth acquisition. The lower tax rate in the full-year 2008 also
reflects $305 million in tax benefits related to the resolution of tax issues.

(1) "Adjusted income" and "adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS)" are
defined as reported net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. and reported diluted
EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders excluding
purchase-accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, discontinued
operations and certain significant items. As described under Adjusted Income in
the Management`s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations section of Pfizer`s Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September
27, 2009, management uses adjusted income, among other factors, to set
performance goals and to measure the performance of the overall company. We
believe that investors` understanding of our performance is enhanced by
disclosing this measure. The adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS measures
are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and
diluted EPS.

Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today reported financial results for fourth-quarter and
full-year 2009. On October 15, 2009, Pfizer completed the acquisition of Wyeth
and, consequently, fourth-quarter and full-year 2009 results include the legacy
Wyeth operations from the acquisition date through Pfizer`s domestic and
international year-ends (see note 16). Fourth-quarter 2009 revenues were $16.5
billion, an increase of 34% compared with $12.3 billion in the year-ago quarter.
Revenues for fourth-quarter 2009 compared with the year-ago quarter were
favorably impacted by $3.3 billion, or 27%, due to the addition of the legacy
Wyeth products, $419 million, or 3%, due to legacy Pfizer products, and $469
million, or 4%, due to foreign exchange. For fourth-quarter 2009, U.S. revenues
were $7.4 billion, an increase of 42% compared with the year-ago quarter.
International revenues were $9.1 billion, an increase of 28% compared with the
prior-year quarter, and reflected 21% operational growth and a 7% favorable
impact of foreign exchange. U.S. revenues represented 45% compared with 42% of
the total in the year-ago quarter, while international revenues represented 55%
compared with 58% of the total in fourth-quarter 2008. 

For full-year 2009, revenues were $50.0 billion, an increase of 4% compared with
$48.3 billion in the same period in 2008. For full-year 2009, revenues were
favorably impacted by approximately $3.3 billion, or 7%, due to the addition of
the legacy Wyeth products, $247 million, or 1%, due to legacy Pfizer products,
and unfavorably impacted by $1.8 billion, or 4%, due to foreign exchange. U.S.
revenues were $21.7 billion, an increase of 7% compared with full-year 2008.
International revenues were $28.3 billion, an increase of 1% compared with last
year, and reflected 8% operational growth and a 7% unfavorable impact of foreign
exchange. U.S. revenues represented 43% compared with 42% of the total last
year, and international revenues represented 57% compared with 58% of the total
in 2008.

* Calculation not meaningful 

For fourth-quarter 2009, revenues from Biopharmaceutical were $14.6 billion, an
increase of 30% compared with $11.2 billion in the year-ago quarter.
Operationally, revenues increased $2.9 billion, or 26%, of which $2.5 billion,
or 22%, was attributable to legacy Wyeth products, primarily Premarin in the
Primary Care unit, Enbrel and Prevnar in the Specialty Care unit, Effexor in the
Established Products unit as well as Enbrel and Prevenar in the Emerging Markets
unit. Additionally, the favorable impact of foreign exchange increased revenues
by 4% or $419 million. 

For fourth-quarter 2009, revenues from Diversified were $1.8 billion, an
increase of 83% compared with $1.0 billion in the year-ago quarter.
Operationally, revenues increased $778 million, or 78%, of which $764 million,
or 77%, was attributable to legacy Wyeth products, primarily Centrum, Advil and
Robitussin in Consumer Healthcare and certain Nutrition products. Additionally,
the favorable impact of foreign exchange increased revenues by 5% or $45
million. 

Reported Net Income(1)and Reported Diluted EPS(1)

For fourth-quarter 2009, Pfizer posted reported net income(1) of $767 million,
an increase of 188% compared with $266 million in the prior-year quarter, and
reported diluted EPS(1) of $0.10, an increase of 150% compared with $0.04 in the
prior-year quarter. Results for fourth-quarter 2009 compared with the same
period in 2008 were favorably impacted by increased revenues as well as the
non-recurrence of the pre-tax and after-tax charge of $2.3 billion in the
year-ago quarter related to the resolution of certain investigations concerning
Bextra and various other products in addition to the favorable impact of lower
costs incurred in connection with our cost-reduction initiatives in 2009. These
factors were largely offset by significant purchase accounting adjustments and
acquisition-related costs associated with the Wyeth acquisition. In addition,
the effective tax rate in fourth-quarter 2009 was favorably impacted by the tax
benefits related to the sale of one of our biopharmaceutical companies, Vicuron
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and the jurisdictional mix of certain expenses incurred
in connection with the acquisition of Wyeth. The fourth-quarter 2008 effective
tax rate was negatively impacted by the unfavorable tax implications of the
aforementioned charge related to Bextra and various other products. 

For full-year 2009, Pfizer posted reported net income(1) of $8.6 billion, an
increase of 7% compared with $8.1 billion last year, and reported diluted EPS(1)
of $1.23, an increase of 3% compared with $1.20 in 2008. These results were
impacted by increased revenues and the aforementioned fourth-quarter factors as
well as the non-recurrence of a $640 million after-tax charge related to the
resolution of certain litigation involving the Company`s non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory pain medicines in third-quarter 2008. These factors were
partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and higher net
interest expense. Additionally, the effective tax rate on reported results
increased to approximately 20% in full-year 2009 from approximately 17% in
full-year 2008, primarily due to the increased tax cost associated with certain
business decisions executed to finance the Wyeth acquisition. 

Additionally, reported diluted EPS(1) in fourth-quarter and full-year 2009 was
impacted by the increased number of shares outstanding in comparison with the
corresponding periods in 2008 resulting primarily from shares issued to
partially fund the Wyeth acquisition. 

Adjusted Income(2) and Adjusted Diluted EPS(2)

Fourth-quarter 2009 adjusted income(2) was $3.8 billion, a decrease of 13%
compared with $4.4 billion in the year-ago quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS(2)
was $0.49, a decrease of 25% compared with $0.65 in the year-ago quarter. For
full-year 2009, adjusted income(2) was $14.2 billion, a decrease of 13% compared
with $16.4 billion in full-year 2008, and adjusted diluted EPS(2) was $2.02, a
decrease of 17% compared with $2.42 in the prior year. Both adjusted income(2)
and adjusted diluted EPS(2) were favorably impacted by higher revenues and
negatively impacted by increased expenses, primarily due to the addition of the
legacy Wyeth operations and increased investment in high-growth and in-line
product opportunities, as well as higher net interest expense and an increase in
the effective tax rate on adjusted income(2). 

The effective tax rate on adjusted income(2) increased to approximately 28% in
fourth-quarter 2009 from approximately 24% in fourth-quarter 2008, and to
approximately 30% in full-year 2009 from approximately 22% in full-year 2008,
primarily due to the increased tax cost associated with certain business
decisions executed to finance the Wyeth acquisition. In addition, the effective
tax rate on adjusted income(2) for full-year 2008 was positively impacted by a
favorable income tax adjustment. 

Additionally, adjusted diluted EPS(2) in fourth-quarter and full-year 2009 was
impacted by the increased number of shares outstanding in comparison with the
corresponding periods in 2008 resulting primarily from shares issued to
partially fund the Wyeth acquisition. 

In fourth-quarter 2009, adjusted cost of sales(2) as a percentage of revenues
was 17.5% compared with 11.7% in fourth-quarter 2008. For full-year 2009,
adjusted cost of sales(2) as a percentage of revenues was 15.4% compared with
14.6% in full-year 2008. These increases primarily reflect the change in the mix
of products and businesses as a result of the Wyeth acquisition. Excluding the
impact of foreign exchange, adjusted cost of sales(2) as a percentage of
revenues was 14.4% in fourth-quarter 2009 and 14.8% in full-year 2009. 

Adjusted SI expenses(2) were $5.3 billion in fourth-quarter 2009, an increase
of 52% compared with $3.5 billion in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted SI
expenses(2) were $14.7 billion in full-year 2009, an increase of 4% compared
with $14.0 billion in the prior year. These increases were attributable to the
addition of the legacy Wyeth operations and increased investment in high-growth
and in-line product opportunities. Foreign exchange increased fourth-quarter
2009 adjusted SI expenses(2) by $135 million compared with the year-ago
quarter, and decreased full-year 2009 adjusted SI expenses(2) by $385 million
compared with full-year 2008. 

Adjusted R expenses(2) were $2.8 billion in fourth-quarter 2009, an increase
of 27% compared with $2.2 billion in the prior-year period. For full-year 2009,
adjusted R expenses(2) were $7.7 billion, an increase of 3% compared with $7.5
billion in the prior year. These increases were attributable to the addition of
the legacy Wyeth operations, continued investment in the late-stage development
portfolio and business-development transactions in the Established Products
unit. Foreign exchange increased fourth-quarter 2009 adjusted R expenses(2) by
$17 million compared with the year-ago quarter, and decreased full-year 2009
adjusted R expenses(2) by $145 million compared with full-year 2008. 

Overall, foreign exchange increased adjusted total costs(13) by $720 million, or
10%, in fourth-quarter 2009 compared with the prior-year period. For full-year
2009, foreign exchange decreased adjusted total costs(13) by $520 million, or
2%, compared with the prior year. 

As announced in January 2009, Pfizer implemented a cost-reduction program that
is expected to achieve cost savings of approximately $3 billion, at 2008 average
foreign exchange rates, compared with 2008 adjusted total costs(13) of $28.6
billion. Approximately $1 billion of these savings is anticipated to be
reinvested in the business, resulting in an expected $2 billion net cost
reduction. Additionally, as a result of the Wyeth acquisition, Pfizer expects to
generate synergies of approximately $4 billion, which is expected to result in
$2 to $3 billion in net cost savings after reinvestment in the business. In the
aggregate, Pfizer expects to generate gross cost reductions of approximately $7
billion, resulting in net cost reductions of approximately $4 to $5 billion, by
the end of 2012, at 2008 average foreign exchange rates, in comparison with the
2008 pro-forma adjusted total costs(13) of Pfizer and the former Wyeth
operations. For full-year 2009, operational improvements resulting from the
Pfizer stand-alone cost-reduction initiatives resulted in a decrease in adjusted
total costs(13) of approximately $200 million, despite significant
fourth-quarter 2009 investment in many high-growth and in-line product
opportunities, including business-development transactions in the Established
Products unit and incremental promotional efforts in the U.S. and emerging
markets, among other items. The operational improvements were driven partially
by the reduction in workforce as well as manufacturing and research and
development site exits. At the closing of the Wyeth acquisition, the combined
workforce totaled approximately 120,700, an increase from the Pfizer stand-alone
workforce of approximately 75,100. As of year-end 2009, the workforce was
approximately 116,500, a decline of 4,200 since the closing on October 15, 2009.


Executive Commentary

"During the fourth quarter, we closed the Wyeth acquisition and immediately
began the integration of our operations, advancing the transformation of the
company," stated Jeff Kindler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We are
pleased with the rapid pace of the integration and our ability to quickly
realize the benefits of our combined organization." 

"Our results this quarter clearly demonstrate the ability of our colleagues to
remain focused and deliver solid operational performance, while working to close
the Wyeth acquisition and to ensure a successful integration," Kindler
continued. "We remain excited about our more diverse in-line product and
pipeline portfolio, which we expect will result in improved opportunities for
the company in 2010 and beyond." 

Frank D`Amelio, Chief Financial Officer, stated, "Our 2010 financial guidance
and 2012 financial targets balance the achievement of our projected cost
reductions, including from the integration of Wyeth, with the expected increased
investment to drive longer-term, top and bottom line performance. These goals
reflect our continued confidence in the business and our ability to capitalize
on near- to mid-term growth opportunities through a meaningful reallocation of
investment. Additionally, our 2012 targets assume a modest level of planned
business-development activities."

2012 Financial Targets

Pfizer has also provided financial targets for 2012. Given the longer-term
nature of these targets, they are subject to greater variability and less
certainty as a result of potential material impacts related to foreign exchange
fluctuations, macroeconomic activity including inflation, industry-specific
challenges including changes to government healthcare policy, among others. In
comparison with the targets previously provided on January 26, 2009, these
updated targets reflect the impact of the completed and pending divestitures of
Animal Health assets as required by regulatory authorities in connection with
their approvals of the Wyeth acquisition, the shift in revenues for human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) products to the joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline
plc (ViiV Healthcare Limited) and the elimination of Relistor revenues due to
Wyeth`s return of its rights to the licensor, which in the aggregate reduced the
revenue target by approximately $1.5 billion. 

For 2012, at current exchange rates(14), Pfizer is targeting reported revenue
between $66.0 to $68.5 billion, reported diluted EPS(1) between $1.58 and $1.73
and adjusted diluted EPS(2) between $2.25 and $2.35. Adjusted R expenses(2)
are targeted to be between $8.0 to $8.5 billion, adjusted operating margin(2) is
projected to be in a range of the high 30%s to low 40%s and adjusted other
(income)/deductions(2) are targeted to be between $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion
in deductions. The effective tax rate on adjusted income(1) is targeted at
approximately 30% while the operating cash flow is expected to be at least $19.0
billion.

        Certain amounts and percentages may reflect rounding adjustments.                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                  
 1.     The above financial statements present the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. Subsidiaries operating outside the United  
        States are included for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended November 30 of each year. Wyeth's results are included in our consolidated financial statements    
        commencing from the acquisition date of October 15, 2009, in accordance with Pfizer's domestic and international year-ends. Therefore, our 2009 results of operations     
        include approximately two-and-a-half months of the fourth calendar quarter of 2009 in the case of Wyeth`s U.S. operations and approximately one-and-a-half months of the  
        fourth calendar quarter of 2009 in the case of Wyeth`s international operations. Cost of sales for 2009 includes the significant impacts of purchase accounting           
        adjustments associated with inventory acquired from Wyeth that was sold in 2009. Amortization of intangible assets for 2009 includes the amortization of intangible assets 
        acquired from Wyeth since the acquisition date.                                                                                                                           
 2.     On January 1, 2009, we adopted the provisions of a new accounting standard that provides guidance for the accounting, reporting and disclosure of noncontrolling          
        interests, previously referred to as minority interests. The adoption of these provisions resulted in reclassifications of prior-period amounts to conform to the fourth  
        -quarter and twelve-month 2009 presentations, primarily related to the presentation of noncontrolling interests.                                                          
 3.     In 2009, we recorded $68 million of Acquisition-related in-process research and development charges (IPR) due to the resolution of a contingency associated with our    
        2008 acquisition of CovX. During 2008, we expensed $633 million of IPR, primarily related to our acquisitions of Serenex, Inc., Encysive Pharmaceuticals, Inc., CovX,   
        Coley Pharmaceutical Group, Inc. and a number of animal health product lines from Schering-Plough Corporation, as well as two smaller acquisitions related to Animal      
        Health. As a result of adopting the provisions of a new accounting standard for business combinations, for acquisitions completed after January 1, 2009, we record        
        acquired IPR on our consolidated balance sheet as indefinite-lived intangible assets.                                                                                   
 4.     Amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets that contribute to our ability to sell, manufacture, research, market and distribute our products is included  
        in Amortization of intangible assets as these intangible assets benefit multiple business functions. Amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets that are  
        associated with a single function is included in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses or Research and development expenses, as appropriate.  
 5.     Other (income)/deductions--net for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2009 includes a gain related to ViiV Healthcare Limited, a newly formed joint venture with     
        GlaxoSmithKline plc, which is focused solely on research, development and commercialization of HIV medicines. The full year ended December 31, 2008, includes charges of  
        approximately $900 million, recorded in the third quarter of 2008, associated with the resolution of certain litigation involving our non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain 
        medicines, and charges of approximately $2.3 billion, recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008, resulting from an agreement-in-principle to resolve previously disclosed    
        investigations regarding past off-label promotional practices concerning Bextra, as well as certain other investigations.                                                 
 6.     (Benefit)/Provision for taxes on income includes tax benefits in the full year ended December 31, 2009 of approximately $556 million related to the sale of one of our    
        biopharmaceutical companies (Vicuron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), which were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009, and $174 million related to the final resolution of the   
        agreement-in-principle referred to above in note 5, which were recorded in the third quarter of 2009. This resolution resulted in the receipt of information that raised  
        our assessment of the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of our tax position. The full-year ended December 31, 2008 includes tax benefits of approximately  
        $305 million related to favorable tax settlements and of approximately $426 million related to the sale of one of our biopharmaceutical companies (Esperion Therapeutics  
        Inc.), both recorded in the second quarter of 2008.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

1. Change in Reported Revenues

Reported revenues increased 34% in fourth-quarter 2009 and 4% in full-year 2009,
compared to the same periods in 2008. The fourth quarter 2009 increase was due
to operational growth of 30%, of which 27% was due to the addition of the legacy
Wyeth products and 3% was due to legacy Pfizer products, and the favorable
impact of foreign exchange of 4%. Full-year 2009 reported revenues were
favorably impacted by 7% due to the addition of the legacy Wyeth products, and
by 1% due to legacy Pfizer products. These increases were partially offset by
the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on full-year 2009 revenues of
approximately 4%. 

2. Change in Reported Cost of Sales

Reported cost of sales increased 130% in fourth-quarter 2009, compared to the
same period in 2008, and increased 10% in full-year 2009, compared to full-year
2008. The increases primarily reflect purchase accounting adjustments associated
with the Wyeth acquisition and the addition of Wyeth manufacturing costs. In
addition, the impact of foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on reported
cost of sales in the quarter and full-year periods. These increases were
partially offset by lower costs recorded in reported cost of sales related to
our cost-reduction initiatives in both the fourth-quarter and full-year 2009
periods. 

Reported cost of sales includes charges related to our cost-reduction
initiatives of $31 million for fourth-quarter 2009, $175 million for full-year
2009, $225 million for fourth-quarter 2008, and $745 million for full-year 2008.
Cost-reduction initiative charges incurred after the Wyeth acquisition, other
than accelerated depreciation, are included in Restructuring charges and certain
acquisition-related costs.

Reported cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased 9.9 percentage
points to 23.8% in fourth-quarter 2009, compared to the same period in 2008, and
reported cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased 1.0 percentage
point to 17.8% in full-year 2009, compared to full-year 2008, reflecting the
aforementioned factors. 

3. Change in Reported Selling, Informational &amp; Administrative (SI) Expenses,
Reported Research &amp; Development (R) Expenses and Reported In-Process R
Charges (IPR)

Reported SI expenses increased 47% in fourth-quarter 2009, compared to the
same period in 2008, and increased 2% in full-year 2009, compared to full-year
2008. The increase in fourth-quarter 2009 primarily reflects the addition of
Wyeth operating costs, the increased investment in high-growth and in-line
opportunities, and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, partially offset
by lower costs recorded in reported SI related to our cost-reduction
initiatives. The increase in full-year 2009 primarily reflects the addition of
Wyeth operating costs and the increased investment in high-growth and in-line
opportunities, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange and
lower costs recorded in reported SI related to our cost-reduction
initiatives.In addition, full-year 2009 included certain insurance recoveries
related to legal defense costs. 

Reported SI expenses include charges related to our cost-reduction initiatives
of $37 million for fourth-quarter 2009, $219 million for full-year 2009, $143
million for fourth-quarter of 2008, and $413 million for full-year 2008.
Cost-reduction initiative charges incurred after the Wyeth acquisition, other
than accelerated depreciation, are included in Restructuring charges and certain
acquisition-related costs.

Reported R expenses, excluding IPR, increased 22% in fourth-quarter 2009,
compared to the same period in 2008, and decreased 1% in full-year 2009,
compared to 2008. The increase in fourth-quarter of 2009 is primarily due to the
addition of Wyeth operating costs and continued investment in the late-stage
development portfolio and business-development transactions in the Established
Products unit, partially offset by lower costs recorded in reported R related
to our cost-reduction initiatives. The full-year 2009 decrease was primarily due
to lower purchase accounting adjustments related to our merger with Pharmacia,
lower costs recorded in reported R associated with our cost-reduction
initiatives and the favorable impact of foreign exchange. This decrease was
partially offset by the addition of Wyeth operating costs, continued investment
in the late-stage development portfolio, business-development transactions in
the Established Products unit, and a $150 million milestone payment to
Bristol-Myers Squibb in first-quarter 2009 in connection with the collaboration
on apixaban. 

Reported R expenses include charges related to our cost-reduction initiatives
of $13 million for fourth-quarter 2009, $91 million for full-year 2009, $85
million for fourth-quarter 2008, and $433 million for full-year 2008.
Cost-reduction initiative charges incurred after the Wyeth acquisition, other
than accelerated depreciation, are included in Restructuring charges and certain
acquisition-related costs.

Reported IPR charges of $68 million in 2009 relate to the resolution of a
contingency associated with our 2008 acquisition of CovX. IPR charges of $633
million in 2008 primarily relate to the acquisitions of Serenex, Inc., Encysive
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., CovX, Coley Pharmaceutical Group, Inc. and a number of
animal health lines from Schering-Plough Corporation, as well as two smaller
acquisitions related to Animal Health. As a result of adopting the provisions of
a new accounting standard for business combinations, for acquisitions completed
after January 1, 2009, we record acquired IPR on our consolidated balance
sheet as indefinite-lived intangible assets.

 * Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.                                                                               
 (a)    Net interest expense was $338 million in fourth-quarter 2009 compared to net interest income of $284 million in the same period in 2008 and net interest expense was $487 
        million in full-year 2009 compared to net interest income of $772 for full-year 2008. Interest expense increased in 2009 due to our issuance of $13.5 billion of senior   
        unsecured notes on March 24, 2009 and $10.5 billion of senior unsecured notes on June 3, 2009, primarily related to the acquisition of Wyeth. Interest income decreased in 
        2009 due to lower interest rates, partially offset by higher average cash balances.

 (c)    2009 amounts primarily represent gain on sales of certain equity investments.                                                                                             
 (d)    In third-quarter 2008, we recorded litigation-related charges of approximately $900 million associated with the resolution of certain litigation involving our non        
        -steroidal anti-inflammatory pain medicines and in fourth-quarter 2008, we recorded charges of approximately $2.3 billion resulting from an agreement-in-principle to     
        resolve previously disclosed investigations regarding past off-label promotional practices concerning Bextra and certain other investigations.

5. Effective Tax Rate

The effective tax rate on reported Income from continuing operations before
provision for taxes on income for fourth-quarter 2009 was favorably impacted by
a tax benefit of $556 million related to the sale of one of our
biopharmaceutical companies, Vicuron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., as well as the
jurisdictional mix of certain expenses incurred in connection with the Wyeth
acquisition. The effective tax rate of 63.1% in the fourth-quarter of 2008 was
negatively impacted by legal settlement provisions, which were either not
deductible or deductible at lower tax rates. 

The effective tax rate on reported Income from continuing operations before
provision for taxes on income for full-year 2009 was 20.3% and 17.0% for
full-year 2008. The higher tax rate in 2009 is primarily due to the increased
tax costs associated with certain business decisions executed to finance the
Wyeth acquisition, partially offset by the favorable impacts discussed above as
well as a tax benefit of $174 million recorded in the third quarter of 2009
related to the final resolution of an agreement-in-principle with the U.S.
Department of Justice to settle investigations of past promotional practices
concerning Bextra and certain other investigations. This resulted in the receipt
of information that raised our assessment of the likelihood of prevailing on the
technical merits of our tax position. The higher tax rate in 2009 was also
partially offset by the decrease in IPR charges, which generally are not
deductible for tax purposes. 

The effective tax rate on adjusted income(1) was 28.3% in fourth-quarter 2009,
23.5% in fourth quarter 2008, 29.5% in full-year 2009 and 22.0% in full-year
2008. The higher tax rates on adjusted income(1) in 2009 are primarily due to
the increased tax costs associated with certain business decisions executed to
finance the Wyeth acquisition. The lower tax rate in the full-year 2008 also
reflects $305 million in tax benefits related to the resolution of tax issues.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
Walt Disney Pictures:

FUN FACTS

THE BIG PICTURE

* DIVINE DIGS - Director Tim Burton`s London office was once owned by Arthur
Rackham, a famous English book illustrator who created the iconic color plates
for the 1907 edition of "Alice`s Adventures in Wonderland." 
* THE QUESTION IS WHO ARE YOU? - Lewis Carroll is actually a pen name for
Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, a lecturer in mathematics at Christchurch
University in Oxford, England. 
* WONDERLAND, NO UNDERLAND - Underland is the same fantastical land that Alice
visited as a child, but-according to screenwriter Linda Woolverton-she misheard
the word "Underland" and thought they said "Wonderland." Woolverton says
Underland is a part of the Earth, lying somewhere far beneath our world. It`s
come upon hard times since the malevolent Red Queen took over the throne, but is
a truly wonderful land, which might explain why the girl who mistook it for
Wonderland has been called upon to help return it to its glory. 
* ALMOST ALICE - "ALICE IN WONDERLAND" sparked two music CDs, including the
motion-picture soundtrack, featuring an extraordinary score by composer Danny
Elfman, and "Almost Alice," a 16-song companion compilation featuring the film`s
end credit track "Alice," written and performed by Avril Lavigne, plus songs
from artists who were inspired by the film, including All American Rejects,
3OH!3, The Cure`s Robert Smith, Franz Ferdinand and Shinedown. The album`s
title, "Almost Alice," comes from a line in the film. All of Underland has been
awaiting Alice`s return since she first visited as a child, but when she does
come back, nobody-including Alice-believes she`s the right Alice, the confident
and feisty Alice they once knew. Eventually, the wise caterpillar tells her
she`s Almost Alice.

CHARACTER-ISTICS

* DEPP`S DESIGNS - Actor Johnny Depp goes through ample preparation for each of
his roles and preparing to play the Mad Hatter was no different. Long before
production began, the actor began doing watercolor paintings of what the Mad
Hatter might look like, discovering later that his vision was quite similar to
director Tim Burton`s. 
* MAD HATTER MOOD RING - The Mad Hatter suffers from mercury poisoning, a common
and unfortunate condition of many hatters of the time who used the chemical
regularly for their craft. Depp and Burton elevated this Hatter`s madness by
literally showcasing the character`s many mad mood swings in his makeup and
wardrobe, creating a virtual human mood ring. 
* CHANGES - Mia Wasikowska, who plays Alice, is five feet four inches in real
life but Alice changes size throughout the course of her adventures in
Wonderland, ranging from six inches to two feet to eight-and-a-half feet, to a
maximum of 20 feet tall. The production worked hard to use practical methods
rather than special effects and often it was a case of putting Alice on an apple
box to make her taller than everyone else. 
* DRINK ME - The potion Alice drinks to shrink is called Pishsolver. The cake
she eats to grow is called Upelkuchen. 
* SWEET AND SOUR - Actress Anne Hathaway, who portrays the White Queen in "ALICE
IN WONDERLAND," decided that her representation of the character wouldn`t be
completely vanilla. The White Queen comes from the same gene pool as the evil
Red Queen, after all, so Hathaway envisioned a "punk rock vegan pacifist" and
was inspired by Blondie, Greta Garbo, Dan Flavin and Norma Desmond. 
* FUTTER-WHAT? - Futterwacken is the term used to describe the Underlanders`
dance of unbridled joy. Composer Danny Elfman was stumped when it came to
creating the music for the dance. He wrote four different pieces for the
director, each fun, unique and, as Elfman says, "pushing the bounds of what
could be acceptable." 
* TWO TWEEDLES - Actor Matt Lucas was tapped to play both Tweedles, rotund twin
brothers who constantly disagree with each other and whose confusing chatter
makes little sense to anyone but themselves. Lucas, however, was unable to play
Tweedledee and Tweedledum at the same time (for some reason). Actor Ethan Cohen
was called on to portray Dum to Lucas` Dee (or vice versa) during filming, but
will never actually appear on screen. 
* BANDERSNATCH? -This disgusting, drooling, foul-smelling creature has a big
filthy body and the squashed, teeth-baring face of a rabid bulldog. The creature
leaves Alice with a rather painful reminder of the Red Queen`s horrible reign.

BEHIND THE SCENES

* MEASURING UP - Costume designer Colleen Atwood had her work cut out for her
when it came to creating the costumes for Mia Wasikowska`s ever-changing Alice.
The character wears a variety of different garments, including one purportedly
made from the Red Queen`s curtains and even armor. Atwood had to find fabric in
different scales, and construct costumes for Mia that would help illustrate her
size changes. 
* ON WITH HIS HEAD - Crispin Glover portrays Stayne, the Knave of Hearts, in the
film, but only his head appears on screen. The body of the character, who`s
seven-and-a-half feet tall, is computer generated. On set, Glover wore a green
suit and a pair of stilts to make him taller. His face was fully made up for the
role (complete with an eye patch and scar). For the final film, Stayne`s entire
costume, body and even his cape are CGI. Only his face is real. 
* ON WITH HER FACE - Helena Bonham Carter endured three hours of makeup each
morning to transform into the fiery Red Queen. With the help of makeup pro
Vallie O`Reilly, the actress was decked out in white powder, lots of blue eye
shadow, painted eyebrows and perfect, heart-shaped bow-mouth lips. The special
effects team enlarged Bonham Carter`s head in post production, creating the
final look for the big-headed Queen. 
* SOLE SURPRISE - Costume designer Colleen Atwood added a red heart to the soles
of the Red Queen`s shoes, visible when the pampered royal places her feet on a
live pig-turned-footrest. 
* STILT TROUBLE - After Crispin Glover, who spent much of his time on stilts
during production, twisted his ankle filming one particular scene, he was often
followed on set by stuntmen all dressed in green who were there solely to catch
him in case he fell again. 
* CARROT CAPPERS -Tim Burton wanted the animal characters in Wonderland to
appear real rather than cartoony. So before creating the White Rabbit, animators
spent a day at a rabbit shelter for abandoned rabbits, observing the animals and
shooting photo reference footage to ensure they captured the nuances of rabbits
chewing and wriggling their noses.

TECHNICAL TIDBITS

* 2D to 3D - Director Tim Burton decided to shoot the film in 2D and convert it
later to 3D. The director was so impressed with the results of the conversion of
his film "The Nightmare Before Christmas" to 3D, he opted to go a similar route
for "Alice." 
* SUPER SFX SUPERVISOR - Tim Burton turned to legendary special effects guru Ken
Ralston and Sony Imageworks to create the wondrous world of Wonderland and its
inhabitants. Ralston (whose credits include the original "Star Wars," as well as
"Forrest Gump" and "The Polar Express") and his team completed more than 2,500
visual effects shots in total. While the team used a combination of live action,
animation and a host of other effects techniques, motion capture technology was
not tapped for the film. 
* IN THE GREEN - To represent the digital characters on set, the production used
either cardboard cut outs, full-size models or else resorted to men in green
with eyes stuck to various parts of the anatomy to help the actors with their
eyelines and to give them something real to react to. 
* HAIR-RAISING - When the animators were looking at reference photography of
real caterpillars, they noticed they had hair on them. So Absolem the
Caterpillar was treated to his very own CG fuzz. 
* THE REAL STUFF - Very few real sets were built for Wonderland. In fact, only
three versions of the Round Hall (where Alice ends up after falling down the
rabbit hole) and the Red Queen`s dungeon were practical sets. The rest were
created digitally. 
* EYES HAVE IT - The Mad Hatter`s eyes were slightly enlarged making them
between 10 and 15 percent bigger than Johnny Depp`s own. 
* HIT THE NET - When the animators began to design the Dodo, their first port of
call for reference was Google Image Search, followed by London`s Natural History
Museum. 
* BIG HEAD - A special 4K hi-def camera called a Dulsa with 4,000 lines of
resolution was used to shoot Helena Bonham Carter`s Red Queen to enable her head
to be blown up to twice its size in post-production without losing any image
quality.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today said it will deliver a record-tying 13 security updates on Tuesday to patch more than two dozen vulnerabilities in Windows and Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will ship a total of 13 updates next week, five of them pegged "critical," the highest threat ranking in its four-step scoring system. The 13 updates will tie the record from October 2009, when Microsoft issued the same number of bulletins, but fixed a total of 34 vulnerabilities . According to Jerry Bryant, a senior manager with the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) , next week's updates will patch 26 flaws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot? That's an understatement," said Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Network Security. "But we could have had 14," he added, referring to the emergency Internet Explorer (IE) update Microsoft released two weeks ago. That "out-of-band" update was originally slated to be included in the collection set to ship this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the eight updates not marked critical, seven were ranked "important," the next-lower rating, while one was pegged "moderate." Eleven of the 13 will affect one or more editions of Windows; the remaining pair will affect Office XP and Office 2003 on Windows, and Office 2004 for Mac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's kind of interesting this month is that there are fewer applications updates," said Storms, talking about the 11-to-2 ratio of Windows-to-Office security bulletins. The trend, Storms noted, has been the opposite: Microsoft applications, primarily Office and IE, have been extensively exploited by hackers, who have shied away from Windows itself because attacking applications has been easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's not to say there isn't evidence of long-standing trends in the massive matrix that Microsoft spelled out in today's advance notification . One trend: Newer software is generally more secure than older software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know that the newer operating systems are more secure," said Storms. "They use newer code, and were created with SDL [Security Development Lifecycle]," he added. SDL is Microsoft's term for a programming philosophy that bakes security awareness into all aspects of development. As proof, Storms pointed to Windows Server 2008 R2, the newest version of Microsoft's server software. "It has the least number of bulletins," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Server 2008 R2 will be affected by 5 of the 11 Windows updates. Windows 7 , the newest client operating system, will be impacted by the same percentage, 45%, of the total. The eight-year-old Windows XP, meanwhile, will require 8 of the 11, or 73% of Windows updates, while the even older Windows 2000 will be affected by 9 of the 11, or 82% of the total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every month, there's a new reason to get off the older operating systems, to get off the older applications," said Storms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storms was hesitant to delve deeply into the affected software matrix Microsoft published as part of its heads-up. "I'll need a Powerbar to do that," he joked. But the update Microsoft tapped as "Bulletin 1" caught his eye, nonetheless. That update ran counter to the norm, for it was rated critical for Windows XP, important for Vista, then back to critical for Windows 7. Because Vista and Windows 7 share a code base, vulnerabilities that affect them are almost always ranked identically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maybe it's something to do with User Account Control," Storms guessed. User Account Control (UAC), is the term for the prompts users see in Windows Vista and Windows 7 that require approval for tasks that may have security implications, such as installing new software. "The more-in-your-face UAC version in Vista might be more annoying, but it might provide some mitigation that UAC doesn't in Windows 7 for this vulnerability," Storms argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bryant, of the MSRC, confirmed that Microsoft will close only one of the three outstanding security advisories. Microsoft will patch the 17-year-old bug in the kernel of all 32-bit versions of Windows. The vulnerability in the Windows Virtual DOS Machine (VDM) subsystem, a component that runs DOS and 16-bit Windows software, was publicly disclosed Jan. 19 by Google engineer Tavis Ormandy on the Full Disclosure security mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two other advisories, including the one involving IE that Microsoft issued just yesterday , will not be patched next week, Bryant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The good thing this month is that there are no mission-critical applications affected, like SQL Server and Exchange," said Storms, looking for a silver lining in the massive update. And he urged IT administrators to do what they could to prepare for next Tuesday. "I'll be asking my team, 'What are we behind on that we can spend the next few days catching up?' and then look at next week's [current] schedule and ask, 'What can we delay?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will release the 13 updates at approximately 1 p.m. ET on Feb. 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;Researchers selected by the U.S. National Science Foundation will have free access to Microsoft's Windows Azure cloud computing platform under a deal announced Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research projects focused on cloud computing will have access to Windows Azure for three years as part of the deal. The agreement will allow the U.S. scientific community "the opportunity to leverage highly scalable cloud computing services, especially for data-intensive applications," said Jeannette Wing, NSF's assistant director for computer and information science and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus will be on finding new ways to use the cloud in research, Wing said during a webcast press conference. "The cloud as a commodity service is familiar to all of us, providing our e-mail, online shopping, posting pictures for our friends to see, and of course, the killer app, search," she said. "However, the cloud as a research platform is still underexplored territory."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing can be particularly useful for analyzing "massive amounts of data," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft wants researchers to be able to do their work without worrying about infrastructure costs, said Dan Reed, corporate vice president for technology strategy and policy and extreme computing at Microsoft. An explosion of data is leading to a need for new approaches to computing-based research, but it doesn't make sense for each university to host its own cloud computing environment, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to shift the dialog from a focus on infrastructure to a focus on insight, and that means reducing the burden of infrastructure management that exists for many academic researchers," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the access to Azure, researchers will get help from Microsoft developers, who will work with grant recipients to equip them with a set of tools, applications and data collections that can be shared with the broad academic community, and also provide their expertise in research, science and cloud computing, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers may immediately submit supplemental proposals to any existing NSF award, the NSF said. Under two programs, researchers will have until April 15 to apply for a cloud computing grant for the current fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New cloud computing programs at NSF are anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's SharePoint suite started out in the early 2000's as a place to store and manage Office documents, but it has quickly evolved into a vast enterprise information portal and content management system. And more and more it's becoming a "social networking platform."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the social networking influence of Facebook and Twitter (profile pages, news feeds, status updates, 140-character microblogs) spill over into workplace, more enterprises are deploying social media tools to improve efficiency and communication, and vendors both young (startups SocialText and Jive) and old (IBM's Lotus Connections) are eager to provide the tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ For complete coverage on Microsoft's new Windows 7 operating system -- including hands-on reviews, video tutorials and advice on enterprise rollouts -- see CIO.com's Windows 7 Bible. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOSS 2007 (Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007) integrated social tools through partnerships with companies like NewsGator for RSS feeds and Atlassian for enterprise wiki software. But the MOSS 2007 social features have been viewed as clunky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Blogs and wikis in MOSS 2007 were weak compared to best-of-breed solutions," says Rob Koplowitz, principal analyst at research firm Forrester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SharePoint 2010, now in beta and set for general availability in June, is upping the ante with more native social networking features that Microsoft promises will be easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is relying on the smooth integration of profile pages, RSS and activity feeds, wikis, blogs, and microblogs as it faces the threat of Enterprise 2.0 SaaS (software as a service) vendors that offer specific social tools to businesses at a fraction of SharePoint's price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SharePoint 2010's biggest strength, its breadth of capabilities, is also its greatest weakness," says Koplowitz. "For companies not currently invested in SharePoint that are looking to only fulfill a basic need, like deploying a set of publicly facing blogs, the full SharePoint platform will look like a sledgehammer compared to products from companies like Socialtext, Jive, and others."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such SaaS startups have the advantage of developing new features quicker than big companies like Microsoft and IBM can. But SaaS companies have much to fear now that Microsoft has made social tools a priority in SharePoint 2010, says Koplowitz. SaaS upstarts also have to walk the thin line of both competing with SharePoint and making their software compatible with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the fact remains: social tools are just a portion of the SharePoint platform and procuring and managing the entire SharePoint suite is a huge task. It entails license and server costs, the training of staff, providing virus protection and backup, and possibly paying for consultant help. It's worth noting that a stripped down, online version of SharePoint has been available since November 2008 and Microsoft cut prices for it in November 2009. SharePoint 2010 will come as both as an on-premises and hosted online offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, if you're a company that just wants a powerful set of social networking tools, implementing the whole SharePoint suite is not a wise choice, says Koplowitz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's like killing a whole buffalo when all you want is a sandwich," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are three SaaS vendors that provide specific enterprise social tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SocialText&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SocialText, founded in late 2002 and based in Palo Alto, Calif., is one of the earliest vendors to adapt Web 2.0 tools to the business world, now referred to as Enterprise 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SocialText's flagship product, the SocialText Workspace wiki tool, allows workers to communicate, share information and content, add comments, and pose questions to groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The integrated SocialText suite also includes: a personalized homepage called Dashboard where users can access employee profiles, wiki pages and other social networking features; a Twitter-like microblogging tool called Signals; and SocialText People pages, the equivalent to Facebook's profile pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SocialText platform is available as a hosted service or an on-site or hosted appliance. It can be purchased as a standalone suite (click here for pricing information) but it is also designed to work within SharePoint and Lotus Connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portland, Ore.-based Jive has been around since 2001, and, like SocialText, is a SaaS company that aims to connect the enterprise through consumer-friendly social networking technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jive's software suite, Jive SBS (social business software), combines collaboration software and social applications. SBS is in its fourth generation. Some of its features include: wikis, blogs, discussion forums, dashboard-like homepages, personalized profile pages, status updates, tagging, bookmarking, document creation and management, and private storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jive reported an 85 percent year-over-year increase in revenue for 2009 and last month acquired social monitoring company Filtrbox for an undisclosed sum. SBS is a standalone suite that, like SocialText, also connects with SharePoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atlassian&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atlassian, an Australian company founded in 2002, has a broad set of software tools that help IT pros and developers track software bugs, manage help desk tickets and test and edit code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atlassian's software development tools are led by JIRA for issue tracking and project management and JIRA Studio, a hosted suite of tools for development teams. But it is probably best known for its enterprise wiki software, Confluence, through which workers create intranet pages and communicate with co-workers in real time, blog, and edit and share documents. Like the Jive and SocialText offerings, Confluence provides a main page (dashboard) with access to all workspaces, people and content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Confluence enterprise wiki can be purchased on its own, although Atlassian is a Microsoft partner and Confluence connects with SharePoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shane O'Neill is a senior writer at CIO.com.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Time Warner Tops Zacks Estimate

Time Warner Inc. (NYSE: TWX) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2009
results that topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate, on the heels of record profits
at its Studio and Networks segments. 

The quarterly earnings of 55 cents a share surpassed the Zacks Consensus
Estimate of 52 cents. In the prior-year quarter, the company had reported
earnings of 19 cents a share. On a reported basis, including one-time items,
quarterly earnings came in at 53 cents a share compared to a loss of $13.41
posted in the year-ago quarter. 

Time Warner, which spun off AOL (NYSE: AOL) and Time Warner Cable (NYSE: TWC),
has raised its business outlook. The company now expects fiscal year 2010
earnings to rise in the mid-teens on a percentage basis. On the back of
stronger-than-expected results, management also boosted its quarterly dividend
by 13.3% to 21.25 cents a share and increased the share repurchase authorization
to $3 billion. 

Another major media conglomerate, News Corporation (Nasdaq: NWS), raised its
quarterly dividend by 25% to 7.5 cents a share. 

Pfizer In-Line, Guidance Down

Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) reported fourth quarter earnings of 49 cents per share,
in-line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and 25% below the year-ago earnings of
65 cents. Full year earnings came in at $2.02, a cent above the Zacks Consensus
Estimate, but 17% below the year-ago earnings of $2.42. 

Although the company reported higher revenues, results were negatively impacted
by increased expenses, primarily due to the addition of the legacy Wyeth
operations and increased investment in high-growth and in-line product
opportunities, as well as higher net interest expense and an increase in the
effective tax rate on adjusted income. 

Revenues for the quarter increased 34% to $16.5 billion. Revenues were favorably
impacted by 27% due to the Wyeth acquisition (completed in mid-October 2009).
Legacy Pfizer products and foreign exchange boosted revenue growth by 3% and 4%,
respectively. International revenues increased 28% to $9.1 billion, reflecting
21% operational growth and a 7% favorable foreign exchange impact.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Siemens Exceeds Estimates

Siemens AG (NYSE: SI) reported first quarter of 2010 earnings per share from
continuing operations of &#8364;1.70 ($2.51), exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate
of $1.44. 

First-quarter revenue of &#8364;17.352 billion ($25.6 billion) was down 12% (8%
organic) compared to the prior-year period, yet exceptional execution and a
favorable revenue mix helped lift Total Sectors profit 11%, to &#8364;2.255 billion. 

Orders of &#8364;18.976 billion ($28 billion) came in 15% lower than the prior-year
period (11% organic), including an expected contraction in industrial and energy
infrastructure markets that typically lag macroeconomic cycles. 

The Industry Sector was the primary factor in lower revenue year-over-year,
reporting a 13% decline in the first quarter on lower sales at Drive
Technologies, Industry Solutions, Building Technologies and Industry Automation.
Energy reported a revenue decline of 10% on lower volume in all divisions. 

Health care revenue declined modestly compared to the prior-year period, and
rose on an organic basis. Revenue for the reported quarter declined
year-over-year in all three regions. The sharpest decline came from the
Americas, including strong negative currency translation effects. Amid the
decline in Asia and Australia, India and China posted higher revenue compared to
the first quarter a year ago. 

Orders came in lower for all sectors than in the prior-year period. Order intake
declined 19% in Energy due primarily to market contraction and increased pricing
pressure. Orders increased strongly at Renewable Energy, including a high volume
from large orders. Orders fell 16% in Industry, due mainly to a lower demand at
Industry Solutions and Drive Technologies. 

Health care orders came in 1% below the prior-year level, and increased on an
organic basis. On a geographic basis, orders declined in all regions, including
substantially lower volume from large fossil power generation contracts in the
region comprising Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Africa and the
Middle East (Europe/CAME). 

Total Sectors profit for the first quarter climbed 11% year-over-year to &#8364;2.255
billion, despite the 12% decline in revenue mentioned above. A favorable revenue
mix and cost situation lifted the Sectors` combined gross margin, and functional
costs were significantly lower, particularly for SG Total Sectors profit also
included a &#8364;45 million gain on the sale of a business. 

Health care was the primary driver of the increase in Total Sectors profit, with
a double-digit profit increase in its imaging business and a profit rebound in
the solutions business compared to the first quarter a year earlier. Energy`s
contribution to the increase in Total Sectors profit came primarily from its
fossil power generation business. While Industry accounted for the largest share
of Total Sectors profit, its first-quarter result was lower than a year earlier.


Free cash flow at the Sector level climbed to &#8364;1.615 billion compared to &#8364;387
million in the same quarter a year earlier. The current period benefited from
improved net working capital management and tight control of capital
expenditures. Free cash flow from continuing operations was a positive &#8364;725
million compared to a negative &#8364;1.574 billion in the first quarter a year ago.
The prior-year quarter included &#8364;1.008 billion in cash outflows associated with
the settlement of legal proceedings. 

Cash and cash equivalents were &#8364;10.4 billion ($15.4 billion) with long-term debt
at &#8364;18.7 billion ($27.6 billion) and shareowners` equity at &#8364;28.7 billion ($42.4
billion). The estimated underfunding of Siemens' principal pension plans as of
December 31, 2009, amounted to approximately &#8364;4.2 billion, compared to an
underfunding of approximately &#8364;4.0 billion at the end of fiscal 2009. A positive
return on plan assets was more than offset by an increase in the defined benefit
obligation. 

Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, an electronics and electrical engineering company,
operates in the industry, energy and health care sectors worldwide. In the
industry sector, the company`s portfolio ranges from industry automation and
drives products and services to building, lighting, and mobility solutions and
services, besides including system integration and solutions for plant business.
Major competitors are ABB Ltd (NYSE: ABB) and General Electric Company (NYSE:
GE). 

Black &amp; Decker Outperforms

Black &amp; Decker Corporation (NYSE: BDK) reported fourth-quarter earnings of 55
cents per share compared to 72 cents in the fourth quarter of 2008. The reported
quarter earnings include $58.8 million of pre-tax expenses related to the
proposed merger with The Stanley Works (NYSE: SWK), while 4Q08 earnings include
a $20.8 million pre-tax restructuring charge. 

Excluding these one-time charges, Black &amp; Decker reported earnings of $1.24 for
the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $0.96 in the fourth quarter of 2008. The
Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate for the quarter was 76 cents per share. 

Revenue in the quarter was down 6% year over year at $1.3 billion. This includes
a favorable currency translation impact of 4%. The company witnessed sales
declines in all three segments. The Power Tools and Accessories segment posted
an 11% decline in sales due to lower construction activity and weak demand for
discretionary items.

&lt;p&gt;MANCHESTER, England &amp; NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and DxS (a wholly owned subsidiary of QIAGEN N.V.)
(NASDAQ: QGEN; Frankfurt, Prime Standard: QIA) today announced that they have
entered into an agreement to develop a companion diagnostic test kit for
PF-04948568 (CDX-110), an immunotherapy vaccine in development for the treatment
of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Financial terms of the diagnostic agreement
have not been disclosed. 

On April 16, 2008, Pfizer and Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. entered into an
agreement to grant Pfizer an exclusive worldwide license to PF-04948568
(CDX-110) which is currently in Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment
of newly diagnosed GBM. 

Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in
adults and occurs in around 25,000 patients worldwide each year. Pfizer`s
investigational drug PF-04948568 (CDX-110) is a peptide vaccine which targets
the tumor-specific Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor variant III (EGFRvIII), a
mutated form of the epidermal growth factor receptor that is only present in
cancer cells and occurs in 25-40 percent of GBM tumors. The QIAGEN assay is
designed to identify those patients whose tumors express the EGFRvIII mutation,
allowing for the possibility of more targeted and personalized treatment. 

The EGFRvIII companion diagnostic will be developed and manufactured at QIAGEN`s
Center of Excellence for Companion Diagnostics in Manchester, UK. The diagnostic
will be a real-time PCR assay used to detect EGFRvIII RNA in tumor tissue. The
assay is designed to offer a simple workflow, which supports its clinical
utility in routine mutation testing. 

Commenting on this announcement, Dr. Stephen Little, Vice President Personalized
Healthcare, for QIAGEN, said, "We are very pleased to have signed this agreement
with Pfizer, as it is another important step toward the realization of
personalized medicine. QIAGEN is aligned to deliver companion diagnostics to our
pharmaceutical partners and this deal is further evidence of our commitment to
develop our scientific and operational capabilities to help select the right
patient for the right medicine." 

"We look forward to collaborating with QIAGEN's DxS unit in the development of
this important diagnostic tool that could potentially help physicians better
define the most appropriate treatment for patients who suffer from glioblastoma
multiforme," said Garry Nicholson, president and general manager of Pfizer`s
Oncology Business Unit.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The most promising investment opportunities are increasingly found outside the United States, yet the vast majority of Americans place little stock in overseas markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is a huge mistake, considering that China, India and other emerging markets promise superior growth, said Brent Ciliano, a portfolio strategist at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, who advises brokers and financial advisers on portfolio construction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The world is massively global. It follows your portfolio should be what the world is," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The facts should speak for themselves, Ciliano said: 70 percent of small-cap stocks are outside the United States; two-thirds of REITs are overseas; about 55 percent of global equities are outside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet most U.S. investors have no more than 5 percent to 10 percent exposure to foreign markets, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the slowdown in developed markets, and the expansion of Asian markets, the rest of the world will represent a bigger and bigger share of the global marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ciliano cited Ibbotson Associates research showing the U.S. share of the world's financial markets could shrink to 30 percent by 2030, down from about 45 percent at present. It was as high as 70 percent in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ciliano said the share held by other countries is increasing at a must faster clip now, which means the U.S. share could fall to 30 percent in just five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"International market capitalization relative to U.S. market capitalization is increasing faster than in the past," he said. "The rate of change is accelerating."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign exposure is a key part of a "core and satellite" diversified investing strategy that Goldman has promoted since the late 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategy calls for surrounding a core portfolio with satellite assets -- emerging market stocks and debt, U.S. and global REITs, commodities, high-yield debt and international small-cap stocks -- as well as private equity, hedge funds and private real estate investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ciliano says this approach has generated higher returns with less volatile swings than the typical "balanced" portfolio of U.S. stocks and bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ciliano said satellites and alternatives should comprise 15 percent to 20 percent of the overall portfolio. Some of Goldman's largest clients have as much as 49 percent invested in satellites and alternatives, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same portfolio services have been packaged for sale to smaller investors through investment advisers and brokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman offers several Asset Allocation Portfolio funds, which make all these asset-allocation decisions, as well as funds that just invest in the seven satellite assets. Retail investors with as little as $1,000 can buy shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key component of the Goldman approach, hedge funds, also is more accessible to retail investors through vehicles that replicate hedge fund returns. Since its debut in June 2008, the Absolute Return Tracker Fund has attracted $730 million in assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joseph A. Giannone; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman says 55 percent of global equities outside U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Non-U.S. share of world equity rising at faster pace&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Joseph A. Giannone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The most promising investment

expansion of Asian markets, the rest of the world will
represent a bigger and bigger share of the global marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ciliano cited Ibbotson Associates research showing the U.S.

&lt;p&gt;Codenomicon Provides Fuzzing Tools and Services for Companies Implementing SDL
CUPERTINO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Codenomicon, a leading vendor of proactive software security testing solutions,
has been selected to participate as a tool vendor in Microsoft's SDL Pro
Network. The network guides and supports development teams as they integrate
Microsoft's Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) into their operations.
Codenomicon's fuzzing solutions complement the services provided by the SDL Pro
Network by helping companies to integrate security and robustness testing into
their development process and verify the quality of their software before
deployment. 

Fuzzing is a natural part of the SDL: the entire fuzzing methodology promotes
building security into systems, instead of protecting vulnerable systems. The
idea behind fuzzing is simple: unexpected data is fed to the inputs of a system
and the behavior of the system is then monitored. If the system crashes, then
there is a bug in the software, which could have been exploited by attackers.
Codenomicon's intelligent tests are based on protocol models, thus they cover
the entire protocol implementation and achieve unparalleled efficiency in
finding both known and unknown vulnerabilities. 

"Microsoft's SDL is the industry-leading proactive software security assurance
process. By emphasizing the importance of building security into software
products in every phase of the software development lifecycle, Microsoft's SDL
has succeeded in making security an integral part of software development," said
David Chartier, CEO of Codenomicon. "Codenomicon is proud to have been selected
among the leading security vendors of the SDL Pro Network," he continues. 

Fuzzing should be used in every step in the software development lifecycle, from
the first unit tests performed by developers to the last acceptance tests made
before the product is released. The earlier vulnerabilities are discovered the
easier and cheaper it is to fix to them, thus security testing is most
effective, when it is integrated into the development process. Codenomicon
provides off-the-shelf tools for all standard or proprietary protocols making it
easy for companies to integrate fuzzing into their SDL. Especially, as the
company's intelligent fuzzers significantly reduce the test execution times. 

Codenomicon Defensics is the market leading proactive fuzzing tool. The
state-of-the-art protocol modeling and test generation technique ensures market
leading test coverage and test efficiency. It provides better test results by
finding more security issues, and in less time. Protocol sequence and test case
editing enables you to customize and add test cases and scenarios. General
purpose tools such as Traffic Capture Fuzzer and Defensics for XML enable users
to test any type of proprietary protocols and SOAP/XML applications. Defensics
products are easy to integrate into existing tool libraries provided by
Microsoft and third parties. Moreover, the comprehensive reporting capabilities
and flexible licensing models enable reporting and reproduction capabilities
across the entire software development organization.

whitepaper from: http://www.codenomicon.com/sdl-fuzzing/. 

About SDL Pro Network:

The SDL Pro Network is a group of security consultants, training companies, and
tool providers that specialize in application security and have substantial
experience and expertise with the methodology and technologies of the SDL.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration's proposed "Volcker rule" could impact about 10 percent of Goldman Sachs (GS.N) net revenues, a senior executive of the Wall Street giant told a U.S. Senate committee on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His remarks came in the second of two hearings this week by the Senate Banking Committee on Obama administration proposals made last month to limit risk-taking by major banks in the wake of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gerald Corrigan, a Goldman managing director, told the hearing about the potential impact of the proposals to curb proprietary trading by banks and get them out of hedge fund and private equity businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you took net revenues associated with ... proprietary trading and hedge fund and private equity funds, we are in net revenues talking about something over the cycle in the broad order of magnitude of 10 percent," Corrigan told the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House has shifted to a more aggressive stance on Wall Street since the Democrats lost a Senate seat in a special election in Massachusetts in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The election highlighted voter resentment against big banks and big bonuses in the wake of massive bailouts during the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the outset of the hearing, Democratic committee Chairman Christopher Dodd blasted banks and Wall Street for a refusal to work with Congress on a range of proposed financial reforms that "borders on insulting to the American people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Criticizing firms for hiring "an army of lobbyists" to fight reforms, Dodd said Obama's new proposals were on the right track, but "will be no easy feat" to implement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corrigan, a former president of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) Chief Risk Officer Barry Zubrow both expressed support for some of the financial regulatory reforms being considered by Congress since 2008, when taxpayers bailed out both firms and many others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two bank executives backed creation of a "systemic regulator" to monitor the economic big picture, and find a way for the government to dismantle large, troubled financial firms in an orderly fashion. Both proposals have wide political support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corrigan said more global cooperation is needed on accounting, bank supervision and economic policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stressed the importance of mark-to-market accounting, or pricing assets at market value, and said tightening the Federal Reserve's emergency lending authority would reduce the "probability of future financial crises."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corrigan is a member of the Group of Thirty, an organization of bankers and regulators chaired by Paul Volcker, the former Fed chairman who is now an Obama economic adviser.

"I tend to favor Mr. Volcker's thought on regulating some of these kinds of activities," Reed said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also called for stronger capital and liquidity standards, more exchange-trading of financial products and a "compartmentalized" financial industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reed also advocated establishing a regulator for consumer finance, saying, "There is a good reason to create a Consumer Protection Agency with a clear and separate mandate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creation of an agency to shield Americans from abusive mortgages, credit cards and other financial products is one of the Obama administration's most controversial proposals for tighter financial oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Andrew Hay)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/129660/emerging_markets_d) has
announced the addition of the "Emerging Markets Development Survey 2009, v2"
report to their offering. 

The Emerging Markets Development Survey series is the most comprehensive
research survey series in existence focused exclusively on developers and IT
managers in the Emerging Markets. The regions surveyed for the report are:
China, India, Brazil, Eastern Europe and Russia. This survey is a companion to
the North American, EMEA, and APAC Development Surveys. The Emerging Markets
Development Survey has extensive analysis on platform and language use, the
gradual acceptance of Linux, the advent and increasing adoption of wireless
technologies and Web Services, as well as technology adoption of all kinds. 

Conducted biannually, 400+ developers 

Executive Summary:

Microsoft SQL Server is the most used database in the emerging markets of China,
India, Eastern Europe, and Latin America, according to a new survey of over 400
developers from Evans Data Corp shows, but MySQL is closing that lead. Over 50%
of developers in the emerging market countries claim to be using Microsoft's
version of SQL Server, but 46% use MySQL. MySQL is slightly stronger in India
and Latin America, but MS SQL Server leads in China and Latin America. 

The extensive survey of over 400 software developers in the emerging markets
measures intentions and adoption patterns through in-depth interviews on
subjects related to Wireless development. This includes platforms, carriers,
programs, tools, and the business of wireless development and distribution of
wireless applications. 

Other highlights from the survey include:

* AJAX has strong adoption across regions but shows more strength in Eastern
Europe and India 
* Visual Basic is still used by more than half of the developers in Latin
America, though usually for a small part of their programming time, whereas in
Eastern Europe, Visual Basic use has shrunk to about 30% 
* When comparing the four regions, India has far largest development teams on
average than either Latin America or Eastern Europe.

Key Topics Covered:

* DEMOGRAPHICS 
* PLATFORM USE AND MIGRATIONS 
* LANGUAGE USE 
* SCRIPTING LANGUAGE USE 
* CLOUD COMPUTING 
* WEB SERVICES AND SOA 
* ARCHITECTURE AND TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION 
* JAVA DEVELOPMENT 
* DATABASE DEVELOPMENT 
* PARALLEL PROGRAMMING 
* VIRTUALIZATION 
* DEVELOPMENT TOOLS AND AGILE DEVELOPMENT

&lt;p&gt; * Lauto will be a managing director in New York&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * He spent more than 30 years with Goldman Sachs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Morgan Stanley is expanding trading operations
  (Updates sourcing, details, and background on past hires)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley (MS.N) has hired
a  Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) veteran to help lead the firm's
equity-trading business, according to an internal memo, the
latest in a series of moves designed to bolster the firm's
sales and trading operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anthony Lauto, who spent more than 30 years with chief
rival Goldman Sachs, will join Morgan Stanley's New York office
as a managing director, the memo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley -- widely seen as mistiming its pullback
from risk -- began building up its sales and trading ranks in
the second half of 2009 as it planned to hire as many as 400
people. The hires were targeted to Morgan Stanley's foreign
exchange, emerging markets and equity derivatives businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The firm in July hired Jack DiMaio, a former Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN.VX) fixed-income head for North America, as
global head of interest rate, credit and currency trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But weak trading results still weighed on Morgan Stanley's
fourth-quarter earnings. Morgan Stanley's trading revenue
dropped 65 percent to $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter from
$3.2 billion in the third quarter. [ID:nN19222799]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News first reported the hire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Shailesh Kuber in Bangalore and Steve Eder in

Announce Acceptance Rate of Over 97 Percent for Data Security Breach Settlement Agreement</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;PRINCETON, N.J. &amp; SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Financial institutions representing more than 97 percent of eligible
Visa-branded credit and debit cards have accepted the Alternative Recovery
Offers they received pursuant to the settlement entered into by Visa Inc.
(NYSE:V), Heartland Payment Systems (NYSE: HPY) and Heartland`s sponsoring
acquirers last month. This level of acceptance fulfills the 80 percent opt-in
condition that was one of the requirements of the $60 million settlement. The
settlement provides these issuers with a recovery from Heartland with respect to
losses they may have incurred from the 2008 criminal breach of the payment
processor`s payment system network. 

To provide additional issuers an opportunity to work through the mechanics of
the opt-in process and not be excluded from the benefits of the settlement,
Visa, Heartland and Heartland`s sponsoring acquirers have agreed to renew the
Alternative Recovery Offer to the non-accepting issuers. The renewed offers will
remain open until 5:00 p.m. PST on Monday, February 8, 2010. 

"Visa is pleased to bring this issue to a close for so many financial
institutions," said Ellen Richey, chief enterprise risk officer, Visa Inc.
"Working with Heartland on this settlement to provide a certain recovery, prompt
payment and a streamlined process resulted in an equitable and expedient
resolution for all parties." 

Bob Carr, Heartland`s chairman and chief executive officer, concurred: "Reaching
a fair settlement agreement that helps issuers of Visa-branded cards was a key
priority for Heartland. Now, these issuers will be able to immediately obtain a
recovery for their Visa-related claims." 

The settlement provides recovery for U.S. card issuers who chose to participate
in the program and international issuers of accounts Visa considered to have
been placed at risk of compromise. Once all remaining conditions of the
settlement have been satisfied, Visa will be notifying participating U.S.
issuers and international issuers with details about the payment process. For
additional questions, issuers can contact their Visa account executive or Visa`s
E-Support Team at eSupport@visa.com or 888.847.2488.

&lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel and the Palestinians may resume indirect peace deliberations soon, with a U.S. mediator shuttling between negotiating teams, an Israeli cabinet minister said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Echoing comments made by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a day earlier, cabinet minister Gilad Erdan said: "Sometimes it takes more than two to tango. And sometimes you need a third party to bring the positions closer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked on Israel Radio if the resumption of negotiations, stalled for more than a year, would be in the format of proximity talks through U.S. mediation, Erdan said: "Yes, indeed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palestinian officials did not confirm Erdan's remarks, but pointed out that U.S. Middle East envoy George Mitchell has made more than a dozen visits to the region to try to revive peace negotiations leading to the creation of a Palestinian state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has said he would return to the negotiating table only after Israel stopped settlement building in the occupied West Bank. He termed insufficient a limited construction freeze announced by Netanyahu in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Abbas told Britain's Guardian newspaper earlier this week that proximity talks could be a way to restart the negotiating process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such shuttle diplomacy could allow Abbas to pursue a peace deal without dropping his settlement freeze demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DIPLOMATIC DANCE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netanyahu said in a speech on Wednesday he had reason to hope the negotiations could resume within weeks and reiterated Israel was ready to renew without preconditions the talks that have not convened since a Gaza war erupted in December 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the Middle East, sometimes it takes three to even start to tango -- but I hope that after this we will be able to dance as a couple," he said, in apparent reference to U.S.-mediated negotiations as a prelude to a resumption of direct talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about the possibility of reviving negotiations, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told Reuters the success of U.S. diplomatic efforts depended on Israel halting settlement construction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel has refused to cease building homes for Jews in and around East Jerusalem which it captured in a 1967 war and annexed as part of its capital in a move not recognized internationally. Palestinians want the city to be capital of a future state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ari Rabinovitch in Jerusalem and Mohammed Assadi in Ramallah; editing by Philippa Fletcher)&lt;/p&gt;

"Over the last two years, we&#8217;ve done just that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the products being released this year will be the last containing a search core compatible with Linux and Unix, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is logic behind Microsoft's decision, according to Olstad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although I understand that focusing on Windows will be a hard change for some of our customers, I&#8217;m convinced that it&#8217;s the right thing to do because it will accelerate our rate of innovation," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is trying to make the move easier on affected customers, Olstad added.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will always interoperate with non-Windows systems on both the front- and back-end.  Our search solutions will crawl and index content stored on Windows, Linux, and Unix systems, and our UI controls will work with UI frameworks running on any operating system," he stated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, it will support ESP 5.3, the search core for the products that will be released this year, for 10 years. Customers who decide to keep running the core on Unix or Linux can "add Windows-only innovations or cloud-based services by using a mixed-platform architecture," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is also rolling out an "upgrade program" that will "help customers evaluate our hosted solutions and/or a Windows-based deployment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, "there&#8217;s no immediate action required as a result of this announcement&#8212;and I expect that most of you will stay with your current deployments for some time," Olstad added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A significant number of customers are running Fast on Linux or Unix, according to Jared Spataro, director of enterprise search at Microsoft. He declined to provide specific figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft made the announcement now in order to give those users plenty of time to prepare, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Microsoft's move came as a surprise to Gartner analyst Whit Andrews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I honestly thought ... that in order to continue to win and execute the most visionary installations, they would need to continue to support Linux," Andrews said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's promises of continued interoperability offer some comfort, he said. "This doesn't mean Microsoft is casting out Linux users from their customer base. There will be people running Fast on Linux right out to the 10-year limit."Meanwhile, Microsoft's announcement raises another question: whether it will continue offering a standalone search product for the long term, given its moves to align the Fast technology with its SharePoint collaboration platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no plans at this time to drop a standalone version, although Microsoft doesn't tend to "project out any further than one product wave," Spataro said. "When we look at any strategy, we really are looking at market demand. [Right now] we certainly hear there's a need for a standalone version."&lt;/p&gt;

 (Updates throughout)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Steve Eder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Feb 5 (Reuters) - In a sign it is concerned about
Main Street anger over bankers' compensation, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc (GS.N) decided to give its CEO Lloyd Blankfein and
other top executives lower bonuses than many had expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, which reported a record profit for 2009, will pay
the executives bonuses in stock worth $9 million each, far
below what they got in the previous record profit year of 2007.
Blankfein received $67.9 million for that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bonus, which was less than the roughly $16 million that
rival bank JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was rewarded with earlier
in the day, was far below the $100 million that at least one
British newspaper had predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The decision follows months of criticism of Goldman, partly
because of expectations that its soaring profits would lead to
massive bonuses just over a year after it was aided by the
government through bailout funds and other financial support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein's bonus is such that he will not even be among
the highest paid people at Goldman, the firm he has run since
2006. Star traders and bankers within Goldman's ranks will
almost certainly be receiving more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He is going to have a lot of people two levels below him
who are making more than he does," said Alan Johnson, a Wall
Street Compensation consultant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein's bonus is an increase from last year, when he
did not take one. He received a base salary of $600,000 for
2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The firm made it clear in a statement that external
pressures had contributed to the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The firm produced very good results for 2009, but the
environment is very difficult and the board was mindful of that
difficult environment in making decisions about executive
compensation," Goldman spokesman Lucas van Praag said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein, along with President and Chief Operating Officer
Gary Cohn and Chief Financial Officer David Viniar, received
58,381 stock units, worth $8.99 million based on Friday's
closing share price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The units do not convert into shares until 2011 at the
earliest, and once converted they cannot be sold or transferred
before January 2015, according to the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was not immediately clear whether the reserved stock
could be used as collateral for loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 'WAY BELOW THE MARKET'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The smaller than expected pay packages were the latest sign
of how Goldman has sought to soften its image after being
excoriated by some commentators and politicians for reaping
huge profits after benefiting from various forms of government
help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein, himself, has found himself in the spotlight time
and again during the past year, most notably after he told
London's Sunday Times newspaper in November that banks serve a
social purpose and are doing "God's work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The backlash against Goldman has fueled efforts in
Washington to enact reforms against the banking industry and to
crack down on banker pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Goldman has answered critics in recent months by
announcing top managers would be paid no cash, all stock
bonuses, and by surprisingly capping its compensation pool at
$16.2 billion for the year -- well short of the $20 billion
record set in 2007. It has also made larger charitable
contributions than in other years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He has quickly gotten religion in terms of being
responsive to the ill populist winds that are blowing in his
face," said  David Dietze, chief investment officer at Point
View Financial Services, a Goldman Sachs shareholder. "The
citizenry is just outraged that these companies, which took
TARP, so quickly turned around and forgot their humble bailouts
and are showering themselves with cash."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman received and later repaid a $10 billion taxpayer
from the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program, but
also benefited from the rescue of its counterparts, including
American International Group Inc (AIG.N), and through cheap
borrowing from the Federal Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Goldman has managed its way through a difficult year in
terms of public relations, some are convinced that 2009 bonuses
will be a mere blip for the firm known for its payouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They got paid pretty well the past couple of years, so
maybe they can just pay themselves less well this year, then
maybe it blows over in a year or two and they can start paying
themselves pretty handsomely again," said Blake Howells,
director of equity research at Becker Capital in Portland,
Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He called the pay amount "small and pretty restrictive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon's bonus was in a mixture of restricted shares and
options, and he did not take a cash bonus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs shares closed up 2.3 percent on Friday at
$154.16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For additional Reuters Breakingviews commentary, please see

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is expanding its search arrangement with Facebook but reining in its advertising deal with the social-networking site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bing already runs search on Facebook in the U.S. But on Friday, Microsoft said Bing would also provide search results for all of Facebook's 400 million users around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also said that it would offer Facebook users additional Bing features, although it did not describe which. "Our two companies will soon provide Facebook users with a more complete search experience by providing full access to great Bing features beyond a set of links, including richer answers combined with tools that help customers make faster, smarter decisions," Jon Tinter, general manager for Bing, wrote in a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the expanded search deal, however, Microsoft said it will stop handling display advertisements for Facebook. Facebook will sell display ads on its own, Tinter said. "Given the kinds of advertisements that make sense within a product as unique as Facebook, it just made more sense for them to take the lead on this part of their advertising strategy," he wrote. Microsoft will continue to provide search advertisements to Facebook, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late last year the companies said that Microsoft would display Facebook users' public status updates and messages in Bing search results. At the time, Facebook said it would have to first roll out its publisher privacy control system to make sure that private messages weren't being indexed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinter said that Facebook users would start to see "fruits of our expanded relationship ... in the weeks and months ahead."&lt;/p&gt;

Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He called the pay amount "small and pretty restrictive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon's bonus was in a mixture of restricted shares and

&lt;p&gt; * Facebook takes full control of display ads business&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Alters and extends ad partnership with Microsoft&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft will keep providing search ads on Facebook&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Alexei Oreskovic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Facebook is taking full
control of display ads on the world's No. 1 social networking
website, cutting short an exclusive deal that had allowed
Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to manage part of that business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Microsoft -- the exclusive provider of Web search
on Facebook -- will continue to sell text-based search ads on
the website as the partners extended the arrangement beyond
2011, when it had been due to expire. A Facebook spokesman
declined to say how long the deal has been extended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft also said it will further integrate its Bing
search engine into Facebook while expanding its reach beyond
the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Facebook, which counts nearly 400 million users, said its
own display ads feature interactive aspects and can target
viewers based on their personal information, making them better
suited to its social networking service than Microsoft's
standard Web banner ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Ad formats that feature social actions perform better and
provide a better user experience since they are more consistent
with the look and feel of Facebook," the company said in a
statement. "This combination of targeting and social relevance
is the primary driver behind the shift in strategy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Facebook said it stopped displaying Microsoft banner ads in
some international markets recently, and following additional
talks with Microsoft, has agreed to stop running the banner ads
across all of Facebook. The change will take place over the
next 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Facebook has long sold its own display ads on users'
profile pages and other parts of the site, but the company
allowed Microsoft to sell banner ads in certain sections of its
website in 2006. The deal, which was extended in 2007, runs
until 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Facebook spokesperson would not provide details on
whether the advertising deal with Microsoft entailed any
revenue sharing agreement, or whether Facebook would pay
Microsoft a fee for altering the deal early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The news comes as Facebook has increased its focus on its
financial performance. In September, Facebook said it had
become free cash flow positive -- meaning that the company
makes enough money to cover the costs associated with running
the service -- ahead of schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said on its corporate blog on Friday that
searches will bring up information from Bing beyond just links
to websites. The search engine will expand worldwide, beyond
the United States, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Facebook, which lets users connect and share information
with friends online, has emerged as one of the Internet's most
popular destinations and is increasingly challenging the Web's
established powerhouses like Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) and Google Inc
(GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft invested $240 million in Facebook for a 1.6
percent stake in the company in October 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Thursday, Facebook said it expected to reach 400 million
active users of its site within the week, representing a gain
of 50 million new users since December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic; Editing by Richard Chang)

&lt;p&gt; * Brazil exposure cut in JPMorgan model&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Risks include rate hike, election, asset inflation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Growth, earnings prospects seen offsetting risks
 (Adds details on risk aversion, updates prices)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Guillermo Parra-Bernal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAO PAULO, Brazil, Feb 5 (Reuters) - As Brazilian assets
bear the brunt of recent turmoil in global markets, investors
should reduce their exposure to the local stock market as new
domestic risks emerge, JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) analysts said in
a report on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The benchmark Bovespa stock index .BVSP has tumbled 8.4
percent since Jan. 20 on concerns over the ability of some
European nations to cut their budget deficits and the strength
of the U.S. economic recovery. The index was down for a third
straight day on Friday, shedding 2.8 percent, the lowest level
since early October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We reduced our Brazil position as the domestic trade is
overowned, exposed to rising local volatility associated with
the rate cycle, foreign exchange rate and asset reflation
concerns, and presidential election noise," JPMorgan analysts,
led by Ben Laidler, said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Bovespa was the world's best-performing stock market
last year, fueled by an ease in risk aversion and perceptions
over Brazil's strong stand during the global recession.
Strategists at several banks and money managers including
Citigroup and BlackRock expect the Bovespa to surge past 77,000
points by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet, Laidler said declines in Brazilian stocks could be "only
partially offset by strong earnings growth and high visibility."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Recently Brazilian government officials have warned
investors over the hefty gains that the nation's currency and
stocks underwent last year and said "excessive euphoria" might
have triggered them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Riskier asset classes such as stocks, credit, commodities
and emerging markets will likely continue to lose ground as
investors seek to exit those trades due to mixed news about the
global recovery and rising policy risks, JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Laidler said Mexico remains JPMorgan's top pick in Latin
America due to a faster-than-expected economic recovery and an
undervalued currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Emerging market equity funds saw redemptions for two weeks
running, with the most recent weekly data showing outflows of
about $1.6 billion, the highest since September, the report
noted. "Momentum has turned negative," Laidler said, adding
that Brazil has now turned a "consensus Neutral/Underweight"
territory for investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors, however, might be betting on a recovery in the
Bovespa in coming weeks as worries subside. The stock futures
contract on the Bovespa due in April INDJ0 is now trading
close to the 63,000 point mark.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. may be close to adding a new way for big businesses to buy Microsoft Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under a new license called "union, Microsoft would charge enterprises the same for software whether it is hosted on-premises or in the cloud, according to a report in SDTimes earlier this week that quoted unnamed Microsoft channel partners who had been told of the program. No prices were listed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new license would help reduce complexity for large companies with workers with widely varying degrees of software usage. Heavy and regular users of a Microsoft app might require an on-premise server version, while light users can make do with a hosted version from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SDTimes said the union license would either apply to Microsoft Office run locally and hosted on the just-launched Windows Azure, or to Exchange and SharePoint, which Microsoft offers in software and hosted form. The latter is via Microsoft's year-and-a-half-old Business Productivity Online Suite (BPOS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did not reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul DeGroot, an analyst with the independent research firm, Directions on Microsoft, said "union" could be a new bundle that combines Office 2010 (on-premise) with Office Web Apps and, to store the data from the latter, SharePoint Online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would allow Microsoft to maximize its revenue without driving customers toward cheap and free solutions such as Google Apps, Zoho and VMware's recently acquired Zimbra e-mail app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So in an effort to have it both ways, Microsoft may ask the customer to pay for both ways, license plus subscription," DeGroot wrote in an e-mail. "My view is that both the economics (buy an expensive product so you can use a cheap one) and practicality (one user working across the feature sets of two doc creation apps) of that is unattractive, and the risk is that very few customers will take them up on that offer. That would not be good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Lai covers Windows and Linux, desktop applications, databases and business intelligence for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co JPM.N, which reported $11.7 billion in profit in 2009, awarded Chief Executive Jamie Dimon a compensation package worth about $16 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bankers' compensation has been a hot-button issue amid the financial crisis, as the U.S. government spent billions in taxpayer funds to prop up the banking system. JPMorgan, which in the summer returned the $25 billion it received from the U.S. Treasury, said Dimon, 53, will not take a cash bonus for the second year running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 195,704 shares Dimon received on Wednesday are restricted until January 2013, while the 563,562 so-called stock appreciation rights or options expire in January 2020 and have an exercise price of $43.20, according to an SEC filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 195,704 shares were worth about $7.9 million at the market close on Wednesday. The options, according to a commonly used valuation method, could be worth around $8 million, according to compensation consultant Alan Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon's total compensation for 2009 will be higher than last year, when he also did not get stock or option awards, but it is a far cry from the almost $30 million in cash, stock and options he received for 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pay for Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive at investment banking rival Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N), could overshadow Dimon's compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is expected to slash Blankfein's bonus from the record $67.9 million he received two years ago, but he is still in the running to get more than $40 million for 2009, according to one compensation consultant.

&lt;p&gt;IBM has opened a football field-size data center in North Carolina it says will rely heavily on outside air for cooling as it turns up the heat inside, gradually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new data center, about 60,000 square-feet in the Research Triangle Park N.C., incorporates IBM's latest approaches to energy. It includes thousands of sensors that dynamically monitor temperature, humidity, air flow and circuits all of which is integrated into the building's management and IT systems. The data center will be supporting cloud platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we tried to do here is have a data center that is more instrumented, interconnected and intelligent than anything we have done before," said Joe Dzaluk, IBM's vice president of infrastructure and resource management at the Global Technology Services division. The data center will use about 6 MWs of power initially, but is designed to be expanded to 100,000 square feet and 15 MWs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the things the company is doing to reduce energy usage is to adopt latest environmental recommendations by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, which allow the temperature for data center equipment from the old recommendation of 77 degrees Fahrenheit to 80.6 , reflecting improvements in equipment design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The maximum temperature involves certain moisture ranges as well. IBM will start at 75 degrees and inch its way up over time, in part because the data center will have some non-IBM equipment running in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data center will also use outside air to cool radiators and chill water, and the company believes it will be able to take advantage of outside temperatures for cooling more for more than half the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dzaluk said that once measurements are taken he expects the data center will be among the most efficient in the world, with a Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) ratio of about 1.2 to 1.3. Facebook Inc. recently announced a new data center in Prineville, Ore ., that it says it expects a PUE ratio of 1.15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PUE is the ratio of total facility power, including everything from the cooling systems, UPS, and lighting, to IT equipment power, the load associated with all IT equipment, and the servers and storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PUE rating isn't perfect. David Cappuccio, chief of research, infrastructure at Gartner, said PUE rating doesn't tell you how efficiently someone is running their equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to be moved up on a method for data center managers to compare their efficiency against industry standards. The EPA has been gathering data from more than 100 companies to develop a benchmarking standard, along the lines of its Energy Star, that may use the PUE or a close relative to assess the power efficiency of a data center. It may be released in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cappuccio said he expects that the EPA standard will increase pressure on data center managers who will likely be asked to explain how they compare with that federal recommendation. That may drive more data center construction business, he said.0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big vendors, such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard and most recently Dell with its acquisition of Perot System last fall , have been adding capability to meet the data center needs of their clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cappuccio said data center consulting is a line of services that could help could help these companies across their other lines. "If I contracted IBM to help me build a data center and they did a good job, the likelihood that I would use IBM services for something else is pretty high," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patrick Thibodeau covers SaaS and enterprise applications, outsourcing, government IT policies, data centers and IT workforce issues for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;- New tools enable developers to easily exploit all areas of Visual Studio 2010
-
ROCKVILLE, Md.--(Business Wire)--
Micro Focus (LSE.MCRO.L), a leading provider of Enterprise Application
Modernization, Testing and Management solutions,today announces four new product
releases that will enable customers to develop, analyze and test the highest
quality code, greatly simplifying the tasks and challenges faced by application
developers. All of these products will be fully integrated with Visual Studio
2010, allowing developers to improve efficiency and productivity by utilizing
Micro Focus` developer tools directly from within Visual Studio 2010. 

Micro Focus COBOL enables developers to exploit existing enterprise applications
on the Microsoft platform. The majority of organizations that still operate
COBOL-based applications now have a low risk opportunity to take advantage of
Visual Studio 2010 without the need for rewriting their applications. The time
savings this generates will enable higher productivity and deliver improved
ease-of-use for developers, as well as allowing them to exploit emerging
platforms and environments, such as Cloud Computing. 

Micro Focus Silk4J, the proven choice of QA professionals for powerful,
functional and regression test automation, brings the best test automation
capabilities to Visual Studio 2010. It will create the opportunity to build
quality applications earlier in the lifecycle and ensure they are seamlessly
integrated. This will eliminate lengthy testing processes and will allow
organizations to maximize return on investment (ROI), while minimizing time
expended on the critical testing process. Additionally, due to Micro Focus`
agnostic approach, Silk4J supports all applications, whether currently on a
Microsoft platform or not. 

Micro Focus DevPartner Studio, a suite that enables developers to debug,
analyze, test and tune applications, will deliver enhanced visibility into the
inner workings of applications being developed within Visual Studio 2010. Such
capability will enable developers to rapidly identify and remedy any problem or
glitch with the application under development, ensuring rapid root cause
analysis and increased developer efficiency. DevPartner will also help
organizations validate their applications before and after upgrading to Visual
Studio 2010, ensuring complete business continuity and maximizing developer
productivity. 

Micro Focus Analyzer Express for Visual Studio, a visibility tool, will help
developers accelerate their day-to-day maintenance activities. Developers
currently find it difficult to understand the structure and behavior of their
complex applications. This slows the execution of much needed business
requirements. Analyzer Express traces data flow through a program with one click
of the mouse from within Visual Studio 2010. Developers can quickly assess a
program, find artifacts of interest, and make needed enhancements without
switching tools. 

"We are delighted to be offering customers the ability to develop and deliver
higher quality products," said Peter Duffell, Vice President, Strategic Partners
of Micro Focus. "Our presence in the roll-out of Visual Studio 2010 demonstrates
both the relevance of core COBOL assets within global organizations` IT
infrastructures and the demand from the developer community to exploit them on
Microsoft platforms. As we look forward to the future, Micro Focus will continue
to work closely with its customers to provide them with tools, applications and
software to support their business and vision for success." 

Neil Willby, Systems Director at Eurorealm Consultants Ltd., a Beta customer for
the new Micro Focus COBOL, confirmed: "We`re excited to see Micro Focus playing
such an integral role in the launch of Visual Studio 2010. COBOL continues to
play a major part in today`s economy, so it is essential that Visual Studio 2010
embraces these tools and allows the developer ecosystem to evolve existing core
applications on new platforms." 

About Micro Focus

Micro Focus, a member of the FTSE 250, provides innovative software that allows
companies to dramatically improve the business value of their enterprise
applications. Micro Focus Enterprise Application Modernization, Testing and
Management software enables customers` business applications to respond rapidly

&lt;p&gt;http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100204006586/en

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and DxS (a wholly owned subsidiary of QIAGEN N.V.)
(NASDAQ: QGEN; Frankfurt, Prime Standard: QIA) today announced that they have
entered into an agreement to develop a companion diagnostic test kit for
PF-04948568 (CDX-110), an immunotherapy vaccine in development for the treatment
of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Financial terms of the diagnostic agreement
have not been disclosed. 

On April 16, 2008, Pfizer and Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. entered into an
agreement to grant Pfizer an exclusive worldwide license to PF-04948568
(CDX-110) which is currently in Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment
of newly diagnosed GBM. 

Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in
adults and occurs in around 25,000 patients worldwide each year. Pfizer`s
investigational drug PF-04948568 (CDX-110) is a peptide vaccine which targets
the tumor-specific Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor variant III (EGFRvIII), a
mutated form of the epidermal growth factor receptor that is only present in
cancer cells and occurs in 25-40 percent of GBM tumors. The QIAGEN assay is
designed to identify those patients whose tumors express the EGFRvIII mutation,
allowing for the possibility of more targeted and personalized treatment. 

The EGFRvIII companion diagnostic will be developed and manufactured at QIAGEN`s
Center of Excellence for Companion Diagnostics in Manchester, UK. The diagnostic
will be a real-time PCR assay used to detect EGFRvIII RNA in tumor tissue. The
assay is designed to offer a simple workflow, which supports its clinical
utility in routine mutation testing. 

Commenting on this announcement, Dr. Stephen Little, Vice President Personalized
Healthcare, for QIAGEN, said, "We are very pleased to have signed this agreement
with Pfizer, as it is another important step toward the realization of
personalized medicine. QIAGEN is aligned to deliver companion diagnostics to our
pharmaceutical partners and this deal is further evidence of our commitment to
develop our scientific and operational capabilities to help select the right
patient for the right medicine." 

"We look forward to collaborating with QIAGEN's DxS unit in the development of
this important diagnostic tool that could potentially help physicians better
define the most appropriate treatment for patients who suffer from glioblastoma
multiforme," said Garry Nicholson, president and general manager of Pfizer`s
Oncology Business Unit.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - In a sign it is concerned about Main Street anger over bankers' compensation, Goldman Sachs Group Inc decided to give its CEO Lloyd Blankfein and other top executives lower bonuses than many had expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which reported a record profit for 2009, will pay the executives bonuses in stock worth $9 million each, far below what they got in the previous record profit year of 2007. Blankfein received $67.9 million for that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bonus, which was less than the roughly $16 million that rival bank JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was rewarded with earlier in the day, was far below the $100 million that at least one British newspaper had predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision follows months of criticism of Goldman, partly because of expectations that its soaring profits would lead to massive bonuses just over a year after it was aided by the government through bailout funds and other financial support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein's bonus is such that he will not even be among the highest paid people at Goldman, the firm he has run since 2006. Star traders and bankers within Goldman's ranks will almost certainly be receiving more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He is going to have a lot of people two levels below him who are making more than he does," said Alan Johnson, a Wall Street Compensation consultant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein's bonus is an increase from last year, when he did not take one. He received a base salary of $600,000 for 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm made it clear in a statement that external pressures had contributed to the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The firm produced very good results for 2009, but the environment is very difficult and the board was mindful of that difficult environment in making decisions about executive compensation," Goldman spokesman Lucas van Praag said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, along with President and Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn and Chief Financial Officer David Viniar, received 58,381 stock units, worth $8.99 million based on Friday's closing share price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The units do not convert into shares until 2011 at the earliest, and once converted they cannot be sold or transferred before January 2015, according to the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear whether the reserved stock could be used as collateral for loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'WAY BELOW THE MARKET'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The smaller than expected pay packages were the latest sign of how Goldman has sought to soften its image after being excoriated by some commentators and politicians for reaping huge profits after benefiting from various forms of government help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, himself, has found himself in the spotlight time and again during the past year, most notably after he told London's Sunday Times newspaper in November that banks serve a social purpose and are doing "God's work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The backlash against Goldman has fueled efforts in Washington to enact reforms against the banking industry and to crack down on banker pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman has answered critics in recent months by announcing top managers would be paid no cash, all stock bonuses, and by surprisingly capping its compensation pool at $16.2 billion for the year -- well short of the $20 billion record set in 2007. It has also made larger charitable contributions than in other years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He has quickly gotten religion in terms of being responsive to the ill populist winds that are blowing in his face," said David Dietze, chief investment officer at Point View Financial Services, a Goldman Sachs shareholder. "The citizenry is just outraged that these companies, which took TARP, so quickly turned around and forgot their humble bailouts and are showering themselves with cash."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman received and later repaid a $10 billion taxpayer from the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program, but also benefited from the rescue of its counterparts, including American International Group Inc, and through cheap borrowing from the Federal Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Goldman has managed its way through a difficult year in terms of public relations, some are convinced that 2009 bonuses will be a mere blip for the firm known for its payouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They got paid pretty well the past couple of years, so maybe they can just pay themselves less well this year, then maybe it blows over in a year or two and they can start paying themselves pretty handsomely again," said Blake Howells, director of equity research at Becker Capital in Portland, Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He called the pay amount "small and pretty restrictive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon's bonus was in a mixture of restricted shares and options, and he did not take a cash bonus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shares closed up 2.3 percent on Friday at $154.16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder; additional reporting by Jonathan Stempel and Elinor Comlay; editing by Carol Bishopric, Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are investigating whether the mortgage insurance market was improperly distressed in 2008 because of payment demands that Goldman Sachs Group Inc and other banks made on American International Group Inc, The New York Times reported on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a conference call between Goldman and AIG executives early that year, the Wall Street bank wanted the insurer to pay more than the $2 billion it already paid to cover losses Goldman said it might suffer on complex securities, the paper said, citing AIG documents and an audio recording of the call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIG executives wanted some of the $2 billion back, saying Goldman had inflated the potential losses, the paper said, adding the call ended with nothing settled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the world's biggest insurer, AIG insured Goldman's securities. It was bailed out with a $182.3 billion government aid package when the mortgage market-inspired financial crisis struck later in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the Securities and Exchange Commission is examining whether the demands by banks were improper, the paper reported, citing people briefed on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the New York Times' third attempt to develop a conspiracy theory about Goldman Sachs and AIG," Goldman spokesman Lucas van Praag said in an email. "The theories are disgracefully contradictory and the 'facts' don't stand up to serious scrutiny."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve's bailout of the insurer remains controversial because it funneled nearly $70 billion to 16 big U.S. and European banks that had bought credit default swaps from AIG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, Societe Generale and other banks had bought those insurance-like derivatives to guard against defaults on hundreds of securities backed by subprime mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A portion of the $11 billion in taxpayer money that went to SocGen, the French bank, was later transferred to Goldman under a deal struck by the two banks, the Times also reported, citing two people with knowledge of the positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for AIG said it had no comment.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON--(Business Wire)--
Alan Johnson's announcement of tougher student visa rules requiring applicants
to speak a certain level of English represents a victory for the education
sector, which united in protest against the proposed changes to the points based
student visa system. 

Of the eight recommendations proposed by the UKBA in the review announced by
Gordon Brown in November last year, only one has been implemented. The most
controversial of the proposals - to raise the minimum qualification level for
non-EU student visa applicants to NQF4* - was refused after universities,
industry bodies, such as Universities UK and private education providers united
in protest. A petition on the Downing Street website against the proposals
secured 8,000 signatures. 

James Pitman, Managing Director at Study Group, the UK's largest independent
provider of international students to the HE sector, commented: 

"The government has listened to our concerns about proposed changes that would
have crippled an education and training export industry that earns universities
&#163;5.3 billion and the economy &#163;32 billion annually, and is responsible for around
28,000 jobs in HE alone. Over half of all international students entering
universities in the UK each year do so via A-levels or foundation courses taken
in Britain, and we are delighted that this route to higher education will remain
open to legitimate students, thanks to the government's decision not to change
the minimum qualification for visa applications. 

"We think that the measures to require a certain standard of English announced
yesterday by Mr Johnson could be sensible. However, they should be carefully
considered and applied only to those countries that represent a genuine threat
to national security so as not to jeopardise our share of other markets. It
would be a shame for students from China and government sponsored students from
the Middle East, for example, to be deterred from applying by more complex
application procedure that was designed to prevent would-be terrorists from high
risk countries such as Pakistan from accessing the UK on student visas. Foreign
students naturally want to come to the UK to learn English and we have a very
successful EFL sector here which would be damaged by a broad application of
raised minimum English levels, so targeted implementation is essential. 

"We also await clarity from the UKBA on how the minimal level of English will be
assessed, a definition of sub-GCSE level and further information on the
introduction of a 'Highly Trusted Sponsors List'. 

"The British education system is renowned for taking a global approach to its
teaching, providing a strong multi-cultural learning environment in which
students learn to empathise with and accommodate international perspectives.
Many international graduates go on to forge successful careers after higher
education, and the positive learning experience and relationships formed in this
country will only strengthen future diplomatic ties between Britain and other
global players. We need to ensure that Britain continues to welcome
international students to our universities." 

* The proposal to raise the minimum qualification to NQF4 (from NQF3) would have
meant that visas would no longer be approved for international students looking
to take A-levels, International Baccalaureate or Foundation courses in the UK -
as these fall into the National Qualification Framework (NQF) level 3 category.
Visas would only be granted to students taking NQF 4 courses - i.e. degree
programmes.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Lions Gate Entertainment Corp and the Weinstein brothers are among the potential buyers of Walt Disney Co's Miramax film unit, sources familiar with the situation said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Independent studio Summit Entertainment, which is behind the popular "Twilight" franchise, could also be interested in Miramax, said the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has put Miramax up for sale because its library of mostly small, independent films does not mesh with the media giant's plan to overhaul its movie operations, a source close to the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney is focusing on its own movie brand, as well as films made by its Pixar division and the newly acquired Marvel, and a distribution deal with Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks studio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Lions Gate was unavailable for comment, while Disney and Summit declined comment. But Lions Gate and Disney are expected to report quarterly earnings on Tuesday, and will likely be grilled by investors and analysts about any possible interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney is asking between $650 million to $800 million for Miramax, home to art-house fare like "Clerks" and "No Country for Old Men," said a source close to one potential bidder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a $500 million to $700 million price tag is seen to be more realistic, according to another source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential sale of Miramax comes as the auction for another storied Hollywood studio, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, entered a second round of bidding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While DVD sales have slumped and will likely hurt the price of any studio sale, the libraries of both MGM and Miramax still generate cash flow through licensing deals for television and other distribution channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Weinstein Co confirmed its interest in Miramax, which Bob and Harvey Weinstein built 31 years ago and named after their parents Miriam and Max. The Weinsteins sold Miramax to Disney in 1993, but stayed on as co-chief executives until five years ago, when they left to form The Weinstein Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are keen to look at the company and we will see what happens in coming weeks," said David Glasser, operations executive for the independent Weinstein Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Weinsteins have been approached by financial partners to help them purchase Miramax and are reviewing the company's assets, according to a source familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Post reported that Lions Gate could initially bid from $500 million to $600 million for Miramax. This would be five times the studio's roughly $100 million in annual cash flow and about twice its $300 million in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a person familiar with Lions Gate, home to the popular "Saw" franchise, said the company was "price sensitive" and not as aggressive as the Post story suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for MGM, its lenders late last month agreed to extend a debt forbearance to March 31, which gives the studio more time to find a buyer or explore alternatives including continuing to operate as a stand-alone entity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial bids, including from Time Warner Inc and Lions Gate, had come in below $2 billion, sources have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MGM has said it is conducting due diligence with select bidders and that "process is expected to run for the next several weeks." MGM is considering a prepackaged bankruptcy along with a sale, other sources familiar have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MGM is owned by a group, including private equity firms TPG, Providence Equity Partners, DLJ Merchant Banking Partners and Quadrangle Group, and media companies Sony Corp and Comcast Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studio has a library of more than 4,000 titles, including the James Bond and Pink Panther franchises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sue Zeidler; editing by Andre Grenon, Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

After that date -- it's also April's Patch Tuesday -- Microsoft will not provide security updates for Vista RTM, said Jerry Bryant, a senior manager with the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, users should upgrade to Vista Service Pack 1 (SP1), or preferably, Vista SP2, Bryant said. Microsoft shipped SP1 and SP2 in March 2008 and May 2009, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's policy is to support a Windows RTM build for at least 24 months after the release of a first service pack, and to support any service pack for the same length of time when it's superseded by a follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Windows 2000 and Windows XP face support deadlines of July 13, 2010, Bryant added in an entry last week to the MSRC blog .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will retire Windows 2000 from all support in July, ending all security patches for the operating system that celebrates its 10-year anniversary this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows XP SP2, the popular 2004 update that beefed up the security of the under-attack OS, will also exit support July 13. To continue receiving bug patches, users must upgrade to XP SP3, the May 2008 update. Bryant claimed that "many" customers are still using XP SP2, and urged them to upgrade to either SP3 or Windows 7 .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Web metrics company NetApplications.com, Windows XP powered 66% of the machines that were online last month, while Vista ran 17.5% and Windows 2000 a puny 0.6%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Microsoft reminded users of Windows 7 Release Candidate (RC) that beginning on Feb. 15, the free preview will warn of a March 1 deadline. On March 1, the operating system will start to shut down automatically every two hours .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt; (Updates with Televisa declining comment, Nextel Mexico not
immediately available for comment, share price fall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Feb 8 (Reuters) - Mexican media group Televisa
has submitted a proposal to the country's antitrust commission
to acquire part of wireless phone operator Nextel's Mexico
operation, a source at the commission said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mexican media reports said last month that Televisa, which
would like to expand into triple-play services, was looking at
paying $1 billion for a stake of between 20 and 30 percent in
Nextel Mexico, part of the NII NIHD.O group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa declined to comment on Monday. Nextel Mexico did
not immediately return calls from Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source spoke off the record because he was not
authorized to speak publicly about the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Consumers are expected to gravitate toward media companies
that can bundle television, Internet and phone services, so
leading providers are looking for ways to combine those
services under one roof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Companies also are looking to expand wireless networks that
can serve more sophisticated cell phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Late last month, NII Holdings said it plans to bid for new
frequencies to bolster its coverage in Mexico as it deploys
'third generation' wireless technology across the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Mexican government had previously launched the
long-awaited terms for mobile-phone frequency auctions, and
hopes to unveil winners by mid-year. Such a big sale of added
wireless capacity in the country is the first in at least a
decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Televisa (TV.N) (TLVACPO.MX) closed down 2.08
percent to 48.57 pesos in Mexico and also slipped 2.5 percent
to $18.30 in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rival companies are willing to team up to improve their
chances of buying the best bands. The process is expected to
lure blue chips like Spain's Telefonica (TEF.MC) and Mexican
media company Televisa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cablevision, the cable unit of Televisa, said last month
that it will boost its broadband speed, following the lead of
rival Telmex, owned by tycoon Carlos Slim, as competition in
the telecom market heats up.

    - Sensor-based observation of plant floor activities and output.

    - Critical alarm analysis including 'floods' of multiple thousands of
data events per second.

    - Safety critical event and alert generation such as turbine or
compressor trips.

    - Proactive, condition-based maintenance on key equipment.

    - Low-latency analysis of aggregated data (windowed and log-scales).

    - Reliable aggregation of data samples across wireless sensor networks.

    - Immediate response to variations in energy or water consumption, to
minimize or avoid outages or other disruptions of service.

&lt;p&gt; * Improving energy efficiency&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Aimed at rivals HP, Oracle-Sun
 (Adds analyst's comments, Oracle-Sun deal)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Feb 8 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) is beginning a
long-awaited upgrade to a range of servers and other hardware
to make them more energy-efficient and competitive than rival
products by Hewlett-Packard and Oracle Corp ORCL.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp said on Monday its new
POWER7 system, including new microprocessors, storage and
middleware, will be able to process more data than its
predecessor POWER6, making them useful for utilities with
electrical grids or banks conducting electronic trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The innovation starts at the chip level," said Ross Mauri,
general manager of IBM's Power systems business. "And they can
dynamically adjust their own electrical usage based on the
workload."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM's business has increasingly shifted to software and
services from hardware over the past decade. But advanced
servers are still a crucial part of its sales strategy as it
competes with HP and Oracle, which recently bought Sun
Microsystems Inc JAVA.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a competitive market out there and each provider is
continuing to offer enhancements," said Andy Miedler, an
analyst with Edward Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "IBM is transforming itself to a software and services
company. But hardware still plays a very big part of the
business because it allows them to wrap everything into one big
bundle. You can get your hardware, services, and software in
one place," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts say IBM also faces growing competition from Cisco
Systems Inc (CSCO.O), which is better known for routers and
switches but is now expanding into servers and software.

&lt;p&gt;Construction of 60-mile Ice Road Complete
ANCHORAGE, Alaska--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Production Company announced today that it has successfully drilled
and cased PTU-15, the first development well for the Point Thomson project on
Alaska`s North Slope. In addition, a 60-mile ice road has been completed from
Endicott to Point Thomson which enables the transport of heavy equipment and
materials to the site. 

ExxonMobil drilled the well to a measured depth of over 16,000 feet. The
shore-based rig directionally drilled under the Beaufort Sea to the targeted gas
reservoir more than 1.5 miles offshore. 

"This is another successful milestone for the Point Thomson project," said Dale
Pittman, ExxonMobil Alaska production manager. 

ExxonMobil Senior Project Manager Lee Bruce added, "PTU-15 pushed the limits of
drilling technology and demonstrated that the Point Thomson drilling plan is
sound." 

The rig will be moved to the second development well at Point Thompson (PTU-16)
and continue drilling. Work continues on front-end engineering and design for
the initial production system. 

"We are continuing to progress the Point Thomson project work. We are ready to
resolve all outstanding issues with the Department of Natural Resources to
maintain the pace and momentum set by the more than 1,500 people and 150
companies that worked on the project over the past year," added Pittman. 

The Point Thomson project, located approximately 60 miles east of Prudhoe Bay,
is scheduled to commence production in 2014. ExxonMobil will continue to bring
innovative technology and world-class management expertise to the field. Field
development will include a gas cycling plant designed to produce hydrocarbon
liquids and re-inject natural gas back into the reservoir, making Point Thomson
the highest-pressure gas cycling operation in the world. 

Point Thomson is a remote natural gas and condensate field located on Alaska`s
North Slope. It holds an estimated 8 trillion cubic feet of gas - about 25
percent of the North Slope`s gas resources - and about 200 million barrels of
condensate. Point Thomson gas is critical to the success of an Alaska gas
pipeline project. 

NOTES TO EDITORS 

The well was drilled with Nabors rig 27-E, which received $35 million in
upgrades prior to mobilization to the Point Thomson central pad site in April
2009.

release are forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including
resource recoveries and project plans and schedules could differ materially due
to: changes in market conditions affecting the oil and gas industry or long-term
oil and gas price levels; political or regulatory developments; the outcome of
negotiations with the Alaska Department of Natural Resources; ongoing
litigation; reservoir performance; timely completion of development projects;
technical or operating factors; and other factors discussed under the heading

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is offering a second release candidate for its ASP.Net MVC 2 technology, which enables developers to build Web applications using a model view controller pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Released last week, Release Candidate 2 of ASP.Net MVC 2 follows a release candidate build shipped in December, said Scott Guthrie, corporate vice president of the Microsoft developer division, in an entry on his ASP.Net blog. The release is built for use with Visual Studio 2008 and the .Net Framework 3.5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Last month, InfoWorld reported that Microsoft is set to launch its Visual Studio 2010 platform on April 12, after having delayed it for a few weeks because of performance issues. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[The second release candidate] includes a bunch of bug fixes, performance work, and some final API and behavior additions/changes," Guthrie said. Significant performance tuning improvements have been made, such as&#160;lambda-based strongly typed HTML helpers being much faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other changes between the first and second release candidates is an ASP.Net MVC 2 validation feature that performs model-validation instead of input validation, Guthrie said. This means when a developer uses model binding, all model properties are validated instead of just validations on changed values of a model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the jQuery 1.4.1 JavaScript library is included by default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visual Studio, Guthrie said, now features scaffolding support for Delete action methods within controllers and Delete views as well. "We'll shortly be releasing the Visual Studio 2010 RC (Release Candidate), which will be available for everyone to download. It will include ASP. NET MVC 2 support built-in," Guthrie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASP.Net MVC 2 is an update to ASP.Net MVC 1.0, which shipped in March 2009, according to Microsoft. Microsoft has not yet announced a final release date for ASP.Net MVC 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MVC framework "encourages developers to maintain a clear separation of concerns among the responsibilities of the application -- the UI logic using the view, user-input handling using the controller, and the domain logic using the model," Microsoft said on a download page for the release candidate. "ASP.Net MVC applications are easily testable using techniques such as test-driven development."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Microsoft moves on MVC Web apps platform upgrade," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A consortium led by Walt Disney Co. is in advanced talks to buy into China's largest in-bus digital media and advertising company, a deal that could offer the U.S. entertainment giant a new platform to promote Mickey Mouse in China, three sources told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc., the world's No.1 Internet search company, which threatened to quit China last month over censorship and hacking concerns, was among investors in the Disney-led consortium, the sources said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consortium planned to buy a stake of between 30 and 40 percent in Bus Online for more than $100 million via a purchase of old and new shares to be issued by the company in private placements, said the sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Disney wants to be a strategic partner not just a financial investor in Bus Online as Disney is going to do many things in China -- for example, the theme park to be opened in Shanghai," said one of the sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To Disney, the deal is not just about sharing in the growth of China's advertising market but more about the promotion of Disney, the brand itself, and this is strategically important to Disney in China."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November, Disney's made a breakthrough deal to build one of its signature theme parks in Shanghai, marking a major advance for Western media and entertainment companies seeking to crack the tough Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior executives of Disney are expected to fly to Beijing to meet Chinese media regulators to discuss Disney's long-term development plan in China including the Bus Online deal, said another of the sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOOGLE IN FOCUS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of its recent problems in China, Google is finalizing a deal that will let the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) help it investigate a corporate espionage attack that may have originated in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beijing has already warned Washington not to make the Google incident political, in addition to other growing sources of friction between the two nations, including Tibet, Taiwan, yuan appreciation and Sino-U.S. trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google was expected to take only a small stake in the Bus Online deal, while Disney aimed to take the greater part, said the sources, adding that no agreement had been signed yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources briefed on the possible deal declined to be identified as the negotiation process is confidential. Bus Online, headquartered in Shanghai, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Google spokeswoman said the company could not immediately comment. Disney could not be immediately reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bus Online is China's No.1 in-bus digital media and advertising company, with revenue of about 314.5 million yuan ($46.07 million) in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2004, the company has received a total of $80 million from venture capital funds and banks including IDG, Yangtze Fund, China Renaissance Capital Investment and CCB International.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bus Online is the exclusive partner of state broadcaster CCTV and the official Xinhua news agency for in-bus media content and advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yum!

&lt;p&gt;Feb 8 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities raised Walt Disney
Co (DIS.N) to "neutral" from "underweight," citing improving
economic conditions, but said earnings recovery would lag its
peer group due to challenging trends at the film studio and
parks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We think that a full earnings recovery of the studio's
earning power is likely to take the new management team time
given the long lead time of producing and releasing a film,"
analyst Imran Khan said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Khan, who raised his price target on Disney stock to $30
from $28, also said discounts at its parks and resorts will
continue to hurt earnings recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We estimate that the segment top line would have to grow
5.1 percent to just offset the increase in pension and benefits
costs," the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He, however, said the outlook for cable networks, expected
to account for 70 percent of its operating income for 2010, is
improving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Disney were up 28 cents in trading before the
bell. They closed at $29.54 Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;RALEIGH, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
Visara International announces that it has successfully replaced IBM 3745 Front
End Processors with the Visara FEP4600 Enterprise Communications Controller in a
major metropolitan Inter-Agency network. The objective of the project was to
replace the aging and unsupported 3745s with the newer and more cost effective
FEP4600. The rack mounted FEP4600 does not require any licensed software such as
NCP or SSP while providing the same functional connectivity. The customer has
estimated that the use of the FEP4600 will save more than $100K in annual
software license and maintenance fees as compared to the IBM 3745s, resulting in
an ROI of less than 12 months. Besides the savings in license and maintenance
fees, the FEP4600 eliminates the use of ESCON to Bus and Tag converters and
saves on floor space as well as power and HVAC requirements. 

The FEP4600 is providing communications via standard SDLC links to other agency
3745s. The next phase of this project is to utilize the FEP4600`s SNI over IP
feature to eliminate the lower speed SDLC links. This feature allows the use of
IP connectivity to provide SNI communications, allowing a highly reliable and
flexible "Business Continuity" architecture. 

According to Visara International's CEO Dr. Kenneth A. Bloom: "IBM decided
several years ago to end their production and support for 3745/46 FEPs. This
move forced many customers worldwide to keep their FEPs solely for SNI
connectivity without a good alternative. This is where the FEP4600 really shines
as it supports SNI and other standard protocols and network attachments with NO
software license required." 

Management and configuration of the Visara FEP4600 is through a network browser
connection. This allows the FEP4600 to be configured, controlled and monitored
without the need to reload the system thus eliminating the scheduling of
configuration changes during off hours. 

Headquartered near Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, Avenir Technologies
Inc. d/b/a Visara International is a global leader in the innovation and
development of mainframe and midrange console solutions, Console Automation

&lt;p&gt;Feb 8 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities raised Torchmark
Corp (TMK.N) to "overweight" from "neutral," citing the life
and health insurer's superior returns and stable growth in an
uncertain environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The brokerage wrote in a note to clients that it considered
the company as one of the best franchises in the life insurance
sector, "given its leading position in less competitive
markets, niche distribution and operating efficiency."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan currently has a price target of $53 on
Torchmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Easing concerns about capital/ratings and improving
business trends will lift investor sentiment and drive upside
in the stock," analyst Jimmy Bhullar said in a note clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage added that Torchmark offered high earnings
visibility due to its lack of exposure to equity-sensitive
products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan said Torchmark's investment portfolio was less
risky than perceived and expects its investment losses to be
manageable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Even in a worst case scenario, a one-notch downgrade would
not materially affect results given TMK's business mix and
distribution focus," Bhullar added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the McKinney, Texas-based company have more than
doubled in the last 12 months. They closed at $44.09 Friday on
the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Anirban Sen in

Pfizer and Keas announced today they have entered into an alliance to
collaborate on the Keas platform to enable Health and Wellness experts to
author, sell and distribute personalized online Care Plans directly to patients.
Pfizer and Keas will collaborate to develop care plans and related capabilities
that seek to provide consumers, patients and their providers an intuitive,
engaging, easy-to-use, and low-cost way to manage their health &amp; wellness,
prevention and care delivery. 

An asset for both consumers and their physicians, Keas allows users to
understand and take charge of their health information by using Care Plans that
meet their personal health needs and help extend the reach of their own
physicians and health care providers. The Care Plans are authored by leaders in
the healthcare industry including doctors, pharmacists, and nutritionists. Among
the health experts who have published Care Plans on Keas include Dr. Greene
Pediatrics, DiabetesMine, HealthWise, and CVS MinuteClinic.

innovative and game changing solutions that empower patients and physicians to
further engage in the patient`s health," said Kristin Peck, SVP of Worldwide
Strategy &amp; Innovation. "This is a further testimony of Pfizer`s commitment to
remain the partner of choice for entrepreneurs and innovators. It is about
harnessing the power of the best innovators across the world through new
partnerships and novel ecosystems to create a healthier world." 

Keas offers a fun, personalized "dashboard" to users giving them the opportunity
to keep track of their own health goals and empower them to make decisions about
self-care as well as medical care. Keas Founder and CEO Adam Bosworth explains,
"Keas helps people take charge of their health, giving them the tools and
knowledge required to live a healthy life and tackle such challenges as weight
loss, smoking cessation, diabetes prevention or control, heart disease,
pediatric issues and even reminders for taking prescriptions or getting lab work
done." 

"The Pfizer relationship with Keas enables us to partner with health care
professionals to extend care management outside the office," said Olivier
Brandicourt, President and General Manager of Pfizer`s Primary Care Business
Unit. "By combining the recommendation of an individual`s physician with a
personalized, expert-developed Care Plan to support day-to-day health decisions,
we believe patients will potentially experience improved health outcomes." 

Patients using the interactive platform also will be able to share their Care
Plan with a designated provider, following the progress of the patient with the
Plan to provide collaborative care. Patients can enroll directly into Care plans
or by recommendation of their physician.

&lt;p&gt; * Disney-led consortium in talks to buy into Bus Online&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Google among investors in Disney consortium&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * KFC to partner with Bus Online in 2,000 restaurants
 (Adds KFC deal, Disney and Google's China business)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By George Chen and Melanie Lee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, Feb 8 (Reuters) - A consortium led by
Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) is in advanced talks to buy into China's
largest in-bus digital media and advertising company, a deal that
could offer the U.S. entertainment giant a new platform to
promote Mickey Mouse in China, three sources told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google Inc (GOOG.O), the world's No.1 Internet search
company, which threatened to quit China last month over
censorship and hacking concerns, was among investors in the
Disney-led consortium, the sources said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The consortium planned to buy a stake of between 30 and 40
percent in Bus Online for more than $100 million via a purchase
of old and new shares to be issued by the company in private
placements, said the sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Disney wants to be a strategic partner not just a financial
investor in Bus Online as Disney is going to do many things in
China -- for example, the theme park to be opened in Shanghai,"
said one of the sources. "To Disney, the deal is not just about
sharing in the growth of China's advertising market but more
about the promotion of Disney, the brand itself, and this is
strategically important to Disney in China."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In November, Disney's (DIS.N) made a breakthrough deal to
build one of its signature theme parks in Shanghai, marking a
major advance for Western media and entertainment companies
seeking to crack the tough Chinese market. [ID:nN03523281]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Senior executives of Disney are expected to fly to Beijing to
meet Chinese media regulators to discuss Disney's long-term
development plan in China including the Bus Online deal, said
another of the sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GOOGLE IN FOCUS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the wake of it's recent problems in China, Google is
finalising a deal that will let the U.S. National Security Agency
(NSA) help it investigate a corporate espionage attack that may
have originated in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beijing has already warned Washington not to make the Google
incident political, in addition to other growing sources of
friction between the two nations, including Tibet, Taiwan, yuan
appreciation and Sino-U.S. trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google was expected to take only a small stake in the Bus
Online deal, while Disney aimed to take the greater part, said
the sources, adding that no agreement had been signed yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sources briefed on the possible deal declined to be
identified as the negotiation process is confidential. Bus
Online, headquartered in Shanghai, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Google spokeswoman said the company could not immediately
comment. Disney could not be immediately reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bus Online is China's No.1 in-bus digital media and
advertising company, with revenue of about 314.5 million yuan
($46.07 million) in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since 2004, the company has received a total of $80 million
from venture capital funds and banks including IDG, Yangtze Fund,
China Renaissance Capital Investment and CCB International.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bus Online is the exclusive partner of state broadcaster CCTV
and the official Xinhua news agency for in-bus media content and
advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yum! Brands' (YUM.N) fried chicken restaurant chain KFC would
sign a deal with Bus Online to allow the Chinese company to set
up screens in KFC's more than 2,000 outlets across China, said
the sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney expected to provide media content to Bus Online for
its partnership with KFC in China on the condition that Disney
and Bus Online agreed on the equity stake investment first, they
said.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A strong performance at its cable division and cost-cuts at its film studio propelled Walt Disney Co to better-than-expected earnings, but clouds remained over its theme parks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney shares rose as much as 2 percent after the first quarter earnings report on Tuesday, which followed what is becoming a familiar pattern for media companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News Corp and Time Warner Inc also reported better-than-expected results this month. For all three, the strength of cable TV can be credited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was strength across the board," said James Marsh, an analyst with Piper Jaffray. "I would point to the resiliency of their media networks business. You get consistent revenue growth out of there, consistent operating income growth, and I think that's something people forget about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney benefited from the calendar shift of the New Year's holiday into the first quarter this year from the second quarter a year earlier, which analysts said added an estimated 2 cents to results. But even with the calendar shift, the quarter was much better than most had expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, some Disney divisions remain under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, room reservations at its parks for the second quarter are currently down 10 percent from last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Consumers remain tentative," said Jay Rasulo, chief financial officer for Disney, which more than most media companies remains tethered to consumer psychology as it reaches across so many sectors in entertainment and leisure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while Rasulo said reservations were down, guests continue to book their rooms closer to their travel date, so the 10 percent was not fully indicative of where it could end up. "But the number speaks for itself," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Disney's fiscal first quarter net income fell to $844 million, or 44 cents per share, from $845 million, or 45 cents a share, in the year-ago first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding items, the company earned 47 cents a share. That beat the 38 cents expected on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 1 percent to $9.74 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strongest performance came from Disney's media network division, the largest in terms of revenue and profit and home to lucrative cable networks. The division's sales rose 7 percent to $4.2 billion, driven by increases at Disney Channels and ESPN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But analysts said the biggest surprise came from its studio, which is currently being overhauled. Sales were essentially flat at $1.9 billion and segment operating income rose 30 percent to $243 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key factor was cost-cutting. That helped take the sting out of quarter that failed to produce a blockbuster from titles like "Old Dogs," "Princess and the Frog" and "A Christmas Carol."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a stronger than expected quarter, primarily driven by cost initiatives at the studio," Jason Helfstein, an analyst with Oppenheimer  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the conference call, Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger told analysts they will not see the "real" results of the studio's restructuring until 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger also called Apple Inc's new iPad tablet a really compelling device that could be a game changer in terms of "enabling us to create essentially new forms of content."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about a potential sale of Disney's Miramax unit, he said it was prudent to explore all options regarding the art-house studio, which sources have said has already attracted several interested buyers like Lions Gate Entertainment Corp and Weinstein Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect Disney to start this year reaping benefits from its acquisition of Marvel Entertainment and a distribution deal with Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks studio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the parks division, which encompasses Disney's theme parks, resorts, cruise lines and vacation and time share operations, operating income fell 2 percent in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attendance was higher at its domestic parks, but guest spending was down alongside lower average ticket prices and a drop in spending on food and drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to Disney's earnings release, its shares closed up 36 cents, or 1.22 percent, at $29.84 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Paul Thomasch in New York, Gabriel Madway and Ian Sherr in San Francisco; editing by Carol Bishopric and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

really compelling device that could be a game changer in terms
of "enabling us to create essentially new forms of content."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When asked about a potential sale of Disney's Miramax unit,
he said it was prudent to explore all options regarding the
art-house studio, which sources have said has already attracted
several interested buyers like Lions Gate Entertainment Corp
(LGF.N) and Weinstein Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts expect Disney to start this year reaping benefits
from its acquisition of Marvel Entertainment and a distribution
deal with Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks studio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the parks division, which encompasses Disney's theme
parks, resorts, cruise lines and vacation and time share
operations, operating income fell 2 percent in the first
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Attendance was higher at its domestic parks, but guest
spending was down alongside lower average ticket prices and a
drop in spending on food and drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prior to Disney's earnings release, its shares closed up 36
cents, or 1.22 percent, at $29.84 on the New York Stock
Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;For the second time in the last four months, Microsoft today shipped a record 13 security updates that patched dozens of vulnerabilities in Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 26 flaws fixed today were off the record of 34 set in October 2009 when Microsoft last issued 13 security bulletins. However, if Microsoft had waited until today to deliver the rush Internet Explorer (IE) update it released late last month -- the IE patches were original slated to appear as part of today's collection -- this month's lot would have tied the vulnerability record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five of the 13 updates were marked "critical," the highest threat ranking in Microsoft 's four-step scoring system. Seven were ranked "important," the next-lower rating, while one was pegged "moderate." Eleven of the 13 affected Windows, while the remaining pair impacted Office XP and Office 2003 on Windows and Office 2004 for Mac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three of the updates stood out immediately, said Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Network Security, including one related to DirectShow, a component of Windows' DirectX graphics infrastructure; and two involving SMB (Server Message Block), the Microsoft-made network file and print-sharing protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The DirectShow vulnerability in MS10-013 has the potential for a classic drive-by attack," said Storms, who noted that the flaw is in Windows' parsing of .avi movie files. "There's no shortage of people watching video on the Web," Storms said, adding that he put the update on his short list because of the potential for large-scale attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft agreed, tagging the update as critical and betting that attackers will come up with reliable exploits for the bug in the next 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storms' other must-patch updates were a pair related to SMB: MS10-006 on the client side and MS10-012 on the server side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other than the historical nature of those updates -- Microsoft quashed six bugs in SMB last year on two different Patch Tuesdays -- Storms pointed out that Microsoft believes the flaws serious, more dangerous apparently than the SMB vulnerability it didn't fix today, even though that bug has exploit code in circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft's saying that these patches are much more important, even though there is public code out there for the denial-of-service," Storms said, referring to the outstanding security advisory for an SMB flaw that it said last week it wouldn't fix today. "Usually the big attack vector is on the server side [for SMB], since they're typically network-based attacks," he continued. "We haven't been too worried about them because of default firewalls, but this month we're seeing vulnerabilities on the client side as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other updates patched PowerPoint, Office's presentation maker; Microsoft Paint, the bare bones paint program included with all versions of Windows; the operating system's implementation of TCP/IP; Windows Server 2008's Hyper-V virtualization software; the Windows kernel; and other bits and pieces of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kernel update, MS10-015 , patched the 17-year-old bug in all 32-bit versions of Windows that went public Jan. 19 when a Google engineer disclosed the vulnerability on a security mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As announced last week, Microsoft today did not patch an IE bug it only recently confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month's security update can be downloaded and installed via the Microsoft Update and Windows Update services, as well as through Windows Server Update Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co has reported a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit, as its cable TV division turned in another star performance and cost-cutting provided some much-needed support for its film studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney shares rose as much as 2 percent on Tuesday after the earnings report, which followed what is becoming a familiar pattern for media companies: News Corp and Time Warner Inc also reported better-than-expected results this month. For all three, the strength of cable TV can be credited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was strength across the board," said James Marsh, an analyst with Piper Jaffray. "I would point to the resiliency of their media networks business. You get consistent revenue growth out of there, consistent operating income growth, and I think that's something people forget about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, with advertisers and consumers keeping close watch on budgets, several of the company's divisions remain under pressure. As just one example, room reservations at its Disney's parks are currently running down a troubling 10 percent from last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Disney's fiscal first quarter net income fell to $844 million, or 44 cents per share, from $845 million, or 45 cents a share, in the year-ago first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding items, the company earned 47 cents a share. That beat the 38 cents expected on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 1 percent to $9.74 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strongest performance came from Disney's media network division, the largest in terms of revenue and profit and home to its lucrative cable networks. Sales from the division rose 7 percent to $4.2 billion, driven by increases at Disney Channels and ESPN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But analysts said the biggest surprise came from its studio, which is currently being overhauled. Sales were essentially flat at $1.9 billion and segment operating income rose 30 percent to $243 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key was cost-cutting. That helped take the sting out of quarter that failed to produce a blockbuster from titles like "Old Dogs," "Princess and the Frog" and "A Christmas Carol."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a stronger than expected quarter, primarily driven by cost initiatives at the studio," Jason Helfstein, an analyst with Oppenheimer  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the parks division, which encompasses Disney's theme parks, resorts, cruise lines and vacation and time share operations, operating income fell 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attendance was higher at its domestic parks, but guest spending was down alongside lower average ticket prices and a drop in spending on food and drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to Disney's earnings release, its shares closed up 36 cents, or 1.22 percent, at $29.84 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Paul Thomasch in New York, Gabriel Madway and Ian Sherr in San Francisco; editing by Carol Bishopric and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil Giant "Desperate" to Derail $27 Billion Liability
QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
In its latest attempt to evade a $27 billion liability in Ecuador, Chevron is
misrepresenting key facts about a court-appointed expert who conducted a damages
assessment not to the company`s liking, representatives of the plaintiffs
announced. 

"Chevron is again trying to strong-arm the court by misrepresenting facts," said
Steven R. Donziger, an American legal advisor to the plaintiffs. "This is part
of an underhanded attempt to derail a trial Chevron is losing based on the
voluminous scientific evidence." 

On Tuesday, Chevron in a press release announced it had "newly discovered"
evidence that the court-appointed Special Master who conducted a damages
assessment, Richard Cabrera, owns a remediation company in Ecuador that stands
to benefit from a clean-up should the plaintiffs win the case. The filing is the
29th official motion Chevron has made to the court to disqualify Cabrera but the
court has never accepted Chevron`s arguments, said Donziger. 

Chevron is accused in the underlying lawsuit of deliberately dumping more than
18 billion gallons of waste into Ecuador`s Amazon when it operated oil fields in
that country from 1964 to 1990, causing a spike in cancer rates and decimating
indigenous groups. The communities claim the pollution left is still leaching
into soils and groundwater and has poisoned an area the size of Rhode Island. 

Cabrera, working with a team of 14 scientists, found damages could be as high as
$27.3 billion. A court will make a final determination on liability and damages
later this year. 

According to Pablo Fajardo, the lead Ecuadorian lawyer in the case, in its
latest court filing Chevron fails to note that:

* Cabrera disclosed to the court that he owned a clean-up company before his
appointment as Special Master. This fact was properly cited by the court as one
of the reasons he was qualified to do the damages assessment. 
* Chevron thought so highly of Cabrera`s qualifications that it accepted him as
a court-appointed expert in an earlier part of the case and paid his fees as
required by court rules. 
* The fact Cabrera`s company is qualified to bid on clean-up contracts offered
by Ecuador`s state-owned oil company is irrelevant. That company, Petroecuador,
is not a party to the case against Chevron and would have no role in any
eventual cleanup. 
* Cabrera by virtue of his role in the case would be barred from having a role
in a future clean-up. 
* Chevron misrepresents Cabrera`s role. Contrary to Chevron`s assertions,
Cabrera did not rule on the critical question of liability and did not
"exculpate" Petroecuador. Liability can only be determined by the court.

The case was transferred in 2002 to Ecuador from U.S. federal court (where it
was originally filed in 1993) at Chevron`s request. Once the trial began in
Ecuador in 2003 and the evidence pointed to Chevron`s culpability, the company
began to try to delay the proceedings and discredit the court and Cabrera. 

In the 1990s, in its effort to move the case to Ecuador, Chevron filed 14 sworn
affidavits in U.S. federal court praising the fairness and competency of
Ecuador`s courts. Once it was clear the company could lose the trial in Ecuador,
Chevron filed multiple legal actions in the U.S. to shift the potential
liability to Ecuador`s government, said Donziger. 

Not one of the U.S.-based legal actions -- including one that was denied by the
U.S. Supreme Court -- have succeeded. Chevron`s latest move is to seek a
closed-door international arbitration under a trade pact between the U.S. and
Ecuador, but the Amazon communities and Ecuador`s government have filed separate
motions in U.S. federal court to block that proceeding, said Donziger. 

"Chevron loses credibility in front of the court and the world each time it
files a frivolous motion based on unsubstantiated facts," said Donziger. "Each
of these motions is part of an evidentiary record that we will use to prove that
Chevron completely abused the court process in Ecuador to evade a judgment, in
violation of the law." 

"We believe all of these Chevron attacks will backfire against the company in a
later enforcement action to collect on any judgment," said Donziger. "Judges are
not as na&#239;ve as Chevron seems to think they are."

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Another 1 Down, Bank Failures Hit 16

1st American State Bank of Minnesota had total assets of about $18.2 million and
total deposits of about $16.3 million as of Dec 31, 2009. 

The recent failure represents another impact on the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation`s (FDIC) fund meant for protecting customer accounts, as it has been
appointed receiver for the bank. The FDIC insures deposits at 8,195 institutions
with roughly $13.5 trillion in assets. When a bank fails, it reimburses
customers for deposits of up to $250,000 per account. The outbreak of bank
failures has significantly stretched the regulator`s deposit insurance fund.
However, the FDIC has access to the Treasury Department`s credit line of up to
$500 billion. 

The failure of 1st American State Bank of Minnesota is expected to cost the
federal deposit insurance fund (DIF) about $3.1 million. 

Minnesota-based Community Development Bank, FSB will assume all of the deposits
and assets of 1st American State Bank of Minnesota. The FDIC entered into a loss
sharing agreement with Community Development Bank, FSB on $11.7 million of 1st
American's assets. 

Increasing loan losses on commercial real estate are expected to cause hundreds
more bank failures in the next few years. The FDIC anticipates bank failures to
cost about $100 billion over the next three years. The failure of Washington
Mutual in 2008 was the largest in U.S. banking history. It was acquired by JP
Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM). The other major acquirers of failed institutions since
2008 include Fifth Third Bancorp (Nasdaq: FITB), PNC Financial (NYSE: PNC), U.S.
Bancorp (NYSE: USB) and Regions Financial (NYSE: RF). Though current signals
indicate that the economy may stabilize, we expect loan losses on the commercial
real estate portfolio to remain high for banks that hold large amounts of
high-risk loans.

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Research Equity Strategist, Dirk Van Dijk says that S 500 earnings are
continuing to show red ink. He tracks companies on the Zacks.com web site,
naming names, while forecasting trends for the months ahead. 

Earnings Season Still Going Strong

With 61.6% of the reports in, this has been a very strong earnings season so far
(although one would not know that by looking at the market action). Yes, we had
easy comps from a year ago, but 54.25% year-over-year growth is nothing to
sneeze at. 

While most of that eye-popping growth is due to a handful of firms, mostly in
the Financials, even if the financials are excluded earnings growth is still
9.5%. The majority of firms are reporting higher earnings than a year ago.
Earnings are coming in much better than expected, with 76.0% of all firms
reporting coming in with better than expected earnings, only 16.9%
disappointing. 

While all sectors have seen more positive surprises than disappointments, Tech
has put on an absolutely stunning performance. With 73.6% of its results in,
there have been 48 positive surprises and not a single disappointment. 

The Tech sector`s strength is being driven by some of the biggest and best-known
of the Tech firms. Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), Applied Materials (Nasdaq: AMAT), Intel
(Nasdaq: INTC), Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) and Texas Instruments (NYSE: TXN) all
have extremely strong revisions profiles for 2010.

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

SAP CEO Steps Down

SAP AG (NYSE: SAP) announced that the SAP Supervisory Board has reached an
agreement with CEO Leo Apotheker not to extend his contract as a member of the
SAP Executive Board. Leo Apotheker has resigned as CEO and member of the SAP
Executive Board effective immediately. 

The company said that it would split the leadership between two co-chief
executives, naming Bill McDermott, head of field organization, and Jim Hagemann
Snabe, head of product development, to those posts. 

In addition, Vishal Sikka, Chief Technology Officer, has been appointed to the
SAP Executive Board. At the request of the Supervisory Board, Hasso Plattner,
Co-Founder of SAP and Chairman of the SAP Supervisory Board, will continue to
play a strong role in advising the new leaders on technology and product
development. 

SAP`s sales fell sharply in September 2008 as companies reduced technology
spending during the worldwide economic and financial crisis. But SAP staged a
smart recovery on the back of cost rationalization and reported a strong fourth
quarter in Jan 2010. 

The new setup of the SAP Executive Board will allow SAP to better integrate
product innovation with customer needs. SAP AG, together with its subsidiaries,
develops, markets, and sells enterprise application software products to
corporations, government agencies, and educational institutions in Europe, the
Middle East, Africa, North America and Latin America, and the Asia Pacific-Japan
region. Major competitors include International BusinessMachines Corp (NYSE:
IBM), Microsoft Corporation (Nasdaq: MSFT) and Oracle Corporation (Nasdaq:
ORCL). 

We currently have a Neutral recommendation on SAP. 

CVS Beats by a Penny

CVS Caremark`s (NYSE: CVS) fourth quarter earnings came in at 79 cents per
share, a cent above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents and higher than 70
cents reported in the year-ago period. Revenues increased 7% year-over-year to
$25.8 billion primarily due to robust growth of both segments - Pharmacy
Services and Retail Pharmacy. 

For the full-year 2009, CVS reported earnings per share of $2.74 compared to
$2.44 in 2008. Revenues recorded a 12.9% growth at $98.7 billion. 

We are pleased to see the robust performance of the pharmacy services segment
during the reported quarter. Revenues increased 14.5% to $13.5 billion. Revenue
growth would have been higher at 18.3% but for the recent generic introductions.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) reported stronger-than-expected quarterly sales on Tuesday as higher demand for its beverages in China, India and Brazil offset a drop in North America, sending the world's largest soft-drink maker's shares up 2.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lower costs and volume gain helped boost profit, which was in line with analysts' estimates. The company gained market share in the carbonated and noncarbonated drinks markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results continued a trend for the maker of Diet Coke, Sprite and Dasani water, which has relied on strength overseas to counter a weak North American market beset by high unemployment and low consumer confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This continues to be a story about emerging market growth," Morningstar analyst Phil Gorham said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted "some really strong numbers in China and India, particularly when you (consider) that they are actually cycling a pretty strong quarter in '08."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola said net income attributable to shareholders rose to $1.54 billion, or 66 cents per share, from $995 million, or 43 cents per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average were expecting 66 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net operating revenue rose 5 percent to $7.51 billion, topping analysts' average forecast of $7.22 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales by volume -- an important measure reflecting the amount of beverage concentrate sold -- rose 5 percent, outpacing gains of 2 percent in the third quarter, 4 percent in the second quarter and 2 percent in the first quarter. Several analysts, such as Stifel Nicolaus's Mark Swartzberg, expected volume to grow about 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Coke gave a tepid outlook for the current year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With consumers still challenged by a mixed global recovery, there again may be bumps along the way with quarter-to-quarter volatility still possible as we move through 2010," Coke CEO Muhtar Kent said on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kent later told reporters 2010 will be "a difficult environment," due to high unemployment in North America, Europe and Japan, as well as economic troubles in emerging markets of Latin America, Mexico and the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless he stood by Coke's long-term annual growth targets, which call for 3 percent to 4 percent volume growth, 5 percent to 6 percent revenue growth and high single-digit earnings per share growth. In November, Coke said it aims to double the revenue and its bottlers generate to roughly $200 billion by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kent also said foreign currency exchange rates would provide a slight benefit to results in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHINA, INDIA DRIVE GROWTH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter volume rose 11 percent in the Pacific region, driven by a 29 percent increase in China, where Coke said it will continue to focus on generating double-digit annual growth rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The per capitas (consumption rates) are still so low in China. We're just getting started, but again, it takes a lot of investment, a lot of effort to generate a quarter of a billion cases of incremental growth a year in China," Kent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quarterly volume rose 7 percent in Latin America, 1 percent in Europe and 5 percent in the company's Eurasia and Africa division, which was helped by a 28 percent increase in India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said its results will include a $100 million loss in the current first quarter related to revaluing its assets in Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volume fell 1 percent in the closely watched North American market because of continued pressure on consumer spending and weak traffic to restaurants. Still, that decline was smaller than the third quarter's 4 percent decline and JP Morgan analyst John Faucher's expectation for a 2 percent decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke's carbonated beverage volume rose 3 percent in the quarter. Volume of still beverages, such as juices, teas and waters, rose 9 percent, driven by a 14 percent gain internationally and flat results in North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke's rivalry with PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N), especially in North America, is poised for a new turn this year, as the No. 2 soft-drink maker is about to complete its acquisition of its largest bottlers, Pepsi Bottling Group Inc PBG.N and PepsiAmericas Inc PAS.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kent has repeatedly expressed his commitment to his company's decentralized, franchise bottling model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola shares rose $1.36 to close at $54.01 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Brad Dorfman with additional reporting by Martinne Geller and Jessica Wohl; Editing by Derek Caney, Maureen Bavdek, Dave Zimmerman and Robert MacMillan)&lt;/p&gt;

Cable Networks

Operating income at Cable Networks increased $27 million to $544 million for the
quarter driven by increases at the worldwide Disney Channels and ESPN, partially
offset by a decrease in income from equity investments. The increase at the
worldwide Disney Channels was driven by higher affiliate revenue due to
subscriber growth internationally and higher contractual rates domestically. The
increase at ESPN was due to higher affiliate and advertising revenue, partially
offset by higher programming and production costs. The increase in affiliate
revenue was primarily due to higher contractual rates and subscriber growth,
including growth from the launch of a new network in the United Kingdom while
higher advertising revenue was due to an increase in sold inventory, partially
offset by lower rates. Higher programming and production costs reflected costs
for soccer programming rights for the new network in the United Kingdom and
increased contractual costs for college football and NFL programming. Decreased
equity income was driven by increased programming and restructuring costs,
partially offset by higher advertising and affiliate revenue at A Television
Networks (AETN) which now includes the Lifetime networks. Restructuring charges
at AETN were primarily for severance costs as a result of the combination of
AETN and Lifetime in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. 

Broadcasting

Operating income at Broadcasting increased $42 million to $180 million for the
quarter primarily due to the absence of a bad debt charge in connection with the
bankruptcy of a syndication customer in the prior-year quarter and higher
revenues from ABC Studios productions driven by increased third party network
license fees and international sales of Criminal Minds. These increases were
partially offset by decreases at the ABC Television Network and owned television
stations. At the ABC Television Network, results reflected lower primetime
ratings and advertising rates, partially offset by a shift from political news
coverage in primetime in the prior-year quarter to entertainment programming in
the current quarter. At the owned television stations, results reflected lower
advertising revenue due to higher political advertising sales in the prior-year
quarter. 

Parks and Resorts

Parks and Resorts revenues for the quarter were essentially flat at $2.7 billion
and segment operating income decreased 2% to $375 million. Results for the
quarter reflected a decrease at Disneyland Paris, partially offset by an
increase at our domestic operations. 

The decrease at Disneyland Paris was due to decreased attendance and lower hotel
occupancy. 

Higher operating income at our domestic operations was driven by an increase in
attendance, which benefited from the shift of the New Year's holiday from the
second quarter in fiscal 2009 to the first quarter in fiscal 2010, and lower
costs, partially offset by decreased guest spending. The decrease in costs was
driven by the absence ofmark-to-market losses on fuel hedge contracts which
impacted the prior-year quarter, decreased food, beverage and merchandise sales
and savings from cost mitigation activities. These decreases were partially
offset by higher pension and postretirement medical expenses and labor and other
cost inflation. Decreased guest spending was driven by lower average ticket
prices and decreased food and beverage and merchandise spending. 

Studio Entertainment

Studio Entertainment revenues for the quarter were essentially flat at $1.9
billion and segment operating income increased 30% to $243 million. Higher
operating income was primarily due to an increase in domestic home
entertainment, partially offset by decreases in domestic theatrical distribution
and music distribution. 

Higher domestic home entertainment results were primarily due to lower
distribution costs and marketing expenses, driven by cost reduction initiatives,
and lower production cost amortization and participation expense. The decrease
in amortization and participation expense reflected the strong performance of Up
and The Proposal in the current quarter compared to WALL-E and The Chronicles of
Narnia: Prince Caspian, which had high participation costs, in the prior-year
quarter.

The decrease in domestic theatrical distribution was driven by higher film cost
write-downs in the current quarter. Lower results in music distribution were
primarily due to lower album sales reflecting the strong performance of High
School Musical 3 in the prior-year quarter. 

Consumer Products

Consumer Products revenues for the quarter decreased 3% to $746 million and
segment operating income decreased 8% to $243 million. 

Lower segment operating income was primarily due to decreased earned licensing
revenue across a number of product categories driven by lower performance of
High School Musical and Hannah Montana merchandise. 

Interactive Media

Interactive Media revenues for the quarter decreased 29% to $221 million and
operating results improved from a loss of $45 million in the prior-year quarter
to a loss of $10 million in the current quarter driven by improvements at Disney
Interactive Studios and Disney Online. 

At Disney Interactive Studios, lower unit sales of self-published video games,
driven by fewer releases, were more than offset by lower marketing expenses,
inventory costs and bad debt charges. The increase at Disney Online was driven
by increased subscription revenues at Club Penguin. 

OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Restructuring and Impairment Charges

The Company recorded restructuring and impairment charges totaling $105 million
in the current quarter primarily related to organizational and cost structure
initiatives at our Media Networks and Studio Entertainment segments including
actions taken by new Studio segment leadership. Restructuring charges of $66
million were primarily severance and related costs while impairment charges of
$39 million consisted of write-offs of capitalized costs related to abandoned
film projects.

lower film and television production spending and the timing of certain sports
rights payments and advance travel deposits.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This earnings release presents earnings per share excluding the impact of
certain items, net borrowings, free cash flow, and aggregate segment operating
income, all of which are important financial measures for the Company but are
not financial measures defined by GAAP. 

These measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP
financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of earnings per
share, borrowings, cash flow or net income as determined in accordance with
GAAP. Net borrowings, free cash flow, and aggregate segment operating income as
we have calculated them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
reported by other companies. 

Earnings per share excluding certain items - The Company uses earnings per share
excluding certain items to evaluate the performance of the Company`s operations
exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period
to period. In the current quarter, these items included restructuring and
impairment charges and a gain on the sale of an interest in a television service
in Europe. In the prior-year quarter, we excluded a gain on the sale of our
investment in two pay television services in Latin America. The Company believes
that information about earnings per share exclusive of these impacts is useful
to investors, particularly where the impact of the excluded items is significant
in relation to reported earnings, because the measure allows for comparability
between periods of the operating performance of the Company`s business and
allows investors to evaluate the impact of these items separately from the
impact of the operations of the business. The following table reconciles
reported earnings per share to earnings per share excluding certain items:

Net borrowings - The Company believes that information about net borrowings
provides investors with a useful perspective on our financial condition. Net
borrowings reflect the subtraction of cash and cash equivalents from total
borrowings. Since we earn interest income on our cash balances that offsets a
portion of the interest expense we pay on our borrowings, net borrowings can be
used as a measure to gauge net interest expense. In addition, a portion of our
cash and cash equivalents is available to repay outstanding indebtedness when
the indebtedness matures or when other circumstances arise. However, we may not
immediately apply cash and cash equivalents to the reduction of debt, nor do we
expect that we would use all of our available cash and cash equivalents to repay
debt in the ordinary course of business. 

Free cash flow - The Company uses free cash flow (cash provided by operations
less investments in parks, resorts and other property), among other measures, to
evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for
purposes other than capital expenditures. Management believes that information
about free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the
cash available to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments and
pay dividends or repurchase shares. 

Aggregate segment operating income - The Company evaluates the performance of
its operating segments based on segment operating income, and management uses
aggregate segment operating income as a measure of the performance of operating
businesses separate from non-operating factors. The Company believes that
information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors by
allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company`s
portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net
income, thus providing separate insight into both operations and the other
factors that affect reported results. 

A reconciliation of segment operating income to net income is as follows (in
millions):

&lt;p&gt;Mining Engineer Who Called for $27 Billion Award Against Chevron Hides
Disqualifying Financial Conflict of Interest
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
In a court filing today in Lago Agrio, Ecuador,Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) provided
newly discovered information showing that the author of a report recommending
that Chevron be ordered to pay $27 billion in damages is the majority owner of
an oilfield remediation company that stands to gain financially from a judgment
against Chevron. Due to the remediation company`s relationship with Ecuador`s
state-owned oil company, Petroecuador, Chevron called upon the court to
immediately reject the work of Richard Cabrera on the grounds that he knowingly
hid his relationship and that he stands to gain from what was supposed to be
unbiased work for the court. 

"For three years, Mr. Cabrera has concealed clear financial conflicts of
interest that disqualify him from acting as an independent and objective
evaluator of the evidence in the case," Chevron Vice President and General
Counsel Hewitt Pate said. "While Mr. Cabrera`s financial interests alone are
sufficient grounds for his report to be rejected, his intentional concealment of
those interests further demonstrates that the entirety of his work lacks
honesty, integrity, or credibility." 

Recently uncovered records, from 2003 through 2008, show Cabrera is co-founder,
general manager, majority stockholder, and legal representative of an oilfield
remediation company, Compa&#241;&#237;a Ambiental Minera-Petrolera S.A. ("CAMPET"), which
is registered to perform oilfield remediation and other services for
Petroecuador. Cabrera failed to disclose these business interests as required by
law. 

In his report, Cabrera absolves Petroecuador of any responsibility or
remediation obligations associated with past or present oil operations despite
its majority ownership of the Petroecuador-Texaco Petroleum consortium, which
operated until mid-1992, and Petroecuador`s sole ownership and operation of the
former consortium fields for the past 18 years. Disregarding Ecuadorian media
reports and other evidence showing that Petroecuador has spilled millions of
gallons of oil since taking over exclusive ownership and operations in 1992,
Cabrera exclusively attributes pollution in the Amazon region of Ecuador to
Texaco Petroleum, now a fifth-tier subsidiary of Chevron. Cabrera`s report says
that Chevron, because it acquired Texaco Inc. in 2001, is solely liable for
damages, citing grossly inflated remediation costs while ignoring Petroecuador`s
role in oil operations and its well-documented poor environmental performance.
Cabrera`s report also calls on Chevron to pay $375 million to update
Petroecuador`s oilfield equipment, which Petroecuador has for decades failed to
properly maintain or replace. These findings make no sense as a matter of
Ecuadorian law or common sense, but are consistent with furthering
Petroecuador`s interests, as well as Cabrera`s own. 

After knowingly omitting to disclose his financial interest in CAMPET, as well
as CAMPET`s status as a registered Petroecuador contractor, Cabrera
affirmatively misrepresented in court filings that he did not have any
impediment or conflict that would affect his performance as an "independent"
court-appointed witness. Cabrera violated the law by accepting his appointment,
which required an explicit acknowledgment of public duties as an impartial
analyst-an acknowledgment Cabrera could not truthfully have made given his
financial interests. 

Cabrera`s recommendations and independence were already compromised prior to the
discovery of his conflict of interests:

* The Amazon Defense Front, the named financial beneficiary of the lawsuit,
directly and improperly paid Cabrera more than $200,000 for his work; 
* Sections of Cabrera`s $27 billion claim are copied word-for-word from
documents written by Amazon Defense Front lawyers; 
* Photographs and video show representatives of the Amazon Defense Front
conducting Cabrera`s field work as well as preparing soil and water samples for
Cabrera, who had promised to carry out his work independently; 
* Nearly 90 percent of Cabrera`s $27 billion figure is allocated to issues that
he was not directed to examine and that are unrelated to the actual claims in
the Ecuador lawsuit; 
* Cabrera assessed more than $9 billion as compensation for cancer deaths
without providing any medical evidence or even the name of a single alleged
victim or family member beneficiary to support his recommendation; 
* Cabrera recommends Chevron pay more than $8.4 billion for what he deems
"unjust enrichment," despite the fact that Texaco Petroleum earned less than
$500 million in profits during the life of the consortium while the government
of Ecuador received more than $24 billion, more than ninety percent of the total
revenue generated by the consortium. Moreover, there is no basis in Ecuadorian
law for such an award; 
* Cabrera assessed $3.2 billion for groundwater remediation and $428 million to
improve potable water systems even though he did not take any samples of
streams, rivers, municipal water sources or drinking water wells, and states in
his own report that he did not have enough data to develop a groundwater
remediation plan; 
* Cabrera recommends more than $2.7 billion dollars for pit remediation,
averaging more than $3 million per pit. This figure is vastly inflated compared
to the $85,000 per-pit actual cost for Petroecuador`s recent remediation work
that has been implemented to the full satisfaction of the government. Proper
remediation, therefore, of every pit that Petroecuador is obligated to clean up
would cost well under $100,000,000; 
* Cabrera claims $1.7 billion in damages for oil infrastructure sites that have
been in constant use by Petroecuador for nearly two decades and substantially
expanded by Petroecuador since Texaco Petroleum`s departure in 1992; 
* Cabrera assessed more than $1 billion in soil remediation for sites he never
visited.

Chevron previously challenged Cabrera`s lack of qualifications as well as the
biased and baseless substance of his report. But Judge Juan Nu&#241;ez, who
subsequently was disqualified for his involvement in a scheme to solicit bribes
in connection with letting remediation contracts that were supposed to be funded
with the proceeds of the judgment Cabrera recommended, inexplicably ignored
those challenges, thus shielding Cabrera`s work from scrutiny. Now that
Cabrera`s clear conflicts of interest are revealed, Chevron has demanded that
the court strike his entire involvement in the case. 

"Mr. Cabrera has placed his own financial interests, as well as the interests of
Petroecuador and the Amazon Defense Front, ahead of the interest of justice,"
Chevron`s Pate added. "Today`s disclosure further illustrates the illegitimacy
of Mr. Cabrera`s fictitious $27 billion recommendation. Taken into account with
Mr. Cabrera`s collusion with the plaintiffs` lawyers and representatives, it is
clear that his report should have no bearing in the outcome of this trial." 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company`s success is
driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has taken another step toward releasing its Visual Studio 2010 IDE and the accompanying .Net Framework 4 programming platform, offering a release candidate (RC) for the paired technologies on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RC stage is considered the last step prior to a general release, with developers able to offer final feedback. Microsoft has scheduled the launch of Visual Studio 2010 and .Net Framework 4 for April 12, after having scrapped an initial March 22 launch date to work on performance issues found by beta testers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ InfoWorld previewed the second beta of Visual Studio 2010 and found it impressive. | Keep up with app dev issues and trends with InfoWorld's Fatal Exception blog.  ] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The downloadable release candidate was offered to MSDN subscribers on Monday. Non-members can get it on Wednesday. Visual Studio 2010 features capabilities for developing applications for the Microsoft SharePoint collaboration platform, Windows 7, and the Windows Azure cloud platform; .Net Framework 4 offers features such as a reduction in size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thank you for all the feedback you've sent our way so far," said S. Somasegar, senior vice president of the Microsoft developer division, in a blog post on Monday, "The goal of this RC is to get more feedback from you and ensure we've addressed the performance issues in the product.&#160; We have made significant performance improvements specifically as it relates to loading solutions, typing, building and debugging."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has received a lot of feedback on the Beta 2 release of Visual Studio 2010 and .Net Framework 4, said Jason Zander, general manager of the Microsoft developer division, in a Monday blog post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular many of you pointed out areas of performance where we were not at parity with [Visual Studio 2008] and it was impacting your ability to adopt the product," Zander said.&#160; "Some of those areas of feedback included general UI responsiveness (including painting, menus, remote desktop and VMs), editing (typing, scrolling, and Intellisense), designers (Silverlight and Windows Presentation Foundation in particular), improved memory usage, debugging (stepping, managed / native interop), build times, and solution/project load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, [Microsoft Technical Fellow Brian Harry] and I have been doing daily stand-up meetings with the team working through the feedback.&#160; We've conducted several private[ [community technology previews] with people who reported issues in order to validate the direction of the work.&#160; In December we made the hard call to extend the Beta 2 period to continue to drive improvements into the product," Zander said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also is working with third-party companies with Visual Studio add-ins, such as Resharper and CodeRush, to make sure the environment works well, Zander said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers can report feedback on the RC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other software development-related happenings at Microsoft, the company and NBC this week are reporting that the Microsoft Silverlight plug-in technology for rich Internet applications will again be used for online Olympics video coverage this month at NBCOlympics.com.

&lt;p&gt;New iBOLT Integration Suite Component for Microsoft SharePoint Enables Unlimited
Closed Loop Business Process Flows between SharePoint, Social Media and
Enterprise Systems
IRVINE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Magic Software Enterprises Inc., a subsidiary of Magic Software Enterprises Ltd.
(NASDAQ: MGIC), a provider of application platforms and business and process
integration solutions, today announced that its new iBOLT business integration
suite component for Microsoft SharePoint will enable unlimited closed loop
integration between Microsoft SharePoint and enterprise systems for ERP, CRM,
HRIS and other critical business functions as well as social media content from
websites such as Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook. 

Michael Singer, Technology Director for Magic Software Americas, is presenting
the solution at SPTechCon 2010 in San Francisco, Calif. Singer`s presentation,
part of the "Tell Me Something I Don`t Know (About SharePoint)" panel, will take
place on Wednesday, February 10, at 4:30 p.m. PT. Demonstrations will also be
available from Magic Software, at booth 305 of the conference. 

As enterprises look to leverage the productivity that Microsoft SharePoint and
other rich platforms provide, they need companies to cost-effectively guide and
simplify the integration of business applications. Magic Software`s iBOLT
provides customers with simple, code-free integration, granting the ability to
optimize their most critical business processes. 

Singer will demonstrate how the iBOLT Integration Suite integrates Microsoft
SharePoint with enterprise systems such as ERP and CRM and with popular Social
Media and Web 2.0 technologies. Using a demonstration application called Social
Launch, Singer will show how iBOLT and Microsoft SharePoint provide users the
ability to pull product information from ERP systems such as SAP Business One or
JD Edwards and coordinate timed product launches by disseminating information
through Microsoft Dynamics CRM, email and social media platforms such as
Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook. 

Glenn Johnson, Senior Vice President Marketing for Magic Software Americas
commented, "Our customers are currently and continually searching for ways to
cut costs, save time and be more efficient by leveraging information trapped in
back-end systems. iBOLT`s automated exchange of information with Microsoft
SharePoint Server augments this business strategy and simplifies online
interaction for users." 

Singer has more than 10 years experience leading application development and
integration projects for Magic Software. He has applied his expertise in
application interface design and the human experience in business processes for
Magic Software for numerous client projects including Allstate, Steelcase and
FMRP. 

SPTechCon will take place from February 10-12, in San Francisco, Calif. The
conference will focus on helping Microsoft SharePoint administrators, developers
and power business users find products and solutions that can help them master
the power of Microsoft SharePoint 2010 for their organizations.

&lt;p&gt; * Ghana repeats threat to block $4 bln deal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Ghana says has written to ExxonMobil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Exxon declines comment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Releads with letter from Ghana to ExxonMobil)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Kwasi Kpodo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ACCRA, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Ghana has repeated its threat to
block the $4 billion sale of an oilfield stake to ExxonMobil
(XOM.N) by Kosmos Energy, the latest move in a tussle over
control of key assets in the west African country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Ghana wants to buy the same Jubilee field stake for its own
state-run Ghana National Petroleum Corp (GNPC) and the West
African country's energy minister said he had written a letter
to the U.S. oil company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We said we would not approve the deal if it should go ahead
as it is now," Energy Minister Joseph Oteng-Adjei told reporters
at a conference, without saying when Ghana sent the letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Privately-owned Kosmos agreed last autumn to sell its 30.875
percent interest in The West Cape Three Points Block and its 18
percent stake in Deepwater Tano Block in the Gulf of Guinea to
Exxon for around $4 billion, sources close to the deal have
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LEGAL THREAT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier on Tuesday the Wall Street Journal reported that
Ghana's government had actually blocked the deal -- something it
has been threatening to do since October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Kosmos sources have said the government can only block a
contract if it can show that the potential buyer lacks
sufficient technical skills or financial strength -- a hurdle at
which Exxon, the world's largest non-government controlled oil
company, is unlikely to fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said if the government were to block the deal, it
could face legal action from Kosmos, which is backed by U.S.
private equity funds Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) and Warburg
Pincus LLC [WP.UL], and that its threats could be intended to
scupper the sale without opening itself up to a lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon spokesman Patrick McGinn said the company did not
"comment on the details of commercial discussions or
opportunities," adding only that it "routinely evaluates
potential development opportunities around the world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Jubilee field, which crosses the two blocks in which
Kosmos holds stakes, has 800 million barrels of recoverable
reserves, Oteng-Adjei said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jubilee was discovered in 2007 by a partnership of the
Ghanaian government and international firms, and is expected to
begin producing in the last quarter of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday the government
had blocked the deal -- something it has been threatening to do
since October -- and would only allow GNPC buy the stake.

&lt;p&gt;New Lifestyle Campaign Will Feature Disney Channel Stars and the First Lady
WASHINGTON &amp; BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
As part of its ongoing effort to promote healthy lifestyles and nutrition for
kids and families, Disney today announced that it will develop a program in
collaboration with First Lady Michelle Obama supporting "Let`s Move," her newly
announced campaign to create a healthier generation. 

Disney will create a series of PSAs featuring the First Lady and leading Disney
Channel stars to inspire healthier eating habits, physical activity and more.
The messages will be featured across Disney`s kid and family targeted media
platforms, including Disney Channel, Disney XD, Radio Disney, and Disney.com and
will begin airing later this year. 

"Having been at the forefront of making healthier lifestyle choices appealing to
kids and families, Disney is delighted to work with the First Lady to promote
exercise, nutrition and healthy living," said Robert A. Iger, president and CEO,
The Walt Disney Company. 

Disney`s participation in "Let`s Move" complements its long-standing commitment
to kids` health and nutrition. In 2006, Disney pioneered groundbreaking
nutritional guidelines aimed at giving parents and children healthier eating
options. Disney food policies limit the use of the company name and its
characters to only those kid-focused products that meet specific guidelines,
including limits on calories, fat, saturated fat and sugar. Disney made
nutritionally-beneficial changes in the meals served to children at all
Disney-operated restaurants in the Disney Parks and Resorts. Today, more than
85% of Disney`s licensed food portfolio consists of healthier options, including
produce and low-fat dairy with more than one billion servings of fruits and
vegetables sold in 2009 alone. Disney Channels Worldwide is committed to
programming that reflects and recognizes that everyone shares a responsibility
to encourage kids and families to adopt healthy lifestyles. Guidelines are
employed to model behavior that demonstrates good nutrition and physical
activity. At least one episode of each series currently in production --
including "Hannah Montana," "Wizards of Waverly Place," "Sonny With A Chance,"
"Zeke and Luther," "Phineas and Ferb" and "The Suite Life on Deck" -- centers on
a healthy lifestyle theme. In addition, over 100 interstitials have been
dedicated to encouraging healthier lifestyles. They include 'Pass the Plate,' a
global effort to both inform and empower viewers, showing them how kids just
like them around the world enjoy and benefit from healthy foods, and "Get`cha
Head in the Game," an interstitial series that inspires kids to follow their
dreams through physical activity.

&lt;p&gt;Windows 7 does not ruin notebook batteries or issue premature warnings that the power is exhausted, Microsoft 's head of Windows said Monday in response to customer complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within minutes, Windows 7 users who have experienced those problems disagreed, calling the explanation "hand washing" and noting that if the company's conclusion was correct, then many affected users must be "under some sort of bizarre bad battery curse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Stephen Sinofsky, the president of the Windows division, Windows 7 is doing what it's supposed to when it reports that a laptop battery needs to be replaced, one of the symptoms that users began reporting as long ago as June 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To the very best of the collective ecosystem knowledge, Windows 7 is correctly warning batteries that are in fact failing," said Sinofsky in an entry to the Engineering Windows 7 blog Monday afternoon. "In every case we have been able to identify the battery being reported on was in fact in need of recommended replacement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinofsky also dismissed claims by a minority of users that Windows 7 had permanently crippled their notebooks' batteries. Numerous users said that after upgrading to Windows 7, their batteries' lifespan was dramatically shortened, then completely curtailed. Returning to another operating system, even Linux , did not restore the battery's performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Windows 7 is neither incorrectly reporting on battery status nor in any way whatsoever causing batteries to reach this state," Sinofsky maintained. He also said that it was impossible for Windows 7 to harm the battery because of the way the operating system interacts with the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no way for Windows 7 or any other OS to write, set or configure battery status information," Sinofsky said. "All of the battery actions of charging and discharging are completely controlled by the battery hardware. Some reports erroneously claimed Windows was modifying this information, which is definitely not possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But one battery maker said it was possible that Windows 7 was involved in some way. "The operating system usually receives information from system firmware which is responsible for monitoring battery capacity and operation," said a spokeswoman for Boston-Power, a Westborough, Mass.-based company that makes long-life Lithium-ion batteries. The firmware she referred to is the PC's BIOS, which boots the computer and initializes the hardware components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If there is an issue with the passing of information between the firmware and the operating system, it might cause improper warnings issued by the OS," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally, Microsoft thought that very thing. Last Wednesday, when the company first responded to the growing chorus of complaints, it said, "We are investigating this issue in conjunction with our hardware partners, which appears to be related to system firmware (BIOS)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debugging battery-BIOS-operating system issues can be "very complicated," the Boston-Power spokeswoman said, because the BIOS can vary from one laptop make and model to another. "It is difficult to know what control the OS has over battery operation in specific systems," she admitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinofsky didn't dive into that level of detail in his blog entry, but emphatically laid out Microsoft's theory that users' reactions were due to the fact that the "Consider replacing your battery" notification was new to Windows 7. He also said Microsoft had traced each complaint, even of new notebooks behaving this way, and found that in all cases the battery really was kaput. Microsoft also combed through the Windows 7 code to verify that there was no way for the operating system to modify a battery's status information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That didn't matter to users. In comments added to Sinofsky's blog, as well as in messages posted to the long support thread dedicated to Windows 7 battery issues, users rejected the executive's arguments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I completely reject Steven Sinofsky's explanation. It's simple hand-washing," said a user identified as "Btstech" on the support thread. "There are hundreds of postings here explaining the problem. Immediately after installing Windows 7, people's batteries are effectively 'dying.' Numerous people have purchased NEW batteries and encountered the same behavior immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The OS is causing this for some reason. Not saying it's damaging the batteries, but it's rendering them useless," Btstech continued. "This is a no brainer. There is a problem here with the new operating system and the way it interacts with various laptops and it must be fixed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another user took noted Windows blogger Rafael Rivera to task for his comments on the same thread. Rivera, who writes the Within Windows blog , had questioned comparisons of battery usage between Windows XP and Windows 7 because the latter's flashy Aero interface increases battery consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If what you are saying is true, then we simply have a different problem: Windows 7 provides dramatically worse battery life than any of the operating systems that preceded it," said "kev99sl" in reply to Rivera. "If this is not the case, and there is no actual problem at all, then a new battery should provide the cure, right? Ah, but new batteries don't solve the problem: the behavior is repeated. Well then, the new batteries must be defective, correct? Then it would seem that you would have all of us believe that we are suffering from an oddly focused, unusual affliction that will somehow not allow us to purchase properly functioning batteries, regardless of the maker. Apparently we're under some sort of bizarre bad battery curse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a comment added to Sinofsky's blog entry, the same user argued that the problem wasn't whether batteries were new or not, but that Windows 7 consumed power at a prodigious pace, a complaint that precedes the new operating system's release .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At some point, Microsoft and its OEM partners are going to have to conclude that a random sampling of consumers are somehow experiencing the extraordinary bad luck of constantly purchasing faulty batteries or, more likely, that there is an issue," said "kev99sl" Monday. "I think it's simply a matter of time until the latter is uncovered, as the majority of impacted consumers are just now coming around to working through battery warranty issues, purchasing new batteries, returning new batteries assumed to be faulty, etc. only to discover that second and third newly purchased batteries do not rectify the problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinofsky denied that there was a problem with Windows 7, old batteries or new. "We have no confirmed cases of new machines with the as-purchased batteries," he said, contradicting numerous reports on the support thread. But Sinofsky also said Microsoft would continue to investigate a possible problem in the operating system. "We are going to continue to be diligent and use all the tools at our disposal to get to the bottom of a report that has the potential to require a code change we would distribute to customers," he acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is clearly concerned about the potential fallout over the battery reports if Sinofsky is turning his attention to it: Yesterday was the first time that he has posted to the Engineering Windows 7 blog since Aug. 10, 2009 , when he defended the company's reaction to a crash bug in the not-yet-released OS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also encouraged users with new batteries, or those thought to be in good condition, to contact him via the blog's e-mail form if they see the Windows 7 warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Google have turned to Taiwanese chipset vendor MediaTek to boost their traction in smartphones aimed at China and other emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MediaTek has already developed a chipset and other hardware for Microsoft's Windows Mobile 6 operating system and has sent the package, MediaTek hardware plus Windows Mobile software, to handset makers in China so they can start designing new Windows Mobile smartphones, a MediaTek representative said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a huge thirst for smartphones in emerging markets," Microsoft said in a statement. "For many people, the phone rather than the PC is the main entry point to the Internet, resulting in a high demand for rich communication devices. In order to meet this demand, we have teamed up with MediaTek to facilitate the provision of affordable smartphones," the company added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MediaTek will release a similar hardware and software package with Google's Android mobile phone OS in the second half of this year, the MediaTek representative said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google did not return calls requesting comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deals will give Microsoft and Google access to hundreds of small mobile phone makers in China that sell inexpensive smartphones at home as well as abroad in India and other emerging markets, said Flora Wu, analyst at research firm BDA (China) Limited. MediaTek has worked with these Chinese handset makers for years, providing the chips and other hardware, while the handset makers focus on the external design of the phones and handset sales. Partnering with MediaTek keeps RD costs low for the phone makers in their struggle against bigger, established companies such as Nokia and Samsung Electronics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft in particular has lost market share in the smartphone wars, mainly to Apple's iPhone and to BlackBerry phones from Research In Motion (RIM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Windows Mobile OS ended 2009 with an 8.8 percent share of the global smartphone market, by number of units, down from 13.9 percent in 2008, according to market research firm Canalys. Google's Android OS was just behind Microsoft in fifth place in global share at 4.7 percent, up from 0.5 percent in 2008, while third-place Apple leaped to 15.1 percent from 9.6 percent and second-place RIM rose to 20.8 percent from 16.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symbian, the leading smartphone OS, also lost share, dropping to 47.2 percent in 2009 from 52.4 percent a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key for Microsoft in the partnership with MediaTek will be providing software support for Chinese mobile phone makers, said Daryl Chiam, a senior analyst at Canalys in Singapore. The Chinese companies are small and don't have as many research and development resources as bigger rivals, yet they need to differentiate their smartphones with unique user interfaces and more, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has talked about driving down the cost of smartphones for emerging markets for years. The company's Unlimited Potential Group has developed a concept called Fone+ for developing nations as a way to expand computing around the world, and primarily in poor countries. The idea is to connect a low-to-mid-end smartphone based on the Windows Mobile OS to a TV via a docking station so data on the handset can be displayed on the TV screen. That way, people can use the computing power in the smartphone on a big screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did not return requests for comment on this story and it is unclear if Fone+ is part of the pact with MediaTek announced Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
Landmark Software and Services, a product service line of Halliburton`s
(NYSE:HAL) Drilling and Evaluation Division, announced today that a major
contract was signed with Chevron Energy Technology Company, a Chevron
Corporation (NYSE:CVX) subsidiary, for the global deployment of the OpenWorks
R5000 data management system. This solution will be used by more than 1,500
Chevron earth scientists and is a key element of Chevron`s next generation
interpretation strategy. 

"Chevron`s selection of OpenWorks R5000 software as the foundation for its next
generation interpretation environment is a testament to the value clients
continue to receive from the OpenWorks application," said Gene Minnich, vice
president, Halliburton Landmark Software and Services. "For the last 15 years we
have adhered to the principle of openness, and this has helped position
OpenWorks software as the leading project management system in our industry. The
commitment to evolving this reliable and secure enterprise class system enables
clients such as Chevron to achieve their ongoing business objectives." 

"Chevron continues to make strategic investments in critical information
technologies to drive superior performance and growth in our Exploration and
Asset Development workflows," said Jim Green, Chief Information Officer of
Chevron Energy Technology. "In developing our next generation interpretation
platform, Chevron carefully considered our business requirements, the
capabilities available in the upstream data management market and the alignment
between the two. The OpenWorks data management solution has been an underlying
part of Chevron`s upstream workflows for the past 15 years and we found that
today it remains an important component of Chevron`s information technology
portfolio." 

Additional capabilities available with the OpenWorks R5000 release such as meta
data capture and quality control of seismic data, along with the ability to
catalog and manage well data across multiple projects, enables improved data
management efficiency within Chevron`s exploration and asset development teams.
Open access to the OpenWorks platform for the integration of other vendors and
Chevron`s proprietary applications provides the flexibility needed to refine
upstream workflows as the build out of the next generation interpretation
environment continues. 

OpenWorks software is used by more than 12,000 interpreters and 800 E
companies worldwide. In October 2008, the OpenWorks R5000 release won a World
Oil Award in the category of Best Data Management solution.

&lt;p&gt; * Ghana threatens to block $4 bln deal, has not yet done so&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Ghana says only state-owned firm allowed to buy it-WSJ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Exxon declines comment
 
 (Releads and updates throughout with Ghana energy minister
confirmation)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Kwasi Kpodo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ACCRA, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Ghana has not blocked a planned $4
billion oilfield stake sale to Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) by Kosmos
Energy but still threatens to do so if the parties do not
abandon the deal, the West African country's energy minister
said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday the government
had blocked the deal -- something it has been threatening to do
since October -- and would only allow the state oil company to
buy the stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kosmos agreed last autumn to sell its 30.875 percent
interest in The West Cape Three Points Block and its 18 percent
stake in Deepwater Tano Block in the Gulf of Guinea to Exxon for
around $4 billion, sources close to the deal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ghana's top oil official said on Tuesday the government had
written to Exxon about the deal but had not gone beyond
repeating the threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If they continue with the current deal, Ghana will not give
its consent to it," Energy Minister Joseph Oteng-Adjei told
reporters at a conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kosmos sources have said the government can only block a
contract if it can show that the potential buyer lacks
sufficient technical skills or financial strength -- a hurdle at
which Exxon, the world's largest non-government controlled oil
company, is unlikely to fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said if the government were to block the deal, it
could face legal action from Kosmos, which is backed by U.S.
private equity funds Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) and Warburg
Pincus LLC [WP.UL], and that its threats could be intended to
scupper the sale without opening itself up to a lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon spokesman Patrick McGinn said the company did not
"comment on the details of commercial discussions or
opportunities," adding only that it "routinely evaluates
potential development opportunities around the world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Jubilee field, which crosses the two blocks in which
Kosmos holds stakes, has 800 million barrels of recoverable
reserves, Oteng-Adjei said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jubilee was discovered in 2007 by a partnership of the
Ghanaian government and international firms, and is expected to
begin producing in the last quarter of this year.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Markets are signaling concern over Walt Disney Company's credit condition, as
their recent CDS and liquidity performance of late will attest, according to
Fitch Solutions in its latest update on Global CDS Spreads/Liquidity Scores for
companies scheduled to come out with earnings announcements this week. 

Disney's regional liquidity has increased seven percentiles, while its CDS
spreads have widened 13% over the last three months. Disney has been
underperforming the overall North America media sector, for which CDS has
tightened 7% during the same period. In contrast, CDS on New York Times Co. has
tightened more than 20% over the last three months, indicating an improved
credit outlook after reaching distressed levels a year ago. 

"The recession's effects on discretionary spending for entertainment remain
lasting, albeit to varying degrees," said Author and Managing Director Jonathan
Di Giambattista. "While the CDS market indicates that Disney is the strongest
media company, the increased liquidity signals new uncertainty in the face of
slumping box office, ad sales and theme park attendance." 

Six North American insurance companies are also reporting this week, with some
big names continuing to underperform. Allstate Corporation's (scheduled to
report on Wednesday) saw CDS spreads tightening 3.7%, compared to 6.3% firming
observed for the industry. Liquidity for Allstate moved into the fourth regional
percentile, from the 14th. 'The market is increasingly concerned over Allstate's
sizeable commercial real estate market exposure, while the potential outcome of
President Obama's proposed tax levy is also creating some uncertainty' said Di
Giambattista. 

Credit markets are signaling increasing uncertainty for Progress Energy Inc,
scheduled to report earnings on Thursday. Over the past quarter, the North
American oil &amp; gas industry experienced 14% CDS tightening. In contrast, CDS on
Progress Energy widened 30% as liquidity shot up 10 regional percentiles, moving
into the 13th percentile. EnCana Corporation, also reporting Thursday, has
underperformed the industry as well, tightening less than 10%, while liquidity
moved up 24 regional percentiles.

Large Capacity 16GB DIMMs Make It Possible
PRINCETON, N.J.--(Business Wire)--
Dataram Corporation (NASDAQ:DRAM), a worldwide leader in the manufacture of
high-quality computer memory, storage products, software and services, today
announced the immediate availability of high-capacity, 16GB DDR3 memory upgrades
for IBM and Oracle`s Sun 2-way servers that use Intel Xeon 5500 (Nehalem-EP)
processors. 

A maximum memory capacity of 192GB is now a reality for these popular servers.
Until now, larger more expensive 4-socket servers were required to reach this
memory capacity. These IBM and Sun 2-way servers are attractive alternatives,
and with 24GB of memory for each processor core, the systems are ideally suited
for memory intensive applications requiring high I/O rates and for server
consolidation with virtualization. 

Dataram`s new 16GB memory upgrades-DRIX1066RQ/16GB for IBM servers and
DRSX1066RQ/16GB for Sun servers-are available and supported for the systems and
models listed in the tables below. Dataram server memory is backed by a Lifetime
Warranty and The Guardian Program, providing the protection and support required
for data center environments.

&lt;p&gt;  SCOTTS VALLEY, CA, Feb 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Virtual Instruments, a leader in storage area network (SAN) and virtual
infrastructure optimization solutions, today announced JPS Health
Network, a network of health care facilities based in Tarrant County,
Texas, is using NetWisdom in their main campus data center. NetWisdom is
being used to help the organization proactively automate the monitoring
and analysis of the affect the SAN has on application availability in
order to avoid problems and anticipate performance and availability
issues before users and application owners suffer the consequences. In
addition, with NetWisdom, they now have a common monitoring, measurement
and reporting solution to help communicate on an on-going basis with the
server and application administrators, as well as their vendors.

    Facing an increasingly digitized patient-facing environment, JPS was
challenged with tight budgets and with getting more performance from their
existing IT resources. One of the key challenges was in maintaining
traditional high service levels in the face of 50% annual digital data
storage growth on their 200+terabyte Fiber Channel SAN, while keeping
costs down. With a growing number of ports and disks, lack of
standardization amongst vendor-supplied tools, and an inability to do
predictive problem avoidance, it was becoming a challenge to manage the
SAN. The only way to do this without dramatically increasing the staff
size was to find some way to proactively automate the monitoring and
analysis of the affect of the SAN on application availability.

    "We've used NetWisdom to find and resolve four problems since
implementation, before they would have eventually caused an outage," said
Christopher Carlton, storage team lead, JPS Health Network. "We're
essentially using it as an additional person on our team. Once you have
it, you experience tremendous value."

    Prior to the NetWisdom deployment, JPS would have to wait until a problem,
such as an outage or a performance issue, was reported. In a typical
scenario, they would look at individual components, system logs, etc. and
perform "process of elimination" troubleshooting. With NetWisdom, problems
were detected much earlier -- before they became serious -- and root-cause
analysis became much more efficient. For instance, with NetWisdom, a
problem the server team initially thought was SCSI controller-related
turned out to be an HBA issue, saving potentially days or weeks of
exhaustive investigative work.

    "The unique challenges of a health care IT environment make a vendor
agnostic monitoring solution an essential component in helping to predict
and prevent application outages caused by the SAN or newly deployed
virtualization technologies," said Mark Urdahl, chief executive officer,
Virtual Instruments. "JPS Health Network is a great example of how
NetWisdom, serving as an extra set of eyes and ears, can help
organizations with exponential data growth control costs and maintain a
high level of service."

    JPS Health Network's Fort Worth datacenter has a 200+ terabyte SAN growing
at over 40% annually connected to 35 application servers through a Brocade
fabric supporting 300 fibre channel SAN ports. To optimize budget and
resources, JPS uses both VMware server virtualization and storage
virtualization. Storage is provided by HDS USP/V virtualized storage
systems, with two modular systems virtualized behind it and another
standalone modular array. There are now 3 full-time staff managing all
storage and backup related tasks for the entire JPS organization,
supporting all office functions like email and billing, and the ongoing
migration to online patient records.

&lt;p&gt;DOE Laboratories and Offices Leverage Their Purchasing Power to Secure
Best-Value Pricing
HERNDON, Va.--(Business Wire)--
CDW Government LLC (CDW-G), a leading source of Information Technology (IT)
solutions to governments and educators, today announced it has partnered with
TKC Integration Services (TKCIS), a subsidiary of Qivliq, LLC, a small
disadvantaged business providing a broad spectrum of IT enterprise technology
products and services to the Federal government, on a five-year enterprise
agreement to deliver a broad range of Microsoft server, desktop and
collaboration software to the Department of Energy (DOE). 

By partnering with CDW-G, prime contractor TKCIS will leverage CDW-G`s
e-commerce, service and distribution capabilities, including software license
tracking, to support the fulfillment of the agreement, while providing direct
technical and customer support to the DOE. 

Through the agreement, the DOE`s 21 laboratories, field offices and headquarters
will leverage their collective purchasing power to secure best-value pricing,
driving down software expenditures. The DOE will also benefit from five years of
Microsoft software assurance, which allows purchasers to upgrade to the latest
Microsoft releases at will. Software assurance benefits also include home
purchase programs for employees, on-site training credits and technical support.
Individual labs and field offices can use these software assurance benefits as
they wish, rather than having to pool their benefits with other DOE entities. 

"Department of Energy agencies will be able to leverage their collective
purchasing power across more than 130,000 desktops and numerous networks
nationwide," said Jet Defensor, TKCIS vice president. "Additionally, the
agreement allows the department to utilize the advantages that come with a NASA
SEWP (Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement) contract, including the ability
to add products, streamlined procurement and low administrative fees." 

Under the agreement, CDW-G and TKCIS will provide the full complement of
Microsoft software, including:

* Microsoft Exchange Server 
* Microsoft SQL Server 
* Microsoft Windows Server 
* Microsoft Enterprise Desktop 
* Microsoft E-CAL 
* Windows OS

The DOE enterprise agreement also standardizes enrollment dates across all DOE
entities. Previously, DOE entities had non-standard enrollment dates, which made
it difficult for IT administrators to keep track of their license renewal dates
and complicated budgeting. Standardized enrollment dates simplify license
renewals and budgeting, allowing administrators to focus on mission-critical
tasks. 

"With this agreement, Energy entities will conserve budget dollars and reduce
the time and resources required to maintain software applications," said Andy
Lausch, CDW-G vice president of federal sales. "At the same time, the DOE works
toward fulfilling its small business goals by leveraging the superior service
capabilities of TKCIS."

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is researching how gadgets like the company's Xbox game machine, surface computers and accelerometers in mobile phones could be used to improve health care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the applications from Microsoft Research, the software giant's lab branch, plug into existing Microsoft products like HealthVault, a Web service for patients to track their own health records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those projects, an application called MyLife for Windows Mobile phones, could help a user log health metrics like blood pressure and weight, and monitor daily activities including exercise, walking and eating. Ongoing work on the application could allow it to help personal logs using built-in devices on a phone like its camera, its accelerometer and its microphone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "dream" is that a user could photograph each meal with their phone to have the application return data such as caloric content, food group and allergy information for each item on a plate, said Eric Chang, director of technology strategy at Microsoft Research Asia, in an interview. To make that easier, a phone could also get the information by scanning a tag attached to a meal, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accelerometers, which are increasingly built into phones to sense how they tilt, can detect how people sway while they walk, which lets MyLife count the steps a user takes each day, Chang said. The app does not yet use the microphones found in all mobile phones but could do so to gain additional information about a user's activities and surroundings, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One challenge for such an app is keeping the demands on a user low. Taking a picture of each meal could be cumbersome, but where possible the app could minimize active user input by using information that the phone already has, such as a user's day calendar or data from linked-up wireless sensors, Chang said. Data from the app can be uploaded to Microsoft's HealthVault for the user to store and track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MyLife plays into a larger goal of putting more personal medical data into the hands of patients, a flip from how most of that data today is stored in hospitals, Chang said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that's really going to allow us to have personalized medicine," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is one of many companies working on mobile health tools, said Christine Chang, an analyst at Ovum. The data will be extremely useful for physicians and researchers, but obstacles include cost, since smartphones and their data plans cost more, and making sure the data is correct, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HealthVault could have a positive effect on health care too, but it faces a rival in Google Health and the two companies may have to work together to make the market work, Ovum's Chang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Microsoft researchers are looking at how the company's Xbox 360 could be used in hospital rooms. Xbox units, which are cheaper than other hospital equipment but still have powerful hardware, are currently favored in a project on how to feed information from electronic medical records onto in-room display screens for patients, said Desney Tan, a senior researcher at Microsoft Research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are also looking at how to automate the data transfer from complex records and choose or filter displayed information according to conditions such as whether the doctor or family members are in the room, which could be detected by sensors, Tan said. Xbox units could be used for those purposes, to present other health information and to let patients play games or access certain Internet services, including through body gestures enabled by Microsoft's upcoming Project Natal control system, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tan was speaking during a Microsoft forum on health-care technology in Beijing, where other Microsoft research projects discussed included the use of computers built into tabletops to instruct patients on how to care for themselves away from the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The computers could be used to pull content like X-ray images from personal records, or other pictures from the Internet, and to save them for the patient to view later, said Michael Gillam, head of the Microsoft Medical Media Lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MONTEREY, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
CerMed Corporation, www.cermedcorp.com, an international women`s healthcare
medical device company that is commercializing three breakthrough products for
cervical cancer screening and a women`s controlled barrier contraceptive that
protects against infection from HIV, will be presenting at the Sachs Associates
Third Annual European Global Lifescience Forum on February 11, 2010 at 14:15
Zurich time. 

Linda Masterson, President and Chief Operating Officer of CerMed, will be
leading the presentation and will discuss CerMed`s products which address two
major market segments, cervical cancer screening and contraceptive/sexually
transmitted disease (STD) prevention. 

Ms. Masterson said, "We are excited about the upcoming presentation which will
provide us the platform to meet with key players in the health sciences field
and introduce CerMed as an emerging company in the women`s healthcare arena.
This conference also marks the first time CerMed will be presenting before an
industry forum, and will provide us the opportunity to review CerMed`s product
line and our commercialization plans." 

"We believe CerMed is the first company to bring a fundamentally different
approach to the improvement of women`s cervical health. Our first product,
CerMap Cervical Specimen Collection and Mapping System, will be marketed
initially in China, where we already have SFDA clearance. We expect to market
worldwide later this summer." 

"CerMap can be used as a front end for collection for the standard PAP analysis
and will be used in conjunction with our Point of Care Cervical Cancer Screening
Test System, as a replacement for the traditional Pap smear. This system is
currently under development with Duke University and Innovative Micro
Technology," she continued. "The test system is designed as a primary screening
system to replace the standard PAP. It is being designed to provide greater
sensitivity and specificity than is currently available from the current
standard of care. We believe this novel, low cost product can help save the
lives of the half-million women who die from cervical cancer each year,
generally because of errors in the current methods or lack of access to
expensive laboratories and methods." 

She continued, "CerMed`s second product under development is CerCap HIV, a
barrier contraceptive cervical cap which reduces the risk of infection from HIV.
CerCap is being developed through strategic partnerships with the University of
California San Francisco, one of the leading hospitals in the field." 

Ms. Masterson concluded, "With life-saving products ready to launch and others
under development, we look forward to becoming an important player in women`s
healthcare."

ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company reports solid fourth quarter 2009 operating results, with
unit case volume increasing 5 percent, successfully cycling 4 percent growth in
the prior year quarter. For the full year, unit case volume increased 3 percent,
in line with our long-term volume target. Internationally, we achieved
broad-based unit case volume growth of 6 percent in the fourth quarter, cycling
6 percent growth in the prior year quarter. In the quarter, unit case volume
increased strongly in key emerging markets (China +29 percent, India +20
percent), developing markets (Brazil +8 percent, Mexico +4 percent) and
developed markets (France +12 percent, Germany +3 percent). Further, in the 118
countries with per capita consumption of Company products less than 150
eight-ounce servings per year, we achieved 12 percent unit case volume growth in
the quarter. 

We gained volume and value share globally in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD)
beverages for the tenth consecutive quarter with share gains across most key
categories. For the year, we gained volume and value share in total NARTD
beverages as well as in both the sparkling and still beverage categories. The
combined power of the global "Open Happiness" campaign and the strength of
holiday programs drove growth in brand Coca-Cola. Brand Coca-Cola unit case
volume grew a solid 4 percent in the quarter, with strong growth across global
markets, including 22 percent in India, 13 percent in China, 12 percent in
France, 5 percent in Mexico and 4 percent in Germany. Total sparkling beverage
unit case volume increased 3 percent in the quarter, with international
sparkling beverage unit case volume increasing 5 percent, cycling 4 percent
growth in the prior year quarter. Total still beverage unit case volume
increased 9 percent in the quarter, led by growth across the portfolio,
including juices and fruit stills, teas and water brands. Still beverage unit
case volume increased 14 percent internationally and was even in North America. 

"We ended this year on a high note, delivering global volume and value share
gains, comparable currency neutral revenue growth, improved productivity and
increased cash flows," said Muhtar Kent, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
The Coca-Cola Company. 

"In a year marked by unprecedented economic uncertainty, our foundation &#9472;
leading brands, unmatched global footprint, great bottling partners and a solid
financial position &#9472; proved that we have the right ingredients for growth even
under challenging economic conditions. Early last year we committed to align our
Company and our system to emerge from this global crisis stronger. Our
performance results for the year underscore that we are doing just that. Now,
with our 2020 Vision as our roadmap, we look forward to entering our next decade
of growth as we work closely together with our bottling partners to usher in a
new era of winning for the Coca-Cola system." 

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

* Fourth quarter 2009 reported net revenues increased 5 percent and were
impacted by six fewer selling days, which offset the impact of five additional
selling days in first quarter 2009 results. Excluding the impact of six fewer
selling days, we estimate that fourth quarter currency neutral net revenues
would have been in line with our long-term target. Reported net revenues for the
full year decreased 3 percent. Excluding structural changes, full year net
revenues increased 4 percent on a comparable currency neutral basis. 
* Fourth quarter 2009 reported operating income increased 4 percent, and
comparable currency neutral operating income was even. Excluding the impact of
six fewer selling days, we estimate that fourth quarter comparable currency
neutral operating income would have been ahead of our long-term target. Reported
operating income for the full year decreased 3 percent. Comparable currency
neutral full year operating income increased 7 percent, in line with our
long-term growth target. This was driven by a continued strong focus on cost
management and the leveraging of productivity initiatives. 
* Cash from operations for the full year increased 8 percent to $8.2 billion,
and we repurchased $1.5 billion of our stock for the full year.

Eurasia &amp; Africa

* Our Eurasia and Africa Group`s unit case volume increased 5 percent in the
quarter, cycling 7 percent growth in the prior year quarter. Full year unit case
volume increased 4 percent, cycling 7 percent growth in the prior year. Net
revenues for the quarter increased 7 percent, reflecting a 6 percent increase in
concentrate sales and a positive currency impact, partially offset by the impact
of six fewer selling days in the quarter as well as negative price/mix. Reported
operating income increased 11 percent in the quarter. Comparable currency
neutral operating income increased 7 percent in the quarter due to the increase
in concentrate sales and focused expense management. For the full year, reported
operating income decreased 3 percent, while comparable currency neutral
operating income increased 12 percent as the group continued to focus on driving
favorable operating leverage. 
* In Eurasia and Africa, sparkling beverages increased 4 percent and still
beverages increased 9 percent in the quarter, with brand Coca-Cola growing 2
percent. The growth in unit case volume was led by a 20 percent increase in
India, cycling a 28 percent increase in the prior year quarter. Africa also
reported strong unit case volume growth in the quarter with the East and Central
Region growing 12 percent, cycling 5 percent growth in the prior year quarter,
and the North and West Region also growing 12 percent, cycling 6 percent growth
in the prior year quarter. Russia gained share in total NARTD beverages and in
sparkling beverages for the year while reporting a unit case volume decline of
13 percent in the quarter and a decline of 14 percent for the year. The results
in Russia continue to reflect the impact of a challenging economic environment. 
* In the quarter, Eurasia and Africa gained share in NARTD beverages. India
gained volume and value share across most categories, including sparkling, still
and juice and juice drinks.

Europe

* Our Europe Group`s unit case volume increased 1 percent in the quarter,
cycling 2 percent growth in the prior year quarter, demonstrating sequential
improvement relative to the first nine months of the year in very challenging
economic conditions. Unit case volume for the year decreased 1 percent, cycling
3 percent growth in the prior year. Net revenues for the quarter increased 1
percent, primarily driven by a 6 percent positive currency impact partially
offset by a 5 percent decline in concentrate sales as a result of six fewer
selling days in the quarter. Reported operating income decreased 1 percent in
the quarter, with comparable currency neutral operating income also decreasing 1
percent on lower concentrate sales, partially offset by tight expense
management. For the full year, reported operating income is down 7 percent while
comparable currency neutral operating income increased 4 percent as the group
continues to drive efficiencies and effectiveness in overall SG spend. 
* Unit case volume growth in the quarter was driven by France, Great Britain,
Germany and Italy, with strong growth in brand Coca-Cola. This growth was
partially offset by results in Eastern Europe which continue to be impacted by
challenging economic conditions. 
* In the quarter, Europe gained value share in total NARTD beverages as did
Spain, France, Germany, Great Britain and Italy. For the full year, we achieved
both volume and value share gains in Europe and across most key countries.

Latin America

* Our Latin America Group continued to deliver strong unit case volume growth
with 7 percent growth in the quarter, cycling 6 percent growth in the prior year
quarter. Unit case volume for the year increased 6 percent, cycling 8 percent
growth in the prior year. Net revenues for the quarter increased 19 percent,
primarily due to a high single-digit benefit from price/mix, combined with 4
percent concentrate sales growth and a positive currency impact, partially
offset by the impact of six fewer selling days in the quarter. Reported
operating income was up 11 percent in the quarter, with comparable currency
neutral operating income up 16 percent, primarily reflecting the solid revenue
growth and consistent investment behind both our sparkling and still brands. For
the full year, reported operating income was down 3 percent, but was up 15
percent on a comparable currency neutral basis due to continued favorable volume
and pricing. 
* Strong unit case volume growth in the quarter was led by an 8 percent increase
in Brazil, a 4 percent increase in Mexico and an 18 percent increase in our
Latin Center Region. 
* Latin America delivered growth across the portfolio with sparkling beverages
increasing 5 percent and still beverages increasing 20 percent in the quarter.
Sparkling beverage growth was led by brand Coca-Cola with 7 percent growth in
the quarter. 
* In the quarter and for the full year, the Latin America Group gained volume
and value share in total NARTD beverages and across most key countries. In
addition, the group posted volume and value share gains in both the sparkling
and still categories.

North America

* Our North America Group`s unit case volume declined 1 percent in the quarter
primarily due to continued macroeconomic pressures impacting consumer spending
and foodservice traffic. Full year unit case volume decreased 2 percent. Net
revenues for the quarter decreased 4 percent, reflecting a 6 percent decrease in
concentrate sales as a result of six fewer selling days in the quarter,
partially offset by a 1 percent positive currency impact and a 1 percent
positive impact from price/mix. Reported operating income decreased 7 percent in
the quarter, reflecting the impact of lower concentrate sales, and increased 7
percent for the year. Comparable currency neutral operating income decreased 10
percent in the quarter, but increased 7 percent for the year driven by business
mix and productivity savings. 
* Unit case volume for sparkling beverages declined 2 percent in the quarter, as
consumer spending continues to be impacted by unemployment and economic
uncertainty. Brand Coca-Cola has continued to increase its favorite brand score
advantage versus the competition among the important teen and mom consumer
segments. Coca-Cola Zero delivered double-digit unit case volume growth in the
quarter, achieving 15 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. 
* Still beverage unit case volume was even in the quarter. Still beverage volume
in our Foodservice and Hospitality business continued to grow, driven by
innovation and new segmented customer offerings in our tea portfolio. 
* In the quarter, North America gained value share in NARTD beverages for the
fifth consecutive quarter, with both volume and value share gains for the full
year. Still beverages also gained value share for the fifth consecutive quarter,
led by strong performance in our Foodservice and Hospitality business, Trademark
Simply and Fuze. Trademark Simply and Minute Maid continued to perform strongly
with new flavor innovations and expanded availability, contributing to volume
and value share gains in the juice and juice drinks category for both the
quarter and the full year. In 2009, Simply became our Company`s 14th billion
dollar brand.

Pacific

* Our Pacific Group delivered unit case volume growth of 11 percent in the
quarter, cycling 9 percent growth in the prior year quarter. Full year unit case
volume increased 7 percent, cycling 8 percent growth in the prior year. Net
revenues for the quarter increased 5 percent, reflecting an 8 percent increase
in concentrate sales and a 7 percent positive impact from currencies, partially
offset by the impact of six fewer selling days in the quarter as well as
negative country and channel mix. Reported operating income increased 5 percent
in the quarter. Comparable currency neutral operating income increased 3 percent
in the quarter, reflecting higher concentrate sales partially offset by negative
country and channel mix, primarily in Japan. For the full year, reported
operating income increased 2 percent, but declined 2 percent on a comparable
currency neutral basis as a result of the same country and channel mix drivers. 
* Pacific delivered unit case volume growth across the portfolio with sparkling
beverages increasing 9 percent and still beverages increasing 15 percent in the
quarter. Importantly, brand Coca-Cola grew 11 percent in the quarter. Unit case
volume growth was led by China, Thailand, Australia, the Philippines, Korea and
Vietnam. In the quarter, Pacific gained volume and value share in total NARTD
beverages. 
* In China, unit case volume grew 29 percent in the quarter driven by strong
double-digit growth in Minute Maid Pulpy and the successful launch of Minute
Maid Pulpy Super Milky, the Company`s first entry into the value-added dairy
segment. Trademark Sprite was also up double digits, and brand Coca-Cola was up
13 percent. China achieved volume and value share gains in total NARTD beverages
as well as the sparkling and still categories in both the quarter and full year.

* In Japan, unit case volume declined 4 percent in the quarter reflecting the
continued weak economy and unfavorable weather. However, our business in Japan
continued to outperform the NARTD industry, resulting in the seventh consecutive
quarter of share gains. Importantly, Coca-Cola Zero maintained its strong
momentum with unit case volume growth of 23 percent in the quarter, and I LOHAS
mineral water in new lightweight eco-friendly crushable PET bottles has gained
volume and value share in this competitive category.

Bottling Investments

* Our Bottling Investments Group`s unit case volume increased 13 percent in the
quarter, primarily driven by strong growth in China, India and the Philippines.
Net revenues for the quarter increased 12 percent, primarily reflecting the
increase in unit case volume and a high single-digit currency benefit, partially
offset by negative country mix. Reported operating income increased 72 percent
in the quarter while comparable currency neutral operating income increased 17
percent, primarily driven by the increase in volume and disciplined expense
management. For the full year, reported operating income was down 32 percent,
but was up 23 percent on a comparable currency neutral basis as volume and
favorable cost of goods continued to fuel growth.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

Net revenues for the quarter increased 5 percent, driven by a 5 percent positive
currency impact and a 1 percent increase in concentrate sales, offset by a 1
percent negative impact from price/mix. While net revenue was favorably impacted
during the quarter by positive concentrate pricing, geographic country mix
offset this benefit as economic recovery in emerging markets outpaces the rest
of the world. Additionally, fourth quarter net revenues were impacted by six
fewer selling days versus the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of six
fewer selling days, we estimate that fourth quarter currency neutral net
revenues would have been in line with our long-term target. For the full year,
comparable currency neutral net revenues excluding structural changes increased
4 percent. 

Cost of goods sold increased 3 percent in the quarter. This increase is
primarily driven by the 1 percent increase in concentrate sales and a 6 percent
impact from currencies, offset by a favorable impact from lower input costs. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 9 percent in the quarter,
and increased 2 percent on a currency neutral basis. The increase was partly
attributable to a net increase in pension and incentive costs offset by our
continued effective management of general and administrative expenses. 

Reported and comparable operating income both increased 4 percent in the
quarter. Items impacting comparability reduced operating income by $101 million
in 2009 and by $108 million in 2008. These items were primarily related to
restructuring charges and costs related to global productivity initiatives.
Comparable currency neutral operating income was even in the quarter. Currency
positively impacted comparable operating income by 4 percent in the quarter.
Excluding the impact of six fewer selling days, we estimate that comparable
currency neutral operating income for the quarter would have been ahead of our
long-term target. After considering current spot rates, the anticipated benefits
of our hedging coverage and the cycling of prior year exchange rates, we expect
currencies to have a slightly positive impact on full year 2010 operating income
with the benefit more heavily weighted to the first half of 2010. 

For the fourth quarter of 2009, our reported earnings per share were $0.66, an
increase of 53 percent. Reported earnings per share for the fourth quarter of
2009 and 2008 included a net charge of $0.00 and $0.21 per share, respectively.
The net charge in both years included restructuring charges and costs related to
global productivity initiatives. The 2008 net charge also included a non-cash
impairment charge related to Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE), an equity
investee. After considering the items impacting comparability, earnings per
share for the quarter were $0.66, an increase of 3 percent. Earnings per share
for the quarter were positively impacted by the relative weakness of the U.S.
dollar versus other currencies around the world as compared to the prior year. 

Cash from operations was $8.2 billion for the year compared with $7.6 billion in
the prior year, an increase of 8 percent. This increase was primarily driven by
better management of working capital versus the prior year as well as higher
dividends from equity investees. For the full year, we repurchased $1.5 billion
of our stock. 

Effective Tax Rate

The reported effective tax rate for the quarter and full year was 19.5 percent
and 22.8 percent, respectively. The underlying effective tax rate on operations
for both the quarter and full year was 23.0 percent. The variance between the
reported rate and the underlying rate was due to the tax impact of various
separately disclosed items impacting comparability. 

The Company anticipates that its underlying effective tax rate on operations for
the full year 2010 will be in the range of 23.0 percent to 23.5 percent. Our
estimated underlying effective tax rate does not reflect the impact of
significant or unusual items and discrete events, which, if and when they occur,
are separately recognized in the appropriate period. 

Items Impacting Prior Year Results

Fourth quarter 2008 results included a net charge of $0.21 per share primarily
related to a non-cash impairment charge at CCE, restructuring charges and asset
write-downs. 

Third quarter 2008 results included a net charge of $0.02 per share primarily
due to restructuring charges and costs related to global productivity
initiatives partially offset by a gain on the sale of a portion of our
investment in the Pakistan bottler. 

Second quarter 2008 results included a net charge of $0.40 per share primarily
related to charges recorded by our equity method investees, restructuring
charges and asset write-downs. 

First quarter 2008 results included a net charge of $0.03 per share primarily
related to restructuring charges and asset write-downs.

 (1)    Intersegment revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2009, were approximately $34 million for Eurasia and Africa, $210 million for Europe, $69 million for Latin America, $24 million for North America, $74 million for Pacific and $29 million for Bottling Investments.                                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 (2)    Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2009, were reduced by approximately $1 million for Eurasia and Africa, $4 million for Europe, $16 million for North America, $32 million for Bottling Investments and $48 million for Corporate, primarily due to restructuring costs and the Company`s ongoing productivity initiatives.                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 (3)    Income (loss) before income taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2009, was reduced by approximately $18 million for Bottling Investments, primarily attributable to the Company`s proportionate share of restructuring charges recorded by certain of our equity method investees.                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 (4)    Income (loss) before income taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2009, was increased by approximately $34 million for Corporate, primarily due to realized gains on the sale of equity securities that were classified as available-for-sale. In 2008, the Company recognized an other-than-temporary impairment related to these securities. The gains on the sale of these securities represent the appreciation in market value since the impairment was recognized.

 (6)    Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2008, were reduced by approximately $1 million for Eurasia and Africa, $44 million for North America, $21 million for Bottling Investments and $42 million for Corporate, primarily due to restructuring costs, productivity initiatives, asset impairments and contract termination fees.                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 (7)    Income (loss) before income taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2008, was reduced by approximately $19 million for Europe, $8 million for North America and $529 million for Bottling Investments, primarily attributable to the Company`s proportionate share of asset impairment charges recorded by certain of our equity method investees.

 (1)     Intersegment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009, were approximately $220 million for Eurasia and Africa, $895 million for Europe, $182 million for Latin America, $80 million for North America, $342 million for Pacific and $127 million for Bottling Investments.                                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 (2)     Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2009, were reduced by approximately $4 million for Eurasia and Africa, $7 million for Europe, $31 million for North America, $1 million for Pacific, $141 million for Bottling Investments and $129 million for Corporate, primarily as a result of restructuring costs, the Company`s ongoing productivity initiatives and asset impairments.                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 (3)     Income (loss) before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2009, was reduced by approximately $84 million for Bottling Investments and $2 million for Corporate, primarily attributable to the Company`s proportionate share of asset impairment and restructuring charges recorded by certain of our equity method investees.                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 (4)     Income (loss) before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2009, was reduced by approximately $27 million for Corporate due to an other-than-temporary impairment of a cost method investment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 (5)     Income (loss) before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2009, was increased by approximately $44 million for Corporate due to realized gains on the sale of equity securities that were classified as available-for-sale.

 (7)     Operating income (loss) and income (loss) before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2008, were reduced by approximately $1 million for Eurasia and Africa, $1 million for Latin America, $56 million for North America, $46 million for Bottling Investments and $246 million for Corporate, primarily attributable to restructuring costs, contract termination fees, productivity initiatives and asset impairments.                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 (8)     Income (loss) before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2008, was reduced by approximately $19 million for Europe, $8 million for North America and $1,659 million for Bottling Investments, primarily as a result of our proportionate share of asset impairment charges recorded by certain of our equity method investees.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 (9)     Income (loss) before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2008, was increased by approximately $119 million for Bottling Investments and Corporate, primarily due to the gain on the sale of Refrigerantes Minas Gerais Ltda.

 (10)    Income (loss) before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2008, was reduced by approximately $2 million for North America, $30 million for Bottling Investments and $52 million for Corporate, primarily due to other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities.

 The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures can provide additional meaningful reflection of underlying trends of the business because 
 they provide a comparison of historical information that excludes certain items that impact the overall comparability.  Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance.  See the tables above for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the three months ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in 
 addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company`s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

 The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures can provide additional meaningful reflection of underlying trends of the business because                                               
 they provide a comparison of historical information that excludes certain items that impact the overall comparability.  Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance.

 The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures can provide additional meaningful reflection of underlying trends of the business because 
 they provide a comparison of historical information that excludes certain items that impact the overall comparability. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance.  See the tables above for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the three months ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition

 The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures can provide additional meaningful reflection of underlying trends of the business because 
 they provide a comparison of historical information that excludes certain items that impact the overall comparability. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance.  See the tables above for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, 
 and not as an alternative for, the Company`s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

&lt;p&gt;ACCRA Feb 9 (Reuters) - Ghana has not blocked a planned $4
billion oilfield stake sale by Kosmos Energy to Exxon Mobil
(XOM.N) but still threatens to do so if the parties do not
abandon the deal, a government source said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that the
government had blocked the deal, something it has been
threatening to do since October, and would only allow the state
oil company to buy the stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source said the government had written to Exxon about
the deal but had not gone beyond repeating the threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're telling them that we prefer that they don't continue
 ... and if they do, we'll not approve of it," the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kosmos sources have said the government can only block the
deal if it can show the potential buyer lacks sufficient
technical skills or financial strength -- a hurdle the world's
largest non-government controlled oil company is unlikely to
fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said if the government were to block the deal, it
could face legal action from Kosmos and that the threats to
block the deal could be aimed at scuppering it without opening
itself to such a liability.

&lt;p&gt;The 27th Annual JPMorgan Chase Corporate Challenge Championship Makes Its 1st
Appearance Outside of New York on March 4
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The JPMorgan Chase Corporate Challenge Championship, which has brought the
fastest companies in the world to Manhattan for nearly three decades, is moving
overseas on March 4. 

The 27th annual Championship will be held on Thursday, March 4, 2010 in
Johannesburg, South Africa. The 3.5-mile road race will feature the first-place
men`s, women`s and mixed teams from all 12 cities in the 2009 JPMorgan Chase
Corporate Challenge Series. 

A total of 144 runners -- representing companies from six countries on five
continents - will compete at the historic Wanderers Club. The race will
immediately precede the regularly-scheduled J.P. Morgan Corporate Challenge in
Johannesburg. 

The Championship features competition in men`s (four men), women`s (four women)
and mixed (two men/two women) team divisions. The first-place team in each
category can accurately refer to itself as "the healthiest company in the
world." 

The trip to South Africa will mark the first time that the JPMorgan Chase
Corporate Challenge Championship will be held outside of metropolitan New York.
The event debuted at the New Jersey Meadowlands in 1983, moved to Wall Street in
1984, and had been held on Park Avenue each fall from 1985-2008. 

Since 2001, the Corporate Challenge Series has expanded internationally with
events added in Sydney, Australia; Johannesburg, South Africa; and Singapore. To
reflect this global diversity, the championship will rotate annually to other
Corporate Challenge cities. 

"We are continually working to bring exciting innovations to the Championship,"
noted Barbara Paddock, Senior Vice President for JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., the owner
and operator of the JPMorgan Chase Corporate Challenge Series. "This move to
South Africa was enthusiastically received by the participating companies, with
all 36 qualifying teams accepting our invitation to compete. 

"This also signals," Paddock continued, "that the Corporate Challenge Series is
stronger than ever." 

The Championship participants qualified at seven U.S. cities that host Corporate
Challenge events - Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, New York, Rochester, San Francisco,
and Syracuse, and overseas locations Frankfurt, Johannesburg, London, Singapore
and Sydney. 

"The Championship-qualifying companies will love experiencing the Corporate
Challenge in Johannesburg," Paddock said. "The setting truly captures the global
essence of our Series. And South Africa will take a great deal of pride in
hosting the first Championship out of the United States." 

The 2009 JPMorgan Chase Corporate Challenge Series featured more than 220,000
participants from over 7,700 companies around the world. Of this throng, the
most elite 144 runners from 36 teams earned the trip to Johannesburg. 

The complete list of qualifying companies (listed in order of men`s, women`s and
mixed teams): 

Sydney, Australia - Macquarie (men`s and women`s teams); KPMG 

Johannesburg, South Africa - Transnet Rail Engineering (men`s and women`s);

&lt;p&gt;Chevron-Led Consortium to Acquire 40 Percent Interest in Orinoco Belt Heavy Oil
Project
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today announced that a consortium led by its
Venezuelan subsidiary has been selected to negotiate its participation in a
project composed of three blocks in the Orinoco Oil Belt (Faja) of eastern
Venezuela. 

"We look forward to being part of this new opportunity that will expand
development of one of the world`s largest known hydrocarbon resources," said
Chevron Vice Chairman George Kirkland. 

Situated in the eastern area of the Faja, approximately 40 miles (65 kilometers)
to the northeast of the city of Puerto Ordaz, the three blocks have a combined
area of 215 square miles (557 square kilometers). 

"We are pleased with today`s announcement and the prospect of negotiating an
opportunity to expand our partnership with Petr&#243;leos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA)
and the Venezuelan communities," said Ali Moshiri, president of Chevron Africa
and Latin America Exploration and Production Co. "Chevron`s growing presence in
Latin America`s resource-rich basins highlights the company`s ability to fully
integrate our experience and technology into the successful development of
large, complex projects." 

It is expected the consortium of Chevron, INPEX Corporation, Mitsubishi
Corporation and Suelopetrol will hold a combined 40 percent interest in the
empresa mixta (joint company). PDVSA will hold the remaining 60 percent
interest. 

In Venezuela, Chevron currently holds a joint venture interest in PetroPiar, an
integrated extra-heavy oil project in the Faja; joint venture interests in
PetroBoscan and PetroIndependiente; joint venture participation in Plataforma
Deltana Blocks 2 and 3 to produce natural gas; and an interest in Venezuela`s
first liquefied natural gas project, which is currently under evaluation.
Chevron also operates the offshore Cardon III block north of Lake Maracaibo in
the Gulf of Venezuela. 

Chevron is a leading heavy oil producer and has broad capabilities within its
portfolio of specialized technologies. It is a world leader in thermal enhanced
oil recovery and has a global network of research and development in heavy oil
refining, conversion and upgrading. It currently produces heavy oil in Brazil,
California, Indonesia, the U.K. North Sea, and the Partitioned Zone between
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and operates a Heavy Oil Center of Expertise in
California. 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company`s success is
driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and other energy products; manufactures and sells
petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides
energy efficiency solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future,
including biofuels and other renewables. Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif.

&lt;p&gt;IBM has found what it claims to be a less costly way to build solar cells. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company's researchers have cooked up prototype photovoltaic cells from commonly found materials, yet the cells can rival the power-conversion efficiency of commercially available solar cells built from rarer, and more expensive, materials, they claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientific journal "Advanced Materials" published a write-up of the work in this week's issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prototype solar cells demonstrated a power-conversion efficiency of 9.6 percent, a 40 percent gain in efficiency from solar cells built by others using the same or similar widely available materials, said David Mitzi, who leads the research team at IBM Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, power-conversion efficiency is defined as the percentage of solar radiation energy that gets converted into an electrical charge via the photovoltaic effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the sun radiates 2.6 gigawatts of energy per square mile to Earth, research firm WinterGreen Research has estimated. Yet, according to IBM, solar cells contribute less than .01 percent of the world's power supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the challenge is producing sun-energy-collecting cells inexpensively enough to compete with other means of energy production, Mitzi said. There are two ways to do this: lower the costs of the cells or improve their power-conversion efficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, commercial solar cells have been capable of achieving a power-conversion efficiency of about 9 percent to 11 percent, though they are based on rare, expensive-to-procure elements such as tellurium and indium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's work follows up on research to use only commonly found materials to built photovoltaic cells, namely a combination of copper, tin, zinc, and sulfur or selenium. To date, cells built from such materials have achieved only a 6.7 percent efficiency rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers went with the thin-film method of making the cells. Typically, the approach involves creating a solution by dissolving all the elements in hydrazine. The solution is then applied to a substrate and heated, allowing a film to form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge with this approach is that zinc is not soluble by hydrazine. So the researchers just put zinc particles in with the solution anyway. This turned out to be a better approach, in fact, because the zinc particles acted as a stress reliever for the film during the deposition process, allowing a thicker film to be made in one deposition cycle without cracking or peeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another cost-saving bonus to this work is that it uses a fabrication process that can more easily be duplicated in production settings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most current production techniques use a vacuum-based approach, whereas these researchers used a deposition-based fabrication process, not unlike the process used to create microprocessors. "You can create on a simple substrate many cells in series, so this is a very valuable approach for making lower-cost and larger-area arrays," Mitzi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research is just basic at this point and further refinements will be needed to bring the technique to production level, Mitzi said. The researchers hope to refine the process to achieve higher efficiency levels, perhaps even as high as 12 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM itself has no plans to enter the solar-cell manufacturing business. It plans to patent the innovations and license the rights to other firms, Mitzi said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular thought, enterprises are not wedded to Microsoft's old and buggy Internet Explorer 6 (IE6), but have largely dumped the browser, a researcher said today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IE6 is running on only 8.3% of the PCs powered by Windows XP that Devil Mountain Software's community-based Exo.performance.network (XPnet) tracks, said Craig Barth, the company's chief technology officer. In comparison, 19.4% of the XP machines are running IE7, while an amazing 72.2% run IE8, Microsoft 's newest browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm shocked," said Barth today. "IE6 is just a single-digit browser on XP in the enterprise ."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devil Mountain sniffs out system information, including installed applications, from the 23,000 PCs that run the XPnet agent, a small program that regularly "phones home" with the machine owner's permission. Devil Mountain recently reconfigured the XPnet agent so that it could determine the version of IE installed on the PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On those computers running Windows Vista, 12.8% have IE7, the browser that shipped with the operating system in 2007, but 86.5% have IE8, which Microsoft launched in March 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IE8 has been a much larger hit than most of us thought," admitted Barth, referring to the long-held idea that while consumers may have obliged Microsoft by upgrading to IE8, relatively few enterprises have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IT shops are clearly getting a bad rap for being behind the curve," Barth said. "These are smart people. They know that IE6 is kryptonite. And they're mostly off of IE6 now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perception that IE6 usage remains strong, especially in the enterprise, has come from metrics vendors such as NetApplications.com, as well as Microsoft itself, Barth argued. "Measurements of the Web as a whole are just not painting an accurate picture of what is in the enterprise," said Barth. "They can't."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to NetApplications' most recent data, IE6 accounts for 20.1% of all browsers in use, while IE7 and IE8 hold down 14.6% and 25.1% shares, respectively. Much of the measured IE6 usage, however, apparently originates in China, where the nearly-nine-year-old program represents 50% of browsers in use. In the U.S., NetApplications has said, IE6 share is less than 10%, a number that is similar to XPnet's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has added to the idea that IE6 is still widely in use by citing that as a reason why it cannot force corporate users to upgrade to a newer, and presumably more secure, version of its browser. "While we recommend Internet Explorer 8 to all customers, we understand we have a number of corporate customers for whom broad deployment of new technologies across their desktops requires more planning," a Microsoft spokeswoman said last week when commenting on Google's decision to drop IE6 support for Gmail later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all, Microsoft's been much more effective convincing business users to upgrade to IE8 than anyone thought, Barth said. Its move last August to push the new browser to enterprises via Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) probably helped considerably, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IT is on the ball, they're not blowing it by sticking with IE6," Barth concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IE6 has been a popular subject in security news since Google confirmed that attackers had used a then-unpatched vulnerability in the aged browser to break into its company network. In little more than a week, Microsoft rushed out an emergency update to patch the IE flaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users who want to contribute to Xpnet's data collective can do so by downloading and installing the DMS Clarity Tracker Agent from Devil Mountain's site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;Many factors go into planning a trip to Disneyland, whether you're a season pass holder or first-time visitor. As a kid growing up in Los Angeles, the biggest one for me was always wait times. Over the years, my family learned the tricks to the schedule--coming on weekdays, visiting during January and October maintenance--but there was still some chance of hitting a rough day at the parks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iPhone developer Juicy Development seeks to take this variable out of the Disney equation with its FastTrac app, which the developer is showcasing at this week's Macworld Expo. Just input what attractions at the theme park you wish to ride for your given day and arrival time, and the app will create a customized schedule for you based on multiple factors (how busy the day has been in the past, the popularity of the ride, and a database of tips and tricks from Disneyland veterans, among other things).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also generate individual schedules for everyone in your party--a must if you're traveling with kids of different ages. The UI is beautifully simple, with map illustrations painted in the style of Disney artist Mary Blair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the developer, FastTrac was tested heavily during peak capacity hours over Spring Break and the Christmas holiday to ensure the app's effectiveness. The app currently only supports rides in Disneyland--presumably, additions will arrive at some point for California Adventure and Disney World.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app--priced at $5--will work on both the iPhone and iPod touch, and requires iPhone OS 3.0 or later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Coca Cola Reports In Line

Coca Cola Company (NYSE: KO) reported fourth quarter 2009 results with earnings
of 66 cents per share, which was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.
Earnings were up 3.0% year-over-year. 

Net revenues increased 5.4% year-over-year during the quarter, due to a 5%
positive impact from currency translation and 1% increase in concentrate sales
which were partially offset by a 1% impact from pricing and mix. 

Worldwide unit case volume increased 5% in the quarter, aided by a 6%
improvement in international unit case volume and a 4% growth in Coca Cola, its
trademark brand. The emerging markets of China and India grew an impressive 29%
and 20%, respectively. 

France also reported a strong growth of 12% during the fourth quarter. In
addition, strong unit case volume growth was observed in other key markets
including Brazil, Mexico and Germany. Europe posted a 1% volume growth, while
North American volume declined 1%. 

Boeing Progressing on 747-8

Boeing Company (NYSE: BA) successfully completed the first test flight of its
long-in-the-making 747-8 Freighter. The 747-8 Freighter is the new,
high-capacity 747 that brings the benefits of low operating costs and best
economics in any freighter to cargo operators. The 747-8 is powered by four
General Electric Company`s (NYSE: GE) GEnx-2B engines. The airplane is 250 feet,
2 inches (76.3 m) long, which is 18 feet, 4 inches (5.6 m) longer than the
747-400 Freighter. The stretch provides customers with 16% more revenue cargo
volume compared to its predecessor. That translates to an additional four
main-deck pallets and three lower-hold pallets. 

Boeing launched the airplane on Nov 14, 2005, with firm orders for 18 747-8
Freighters: 10 from Cargolux of Luxembourg and eight from Nippon Cargo Airlines
of Japan. Till date, Boeing has secured 108 orders for the 747-8. The customers
are a varied mix of airlines like AirBridgeCargo Airlines, Atlas Air, Cathay
Pacific, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise, Emirates SkyCargo, Guggenheim and Korean
Air. 

Headquartered in Chicago, Boeing is the world`s largest manufacturer of
commercial jet liners and military aerospace products (based on total sales).
Boeing designs and produces commercial airplanes, defense systems, and civil and
defense space systems. It is also the largest NASA contractor. Non-airplane
products include helicopters, electronic and defense systems, missiles,
satellites, rocket engines, launch vehicles, and advanced information and
communication systems. 

Boeing is one of the best-positioned companies among its defense peers due to
its balanced exposure to commercial aircraft and defense equipment. Defense
peers like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT) and Northrop Grumman
Corporation (NYSE: NOC) dabble only in defense equipment. 

Going forward we believe Boeing`s $316 billion order backlog, strong order
booking, stable cash flow generation and a globally diversified customer base
will help maintain the growth momentum. However, a bearish commercial aerospace
market, apprehension over growth in defense spending, and delays in the launch
of the 787 series jetliner will affect Boeing`s performance in the near term.

&lt;p&gt;ACCRA (Reuters) - Ghana has repeated its threat to block the $4 billion sale of an oilfield stake to ExxonMobil by Kosmos Energy, the latest move in a tussle over control of key assets in the west African country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghana wants to buy the same Jubilee field stake for its own state-run Ghana National Petroleum Corp (GNPC) and the West African country's energy minister said he had written a letter to the U.S. oil company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We said we would not approve the deal if it should go ahead as it is now," Energy Minister Joseph Oteng-Adjei told reporters at a conference, without saying when Ghana sent the letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Privately-owned Kosmos agreed last autumn to sell its 30.875 percent interest in The West Cape Three Points Block and its 18 percent stake in Deepwater Tano Block in the Gulf of Guinea to Exxon for around $4 billion, sources close to the deal have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LEGAL THREAT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Tuesday the Wall Street Journal reported that Ghana's government had actually blocked the deal -- something it has been threatening to do since October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kosmos sources have said the government can only block a contract if it can show that the potential buyer lacks sufficient technical skills or financial strength -- a hurdle at which Exxon, the world's largest non-government controlled oil company, is unlikely to fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said if the government were to block the deal, it could face legal action from Kosmos, which is backed by U.S. private equity funds Blackstone Group LP and Warburg Pincus LLC , and that its threats could be intended to scupper the sale without opening itself up to a lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon spokesman Patrick McGinn said the company did not "comment on the details of commercial discussions or opportunities," adding only that it "routinely evaluates potential development opportunities around the world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jubilee field, which crosses the two blocks in which Kosmos holds stakes, has 800 million barrels of recoverable reserves, Oteng-Adjei said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jubilee was discovered in 2007 by a partnership of the Ghanaian government and international firms, and is expected to begin producing in the last quarter of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday the government had blocked the deal -- something it has been threatening to do since October -- and would only allow GNPC buy the stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Martinne Geller; Writing by Daniel Magnowski in Dakar and Tom Bergin in London; Editing by Karen Foster and Andrew Callus)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Karen Brettell

 NEW YORK, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) debt
spreads and ratings are likely to stay steady if the company
continues positive earnings momentum and reduces leverage taken
on as part of its acquisition of Marvel Entertainment.

 Disney's credit default swap costs fell after the company
on Tuesday reported better-than-expected earnings for the
fiscal first quarter, boosted by a strong performance at its
cable division and cost-cutting at its film studio. For
details, see [ID:nN09114719]

 The cost to insure the company's debt dropped to around
52.5 basis points on Wednesday, or $52,500 per year for five
years to insure $10 million in debt, from the 55 basis point
area on Tuesday, according to Markit Intraday.

 "Disney reported results that were better than we
anticipated," Barclays analysts Hale Holden and Danish
Agboatwala said in a report, and the company remains the "gold
standard" for entertainment credits.

 Disney's swaps are trading at recent tights relative to the
index, Barclays said. Its swaps compare to spreads of around 79
basis points, 75 basis points and 58 basis points,
respectively, for CDSs on News Corp NWS.N, Omnicom Group
(OMC.N) and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O).

 Barclays has a marketweight recommendation on the company's
debt, however, saying that "it is unlikely there are any
near-term negative credit shocks."

 Disney has maintained stable ratings in spite of an
increase in leverage due to its acquisition of Marvel in
December for $4 billion in cash and stock.

 The company is likely to issue new corporate debt in the
near-term to fund the repurchase of shares issued in the
acquisition, in addition to meeting near-term debt maturities
and capital expenditures, Barclays said.

 Ratings agencies have affirmed the company's ratings,
however, citing confidence that the company will pay down debt,
and noting the revenue benefits from the Marvel acquisition.

 Cost reduction benefits from the purchase may also allow
the company to sustain higher leverage than it has held
historically, Fitch Ratings said on Wednesday.

 Fitch has a stable outlook on Disney's A rating, the sixth
highest investment grade.

 Standard  Poor's in December took the company off review
for downgrade from A, though it assigned the company a negative
outlook, indicating a rating downgrade may be likely over the
coming one-to-two years.

 The rating affirmation was made on an expectation that the
company should be able to restore its leverage for the current
rating within the next 18-24 months, SP said.

 The negative outlook, however, reflects longer term
concerns about the strength of a recovery in Disney's
businesses, particularly in its film unit, SP said.

 The negative outlook also reflects the possibility that
Disney could make more acquisitions or resume large share
buybacks, which would delay its deleveraging or drive leverage
even higher, SP said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Time, prosperity and short memories could allow Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) to slowly ratchet up bonuses for its top executives, but analysts believe the days of mega payouts are probably gone for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long Wall Street's top investment bank, Goldman converted to a bank holding company at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, one of several ways in which it benefited from government help without which it might not have survived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And although Goldman might get away with incremental increases for top managers, Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein has little chance of getting the $67.9 million bonus he made in 2007, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, CEO since 2006, could have demanded a record bonus to match his firm's 2009 record earnings, but wisely took a relatively modest $8.99 million stock bonus instead in a nod to political pressure for restraint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The $70 million bonus is probably past us," said Rose Marie Orens of New York-based Compensation Advisory Partners. "I think they know that too -- not in a public company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, for its part, says it has no "magic formula" for determining compensation. In 2010, as in past years, it will be determined by performance, competition and "the world around us," chief financial officer David Viniar told a conference in Florida on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three-Week-Long South Padre Beach Party Captivates Young Adults for 16 Straight
Years
SOUTH PADRE ISLAND, Texas--(Business Wire)--
As college students across the country prepare to embark on their annual rite of
passage, Coca-Cola Beach is ramping up to entertain tens of thousands of
students in a fun and engaging, yet safe and wholesome environment for the 16th
year on South Padre Island. 

Located on five acres of beachfront at the Isla Grand Beach Resort on Texas`
southern tip, Coca-Cola Beach is a free Spring Break experience with
heart-thumping music from the hottest DJs, boisterous on-stage contests, cool
prizes and a chance to sample the latest technology and products. More than
100,000 college students take part in the fun at Coca-Cola Beach, a spring break
tradition since 1995. 

"Coca-Cola Beach offers young adults an unparalleled Spring Break experience,"
said John Oehlke, vice president of the South Region for Coca-Cola North
America. "By providing free, non-stop fun in a safe environment, we hope to help
create memories that will last a lifetime." 

Coca-Cola Beach is a partnership with the Isla Grand Beach Resort and is
supported by the South Padre Island Convention and Visitors` Bureau. 

"Coca-Cola Beach is key in our Spring Break initiative here on South Padre
Island," said Dan Quandt, executive director of the South Padre Island
Convention and Visitors Bureau. "For 15 years, Coca-Cola has provided safe, free
fun for visitors to our Island - they are a wonderful corporate partner to
invest in the experience of Spring Break on South Padre Island." 

While Coca-Cola Beach has been called "the largest beach party on the planet" by
The Travel Channel, it is also a place where blue water meets green thinking.
Recycling is a national Coca-Cola initiative, and it`s a major focus at
Coca-Cola Beach. Recycling receptacles for bottles and cans are placed at the
event site and emptied daily. Coca-Cola Beach also offers incentives for
students to volunteer and get involved with the cleanup each evening to ensure a
pristine beach the following morning. 

Open for 17 consecutive days from March 7 - 23, Coca-Cola plans to give away
more than 15,000 bottles of Coca-Cola products and thousands of t-shirts, hats
and other Coca-Cola branded merchandise to keep students refreshed and equipped
to make the most of their experience. During that time, Coca-Cola Beach employs
17 full-time Spring Break staffers for 26 days, with total man/woman hours of
2,523. 

With warm tropical breezes and miles of powdery soft sand, every watersport
under the sun and a vivacious nightlife, South Padre is the preferred
destination for Spring Breakers from across the country.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Bob Iger wasn't bluffing. The Disney CEO has been telling Wall Street for months of his plans for studio executives to shorten traditional movie release schedules, and it appears the time has arrived for the first grand experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A day after the revelation that UK exhibitors are being asked to accept a tightened theatrical window for Disney's spring feature "Alice in Wonderland," The Hollywood Reporter has learned that U.S. theater owners have been similarly approached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, movies play in first-run theaters for up to 16 weeks. Disney is talking about a theatrical run of just under 13 weeks for "Alice," a 3D motion-capture/live-action fantasy directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studio would benefit from truncating the theatrical run because the movie, with its family-friendly subject matter and well-known cast, is well positioned to do big success as a home entertainment title. The quicker Disney can get it into DVD and Blu-ray Disc release, the better for its bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's likely that Disney also will accelerate the availability of "Alice" on video-on-demand, which home-entertainment executives have come to view as less of a threat to DVD/Blu-ray income and more as a complementary revenue stream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exhibitors have made it clear that they need a compensating upside from the moves. Less clear is how the studio will provide such a benefit, but film-rental terms are always subject to some negotiating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days, most releases come with "aggregate" terms. In such cases, distributors and exhibitors agree to split box office by a set percentage of a film's entire run, with up to 55 percent going into studio coffers on pricey high-profile releases. But on some pictures, studios still pencil in a growing share for exhibitors during the course of a run. It's possible that Disney will use such an approach to offer a sweeter-than-usual early taste of the receipts for theater owners in exchange for their agreeing to book the film for a truncated theatrical run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any event, exhibitors are getting assurances that Disney will proceed cautiously in broadening its experiment to future movie releases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's sales job in the U.K., where it sought to lop as much as five weeks from its regional run, was a bit easier. European theater owners know the theatrical market will be squeezed greatly when the soccer World Cup kicks off in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, another benefit of the shorter theatrical run for "Alice" -- set to unspool worldwide March 5 in a combination of 2D and 3D venues -- would be its freeing up 3D screens for other extra-dimensional features, including Warner Bros.' April 2 release "Clash of the Titans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Iger, who's been trying to reinvigorate the Disney film studio through a major executive shuffle, changes to traditional release windows simply are a matter of maximizing studio profits. As recently as Tuesday, the Disney topper mused during an earnings conference that window experiments might be a way of improving the studio's bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
The Walt Disney Company's (Disney) fiscal first quarter 2010 operating
performance was solid and in line with Fitch Ratings' expectations. The
company's results continue to be fueled by its strong cable networks division
(revenue up 8%) driven predominantly by international subscriber growth and
higher carriage fees domestically. Overall the company's revenue was up 1% and
EBITDA was up almost 10%. Free cashflow also improved in the quarter. Short-term
debt was up approximately $1.4 billion over the prior quarter related to the
Marvel transaction but overall net borrowings were down approximately $1.6
billion compared to the prior year. Leverage remains below 2.0 times (x). 

Fitch believes the company is positioned for modest cyclical improvement
throughout the rest of calendar 2010, particularly in its theme parks and media
networks divisions. Given the permanent fixed cost actions the company has taken
during the downturn, Fitch expects the company could exhibit even more operating
leverage in an upturn than it has historically. Fitch notes that if revenue
grows more significantly, EBITDA could grow more than 2x any percentage increase
in revenue. This type of performance would be unlikely to result in positive
rating momentum, but would position the company more solidly in the 'A' rating
category. Fitch expects more cashflow over the next several years to be
dedicated to capital expenditure programs and share buybacks. This potential
activity is accommodated in Fitch's ratings on Disney. 

Disney's ratings continue to reflect the company's leading market positions in
core businesses, unique brand franchises, substantial cable network carriage
revenues, and strong credit metrics. In addition, the company continues to
benefit from leveraging its hit-driven brands across multiple platforms. Credit
concerns center on the cyclical volatility of its theme parks and resorts,
studio and broadcast networks businesses, as well as the maturation of the DVD
business. The Stable Outlook takes into account the company's current liquidity
as well as Fitch's expectations related to the overall long-term secular profile
of the company's businesses. 

Fitch rates Disney as follows: 

The Walt Disney Company 

--Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A'; 

--Senior unsecured debt 'A'; 

--Commercial paper 'F1'. 

ABC Inc. 

--IDR 'A'; 

--Senior unsecured debt 'A'. 

Disney Enterprises, Inc. 

--IDR 'A'; 

--Senior unsecured debt 'A'. 

The Outlook is Stable.

&lt;p&gt;Drivers Demonstrate Singing Skills in New Spot Set to Debut During the DAYTONA
500
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Race fans will see a whole new side of their favorite drivers as some of the
sport`s biggest stars show off their singing abilities in Coca-Cola`s latest
television commercial set to debut during the DAYTONA 500 (Sunday, Feb. 14, 1
p.m. on FOX). 

The new spot, entitled "Harmony," offers a NASCAR twist on one of the most
popular commercials ever - Coca-Cola`s iconic "Hilltop," which first aired in
1971 - as several drivers belt out the famous song, "I`d Like To Buy The World A
Coke" while battling one another on the racetrack. In the ad, Coca-Cola Racing
Family members Greg Biffle, Clint Bowyer, Jeff Burton, Denny Hamlin, Kevin
Harvick, Bobby Labonte, Joey Logano, Ryan Newman, David Ragan, Elliott Sadler
and Tony Stewart show how even the most competitive rivals can Open Happiness
with Coca-Cola. 

"In the original ad, Coca-Cola was the bond that connected people through a
spirit of optimism. That uplifting outlook still rings true today and is
reflected in our NASCAR-themed commercial in a fun, unexpected way," said Katie
Bayne, Chief marketing Officer, Coca-Cola North America. "By showing how a
refreshing Coca-Cola can bring together even the most competitive rivals, we`re
reminding people to take a moment to have fun, open a little happiness and enjoy
the simple pleasures in life." 

In the opening scene, controlled chaos ensues as the drivers pull into the pits,
complaining to their crew chiefs over the radio and calling for adjustments.
Before heading back onto the track, the drivers are each handed an ice-cold
Coca-Cola for much needed refreshment. As crew chiefs and fans monitor driver
radio chatter, they quickly find that the previously exasperated drivers have
changed their tune - literally - as they`re seen singing the signature song`s
familiar lines during the heat of battle, complete with "apple trees and honey
bees and snow white turtledoves." 

"I`d Like To Buy The World A Coke," the iconic song from "Hilltop" which was
written in less than 24 hours, became an instant hit and inspired numerous
renditions, including three top 40 versions of I'd Like to Teach the World to
Sing. Within 10 days of the U.S. release of "Hilltop," The Coca-Cola Company
received 10,000 letters from people expressing support for the message in the
ad. 

"It`s been both fun and an honor to be a part of creating a new NASCAR take on a
commercial that is such a big part of Coke`s history," said driver Kevin
Harvick. "Most of us drivers should probably stick to our day jobs, though,
because I`m pretty sure our version of the famous Coca-Cola song won`t make it
to the top of the charts."

singing "I`d Like To Buy The World A Coke." In addition, a video featuring

&lt;p&gt;Ecuador Accuses Oil Giant of Reneging on Promises to US Federal Court and
`Triple Forum Shopping`
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
In a blistering attack against Chevron, lawyers for the government of Ecuador
accused the oil giant of "triple forum shopping" and reneging on
legally-enforceable promises in a motion asking a federal judge to shut down an
international arbitration that Chevron is using to try to escape a potential $27
billion environmental liability. 

The motion came in a lawsuit filed in U.S. federal court by the Republic of
Ecuador to enjoin Chevron from participating in an arbitration under the
U.S.-Ecuador bilateral investment treaty. Chevron is seeking to use the
arbitration to shift to Ecuador`s government any liability for clean-up that
might result from a final judgment in the separate environmental lawsuit,
Aguinda v. ChevronTexaco, which has been pending against the oil giant in
Ecuador since 2003. 

The Ecuador government motion says Chevron has tried "to whipsaw this [U.S.
Federal] Court and the affected parties, searching for a haven, whether in the
United States or abroad, to avoid liability" for deliberately dumping billions
of gallons of toxic waste into Ecuador`s Amazon. Representatives of the 30,000
plaintiffs in the Aguinda case say the dumping has caused more than 1,400 cancer
deaths and decimated indigenous groups. A court-appointed Special Master found
the oil giant could be liable for up to $27.3 billion in clean-up costs and
damages. 

The Aguinda lawsuit alleges that Chevron designed and built a system of oil
extraction that deliberately discharged billions of gallons of toxic waste into
streams and rivers over an area roughly the size of Rhode Island. The Aguinda
case originally was filed in the same US federal court in 1993, but it was
ultimately sent to Ecuador on the express promise by Chevron to submit to
jurisdiction there and pay any judgment. 

Ecuador`s preliminary injunction motion references Chevron`s repeated, express
representations "to satisfy any `final judgment` against it &#8230; subject only to
possibly exercising its right to defend against enforcement of any adverse
Ecuadorian judgment under specific defenses set forth under NY federal law," not
international arbitration. 

"The stark reality," Ecuador asserts in the motion, "is the respondents (Chevron
and its local subsidiary), having moved the case to Ecuador &#8230; are reneging on a
key condition of the dismissal - their promise to satisfy any judgment. Not only
are they refusing to satisfy a key condition&#8230; they are asking an
not-yet-constituted arbitral tribunal to prevent the Ecuadorian court from
deciding a case which it has been hearing for more than six years, by ordering
the Republic to force its court to dismiss the plaintiffs` claims - all without
the participation of the plaintiffs themselves." 

According to the motion: "This is Texaco-style justice." 

Chevron is trying to use the arbitration in a more favorable forum to resolve
many of the same legal issues currently being heard by the Ecuador court in the
Aguinda trial, but without the presence of the plaintiffs who would be barred by
rule from participating, said Steven Donziger, an American legal advisor to the
Amazonian communities. Chevron`s goal is to have the arbitral panel order
Ecuador`s government to contravene its own Constitution to mandate that its
local trial court find that Chevron has "no liability" in the Aguinda case, he
added. 

Donziger said that Chevron`s action, if successful, would make it virtually
impossible for victims of corporate misconduct to ever bring claims in their own
courts against foreign investors. Further, it is unclear if the arbitral panel
has the power to order Ecuador to violate its own Constitution and quash a legal
case, he added. 

"This is a radical attempt by Chevron to re-write the rules of the game because
it is losing a trial where it faces a large potential liability," said Donziger.


The Ecuador government motion states that Ecuador would be "irreparably harmed"
if it is "forced to arbitrate the substantive merits of a 16-year environmental
case to which it has never been a party, which has not yet gone to judgment, and
which eventual judgment Texaco expressly represented it would satisfy" as a
condition of its dismissal to Ecuador from U.S. federal court several years ago.


Chevron in 2004 attempted to arbitrate the same issues against Ecuador before
another private forum, the American Arbitration Association in New York. In that
case, Chevron suffered a string of devastating setbacks in the federal trial
court, a federal appeals court, and ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court which
denied review of the case even after Chevron had hired former U.S. Solicitor
General Paul Clement to represent the company. That arbitration was permanently
stayed in 2007. 

Ecuador describes Chevron`s latest arbitration filing as "a prime example of
triple forum shopping." The three courts are the AAA arbitration in U.S. federal
court (where Chevron lost), the trade arbitration before an international
arbitration panel (subject of the motion described above), and the Ecuador trial
itself (which has yet to reach judgment). 

If granted, the injunction will stop Chevron from proceeding to arbitration
while the court considers Ecuador`s request to permanently enjoin the
proceeding. The Ecuadorian plaintiffs also have filed a separate motion before
the same federal court asking that the arbitration be enjoined.

&lt;p&gt; * Revenue falls 2.3 pct to $5.12 bln, misses Street view&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Stands by 2010 guidance, sees smaller currency lift&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shares down about 3 percent after sharper decline
 (Adds comments from conference call, updates stock decline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jessica Wohl&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHICAGO, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc
(CCE.N) posted lower-than-expected quarterly sales, citing
lingering economic weakness and tough competition, and said
revenue in North America should essentially be flat this year,
sending its shares down more than 3 percent on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The largest bottler of Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) drinks stood by
its full-year forecast even though it continues to deal with
skittish consumers in North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As recently as mid-December, it had forecast slight revenue
growth in North America, where it is raising prices 2 percent
to 3 percent. [ID:nN17193404] It still expects gains in
Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola, its largest shareholder and supplier, reported
stronger-than-expected sales growth on Tuesday, helped by
strength in emerging markets. [ID:nN09135554]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola also reported a 1 percent increase in European
sales volume, which analysts said boded well for Coke
Enterprises, as it operates in countries such as Britain,
France and Belgium, in addition to North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola Enterprises, which bottles and distributes drinks
such as Coca-Cola, Sprite, Minute Maid juice and Powerade
sports drinks, said volume rose 6 percent in Europe during the
quarter, but fell 3 percent in North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Business in key North American venues such as bars and
restaurants, remains soft, said CEO John Brock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UBS equity analyst Kaumil Gajrawala was surprised to see
pricing fall 0.5 percent in North America, where sales of
higher-priced noncarbonated drinks and single-serving packages
slowed as consumers sought bargains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gajrawala, who rates Coke Enterprises a "buy," said it was
the first time North American pricing fell since the third
quarter of 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To reignite sales, the company still plans to double the
number of "Boost Zones" in North America to more than 100 and
add more than 70 in Europe, where the zones started, this year.
The zones, where red banners and signs are prominently
displayed, help drive sales of higher-margin items like chilled
drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola Enterprises' shares were down 3.5 percent at
$19.62 after dropping to $19.37 on the New York Stock Exchange,
while Coke's shares were down 0.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SALES MISS FORECAST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke Enterprises earned $110 million, or 22 cents per
share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $1.45
billion, or $2.99 per share, a year earlier, when it was
burdened with a hefty impairment charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On a comparable basis, earnings per share were unchanged
from the fourth quarter of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue fell 2.3 percent to $5.12 billion. Analysts on
average had expected earnings of 20 cents per share on revenue
of $5.28 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "quality of the quarter was not great," J.P. Morgan
analyst John Faucher said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Faucher said a 13 percent decline in operating profit
missed his expectations for a loss of 2 percent, while an 18
percent tax rate was below his estimate of a 26 percent rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it still expected 2010 comparable earnings
to rise at a high-single-digit percentage rate. That forecast
excludes the impact of currency exchange rates, which are now
expected to have just a negligible impact. Back in December,
Coke Enterprises anticipated a 4 cent-per-share lift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also expects low-single-digit growth in revenue, aided
by mid-single-digit growth in Europe. The company said
commodity costs should be flat to down slightly this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When asked about acquisitions during a conference call,
Brock said his company is "very open" to expanding its reach in
North America and Europe and that he sees fewer gaps in the
beverage portfolio than he did a few years ago.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), which held down executive pay last year, has no "magic formula" for setting compensation in 2010, Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viniar said pay this year would depend on a number of factors, including the firm's performance, competition and "the world around us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will try to strike the right balance going forward," he told the Credit Suisse Financial Services Conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman reported record annual profit for 2009 and paid its employees $16.2 billion, below its all-time compensation high of $20 billion in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm was on a pace for record pay last year before changing course and reducing the amount set aside for pay in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For much of 2009, the investment bank was the target of intense public criticism over the large sums it was earmarking for pay, so soon after a government bailout. Critics charged that the financial sector's losses were socialized while its profits were privatized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman was among hundreds of U.S. banks that received government bailout money in 2008 as the financial crisis threatened to drag down the entire financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's 2009 compensation costs amounted to 36 percent of its net revenue, well below historical averages near 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank paid Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein $9 million in 2009, far below the $67.9 million he received in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rival Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which reported a net loss for 2009, paid out 62 percent of its revenue as compensation. Its new CEO, James Gorman, vowed last week to bring the ratio down substantially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar said Goldman did not target a compensation ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We try to pay our people fairly," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar said it was too early to tell how the regulatory winds will impact Goldman Sachs. President Barack Obama last month proposed stricter limits on financial risk-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is too early to know how these things are going to unfold," Viniar said. "We have a long history of responding to regulatory changes as they happen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He reiterated that he did not expect Goldman to hand back its banking charter. Some investors have speculated that Goldman would try to shed its banking charter to reduce the regulatory scrutiny it faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America`s Second Largest Sea Port Refines Operating, Invoicing and Revenue
Tracking Systems for Moving Over $100 Billion in Goods Annually
LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
Ignify, a global ERP and CRM consulting firm, eCommerce solution provider, and
Microsoft Dynamics Inner Circle Partner, today announced that they have been
chosen by the Port of Long Beach California to implement Microsoft`s Dynamics
AX. The new ERP system will greatly heighten productivity by automating the
Port`s critical billing, accounts receivable, revenue recognition and analytical
reporting systems responsible for moving more than $100 billion worth of
products, natural resources, and provisions traversing through the harbor each
year. 

Microsoft Dynamics AX will serve as the central core for the Port of Long
Beach`s new Port Operating and Revenue Tracking System (PORTS) that will be
developed and implemented by Ignify. The key role of the PORTS platform will be
to help the Port of Long Beach increase the efficiency of the billing process
and improve customer service by managing invoices, accounts receivables and cash
application. Dynamics AX-based PORTS will provide EDI and real-time reporting of
billing data which is not available in the current system, thereby enhancing
financial reporting and automating data validation. In addition, a new web-based
portal will offer tenants, terminal operators, and employees the ability to
securely create, view and manage orders anywhere an Internet connection is
available. 

Other benefits include:

* Allows port staff and customers to enter billing data directly into a web
browser, reducing data entry errors 
* Validates customer self-reported data and calculates charges and credits in
accordance with lease agreements and Port tariffs 
* Interfaces with the Port's Electronic Document and Records management system,
Vessel Tracking, Property Management and Green Flag systems 
* Provides dashboard style user interfaces for Port staff, executives and
external customers

Microsoft Dynamics AX will provide increased automation and efficiency,
flexibility and scalability for future enhancements, and better quality control
and turnaround time for more effective decision-making. 

The Port of Long Beach is one of the world`s premier sea ports responsible for
the transport of goods ranging from textiles, automobiles, petroleum, steel,
furniture, and consumer electronics among many other products. The Port is also
an economic powerhouse responsible for over 316,000 jobs in Southern California
and 1.4 million jobs throughout the United States. 

"We are pleased that the Port of Long Beach has chosen us for this important
project," said Sandeep Walia, president of Ignify. "The amount of cargo
traveling in and out of Long Beach at any given moment along with the amount of
data generated for fulfilling these shipments is astronomical. By automating
inventory and revenue tracking through Microsoft Dynamics AX and designing a
web-portal where customers can log-in and manage orders themselves, the Port of
Long Beach will dramatically improve day-to-day operations while lowering total
annual costs." 

In addition to the Port of Long Beach, Ignify in 2009 was selected to implement
Microsoft Dynamics AX ERP system for the Harbor Center port in the Philippines.
Ignify was recently ranked as the 26th fastest growing company by the Los
Angeles Business Journal and 19th Fastest Growing IT Company nationwide by Inc.
Magazine`s Inc. 500.

&lt;p&gt; * Says 2010 compensation will be based on multiple factors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Says aiming for 'the right balance'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Says too early to forecast impact of regulatory reform&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Steve Eder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N), which held down executive pay last year, has no "magic
formula" for setting compensation in 2010, Chief Financial
Officer David Viniar said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Viniar said pay this year would depend on a number of
factors, including the firm's performance, competition and "the
world around us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will try to strike the right balance going forward," he
told the Credit Suisse Financial Services Conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman reported record annual profit for 2009 and paid its
employees $16.2 billion, below its all-time compensation high
of $20 billion in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The firm was on a pace for record pay last year before
changing course and reducing the amount set aside for pay in
the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For much of 2009, the investment bank was the target of
intense public criticism over the large sums it was earmarking
for pay, so soon after a government bailout. Critics charged
that the financial sector's losses were socialized while its
profits were privatized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman was among hundreds of U.S. banks that received
government bailout money in 2008 as the financial crisis
threatened to drag down the entire financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's 2009 compensation costs amounted to 36 percent of
its net revenue, well below historical averages near 50
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank paid Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein $9 million in
2009, far below the $67.9 million he received in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rival Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which reported a net loss for
2009, paid out 62 percent of its revenue as compensation. Its
new CEO, James Gorman, vowed last week to bring the ratio down
substantially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Viniar said Goldman did not target a compensation ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We try to pay our people fairly," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Viniar said it was too early to tell how the regulatory
winds will impact Goldman Sachs. President Barack Obama last
month proposed stricter limits on financial risk-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is too early to know how these things are going to
unfold," Viniar said. "We have a long history of responding to
regulatory changes as they happen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He reiterated that he did not expect Goldman to hand back
its banking charter. Some investors have speculated that
Goldman would try to shed its banking charter to reduce the
regulatory scrutiny it faces.

&lt;p&gt;Feb 10 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities added Kraft Foods
Inc KFT.N to its U.S. focus list, saying it expects the
British confectioner's earnings potential to increase
substantially following the acquisition of Cadbury Plc
CBRY.L.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said in a note to clients that it expects
little to no earnings growth for the company in 2010, but added
that it sees low double-digit pro forma EPS growth from 2011
through 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kraft, which is in the final stages of taking over Cadbury
after a prolonged bid battle, has underperformed its peers,
with a compression in its relative valuation, J.P. Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect double-digit price appreciation by the end of
2010, and investors should benefit from the current 4 percent
dividend yield," said JP Morgan, which has a $34 price target
on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, while maintaining an "overweight" rating on
the stock, said it expects revenue synergies for the two
companies to add 60 basis points (bps) of sales growth in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Kraft were trading almost flat in early morning
trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, Feb 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
(SPTech Conference Booth #704) - Titus Labs a leading provider of
security and compliance solutions for email and documents, has released
the latest version of Titus Labs Metadata Security(TM) for Microsoft
SharePoint. The newly enhanced Metadata Security application provides
enhanced options for administrators to protect information in SharePoint
-- based on metadata properties. Metadata Security enables administrators
to maintain all information in a single library or list while restricting
access or permissions associated with items, based on one or more
metadata properties. Titus Labs will be showcasing the solution in booth
704 at SPTech Con in San Francisco, along with their other leading
SharePoint security products.

    To secure individual documents or items in SharePoint, administrators
need to create individual per item security which is complicated and time
consuming. Titus Labs Metadata Security for SharePoint enables
administrators to assign security based on attributes or metadata
columns. With this solution, it is much easier for administrators to
configure security as there is no need to assign permissions to every
item. Metadata Security can automatically assign specific permissions for
each item in SharePoint, eliminating the need to define security settings
and item-level permissions manually. This enables companies to maintain a
central repository with permission based access.

    Key Features of this version include:

    - Support for metadata security rules based on more than one column. For
example, administrators can build special perrmissions for documents
where the Department metadata equals FINANCE and Security equals INTERNAL
USE.

    - Ease of use with building metadata security rules for documents that
have metadata with user names. For example, in a healthcare environment
you can protect sensitive healthcare documents, by automatically
assigning permissions to doctors and patients.

    - Support for SharePoint document libraries and now SharePoint lists.

    - Support for Microsoft SharePoint Server and now Windows SharePoint
Services platforms.

    "Titus Labs Metadata Security is the only product that allows us to
catalogue a giant repository of documents that each of our large
pharmaceutical clients can access with restricted permissions," said Mark
Cutler, Manager Information Technology, Corporate Translations Inc. "We
are truly excited about the flexibility of the new release enabling us to
give even better service and value to our customers."

    "As with all Titus Labs' products, customer feedback has driven the
development of this latest release," says Charlie Pulfer, VP Product
Development and Marketing for Titus Labs. "Administrators need a simple
way to control access to information in SharePoint while ensuring team
collaboration. Our latest version of Metadata Security enables secure
information sharing in SharePoint in a flexible and easy way."

    Pricing and Availability

    Titus Labs Metadata Security 2.0 is available immediately from Titus Labs
and authorized reseller partners. Pricing for Windows SharePoint Services
(WSS) starts at $3,995, and pricing for SharePoint Server (MOSS) starts
at $4,995. Existing customers, who have Metadata Security 1.0, are
entitled to a free upgrade to the new release with their maintenance.

&lt;p&gt;SAN ANTONIO &amp; SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
The American Payroll Association and Visa in (NYSE:V) today announced the launch
of the APA Visa Paycard Portal (www.paycardportal.com). The APA and Visa
collaborated in the creation of the portal as an online resource to educate
businesses about payroll cards. Payroll cards or "paycards" enable electronic
wage payment to employees regardless of whether they have a traditional bank
account. 

"APA`s partnership with Visa creates a true go-to resource for businesses to
learn about payroll card programs and best practices," said APA Executive
Director, Dan Maddux. 

The APA Visa Paycard Portal offers a wide range of resources for payroll and
finance professionals. Highlights of the site include:

* An overview of the benefits of payroll cards for employers and employees 
* Best practices for implementing a payroll program 
* `Points from the pros` allowing employers to ask questions about payroll cards
programs 
* The latest industry news and webinars on key topics 
* Research on state laws that allow 100% electronic pay 
* Updates on legislative activity

"Through the combined expertise of Visa and the APA, payroll professionals now
have valuable information on how payroll cards offer employers cost saving
efficiencies while enhancing the payroll experience for employees -literally at
their fingertips," said Nizam Antoo, senior business leader, consumer prepaid
products, Visa Inc. 

Paycards can eliminate the recurring production and administrative costs of
printing and mailing checks, while bringing the convenience and security of
electronic payments to employees lacking a traditional bank account. The
employee`s pay is deposited directly to a secure account, accessible through a
payment card, rather than receiving a traditional paper check. Employees enjoy
more immediate access to their funds and the ability to use the card for
everyday expenses and to pay bills in person, online or by phone as well as to
access cash at ATMs.

For full-year 2009, consolidated comparable operating income grew 9 percent.
North American comparable operating income grew $126 million or 13 percent, and
in Europe, operating income grew $63 million, or 7 percent, including a negative
currency impact of $118 million. Full-year revenues were down &#189; percent, as
North American revenue declined &#189; percent and European revenue declined 1&#189;
percent. Excluding a negative currency impact of 3&#189; percent, total revenues grew
3 percent. There was a negative currency impact of approximately 15 cents on
comparable EPS results of $1.60. 

In the fourth quarter, diluted EPS on a reported and comparable basis totaled 22
cents. Revenue declined 2&#189; percent as a favorable currency impact of 3 percent
was offset by four fewer selling days. 

"Our 2009 results clearly demonstrate that we can deliver against our long term
objectives even as we manage through difficult operating and economic
conditions," said John F. Brock, chairman and chief executive officer. "Our
earnings in 2009 were the highest in our history and up more than 20 percent
from a year ago. These results reflect the hard work and talent of our 70,000
employees, whose efforts have positioned CCE to deliver another year of earnings
growth in 2010. 

"Despite this success, we face lingering economic weakness throughout our
territories and an evolving competitive environment," Mr. Brock said. "However,
we remain confident that we can continue to achieve our long-term objectives as
we strive to be the world`s best beverage sales and customer service company." 

NORTH AMERICAN RESULTS

For full-year 2009, comparable North American volume declined 5 percent, while
net pricing per case grew 6&#189; percent. Full year cost of sales per case increased
4 percent. In the fourth quarter, North American volume declined 3 percent,
while net pricing per case declined &#189; percent reflecting the mix impact of
slower sales of still beverages and single-serve packages. 

"Though fourth quarter volume results reflect significant sequential improvement
over the third quarter, we continue to see the impact of weak macroeconomic
conditions on our overall results," Mr. Brock said. "Key channels, such as on
premise, remain soft. We will continue to execute several key operating and
brand initiatives to counter these conditions. For example, through our
price/package architecture effort, we are offering customers and consumers
important package and price point alternatives. 

"We are also strengthening our marketplace presence through our Right Execution
Daily initiative and through Selling and Merchandising Optimization, which
enhances customer service and reduces costs," Mr. Brock said. "This work,
coupled with the strength of our Red, Black and Silver Coca-Cola trademark
portfolio as well as new brand activity including vitaminwater Zero, will help
us reach our 2010 goals in North America." 

EUROPEAN RESULTS

A balance of solid volume and pricing growth enabled Europe to achieve a third
consecutive year of profit growth. For the full year, comparable volume grew 5&#189;
percent, with continental Europe growth of 5 percent and growth in Great Britain
of 6 percent. A key growth factor is the ongoing success of Coca-Cola Zero and
the company`s Red, Black, and Silver initiative. For the year, Coca-Cola
trademark brands grew 7 percent, highlighted by growth for brand Coca-Cola, diet
Coke/Coke light, and Coca-Cola Zero, which increased more than 15 percent.
Flavored sparkling drinks grew 3 percent, driven by Sprite and energy drinks.
Still beverages grew 1 percent for the year, with growth in water and declines
for juices. 

Comparable net pricing per case increased 4 percent for the full year on a
currency-neutral basis. In the fourth quarter, European volume increased 6
percent and comparable net pricing per case grew 3&#189; percent. 

"Europe continues to deliver outstanding results, with balanced growth and
profitability for the third consecutive year," Mr. Brock said. "To build on this
progress, it is vital that we continue to focus on core sparkling beverages,
improve our overall still beverage portfolio, strengthen customer service amid a
rapidly changing commercial environment, and further enhance our effectiveness
and efficiency. 

"We are committed to maximizing our operations to seize the attractive growth
opportunities in Europe," Mr. Brock said. 

2010 OUTLOOK

CCE reaffirmed the guidance delivered in its December conference call with
analysts. For 2010, the company expects operating income will increase in a mid
to high single-digit range, driven by mid single-digit growth in both Europe and
North America. Revenue should increase at a low single-digit rate, driven by mid
single-digit growth in Europe and essentially flat revenue in North America. 

Comparable earnings per diluted common share will increase at a high
single-digit rate, excluding currency. Though it is too early to accurately
evaluate the 2010 currency impact, at current rates, currency would have a
negligible impact to full-year EPS. 

The company also expects strong free cash flow of approximately $800 million,
and capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion. Interest expense is
expected to decline modestly, and the effective tax rate for 2010 is expected to
be approximately 26 percent. Guidance excludes items affecting comparability and
is currency-neutral. 

SHARE REPURCHASE PLANS MOVE FORWARD

CCE confirmed that it plans to repurchase up to $600 million of its common stock
by the end of 2010 under previously authorized share repurchase programs.
Repurchased shares will be added to treasury stock and made available for
general corporate purposes, including acquisition financing and the funding of
various employee benefit and compensation plans. The company said its share
repurchase plans may be adjusted depending on economic, operating, or other
factors, including acquisition opportunities.

 (a)               The non-GAAP financial measure "Bottle and Can Net Pricing per Case" is used to more clearly evaluate bottle and can pricing trends in the marketplace. The measure excludes the impact of fountain gallon volume and other items that are not directly associated with bottle and can pricing in the retail environment. Our bottle and can sales accounted for approximately 91 percent of our net revenue during 2009.

The measure excludes the impact of fountain ingredient costs as well as marketing credits and Jumpstart funding, and allows investors to gain an understanding of the change in bottle and can ingredient and packaging costs.                                                                                                                                   
                   
                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 (d)               "Comparable Bottle and Can Volume" excludes the impact of changes in the number of selling days between periods. The measure is used to analyze the performance of our business on a constant period basis. There was one less selling day for the full year 2009 versus full year 2008. There were four less selling days in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus the fourth quarter of 2008.                                                                                                                       
                   
                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 (e)               The non-GAAP measure "Free Cash Flow" is provided to focus management and investors on the cash available for debt reduction, dividend distributions, share repurchase, and acquisition opportunities.

&lt;p&gt;Best Selling Microsoft SSL/VPN Appliances Now Manage DirectAccess
FREMONT, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Celestix Networks announced today that they have begun taking orders for their
upgraded WSA series appliances that now host Microsoft`s new Forefront Unified
Access Gateway 2010 software. 

Microsoft Forefront Unified Access Gateway 2010 (UAG) lets network professionals
provide mobile and remote workers with secure access to enterprise applications
via a highly configurable SSL VPN. UAG provides centralized, highly customizable
management that provides granular access and policy control across all of an
enterprise`s users, devices, and network resources. UAG also gives
administrators expanded options for managing Microsoft`s new DirectAccess always
on VPN feature in Windows Server 2008 R2. DirectAccess is expected to be a
significant factor in the field of secure access as enterprises migrate their
network infrastructures to Windows Server 2008 R2. 

Celestix reengineered their new 6th-generation hardware platforms to maximize
the performance of Microsoft`s 64-bit Windows 2008 R2 OS and UAG application
with added processing power and memory. For smaller customers or branch offices,
Celestix introduces the X4 platform, which supports the increased SSL encryption
requirements of small businesses. Enterprise customers will benefit from
Celestix` new high-performance H2 platform designed for Fortune 1000
datacenters. Although network administrators often desire sheer throughput for
SSL encryption, Celestix strikes the right balance of power, security, and
economy by minimizing space and power requirements while producing its
trademarked sleek, elegant appliance design. 

The new WSA appliances also share Celestix` next-generation Comet appliance
engine software with Celestix` recently released MSA web security gateway
appliances. Celestix reengineered their appliance engine from the ground up to
deliver the fully integrated appliance experience familiar to existing Celestix
customers. Comet takes full advantage of the new 64-bit architecture to provide
datacenter-ready features such as a web user interface for headless operation,
integrated save/restore of Last Good Version for disaster recovery, and a
rebuilt software update engine to provide a comprehensive view of patching. 

"By adding our X4 hardware platform and H2 high-end hardware platform to our
appliance series, we have positioned WSA appliances with 64 bit technology to
remain the SSL VPN solutions of choice for protecting the next generation of
Microsoft infrastructures at businesses and enterprises," commented Neil Matz,
vice president of product management at Celestix.

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats alerts and story to remove defunct Nikko Cordial stock
code)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO Feb 10 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Fortress
(FIG.N) are among the firms invited to bid for Anabuki
Construction Inc, a Japanese apartment developer that failed last
year with about $1.6 billion in debt, three sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anabuki, based on the southern Japanese island of Shikoku,
announced on Tuesday that it had hired Nikko Cordial Securities
as its adviser in finding an investor to buy the company and help
it rebuild its operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Based on previous cases in the same industry and of the same
amount of debt, the deal could be worth 50-80 billion yen
($557-892 million), said one of the sources, who added that
Anabuki would aim to find an investor by May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Invitations were sent to more than 100 firms, the source
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sources were not authorised to speak on the record about
the deal. Anabuki and Nikko Cordial declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anabuki ranked as Japan's third-largest condominium developer
in 2008 behind Daikyo Inc (8840.T) and industry leader Mitsui
Fudosan (8801.T), according to the Real Estate Economic
Institute, a research firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Anabuki was hit hard by the slump in Japan's property
market in the wake of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It filed for bankruptcy in November with 139 billion yen in
liabilities, making it the country's sixth-largest corporate
failure last year, according to Tokyo Shoko Research.

&lt;p&gt;MILAN Feb 10 (Reuters) - Sales at Walt Disney (DIS.N)

Christmas, and Disney Italy Chief Executive Cecilia Tosting
expects growth this year, she told an Italian newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;

two by the end of 2010 "with a plan for further growth in

Christmas started slowly, but then there was an acceleration

&lt;p&gt;I know, I know. You hate Microsoft for its bloated, buggy software, its slowness to innovate, and its government-certified, monopolistic bullying. I won't argue with any of those points, or those made last week in the NY Times by former Microsoft VP Dick Brass, who called his former employer "a clumsy, uncompetitive innovator."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I will say this: All of us in the technology community owe a big debt to Microsoft. Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer shouldered a task that, for all their brilliance, Jobs and his colleagues at Apple didn't take on: making computing ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's easy to bash Microsoft over its many failings, and I often do--particularly on the consumer front. But the Redmond giant has done an admirable job of getting pretty much every business on earth onto a single, functional platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is that a criticism of Apple? It is not. So hold your fire, fanboys. Apple makes great hardware and software. And not just computers, as its game-changing successes with iTunes and the iPhone--and maybe the iPad--prove. But an essential ingredient in that recipe for success is total control of the platform. Apple has it, Microsoft doesn't. So the very quality that made Apple a better platform than Windows also made the Mac a niche product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows, Windows Everywhere&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As computer technology really took hold in the 1980s and 1990s, businesses wanted standard products and standard software at a relatively low price point. Apple didn't offer that. If you wanted to buy an Apple, or later a Mac, you bought it from Apple or an Apple-certified dealer. Except for a very brief experiment, no other company has been allowed to build a Mac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Apple controlled the platform, its products weren't plagued by the panoply of hardware and software incompatibilities familiar to Windows users. But there was a huge tradeoff. Apple had a monopoly on Apple computers. And like all monopolies, it kept prices artificially high. For years, a business-worthy Apple machine cost nearly twice as much as a roughly comparable Windows machine. Faced with that discrepancy, choosing Windows-based PCs was a no-brainer for most companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And writing software for the Windows platform instead of the Mac platform was a no-brainer for developers who wanted the largest audience possible. The same was true for makers of all sorts of components and peripherals. Without the ability to sell hundreds of millions of chips for use in hundreds of millions of computers, a company like Intel could never have afforded the immense investment it took to push semiconductor technology so far, so fast. Simply put, Windows spawned a global ecosystem that proprietary Apple couldn't match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Microsoft made backwards compatibility a key strategic goal as it revved the Windows platform. Sure, that led to code bloat and a lessening of innovation. But if you were in a business, you didn't have to worry that your old software would suddenly be worthless if you bought a new computer with a newer version of Windows. That was not, and is not, true of Apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, the PC became a commodity, which means that the machines were so similar, price became the major differentiator. As those prices continued to drop, computing spread from North America, Europe and Japan, to less developed parts of the world. There are hundreds of millions of computers in use, and the vast majority run Windows and use products like Microsoft Office. And all of those businesses can exchange content because their hardware and software is compatible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like it or not, that changed the world in a way that Apple could not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, of course, technology is rapidly leaving the Windows desktop behind and Apple is now leading the charge, changing the world. No one would have thought that a computer company would completely upend the music business--and that's just one example. Dick Brass was right. Microsoft is in danger, not of financial bankruptcy, but of intellectual bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe that won't happen. But whether it does or not, it's worth remembering that Microsoft deserves a vote of thanks along with the well-deserved brickbats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;San Francisco journalist Bill Snyder writes frequently about business and technology.

&lt;p&gt;A judge dismissed a lawsuit that was filed against Microsoft over its much-criticized Windows Genuine Advantage program in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The judge in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington on Thursday dismissed the case with prejudice, leaving each party to pay its own lawyer fees. In a statement, Microsoft said it was pleased the case was &#8220;resolved successfully.&#8221; It did not say whether it agreed to any kind of settlement arrangement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit essentially characterized WGA as spyware, charging Microsoft with failing to describe the tool&#8217;s functions before downloading it onto the plaintiffs' computers. WGA was designed to determine whether a user&#8217;s version of Windows was pirated. It sent regular information back to Microsoft about user&#8217;s hardware and software and warned users of piracy violations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Contrary to the express statements Microsoft made in the inadequate disclosures that were provided, the software collected and communicated private identifying information from consumer&#8217;s computers and sent that information back to Microsoft on a daily basis,&#8221; the complaint read. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, the plaintiffs failed to have the suit certified as a class action, a blow to their case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the suit was filed, amid a storm of criticism, Microsoft released a new version of WGA with a reduced schedule of reporting user information back to the software giant. Months later it changed WGA again so as to not cut off users of Windows XP who had uncertain licenses. Those users were being labeled as having illegitimate software and were periodically asked to reinstall or buy a new version, even though in many cases the software was legitimate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WGA caused other problems as well. Once, after a worker accidentally loaded software onto the live system, Windows XP and Vista users were told via the WGA system that they had pirated copies of their software. The problem lasted more than a day before it was fully corrected. &lt;/p&gt;

standardized on IBM WebSphere MQ as their corporate message bus now have
the ability to directly integrate Kabira's Policy Orchestration solutions
into their network architectures," said Manish Gupta, vice president of
global marketing at Kabira. "This MQ channel enhances our customers'
ability to more rapidly develop and deliver new high-performance solutions
that will extend existing functionality and networks."

    The Kabira WebSphere MQ channel is supported for Kabira systems that run
on version 3.5.4 or later of Kabira's core transaction technology. It is
immediately available as an upgrade for Kabira systems deployed on the
Intel X86_64 architecture under Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 5.4, as
well as for multicore Sun Sparc systems running the Solaris 10 operating
system. As with all Kabira software, the MQ Channel 1.0 ships with a fully
integrated set of test cases to accelerate deployment and testing within
existing MQ networks. Pricing is similar to that of other standard Kabira
channels and is available upon request.

&lt;p&gt;Windows 8, the theoretical next version of Microsoft's ubiquitous OS, will&#160; be different from what has been expected of the platform, according to a cached version of a Microsoft blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Google-cached version of a January 31 blog on MSDN, entitled, "What's in store for the next Windows?" provided a limited glimpse of what to expect. The OS also was referred to as Windows.next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ InfoWorld columnist Randall C. Kennedy offered up predictions on Windows 8 last year. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The minimum that folks can take for granted is that the next version will be something&#160;completely different&#160;from what&#160;folks usually expect of Windows -- I am simply impressed with the process that Steven [Sinofsky,&#160; president of the Microsoft Windows and Windows Live Division] has set up to listen to our customers needs and wants and get a team together than can make it happen," the post, from a member of the Windows update team, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To actually bring together dozens and dozens of teams across Microsoft to come up with a vision for Windows.next is a process that is surreal! The themes that have been floated truly reflect what people have been looking for years and it will change the way people think about PCs and the way they use them.&#160;It is the future of PCs," the blogger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shipped Windows 7 in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft executive at the Microsoft Global High-Tech Summit 2010 meeting in Santa Clara, Calif. on Thursday was unfamiliar with the blog. "I don't know what the blog entails, but I am certain we're continuously innovating [with] with Windows," said Drew Gude, director of US High Tech amp; Electronics at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Microsoft gives a glimpse of Windows 8," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;This Silicon Alley Insider chart of the day, via Tim O'Reilly, is an attention-grabber. While Microsoft reports operating profit by division in its quarterly SEC filings, the chart does a much better job of telling Microsoft's business story over the past 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the chart was first posted, the date range spanned September 2006 to September 2009. Silicon Alley Insider added the December 2009 data after a comment on the blog post. As a result, the y-axis doesn't actually span the size of Microsoft's roughly $10 billion operating profit in the December 2009 quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Get InfoWorld's 21-page hands-on look at the new version of Windows. | The real-world state of Windows: Check out InfoWorld's live Windows Pulse monitors of users' app preferences and PC configurations. | Looking for the ultimate laptop?

The Eamp;D (Entertainment and Devices) division seems to be oscillating between profitability and loss, with profits being highest ahead of and during the holiday season. However, as a commenter, Se7en, writes on the post:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To which, ex-Wall Street analyst Henry Blodget writes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;E amp; D and Online Services are two important investment areas for the company, made possible by Microsoft's impressive profits in the Office and Windows divisions. While Microsoft has had some success attracting the hearts of users in these market areas, there's a long road ahead before claiming success versus Apple and Google respectively. Frankly, one has to seriously ask if these investments will ever amount to being the profit engine(s) for the company. Of course, Microsoft shouldn't abandon or minimize these investment areas, but it does need to seriously consider whether these divisions stand poised to replace the profits from Office and Windows in the face of open source and cloud-based competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This brings us to the Server and Tools business. With a healthy $1.5 billion in quarterly operating profit and growth over the 3 year analysis window, this division that could potentially offset erosion to the Office and Windows cash cows. Keep in mind that Microsoft's cloud, Windows Azure, recently moved into the Server and Tools division. With the industry emphasis around cloud computing, and Microsoft's success with .Net middleware, Microsoft likely sees its future linked heavily to the growth and profitability of the Server and Tools division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow me on twitter at: SavioRodrigues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PS: I should state: "The postings on this site are my own and don't necessarily represent IBM's positions, strategies or opinions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "The story behind Microsoft's operating profit by division," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Goldman Sachs Group programer was indicted on charges he stole computer code for the investment bank's high-frequency trading platform, federal prosecutors said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former programer, Sergey Aleynikov, 40, was arrested and charged in July. The three-count indictment alleges that Aleynikov, who worked at Goldman from May 2007 to June 2009, illegally transferred and downloaded "hundreds of thousands of lines of source code for Goldman's high-frequency trading system" on his last day at the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, according to the indictment, then uploaded the source code onto a laptop computer that he took with him to a meeting in Chicago with his new employer, Teza Technologies LLC, a high-frequency trading start-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Aleynikov at Newark Liberty International Airport upon his return from Chicago. He was held in custody over the July 4 holiday weekend before posting bail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov's arrest is credited with shining a spotlight on fast-growing business of high-frequency trading, a computer-driven strategy that is said to be responsible for more than half of the daily trading volume in U.S. stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indictment said Goldman's high-frequency platform generates "many millions of dollars in profits per year." Goldman acquired some of the platform in 1999, when it paid $500 million for Hull Trading Co and has since made major improvements to the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indictment specifically charges Aleynikov with one count of theft of trade secrets, one count of transportation of stolen property and one count of unauthorized computer access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In today's information age, a theft of valuable intellectual property represents a serious breach of economic security," Manhattan US Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov's lawyer, Sabrina Shroff, said she and her client were "very disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision to seek an indictment. But she said Aleynikov would be "vindicated" at trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shroff had asked prosecutors to consider a deferred prosecution agreement for her client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one from Teza, a trading firm started by several former Citadel Investment Group traders, was charged in the indictment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If convicted, Aleynikov faces up to 25 years in prison. He is set to be arraigned on the charges on February 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is US v Aleynikov, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 09-mj-01553.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reported by Grant McCool and Matthew Goldstein; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds analyst comments; DVD sale declines; Disney's strength)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Sue Zeidler and Alex Dobuzinskis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) has

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today said it will soon will feed Windows 7 users an update that detects illegal copies installed using more than 70 different activation cracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The update to Windows Activation Technologies (WAT), the anti-piracy software formerly known as Windows Genuine Advantage (WGA), will be posted to Microsoft 's download site on Feb. 17, and offered as an optional upgrade via Windows Update later this month, where it will be tagged as "important."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out the gate, the update will reach Windows 7 Home Premium, Professional, Ultimate and Enterprise users, said Joe Williams, the general manager of Microsoft's activation and anti-counterfeit group. "I'd like to stress that the Update is voluntary, which means that you can choose not to install it when you see it appear on Windows Update," said Williams in an entry to the Genuine Windows blog .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's counter to the practice Microsoft used in 2006, when it force fed Windows XP customers a WGA update by labeling it as a high-priority security update. Several users sued Microsoft over that behavior; the lawsuit was officially dismissed just last week. Since then, the company's anti-piracy software updates have been less aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Williams, the WAT update sniffs out more than 70 "activation exploits," Microsoft's term for what others call "cracks" that sidestep the product activation process, or use stolen keys to illegally activate counterfeit copies of Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the update has been installed, PCs running cracked copies will begin displaying a black background and the usual gamut of nagging notifications that mark the operating system as bogus. "Machines running genuine Windows 7 software with no activation exploits will see nothing," promised Williams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft regularly refreshes its anti-piracy technology to identify new activation exploits -- it did the same two years ago in a Vista crack crack-down -- but the number of exploit "signatures" in the upcoming WAT update is magnitudes larger than any previous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the 70-some cracks shut down by the update are a pair that surfaced last November , just weeks after the launch of Windows 7. At the time, Microsoft said it was aware of the cracks -- "RemoveWAT" and "Chew-WGA" -- and was working on ways to disable them. A Microsoft spokeswoman confirmed today that the WAT update will include signatures for both cracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams also noted that the WAT update will periodically "phone home" to Microsoft's servers to re-validate the copy of Windows 7 as legit, and use those opportunities to update activation signatures to detect newer cracks. Initially, WAT will connect to Microsoft's severs every 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If WAT uncovers tampered, disabled or missing activation or licensing files, the software steps up its activity, and runs a check every week, and if necessary, repairs those files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams argued that the update is intended to keep "customers and partners secure," a rationale the company regularly uses when it explains why anti-piracy software is necessary. He cited studies by IDC and others, which Microsoft has called on in the past, that have said up to a third of counterfeit copies of Windows are infected with malware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A leaked copy of Windows 7 Release Candidate (RC) posted on file-sharing sites in May 2009 was, in fact, infected with a Trojan horse .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Bing search (decision) engine keeps chipping away, that's for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After inheriting an 8 percent market share when it took over for Live Search last May, Bing has been growing little by little every month, reaching 11.3 percent of the U.S. search market in January, according to market researcher comScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's a half a percentage point higher than December's 10.7 percent. This is basically how Bing has been rolling: it takes another small step forward each month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ComScore has Google's market share dipping 0.3 percent in January to 65.4 percent, but the search neighborhood bully has been impervious to Bing's gains, remaining mostly flat over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ For complete coverage on Microsoft's new Windows 7 operating system -- including hands-on reviews, video tutorials and advice on enterprise rollouts -- see CIO.com's Windows 7 Bible. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Bing has unfortunately managed to do is blast friendly fire at pending partner Yahoo. Yahoo's search market share has dropped roughly 3 percent since Bing came on the scene. Like it has nearly every month, Yahoo dipped 0.3 percent in January to 17 percent, according to comScore. As Bing makes small gains, Yahoo makes small drops, keeping their eventual union at the same total market share percentage (just under 30 percent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Bing's steady growth is tainted by the fact that Microsoft's Online Services division continues to lose big money. Microsoft's earnings for 2Q 2010, in which Windows and Office saved the day again, showed that nearly every division was profitable except Online Services, of which Bing is a major part. This division has been losing hundreds of millions of dollars for two years (it reported a $466 million income loss for the last three months of 2009).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So yes, Bing is gaining market share, but Microsoft's search business is not profiting from it because it is spending more money to get these traffic gains through promotions and deals than it gets back from Bing revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's not good. A Silicon Alley Insider story estimates that Microsoft spends $2 billion a year on its online division. The story also cites a line from Microsoft's most recent Form 10Q quarterly SEC filing: "Cost of [online] revenue increased $171 million or 50 percent, primarily driven by higher online traffic acquisition costs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can strongly assume that "online traffic acquisition costs" is Bing, meaning most of that $171 million has been spent on boosting (buying?) Bing traffic. That's in addition to the $100 million Microsoft spent on launching and marketing Bing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Online Services division deep in the red, Bing's incremental market share gains don't mean much. Bing is, for lack of a better word, a money pit, and taking share away from Yahoo and not the real enemy, Google, makes matters worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this expense/revenue disparity keeps up, the Yahoo search partnership will be another bottom line killer for Microsoft rather than a market-share boosting, profit-generating force to be reckoned with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shane O'Neill is a senior writer at CIO.com.

regulator approved on Thursday tycoon Carlos Slim's plan to
consolidate his fixed-line and wireless assets, a major step in
creating a Latin American telecommunications behemoth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Slim launched a $21 billion proposal in January to shift
control of his Mexican fixed-line operator Telmex TELMEXL.MX
TMX.N and regional fixed-line operator Telmex Internacional
TELINTL.MX TII.N into his flagship America Movil (AMXL.MX)
(AMX.N) cellphone company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As competition in Latin American telecommunications
increases, Slim wants to integrate his companies to create a
provider with fixed-line telephone, mobile and Internet
services across Latin America to better challenge rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of America Movil gained 1.44 percent to 28.94 pesos
ahead of the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also on Thursday, the regulator approved a proposal by
media group Televisa (TLVACPO.MX)(TV.N), which dominates
Mexico's television industry and is a growing competitor
against Slim's companies, to acquire up to 40 percent of NII
Holdings' NIHD.O wireless phone operator Nextel Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mexican media have reported that Televisa, which has said
it wants to expand into cellphone services, taking on America
Movil, would look to pay at least $1 billion for a stake in
Nextel Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regulators have struggled for years to reduce the dominance
of Slim's America Movil and Telmex in Mexico's telephone
industry, often battling in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Announcing its ruling, the commission said that, since
Telcel, which is America Movil's Mexican unit, and Telmex are
both controlled by Slim, their financial consolidation would
not change competitive conditions in Mexico's
telecommunications industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The combinations Telmex-Telcel and Televisa-Nextel do not
affect markets or represent a risk to competition," the
regulator said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under Slim's proposal, Telmex, which has about 80 percent
of Mexico's fixed-line market, will be controlled by America
Movil, which has more than 70 percent of the country's wireless
market, but the two companies will remain separate entities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; America Movil plans to absorb Telmex Internacional
completely, with fixed-line and Internet services in Brazil and
other parts of South America, and eventually delist it from the
stock market. Telmex would continue to trade on the stock
market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; America Movil said in a statement it would continue steps
to complete the consolidation, which is subject to regulatory
approval in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The green light from the competition watchdog increases
expectations Slim could soon give details about the savings he
sees from tying up the companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; America Movil has said consolidating the companies would
allow it to take advantage of new technologies, but Slim told
reporters last month the tie-up of his telecommunications
assets will not lead to bundles combining fixed-line and
wireless in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Noel Randewich and Tomas Sarmiento; editing by

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has revised the way it authenticates copies of Windows 7, the company announced Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is adding to Windows 7 a new signature-based approach for checking if an OS is properly licensed. This signature checking will happen in addition to the key-based verification process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new procedures are necessary to thwart the new bypasses to the verification process that have been developed, said Joe Williams, general manager of the worldwide Windows Genuine Advantage program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The counterfeiters have evolved their methods and we've evolved what we do," Williams said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 7 users with automatic updates will have their copies reinspected by the company's new activation process. Those running validly obtained copies of Windows 7 should not notice the check at all, Williams said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first update to the Windows Activation Technologies for Windows 7. Microsoft will post the update on Tuesday and will publish it to Windows Update a week later, as an "important" update for the Windows 7 Ultimate, Enterprise, Professional and Home Premium editions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although any edition of Windows 7 can use the activation, Microsoft won't initially push it out to Windows Starter and Windows Basic, as those two editions aren't pirated that often, Williams said. Nor will it be pushed out to enterprise customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the signatures used by antivirus software, the new signature-based inspection will look for clusters of related changes to the OS that indicate the licensing procedures have been circumnavigated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to Windows 7 and Vista, counterfeiters largely used the OEM product keys for validating multiple copies or reverse engineered the algorithm for generating keys. Since then, Microsoft has stopped issuing product keys to license multiple copies and has improved the key-generation algorithm, Williams said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, counterfeiters have moved on to other techniques, many of which involve tricking Windows 7 into thinking it is a preactivated, preinstalled OEM copy. This approach could involve changing registry entries, key settings, the core licenses, and/or information on the boot sector. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which purchases or obtains pirated copies of the OS to pick apart how the counterfeiters thwart the key registrations, has created about 70 different signatures thus far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the user, the process of re-validating Windows 7 should be painless, Williams promised. For those with automatic updates, the program will be downloaded, installed and run automatically. Those who selected to install windows updates manually will have to download the program manually. Once the update is installed, it will look for known activation hacks. If none are found, it will go dormant for 90 days, wake up, check Microsoft for new signatures, and run a scan again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the software does find the characteristics of a hacked copy of Windows, it will then place the OS in the unactivated mode, which means the desktop wallpaper will be changed to black, and various pop-ups and tray messages will persistently remind the user of the OS' unverified state. No functionality will be hindered, Williams said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about the chances of false positives -- where the computer is identified as hacked, but in reality, it has a genuine key but has been reconfigured in such a way that it matches a signature? Williams said the chances of this happening are "very low," due to the fact that the signatures all require multiple actions. "We would not switch the system to nongeniune unless all the other aspects of the exploit were present," Williams said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Windows 7 users may be wary of re-scrutinizing their copies of the OS under the chance, however slim in Williams' estimation, that their genuine verification will be revoked. Williams offered a few reasons why to reverify anyway. People might have purchased their machines from, what Williams said, were "nefarious resellers" who used pirated copies of Windows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the copies were pirated, perhaps from the Internet, these copies may be embedded with malicious code, such as with viruses, Trojan horses or keyloggers. Williams pointed to a study conducted by Media Surveillance that found that 32 percent of illegally downloaded copies of Windows contained malicious code. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, hacked copies of Windows can be unstable. An activation hack of Windows Vista that involved spoofing the grace timer caused more than a million system crashes, according to a compilation of report crashes that came in through Microsoft's Watson error-collection tool, Williams said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Goldman Sachs Group programer was indicted on charges he stole computer code for the investment bank's high-frequency trading platform, federal prosecutors said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former programer, Sergey Aleynikov, 40, was arrested and charged in July. The three-count indictment alleges that Aleynikov, who worked at Goldman from May 2007 to June 2009, illegally transferred and downloaded "hundreds of thousands of lines of source code for Goldman's high-frequency trading system" on his last day at the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, according to the indictment, then uploaded the source code onto a laptop computer that he took with him to a meeting in Chicago with his new employer, Teza Technologies LLC, a high-frequency trading start-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Aleynikov at Newark Liberty International Airport upon his return from Chicago. He was held in custody over the July 4 holiday weekend before posting bail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov's arrest is credited with shining a spotlight on fast-growing business of high-frequency trading, a computer-driven strategy that is said to be responsible for more than half of the daily trading volume in U.S. stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indictment said Goldman's high-frequency platform generates "many millions of dollars in profits per year." Goldman acquired some of the platform in 1999, when it paid $500 million for Hull Trading Co and has since made major improvements to the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indictment specifically charges Aleynikov with one count of theft of trade secrets, one count of transportation of stolen property and one count of unauthorized computer access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In today's information age, a theft of valuable intellectual property represents a serious breach of economic security," Manhattan US Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov's lawyer, Sabrina Shroff, said she and her client were "very disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision to seek an indictment. But she said Aleynikov would be "vindicated" at trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shroff had asked prosecutors to consider a deferred prosecution agreement for her client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one from Teza, a trading firm started by several former Citadel Investment Group traders, was charged in the indictment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If convicted, Aleynikov faces up to 25 years in prison. He is set to be arraigned on the charges on February 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is US v Aleynikov, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 09-mj-01553.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reported by Grant McCool and Matthew Goldstein; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

for exceptions and not an overall change in policy.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Troubling Trade Deficit

The trade deficit from oil is a particularly thorny problem. When the dollar
declines, the price of oil tends to increase. After all, just because the dollar
is strong is no reason for the price of oil the Japanese import to fall in Yen
terms, or for the price of oil that the Germans import to fall in Euro terms. 

The dollar declined sharply relative to other major currencies during the first
half of the decade, as shown in the third graph. That decline made our exports
relatively more competitive, and our imports more expensive, which was a major
force in turning around our non-oil deficit. 

Some of the improvement came from companies like Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) being
able to sell more heavy equipment abroad, but also some of it came from domestic
buyers discovering that Caterpillar`s products were priced more competitively
than similar equipment from Kubota (NYSE: KUB). 

While I strongly feel that a weaker dollar is a good thing for the U.S economy
at this point, it alone will not be sufficient to solve the trade deficit
problem. It can help greatly on the non-oil side, but it is unlikely to do
anything on the oil side. To solve that problem, we have to shift over to
non-oil energy sources. 

At one point, the U.S. had very large reserves of oil (people forget that for
decades the U.S. was the world`s largest oil exporter). That oil has already
been burned. There is no way we can drill our way out of the problem. No new
drilling is going to result in a significant increase in domestic oil production
-- it can't. 

Most oil is used for transportation, so coal is not a very useful alternative.
However, it is technically very feasible to shift to the use of natural gas as a
transportation fuel, particularly for fleets that return to a home base each
night, for example city buses. We have very abundant and growing supplies of
natural gas thanks to the emerging shale plays. 

I think that we will eventually move in this direction. That would be very good
news for the more gas-oriented exploration and production companies like EnCana
(NYSE: ECA). I suspect that is also a very big part of the reason that Exxon
(NYSE: XOM) is buying XTO Energy (NYSE: XTO).

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Honda Joins Recall Parade

Following top automaker Toyota Motor Corp.'s (NYSE: TM) foray into massive
automotive safety recalls, Honda Motor Co. (NYSE: HMC), Japan's second biggest
automaker, is heading down a similar road. Honda has recalled 437,000 vehicles
on top of a recall of 514,200 vehicles last year due to a problem related to air
bag inflators. The additional recall includes 378,000 cars in the U.S., about
41,000 cars in Canada and 17,000 cars in Japan, Australia and elsewhere in Asia.


The recall -- about 952,000 vehicles in total -- includes 2001 and 2002 year
models of Accord, Civic, Odyssey, CR-V, Pilot, Acura TL and Acura CL vehicles in
the U.S., as well as the Inspire, Saber and Lagreat models in Japan. All the
vehicles are manufactured at Honda's U.S. and Canadian plants. 

Honda originally announced the recall in November 2008, involving 4,200 vehicles
of 2001 Accord and Civic sedans in the U.S. The recall was expanded in July 2009
to 514,200 vehicles globally, including the 2001 and 2002 Accord and Civic as
well as 2002 Acura TL sedans. 

Honda officials stated that the air bag inflator deploys with too much pressure,
causing the inflator to rupture and injure or kill the driver. The company has
noticed 12 incidents in the U.S., including 11 injuries and one death, and no
accidents elsewhere linked to the problem until July 2009. 

The airbags are manufactured by the U.S. unit of Japan's Takata Corp, which was
not aware of any defect in their airbags supplied to other automakers. An
ongoing investigation has revealed that the defect was caused by insufficient
stamping pressure during the production of the inflator propellant and not by
the propellant's excessive moisture intake, as previously believed. 

Automotive safety recalls are regular issues with major automakers. Last month,
Honda announced a global recall of about 646,000 cars for a fault with a window
switch. Last year, Ford Motor (NYSE: F) completed a series of recalls affecting
14 million vehicles due to a faulty cruise control deactivation switch. However,
the recent recalls have been highly focused, denting the image of automakers
like Toyota. 

Disney Beats Zacks Estimate

The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS), a diversified entertainment company,
recently reported better-than-expected first-quarter 2010 results on the heels
of strong results from its Media Networks segment, and effective cost management
at its film studio. 

The quarterly earnings of 47 cents a share outdid the Zacks Consensus Estimate
of 39 cents, and jumped 15% from 41 cents delivered in the prior-year quarter.
On a reported basis, including one-time items, earnings came in at 44 cents,
down 2% from 45 cents posted in the year-ago quarter. In terms of earnings
surprises, Disney outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 21% in the
quarter and by 12% in fourth-quarter 2009. 

Although double-digit growth was registered in the bottom-line due to a
sustained focus on controlling costs, the top-line remains under pressure,
experiencing a slight uptick of 1% year-over-year to $9,739 million. 

CTIC Drug Approval Delayed

The wait for the approval of Cell Therapeutics` (Nasdaq: CTIC) drug, Pixuvri
(pixantrone) is far from over. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) announced that the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting, scheduled
for Feb 10, has been postponed due to bad weather conditions in the Washington
region. 

Cell Therapeutics is seeking FDA approval of Pixuvri for the treatment of
relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin`s Lymphoma (NHL) in patients who
have not responded to other treatment options. The FDA usually follows panel
recommendations to decide on the approvability of a particular drug. A final
decision on Pixuvri would be taken by April 23. 

The postponement of the FDA`s committee meeting is not the end of problems at
Cell Therapeutics. In an analysis for the committee, the FDA reviewers have
raised various issues related to the study design. The study that opened in June
2004 sought to enroll 320 patients. However, the enrollment was challenging and
was stopped in March 2008 after enrolling 140 patients, less than half the
original plan.

&lt;p&gt;Big Blue wants a piece of high-flying Apple, as well as a slice of the social networking craze. As Macworld Expo gets underway in San Francisco today, IBM unveiled enterprise-class social software for the iPhone and Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the support side, IBM has also joined the Enterprise Desktop Alliance, a group of software vendors who've bandied together to deploy and manage Macs in the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM is endorsing the notion that Apple is ready for business," says Ed Brill, director of product management for Lotus Notes. "The Mac and the iPhone platforms are maturing to the mainstream part of the corporate environment. It's no longer just marketing and the CEO who have Macs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Apple engineers describe three nightmares when managing Macs in the enterprise, reports CIO.com. | A survey shows IT managers facing Mac-Windows challenges, as well as woeful enterprise Mac support, and then there's the cost factor. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest version of IBM's office productivity suite, Lotus Symphony 3.0 beta, is now available on both Windows and Mac. Enterprise customers can also leverage IBM's social software products like Lotus Connections and Lotus Quickr for blogs, wikis and collaboration on the Mac or iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not treating this as a porting effort but as a first-class piece of our equation to go across the spectrum of Apple devices," Brill says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, IBM delivered an iPhone app called Lotus Notes Travel Companion for secure enterprise email. Meanwhile, IBM customers such as Colgate-Palmolive, Union-Pacific Railroad, HSBC, United Nations, among others, have already deployed Lotus Social Software for "harnessing the wisdom of the crowds," IBM claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not simply a case of IBM wanting to hang with the cool crowd, either. Lotus Notes integrator iEnterprises, which also helps enterprises securely mobilize Lotus Notes and other enterprise apps, has heard customers asking for iPhone support. Recently, iEnterprises launched five iPhone apps on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today, about a third of our mobile customers use an iPhone component," says John Carini, CEO of iEnterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, enterprises took a cautious approach with social networking and Apple products. Many decided not to support iPhones. "Psychologically, enterprises don't want to deploy apps through the App Store," Carini says. "But social networking, Macs and iPhones have reached critical mass, and now everyone is noticing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Kaneshige is a senior writer for CIO.com in Silicon Valley.

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, ONTARIO, Feb 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Honourable Vic Toews, Minister of Public Safety, made the following
statement today in response to news that CBSA and RCMP officers from the
National Ports Enforcement Team at the Port of Halifax, seized over 200
kilos of cocaine. 

    "I would like to congratulate CBSA and the RCMP on the outstanding
efforts that led to this seizure," said Minister Toews. "Through their
partnership and coordinated efforts, these law enforcement agencies have
once again taken action to keep our communities safe."

    Our Government established the National Anti-Drug Strategy and invested
$102 million over five years to help law enforcement to combat the
production and distribution of illegal drugs.

    Other measures to combat organized crime, gangs, illegal guns and drugs
include:


--  $400 million over five years for a Police Officer Recruitment Fund; 
--  The recruitment of over 1,500 new RCMP; 
--  Support for programs to prevent youth from joining gangs; and, 
--  New legislation to increase penalties for gang and organized crime
    related violence as well as mandatory prison sentences for serious gun
    crimes. 


    The Government's message is clear - the production, trafficking and
distribution of illegal drugs in our communities will not be tolerated.
We are committed to giving law enforcement the tools they need to keep
our communities safe."

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
SPSS, an IBM (NYSE: IBM) Company, today announced that banks worldwide are
adopting IBM&#174; SPSS&#174; predictive analytics software to mitigate risk and grow
their business through more focused direct marketing campaigns and retention
strategies. 

As part of today's news, banks such as First Tennessee, Rabobank Nederland and
S Bank, have integrated IBM SPSS predictive analytics into the entire
marketing process to better align with their most valuable customers and gain
deep understanding of client behavior. 

As a result, these banks have seen significant improvements in their marketing
campaigns and overall business performance. For example, First Tennessee Bank
increased its return on investment on cross-sell campaigns by 600 percent in six
months. Rabobank Nederland, a part of a consortium of banks with more than 1,000
branch offices across 43 countries, was able to increase its close rate by as
much as 20 percent by targeting the right clients in cross-sell and up-sell
initiatives. 

One of the biggest challenges in the banking industry is the ability to target
the right customer at the right time. Adopting successful strategies and
applying analytics to mitigate risk is bringing a new level of efficiencies in
commercial banks. All successful customer campaigns depend on precise, timely
targeting that deliver compelling offers to prospects and keep costs low. 

By elevating direct marketing efforts using IBM SPSS predictive analytics to
target the right customers at the right time and through the right communication
channel, banks are able to improve satisfaction levels, increase brand awareness
and capture those customers most likely to respond and become profitable
clients. 

First Tennessee Bank Gains Deep Understanding of Customer Behavior

Effective customer segmentation processes are critical for banks. Many realize
the most valuable customer segments account for the overwhelming majority of
total customer profitability, while numerous other segments not only contribute
very little profit, but may represent a loss. 

First Tennessee Bank, a Memphis, Tenn.-based subsidiary of First Horizon
National Corp. and among the nation`s top 50 bank holding companies with more
than $20 billion in assets, has turned to IBM SPSS predictive analytics to
increase the overall return on investment on its cross-sell campaigns by more
than 600 percent in six months. 

Historically, First Tennessee had a one-dimensional approach to pushing siloed
products and wanted to create a customer relationship-based approach. The
organization sought to predict which marketing programs and campaigns could
generate the highest response - helping avoid investing budget spend on the
wrong customer targets. Using IBM SPSS predictive analytics, the organization
builds propensity models that identify its highest performing customer segments
and creates monthly marketing campaigns around them, leading to decreased costs
of their direct response campaigns. 

Tanner Mueller, database marketing team managerat First Tennessee Bank, said,
"IBM SPSS predictive analytics is enabling First Tennessee Bank to gain an
unprecedented level of insight from our data, making our marketing campaigns
more efficient, and improving our returns and the way we reach clients." 

Rabobank Nederland Focuses Marketing Efforts on the Most Profitable Customers

IBM SPSS predictive analytics helps banks focus marketing programs on the
prospects most likely to respond to new products or services. It minimizes costs
by predicting which marketing programs will generate the highest responses by
not spending marketing budgets on the wrong targets. 

Rabobank Nederland, strengthening its position as a market leader by expanding
relationships with private and corporate customers, is deploying IBM SPSS
predictive analytics to generate qualified leads and higher marketing returns
through improved campaigns. 

Now, Rabobank is better supporting the local branches in effective cross-sell,
up-sell and deep-sell initiatives. Applying predictive analytics to understand
client behavior and future buying patterns for potential sales, Rabobank is now
able to prioritize its customer leads across all channels. As a result, it has
been able to increase the close rate from the range of 2 to 4 percent, to 12 to
20 percent, which means it is moving more customer opportunities into the sales
pipeline. 

Paul Groenland, manager of the marketing intelligence department at Rabobank,
said, "Whereas many financial institutions are struggling in today`s difficult
economic environment, Rabobank has become even more successful. This success is
based on our co-operative structure, increased customer focus, organizational
commitment to CRM and investments in supporting technology, such as IBM SPSS
predictive analytics software, which deliver true ROI." 

S Bank Enhances Relationships and Improves Customer Satisfaction

S Bank, headquartered in Indiana, Pa., with assets of $4.2 billion in 2009,
uses IBM SPSS predictive analytics to improve its direct marketing efforts for
customer acquisition campaigns. With an intuitive and strategic approach for
customer segmentation in its marketing campaigns, S Bank has created better
response rates and reduced marketing spend by sending less unwanted direct mail
to customers. 

Prior to IBM SPSS predictive analytics, S Bank was manually creating queries
that were extremely time consuming. Now, S Bank is able to send specific and
targeted email and mail product offerings on checking, home equity loans,
deposits and ancillary services to those customers most likely to respond. This
approach has reduced marketing spend as costs of campaigns are lowered. 

Rob Jorgenson, senior vice president of marketing at S Bank, said, "In this
market, now is the perfect time for our organization to approach new customers
and use direct marketing campaigns to emphasize our approach to relationship
banking. IBM SPSS predictive analytics enables our organization to identify
customer needs, send targeted and focused campaigns and amplify our overall
approach to customer marketing."

&lt;p&gt;   * Deal centres on port of Valencia-sources&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Slowed down by concerns over port sector-sources&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * ACS shares close down 1.2 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Adds more detail in second paragraph, share price)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MADRID/AMSTERDAM, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Spanish group ACS
(ACS.MC) is close to selling the Spanish port business of its
subsidiary Dragados SPL to a JPMorgan (JPM.N) infrastructure
fund, though concerns about the port sector are hampering the
deal, sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ports are seen as among the most vulnerable infrastructure
assets in an economic downturn, with the recent crisis prompting
many shipping lines to cut freight rates and capacity, even as
the global economy starts to improve. [ID:nLB221630]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ACS is negotiating the sale of ports that account for about
90 to 95 percent of the earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of the Spanish business
of Dragados SPL, three people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asked if there were plans to sell the Spanish port business
of Dragados to JPMorgan, an ACS spokesman declined to comment. A
JPMorgan spokeswoman also declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ACS shares closed down 1.24 percent at 32.7 euros, slightly
outperforming the DJ European Construction and Materials Index
.SXOE, which closed down 1.65 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EYES ON VALENCIA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although Dragados's Spanish port division includes several
ports, including those of Bilbao, Malaga and Las Palmas, the
sources said that a key asset in the portfolio was the port of
Valencia, which had revenue of 114.3 million euros in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan is seeking around 200 million euros from banks,
mainly to recapitalise the port of Valencia, but progress in
securing financing has been impeded by fears over the state of
world trade and cargo overcapacity in Spain, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The enterprise value of the assets is not clear. When ACS
first launched the sale, more than a year ago, media reports
suggested Dragados SPL could fetch up to 1.4 billion euros, but
then JPMorgan started looking only at some of the assets.
[ID:nGEE5B61DS]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ACS has been looking at selling port assets across the globe
as it seeks to cut down on its net debt, which stood at 9.3
billion euros as of Sept. 30. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In December it sold a 24 percent stake in an Indian
container terminal to Gammon Infrastructure (GAIN.BO).

&lt;p&gt;IBM announced an enterprise -class network attached storage (NAS) array today that is capable of scaling to 14 petabytes under a single name space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The array, called SONAS (Scale Out Network Attached Storage), is targeted at mid- and large-size enterprises. The rack-sized array is built in part on hardware and software developed for IBM's supercomputing systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said the system can offer enterprises access to billions of files in support of cloud computing architectures. "IBM SONAS addresses one of the key promises of Cloud computing, which is to provide access to information anywhere at any time," the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SONAS will allow an organization to snap-in resources seamlessly as information requirements increase, but it also provides the capability to scan up to a billion files of data in a matter a matter of minutes," the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terri McClure, an analyst with market research firm Enterprise Strategy Group, said there has been continued interest in commodity-based scale-out platforms in the data center that is driven by the long-term aftershocks of the economic slowdown .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McClure compared SONAS with Hewlett Packard's X9720 clustered file system , as well as clustered NAS systems from Isilon Systems Inc. and Panasas Inc .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clustered storage systems provide massive throughput because of an increased port count that comes from cobbling many storage servers together into a single pool of disks and processors, all working on a similar task and all able to share the same data through a single global name space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Dell said it had placed a bid to purchase clustered NAS vendor Exanet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Scale-out architectures bring a lot of operational efficiency to the table," McClure said. "With 2009 spending slowing to a near stop, scale-out interest mostly stayed just that: interest. In 2010, ESG expects that interest to translate into actual spending, aided by increased visibility from big-name vendors like EMC , HDS, HP , IBM, and NetApp as they continue to invest in scale-out offerings and validate commodity-based scale-out architectures for enterprise applications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Hill, an analyst with industry research firm the Mesabi Group, said in a research note that "IBM saw the need for a higher-end solution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In IBM's view, classical NAS is general purpose file storage that only allows capacity expansion behind one or two node clusters, making it most appropriate for the small to midrange market. Scalable NAS is the next step up," Hill said. "While it uses a single namespace to view all files, scalable NAS may well support limited node clustering for performance and capacity expansion, though its scaling is not necessarily linear or independent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said its SONAS array offers automated data tiering, meaning data can migrate between different disk drive types for higher or lower levels of performance based on preset policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every day, the equivalent of eight-times the information that exists in all US libraries combined is created," Doug Balog, vice president of disk systems for IBM, said in a statement. "Companies not only need to cost-effectively store that data, but they need to rapidly locate it and provide ubiquitous access to it instantly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said its policy-driven automation software for storage management can achieve increased utilization rates in file management systems, allowing a company to pre-define where data is placed, when it is created, where and when it moves to in the storage hierarchy, where it's copied for disaster recovery, and when it will be eventually deleted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also said SONAS should reduce operational costs by consolidating hardware to reduce capital costs. "It also minimizes ongoing administration and headcount costs and decreases operational expenditures by streamlining and simplifying the administration, backup, application and access to data," IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucas Mearian covers storage, disaster recovery and business continuity, financial services infrastructure and health care IT for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;This was not a banner week for Microsoft darling Windows 7. The new OS has been cruising along with solid buzz and record sales to back it up, but user complaints on two fronts - misreported battery life and a stability update causing disruptions - provided a reality check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was quick to refute that these were major issues (which was, in turn, refuted by users), but the strong negativity from the user community was a first for Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also delivered a security update on Tuesday with a record 13 security updates patching dozens of vulnerabilities in Windows. Unfortunately, a side effect of the giant patch was that some Windows XP machines were crippled with the notorious BSOD (blue screen of death), according user complaints on Microsoft's support forum.

&lt;p&gt;Speculation is mounting that Microsoft will show off the Windows Mobile 7 operating system at a wireless industry conference in Barcelona next week. Customers have waited through a series of delays and setbacks, but if those predictions turn out to be true, it could help to generate some renewed excitement over the waning mobile platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows Mobile 7 platform is rumored to have an interface based in large part on the Zune HD which has received a fair amount of praise. There are also rumors that Microsoft is forking its business mobile platform and its consumer offering with the addition of a platform based more on social networking and aimed at a teen audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did develop an interim mobile platform--Windows Mobile 6.5-- to add some incremental improvements over Windows Mobile 6, but compared with platforms like Android and iPhone, Windows Mobile is lacking and Microsoft has seen its lack of progress reflected in declining market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Microsoft is still in third place for smartphone platforms in the United States. It is behind RIM and Apple, but at 18 percent of the market it is solidly ahead of Palm and Google. It has dropped out of second place, and lost a percent of market share over the last quarter, but if any of the other platforms (with the possible exception of the iPhone) were to experience the delays and setbacks that Microsoft has encountered, the market share drop would be much more dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relatively small decline in market share for Windows Mobile can be attributed in large part to attrition and impatience. As business professionals lose or break older Windows Mobile devices, or contracts expire and they switch wireless providers, they are forced to choose a new smartphone and the current Windows Mobile does not offer a very compelling platform compared with iPhone and Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I personally represent that group. I held out as long as I could--even falling back on an older feature phone for months--waiting patiently for a new Windows Mobile. I didn't find Windows Mobile 6.5 to be enough of an incentive, but I needed a smartphone and couldn't continue holding out for Windows Mobile 7. So, now I have an iPhone...for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact is, barring an announcement that it is simply throwing in the towel and giving up on the mobile operating system altogether, Microsoft still has an audience anxiously waiting to see what it will deliver. Even in third place, Microsoft is easily within striking distance to reclaim second place from Apple, and it could pose a challenge even to RIM's BlackBerry dominance if Windows Mobile 7 can live up to expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft has struggled with its mobile operating system, it still occupies a dominant stake of the server operating system, desktop operating system, business productivity software, messaging, and Web browser markets. Bells and whistles aside, it's hard to argue with the potential of a smartphone platform that can seamlessly tie in with the platforms and tools that businesses rely on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RIM, Apple, Palm, and now Google, all recognize and respect Microsoft's presence in the enterprise. These other mobile platforms realize that integration with Microsoft backend tools--particularly Exchange Server--is imperative to success in the enterprise. No matter how hard they try, though, the solutions are often clumsy or cumbersome, and have a sort of "square peg in the round hole" feel to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core appeal of a Microsoft mobile operating system is the inclusion of native tools that naturally integrate with the existing server, desktop, and office productivity environment. Windows Mobile is uniquely suited to deliver a seamless and familiar experience for business professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expecting Microsoft to introduce unique innovations or raise the bar in any way for mobile operating systems is probably a recipe for disappointment. Assuming that Microsoft can at least improve Windows Mobile to the point that Windows Phones are more or less on par with next-generation smartphones like the iPhone or Droid will be enough, though, for Microsoft to get the ship pointed in the right direction and begin to reclaim some of its lost mobile platform market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has a built-in audience and the game is Microsoft's to lose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tony Bradley is co-author of Unified Communications for Dummies .

&lt;p&gt;The Internet advocate who blasted Microsoft in 2006 over the daily "phone home" habits of its anti-piracy software took the company to task again today for a new practice that will examine consumers' Windows 7 PCs every 90 days to make sure they're running legitimate copies of the OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauren Weinstein, the co-founder of People For Internet Responsibility (PFIR), urged Windows 7 users not to accept the option update to Windows Activation Technologies (WAT) when Microsoft begins seeding it to the Windows Update service later this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The approach that Microsoft is now taking doesn't seem to make sense, even for honest consumers," Weinstein argued in a post to his blog . "Microsoft will trigger forced downgrading to non-genuine status if they believe a Windows 7 system is potentially pirated based on their 'phone home' checks that will occur at (for now) 90 day intervals during the entire life of Windows 7 on a given PC, even months or years after purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Microsoft announced the WAT update would identify pirated copies of Windows 7 that had been illegally activated using any of more than 70 "cracks," or activation exploits. After users install the update, the WAT software will regularly connect with Microsoft's servers -- the "phone home" functionality that Weinstein called out -- to download new crack "signatures," which would then be used to reevaluate the copy of Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The repeated validation is new to Windows, confirmed Joe Williams, the general manager of Microsoft's Genuine Windows group, who said that neither Windows XP or Vista had reevaluated already-activated Windows PCs on a regular schedule. Machines that had had significant hardware component replacements were the exception: Swapping out a motherboard, for instance, would typically trigger another activation validation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams defended the change. "We want to make sure we're protecting our customers," he said, against newly-developed activation cracks that may have slipped by Microsoft, or simply not been in use, when the PC was originally activated. "And we're a commercial enterprise , and it is important that our [intellectual property] is protected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weinstein countered that Microsoft was overstepping its bounds by demanding validations in perpetuity. "Say you've used your system for a year. Is it reasonable for Microsoft to say, 'We changed our mind and now you're not genuine'?" asked Weinstein in an interview today. "It's one thing to validate when you originally get the system, but to do that months or years later, and [for] Microsoft [to] say, 'Now we're going to say your Windows is not genuine,' ...it becomes a matter of ownership. At what point is one free of this constant checking?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weinstein called the new Microsoft WAT update an "unacceptable intrusion" and more. "For Microsoft to assert that they have the right to treat ordinary PC-using consumers in this manner, declaring their systems to be non-genuine and downgrading them at any time, is rather staggering," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recommended that users reject the download of the WAT update. To do that, users may have to reset Windows Update so that it does not automatically download and install every update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Williams suggested the same if users don't want Microsoft re-validating Windows. "We're pretty insistent that this is a voluntary update," he said. "And any customers who don't want WAT can uninstall the update after it's installed." The uninstall option is new for Microsoft's anti-piracy software; in the past, once installed, it could not be removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weinstein may be best known to Windows users for uncovering the secret "phone home" characteristics of WAT's predecessor, Windows Genuine Advantage (WGA), when Microsoft launched an update in June 2006. The hue and cry over the feature drove Microsoft to first deny Weinstein's charge that WGA was spyware , then to retreat from the constant communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Williams argued that the WAT update was not similar to the 2006 incident. "This is different," he said. "Why we took grief then was because of a lack of disclosure, not the functionality of the feature."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weinstein disagreed, saying that it was the feature itself that was objectionable. "The approach represented by this kind of escalation, into what basically amounts to a perpetual anti-piracy surveillance regime embedded within already-purchased consumer equipment, is entirely unacceptable," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has not announced a date when it will begin issuing the WAT update via Windows Update -- only that it will happen this month -- but has said it will post the update on its manual download site Feb. 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is working on a patch to fix a problem causing crashes &#160;in the upcoming Visual Studio 2010 IDE, Microsoft reports said this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue involves the IntelliSense coding feature in the Visual Studio 2010 Release Candidate (RC) that shipped this past Monday. IntelliSense has offered such capabilities as completion of typing and performing searches on language elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Want to cash in on your IT experiences?

A patch is to scheduled to be released next week to fix the issue and prevent it from reoccurring, Guthrie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only machines running the RC and an application or device using UI Automation 3.0 APIs are impacted. "This includes but may not be limited to RC users who are using screen reader software, multi-touch drivers, or tablet PCs," said Brittany Behrens, program manager on the Visual Studio Editor team, in the Visual Studio Blog.&#160;"Furthermore, the issue applies most commonly to customers using UIA on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008; impact on prior operating systems should be minimal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workarounds include not using UIA on the same machine running the RC.&#160; "This could include not running a screen reader, uninstalling multi-touch drivers, or disabling the touch features on a tablet PC," Behrens said.&#160;"On tablet PCs, this may mean disabling the tablet service (these instructions worked for our tablets, but please note that this link goes to a third-party site that is not supported or maintained by Microsoft).&#160; However, we recognize that this is not an option for all users."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users also could modify their registry. But this could produce the side effect of seeing an unhandled exception dialog the first time the bug is hit in a given Visual Studio session, she said. Also, every subsequent time the bug is hit, Visual Studio 2010 will catch and suppress the exception instead of crashing, but the caret will stop blinking and the editor will not accept input until the developer clicks on it again to restore focus, said Behrens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fix for the bug already has been checked in for the Visual Studio 2010 release-to-manufacturing release, said Behrens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Featuring capabilities for developing SharePoint, Windows Azure and Windows 7 applications, Visual Studio 2010 is due to be launched April 12.

&lt;p&gt;SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (Reuters) - Costa Rican police seized around a ton of cocaine and arrested two suspected Mexican traffickers on Friday in the latest sign Mexican gangs are stepping up their use of the country as a storage point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Police found 2,139 pounds (969 kg) of cocaine stashed at a rural house near the Pacific coast northwest of San Jose, and arrested two Mexican nationals at the scene. They are believed to be members of Mexico's Juarez cartel, the public security ministry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President-elect Laura Chinchilla, a former security minister who won a landslide election victory on Sunday, has said combating Mexican drug gangs operating in Costa Rica will be a priority when she takes power in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A three-year army crackdown on drug gangs in Mexico has encouraged some traffickers to push south into Central America, setting up bases in countries like Guatemala as they seek new routes to smuggle South American cocaine to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Costa Rican authorities have seized 93 ton of cocaine between 2006 and 2009 -- nearly twice the amount the country captured in the preceding decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Costa Rica is known for being an oasis of stability, high living standards and low crime in a region scarred by Cold War-era civil wars and plagued by violent street gangs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it also sits halfway between the cocaine-producing Andes and Mexico, whose smuggling gangs earn some $40 billion a year smuggling the drug north using planes, boats and trucks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police raided the house in Costa Rica early on Friday following a tip-off from neighbors, the ministry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two suspects are from the northern Mexican border city of Ciudad Juarez, one of the world's most violent spots. One had a press credential from a Mexican newspaper, the ministry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Leslie Josephs; editing by Mohammad Zargham)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long war between Microsoft and Macintosh is almost over. It will end when Microsoft ships Office for Mac 2011, the release that ends Redmond's decade-long attack on Apple computers in business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Office 2011, due before the holidays, replaces the much-despised Entourage e-mail client and information manager with a real version of Microsoft Outlook created for Macintosh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When that happens, Mac users become full participants on their companies' Exchange-based e-mail systems. End of the Mac as a second-class corporate citizen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft could have done this previously, but used Entourage to create a barrier between Mac users and Exchange. Given the issue persisted for a decade, the incompatibility must be considered intentional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This nonsense went on much too long and Microsoft still deserves roasting for having pulled such a stunt in the first place. So, no congratulations from me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entourage appeared in 2000, replacing the previous Outlook Express that shipped with Office 98. Asked why they didn't just offer a new Mac version of Outlook, Microsoft replied that Entourage was intended for a different audience than Outlook served.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That "new audience" being Mac users who didn't need to connect to Exchange, which left out a huge number of potential Windows-to-Mac converts over the decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intentionally crippled as a client for Exchange servers, Entourage was a sure way of keeping Macs from expanding their presence in businesses large enough to use Exchange and Outlook. (Wikipedia does a good job of explaining this history).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incompatibilities diminished somewhat over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until 2003, Entourage could not connect to an Exchange server at all. Today, server-side rules are still not supported, nor is synchronization of tasks and notes. Entourage also relies upon its own user interface, which is quite unlike Outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critically, Entourage cannot import Outlook post office (.PST) files created on a Windows machine, making it impossible to easily move a user's messages from Windows to Macintosh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office 2011, being discussed this week at Macworld Expo in San Francisco, deals with these issues, finally giving Macs status as first-class participants in companies using Exchange e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to learn more about Office 2011--which looks quite nice and brings Mac users closer to the Windows Office experience--let me refer you to Dan Miller's story from Macworld and a podcast interview with Eric Wilfrid, the general manager of Microsoft's Mac Business Unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nowadays, compatibility means more than just file formats," Microsoft's Kurt Schmucker told Miller. "It's also workflow, collaboration, and user interface."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays? Compatibility always meant workflow, collaboration, user interface, and feature set--another area where Office 2011 is described as more like a Windows version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a decade of crippling the Mac as a business computer, Microsoft is now embracing it. Or at least has decided there are enough Windows and Office users who also use Macs to make improved compatibility something now in Microsoft's best interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Coursey has been writing about technology products and companies for more than 25 years.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - American International Group Inc (AIG.N) turned down JPMorgan's (JPM.N) attempts to get in on the estimated $10 billion Hong Kong IPO of its Asian life insurance unit, sources involved with the deal said on Friday, in a snub partly stemming from soured relations dating back to the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the only major investment bank omitted from a long list of underwriters for the IPO of American International Assurance (AIA), the U.S. insurer's Asian arm once labeled by former CEO Maurice Hank Greenberg as the group's 'crown jewel'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IPO, among the biggest slated for Asia this year, could produce more than $300 million in fees to those involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIG, bailed out by the U.S. government during the global financial crisis, has chosen Citigroup (C.N), Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX), Goldman Sachs (GS.N), BofA Merrill Lynch (BAC.N), UBS (UBSN.VX), CCB International and ICBC International to underwrite the IPO, sources involved in the offering said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When that list was circulated -- and no underwriting list is final until the prospectus is printed -- the sources assumed there was a lingering contractual reason behind JPMorgan's absence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and private equity giant Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) acted as advisers to AIG throughout its restructuring. While Blackstone has kept that role, JPMorgan and AIG parted ways last year on a sour note, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, did not pin down the exact reason for the falling out between AIG and the U.S. bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The relationship is not here, which explains why the bank has not been mandated on AIA's IPO," said one of the sources, who like the others interviewed for this article, declined to be named due to the issue's sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIG struggled with parts of its restructuring last year, putting some assets up for sale, taking them off the market, and then putting them back up for sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources said on Friday that JPMorgan wasn't actually tied to its previous relationship with AIG, and had pitched hard to get on to the AIA IPO, thinking bygones were bygones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But old grudges appear to have been at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you go down the road of including everyone, either you do or you don't," said one of the sources involved in the IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a politically charged IPO," said the source, referring to the U.S. government involvement in AIG's bailout and all the advisers and politicians who became part of that difficult process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So, within that context, it's not an accident," that JPMorgan was left off the AIA IPO, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and AIA declined to comment on why the bank was left off the underwriting list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIG had already selected Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) as joint global coordinators for the offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Paritosh Bansal in NEW YORK; Editing by Ian Geoghegan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI &amp; BARCELONA--(Business Wire)--
Convergys Corporation (NYSE: CVG): 

Launching Convergys Smart Communications Suite powered by Microsoft, the first
pre-integrated and pre-configured billing and customer care platform to rapidly
deploy and launch new and exciting business and consumer services

CINCINNATI &amp; BARCELONA; Mobile World Congress -- Convergys Corporation (NYSE:
CVG), a global leader in relationship management, announced today that it is
entering into a global strategic relationship with Microsoft Corp., the world`s
leading software company, to "change the game" for communications providers and
utility companies. 

Combining the power of two market leaders, Convergys in customer care and
billing and Microsoft in technology innovation, the companies will be delivering
the Convergys Smart Communications Suite powered by Microsoft. Currently under
development, the solution will provide a comprehensive next-generation business
support system (BSS) that dramatically improves the customer experience. By
combining Microsoft Dynamics CRM and Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 with the
modular business support system capabilities of Convergys, the solution supports
a shared vision of enabling service providers to rapidly deliver a wide range of
new and differentiated services. 

The Convergys Smart Communications Suite is inherently flexible to meet the
demands of companies and the growing demands of their customers. Scalable and
interoperable with existing systems and third party applications, as well as
with varying deployment models, the solution will offer a compelling alternative
to rival billing and CRM platforms. Its open and well-defined architecture means
it can help companies achieve faster-time-to-market for new services with
reduced implementation time and automated workflows for most common business
processes. Additionally, the low cost licensing options and maintenance costs
associated with the solution can rapidly reduce cost-to-market for new services.


The integration of the highly scalable* Microsoft Dynamics CRM into the
Convergys Smart BSS Solutions portfolio will bring the well-known and
easy-to-use customer care tools based on Microsoft Office, Outlook, and
SharePoint across all service providers` customer care channels. Call center
agents will benefit from a customer-centric, simplified user interface, helping
ensure that they can move customers quickly and intuitively between sales
channels and promotions, to deliver the best possible customer service and
reduce call-handling times. A single catalogue that enables easy bundling of new
products will help agents with more targeted cross/up-selling opportunities that
have a positive impact on the service provider`s revenue, profitability, and
churn. 

With the inclusion of SQL Server 2008 R2 in the solution, Convergys can offer
customers and prospects the best commercial database from a performance and
pricing perspective. Delivering excellence in data compression, partitioning,
availability, and encryption at no extra cost, SQL Server will enable
communications providers to centralize and manage critical customer information.


"Microsoft's value added services and strong internet delivery platform combined
with Convergys' communications-focused billing and customer care provides a
unique solution for new entrant and established communications service providers
to introduce new services and rapidly gain new revenue," said Larry Goldman,
Head of Subscription Research at Analysys Mason. 

"We are delighted to be working closely with one of the top vendors in the
communications industry to offer a truly flexible billing and CRM platform,"
said Austen Mulinder, Corporate Vice President, Communications Sector,
Microsoft. "Our relationship signals greater choice for service providers
looking for a more agile, cost-efficient platform that can support the delivery
of the next wave of differentiated services." 

"As leading companies in our fields, Microsoft and Convergys have come together
to help our customers grow faster and provide a better customer service
experience (alleviate communications industry pain points). Working together, we
are providing new capabilities to service providers to launch new services
faster, provide superior customer service experiences, and create new or enhance
business growth plans at a total cost of ownership that simply can`t be
matched," said Bob Lento, President, Information Management, Convergys. "The
result is a solution that ushers in a new era of affordable innovation and
customer-centricity."

*In July 2009, performance results showed Microsoft Dynamics CRM 4.0 scale to
more than 50,000 concurrent users and more than 2.9 million daily transactions -
all from hardware that cost less than $35,000 or $0.70 per user, reducing
hardware costs by nearly 80 percent. By comparison, an October 2008 performance
test for Oracle Siebel Release 8.0 scaled to 14,000 users and 1.6 million daily
transactions on Sun hardware that cost more than $150,000. (Microsoft and Intel

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft late Thursday said it had halted distribution of a security update linked to crippled Windows XP PCs that display the notorious Blue Screen of Death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to users who posted complaints to Microsoft's support forum, after installing the update, one of 13 released Tuesday, their machines refuse to start up. Instead, their systems shudder to a stop at the blue screen which in Windows indicates a serious software error and crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We stopped offering this update through Windows Update as soon as we discovered the restart issues," said Jerry Bryant, a senior manager with the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bryant also said that Microsoft was digging into the problem. "Our initial analysis suggests that the issue occurs after installing MS10-015 (KB977165)," he said. "However, we have not confirmed that the issue is specific to MS10-015 or if it is an interoperability problem with another component or third-party software."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also downplayed the extent of the blue screening, saying that only a "limited number" of users were affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The support thread dedicated to the problem, however, grew by bounds on Thursday. By day's end it boasted more than 250 messages -- double the number of 12 hours before -- and had been accessed over 55,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bryant encouraged Windows XP users to apply Tuesday's other patches, and to protect their machines in lieu of the now-missing MS10-015 with a automated workaround that disables the vulnerable NT Virtual DOS Mode (NTVDM) subsystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MS10-015 quashed a pair of 17-year-old kernel bugs in all 32-bit versions of Windows. The vulnerability went public three weeks ago when a Google engineer published proof-of-concept attack code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did not provide any new help Thursday to users whose machines have been incapacitated, nor did Bryant provide a timetable when the company would conclude its investigation. The only Microsoft-endorsed solution, which was posted to the support forum Wednesday by a user , is worthless to netbook owners whose systems lack a CD or DVD drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late Thursday, however, someone identified as "John E" and labeled as a Microsoft employee asked users with the blue screen problem to submit a memory dump file from their PCs for examination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact now stretches beyond Microsoft. A spokeswoman for Dell acknowledged Thursday that calls to its support center were on the increase because of the blue screen issue. Hewlett-Packard did not respond to a similar request for comment on the update problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, rumors began circulating about possible causes of the apparent conflict between the MS10-015 update and some, though certainly not all, Windows XP machines. One making the rounds ended up on the support thread: "Is it true that the [Blue Screen of Death] only happens on people already infected with the malware that this update is supposed to fix?" Several users jumped in to reject that theory, a good bet since although exploit code was publicly disclosed several weeks ago, Microsoft said Tuesday that it had seen no in-the-wild attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week's incident was not the first where a Microsoft update has harmed rather than helped. Two years ago, a set of updates for Vista sent machines into an endless series of reboots .

&lt;p&gt; (Corrects first paragraph of Feb. 10 story to read "general
manager" instead of "chief executive")&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MILAN Feb 10 (Reuters) - Sales at Walt Disney (DIS.N)
stores in Italy have picked up in the first months of 2010 after
Christmas, and Disney Italy General Manager Cecilia Tosting
expects growth this year, she told an Italian newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Walt Disney on Tuesday reported better-than-expected
earnings, helped by a strong performance at its cable division
and cost-cuts at its film studio but clouds remained over its
theme parks. [ID:nN09114719]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect 2010 to be a year of growth, because we have
signals in that direction especially in sectors where we have
direct contact with the public such as sales points," Tosting
told Il Sole 24 Ore in an interview published on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tosting said Disney has 16 stores in Italy, its
second-biggest European market, and was planning to open another
two by the end of 2010 "with a plan for further growth in
successive years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Revenues at sales points continue to be good even if
Christmas started slowly, but then there was an acceleration
that continued in the first months of 2010," she said.

volume, announces results for the fourth quarter of 2009.


--  Total revenues reached Ps. 29,032 million in the fourth quarter of
    2009, an increase of 27.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008
    driven by double-digit revenue increases in every division.
--  Consolidated operating income grew 19.1% to Ps. 4,827 million for the
    fourth quarter of 2009, mainly driven by double-digit operating income
    growth recorded in our Latincentro and Mercosur divisions. Our
    operating margin was 16.6% in the fourth quarter of 2009.

operating income and EBITDA by 24%, 16% and 15% respectively. The Company
grew organically through our defensive portfolio of products as
exemplified by the solid performance of the Coca-Cola brand, and our new
lines of business, such as ValleFrut in the orangeade category; proving
to be counter-cyclical to the prevailing economic conditions. On the
acquisitions front, we continued integrating the Brisa water business in
Colombia, helping us to consolidate our presence in the water segment in
that market. We successfully weathered one of the most difficult years
for consumers, while strengthening our balance sheet and investing for

&lt;p&gt; * Televisa has not signed deal with NII Holdings yet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Regulator has approved possible acquisition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Televisa eyes wireless market
  (Adds background on wireless market, Slim approval)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MEXICO CITY, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Mexican media giant
Televisa said on Friday it received regulatory approval to buy
a stake in NII Holdings' Nextel Mexico wireless telephone unit
but said it has yet to sign a deal with the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mexico's antitrust regulator gave a green light on Thursday
to a proposal by Televisa (TLVACPO.MX) (TV.N) to buy up to 40
percent of NII's Mexican unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "No agreement has been signed between Televisa and NII
Holdings and it can't be guaranteed that the transaction under
consideration will go ahead," Televisa said in a stock market
filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mexican media have reported that Televisa, keen to expand
into cellphone services, could pay at least $1 billion for a
stake in Nextel Mexico but the company has been mum about
possible negotiations with the U.S.-based company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NII's NIHD.O Nextel Mexico is the No. 4 player in the
cellphone market in Mexico but generates higher revenue per
customer than its two closest competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Competition in Mexico's telecom industry, dominated by
tycoon Carlos Slim's America Movil, is heating as the
government auctions wireless spectrum after years of delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The competition regulator also approved on Thursday a plan
by Slim to consolidate his fixed-line and wireless assets, a
major step in creating a Latin American telecommunications
behemoth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Slim launched a $21 billion proposal in January to shift
control of his Mexican fixed-line operator Telmex TELMEXL.MX
TMX.N and regional fixed-line operator Telmex Internacional
TELINTL.MX TII.N into his flagship America Movil (AMXL.MX)
(AMX.N) cellphone company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Slim wants to integrate his companies to create a provider
with fixed-line telephone, mobile and Internet services across
Latin America to better challenge rivals like Spain's
Telefonica (TEF.MC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the billionaire's proposal, Telmex, which has about
80 percent of Mexico's fixed-line market, will be controlled by
America Movil, which has more than 70 percent of the country's
wireless market, but the two companies will remain separate
entities.

&lt;p&gt;AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A week before Valentine's Day, a consignment of cocaine was found hidden among 20,000 roses from Latin America at Amsterdam airport, Dutch authorities said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roses, a popular February 14 Valentine's Day gift, arrived last Sunday on a flight from Bogota, Colombia, which stopped over in Puerto Rico, the public prosecutors' office said in a statement. The drug was found in cellophane packets hidden in boxes containing the roses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three people in the Netherlands were arrested and police found a total of 9 kg (20 lb) of cocaine in their possession, including the seized shipment, with a street value of about 1.3 million euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Netherlands is a major flower trading hub, home to the world's biggest flower auction house and is the source of 60 percent of the world's flower exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Reed Stevenson; editing by Andrew Dobbie)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * JPMorgan left off AIA underwriting list&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Bank missing out on fee bonanza&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Old grudges from AIG relations may have prompted snub
 (For more Reuters DEALTALKs, click [DEALTALK/]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Michael Flaherty and Kennix Chim&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HONG KONG, Feb 12 (Reuters) - American International Group
Inc (AIG.N) turned down JPMorgan's (JPM.N) attempts to get in
on the estimated $10 billion Hong Kong IPO of its Asian life
insurance unit, sources involved with the deal said on Friday,
in a snub partly stemming from soured relations dating back to
the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan is the only major investment bank omitted from a
long list of underwriters for the IPO of American International
Assurance (AIA), the U.S. insurer's Asian arm once labelled by
former CEO Maurice Hank Greenberg as the group's 'crown jewel'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The IPO, among the biggest slated for Asia this year, could
produce more than $300 million in fees to those involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AIG, bailed out by the U.S. government during the global
financial crisis, has chosen Citigroup (C.N), Credit Suisse
(CSGN.VX), Goldman Sachs (GS.N), BofA Merrill Lynch (BAC.N),
UBS (UBSN.VX), CCB International and ICBC International to
underwrite the IPO, sources involved in the offering said on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When that list was circulated -- and no underwriting list
is final until the prospectus is printed -- the sources assumed
there was a lingering contractual reason behind JPMorgan's
absence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan and private equity giant Blackstone Group LP
(BX.N) acted as advisers to AIG throughout its restructuring.
While Blackstone has kept that role, JPMorgan and AIG parted
ways last year on a sour note, according to two sources with
direct knowledge of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sources, who declined to be named due to the
sensitivity of the matter, did not pin down the exact reason
for the falling out between AIG and the U.S. bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The relationship is not here, which explains why the bank
has not been mandated on AIA's IPO," said one of the sources,
who like the others interviewed for this article, declined to
be named due to the issue's sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AIG struggled with parts of its restructuring last year,
putting some assets up for sale, taking them off the market,
and then putting them back up for sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sources said on Friday that JPMorgan wasn't actually
tied to its previous relationship with AIG, and had pitched
hard to get on to the AIA IPO, thinking bygones were bygones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But old grudges appear to have been at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When you go down the road of including everyone, either
you do or you don't," said one of the sources involved in the
IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a politically charged IPO," said the source,
referring to the U.S. government involvement in AIG's bailout
and all the advisers and politicians who became part of that
difficult process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "So, within that context, it's not an accident," that
JPMorgan was left off the AIA IPO, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan and AIA declined to comment on why the bank was
left off the underwriting list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AIG had already selected Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and
Morgan Stanley (MS.N) as joint global coordinators for the
offering.

&lt;p&gt;While Apple with its iPad tablet device may be hogging all the headlines lately, a Microsoft official stressed Thursday that the Redmond, Wash. software giant should not be counted out when it comes to offering its own software on different types of devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A video at the Microsoft Global High-Tech Summit 2010 meeting in Santa Clara, Calif. Tuesday showed how devices such as a tablet and a credit card-shaped unit&#160;could be served data via cloud computing. Interviewed afterward, speaker Drew Gude, Microsoft director of U.S. High Tech amp; Electronics, said the future will include these types of devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Read the iPad questions Apple won't answer in InfoWorld. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a ton of innovation going on right now in form factors," amongst Microsoft and hardware partners, he said. A Windows XP and Vista tablet already has been offered and a Windows 7-based slate device from HP recently was shown at the CES conference in Las Vegas last month, &#160;Gude said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That video was intended be kind of glimpse of the future," where Microsoft has taken ideas like Microsoft Surface multi-touch technology and applied it to new types of surfaces and products, he said. Devices shown in the video are under development at Microsoft and could be on the market in the next three to 10 years, according to a Microsoft representative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft can serve as an alternative to Apple on the device front, Gude acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Apple has somewhat of a closed architecture in that iPad, and I think people want the power of choice," said Gude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gude and Microsoft's Dan'l Lewin, corporate vice president for strategic and emerging business development, cited on Thursday innovations fostered by Microsoft and partners. But the company recently has had to contend with an Op-Ed piece in The New York Times written by former Microsoft executive Dick Brass, who charged that Microsoft no longer brings users into the future and never developed a true system for innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When I read Dick's comments, being a seven-year veteran of the company, I was kind of scratching my head," Gude said. Large companies are using Microsoft innovation to improve their businesses, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about the Brass piece, Lewin deferred to a statement from Frank Shaw, Microsoft corporate vice president for corporate communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To make his point, Dick generally focused on ClearType, noting that this technology was 'stifled' by existing business groups. For the record, ClearType now ships with every copy of Windows we make and is installed on around a billion PCs around the world. This is a great example of innovation with impact: innovation at scale," Shaw said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Innovation as a word is overused, Lewin said during his presentation. "Invention is a central element of creating something that might have value. Innovation is more like the process of unfolding it with economic impact," Lewin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the research group at Microsoft has a mission to further the state of the art and insure Microsoft has a future, Lewin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft investment priorities were listed by Gude: Innovation, product differentiation, supply chain transparency, creating superior experiences, and building closer customer relationships. The investment strategy is focused on low-cost computing, business insight, security, consumerization of IT, and cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The consumerization of IT is a huge issue right now that's fundamentally changing our industry," Gude said. "The line is blurring between what is business computing and what is personal computing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Microsoft vies with Apple in device battle," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Disney-Pixar`s Toy Story 3 kicked off the American International Toy Fair in New
York City today with a plethora of new toys and playthings that pay homage and
celebrate the best the toy industry has to offer. In a playful, Toy Story-themed
setting before an invitation-only crowd of toy industry insiders, Green Army Men
descended from the ceiling in "take-over" mode as they helped John Lasseter,
chief creative officer of Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios, Lee Unkrich,
director, Toy Story 3, Darla K. Anderson, producer, Toy Story 3 and John
Ratzenberger, voice of Hamm, unveil a first look at some of the more than 250

Toy Story isthe largest toy licensing event of 2010 and the only film franchise
that galvanizes the toy industry with an unprecedented line-up from Disney
Consumer Products and more than 20 world-renowned toy companies, including
Thinkway Toys, Mattel, The LEGO Group, HASBRO, JAKKS Pacific, and Fisher-Price.
Boasting $8B in global merchandise sales to date since it was introduced in
1995, Toy Story will continue to bring excitement to retailers around the world
and turn up the fun for kids at playtime. The new Toy Story 3 toy line features
action figures, dolls, role play, games, play sets, construction sets, vehicles,
talking plush and robots that might just come alive when kids are not around. 

The filmmakers also revealed a look at the much-anticipated Toy Story 3 with an
all new film trailer introducing a plush bear character named Lots-O`-Huggin`
Bear, one of the 14 new toys featured in Toy Story 3`s Sunnyside Day Care, and
the first plush toy to appear in the film franchise. The trailer, which will air
tonight on Disney Channel, also previews an explosive train sequence and a host
of other new characters. The new Toy Story 3 toy line will also include toys
inspired by these new characters adding hours of fun as kids play out scenes
from the new film. 

"I`ve always had a great love and fascination with toys and that`s really where
the idea for Toy Story began," said Lasseter. "When we set out to create Toy
Story, I imagined this really amazing group of characters that would entertain
kids and families for hours. And that`s also what we set out to do with the toys
inspired by the films. Working with some of the best toy companies, we took
every single detail into consideration to develop a great toy line that is true
to this franchise. Taking a look around the room today, I think we again
achieved our vision with Toy Story 3." 

Lasseter was inducted into the Toy Hall of Fame at the Toy Industry Association
Toy of the Year Awards banquet last night. Through such hits as Toy Story and
Cars, he has brought toys to life on the big screen in a magical way that has
engaged kids and collectors off-screen with film-inspired product for nearly 15
years. Lasseter follows in the footsteps of Walt Disney, who was inducted into
the Toy Hall of Fame in 1987.

evergreen toys such as Barbie, Chatter Phone and Mr. Potato Head, andcombines

&lt;p&gt;  BARCELONA, Feb 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Juniper Networks(R) (NYSE: JNPR) today announced it has become a
validated IBM Service Provider Delivery Environment (SPDE) partner. The
latest joint effort is an interoperable service delivery platform and
networking solution that is based on Juniper's Junos(R) Space, an open
application network platform for ecosystem partners, and IBM's SPDE
framework. It will be featured at IBM's Telecom Solutions Lab in Austin,
Texas and shown in IBM's booth, Hall 1, C31 at the GSMA Mobile World
Congress on February 15-19 in Barcelona.

    Network operators can use IBM's SPDE framework underpinned by Juniper
Networks infrastructure solutions to gain access to a full suite of IBM
software assets. The SPDE framework integrated with Junos Space also
allows IBM and Juniper partners, including content/application providers,
to have network-wide visibility and control and to gain powerful access
to dynamic network intelligence -- enabling new services, new experiences
and new business models.

    "Juniper is transforming the network economics and experience through
solutions with partners like IBM to help customers monetize the new
network," said Andy Vandeveld, vice president of strategic alliances,
Juniper Networks. "By continuing to build joint solutions that combine
Juniper's history of carrier-grade networking innovations with IBM's
expertise in SOA and the value delivered by the SPDE framework, we can
further enhance our service delivery platform capabilities. Together, we
are providing a clear migration path for service providers to lower-cost
IP networks, while maintaining service quality, brand image and
profitability."

    "Adding Juniper's networking solutions to IBM's SPDE framework allows
communications service providers to leverage their existing investments
and rapidly develop and deploy new revenue generating services," said
Scott Stainken, general manager for IBM's Telecommunications Industry.
"Together IBM and Juniper are creating unique solutions for the telecom
industry such as dynamic video on demand and cloud computing
infrastructures."

    The Juniper Session Resource Control element of Junos Space provides a
feedback loop between applications, users and the network to connect the
services layer with the network layer. Junos Space is an open development
and deployment platform for network applications, which enable customers
and third-party developers to simplify network operations, automate
support and accelerate service delivery. This combination enables dynamic,
intelligent network activation in the Juniper platform -- bridging the
IT/application and network domains for fixed and mobile operators.

    "The joint innovation of IBM SPDE and Junos Space allows our shared
service provider customers to create and deliver personalized services
for their subscribers at low incremental cost," said Mike Harding, vice
president and general manager of Junos Space, Juniper Networks. "This
enables them to align traffic and revenue growth and fully participate in
the explosive smartphone, social networking and Web 2.0 market
opportunities."

    Mobile World Congress Demonstration
 The integrated IBM and Juniper
solution will be shown at the GSMA Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in,
IBM's booth Hall 1, C31. The demonstration highlights integrated
composite services that connect with BSS/OSS systems for consolidating
customer, product, network and billing information. Visitors can interact
with IBM and Juniper experts and see how SPDE provides a standards-based
industry framework that creates flexibility, enables integration and
provides a unified platform to introduce new services through the network
with minimal impact to their business process. Other use cases shown is
the delivery of assured video quality, leveraging Dynamic SOA based on
NGOSS implementation using WebSphere Business Services Fabric and Telecom
Operations Content Pack.

&lt;p&gt;DAKAR (Reuters) - West Africans are consuming more of the drugs trafficked between South America and Europe, raising the specter of rising crime and health problems in already unstable states, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The region, an established transit point for Latin American cocaine to big Western markets, has also become a drug processing site amid rising addiction rates, and drug-related violence will follow, they told a drug summit over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A flourishing illicit trade in the hands of organized crime is obviously a threat to the rule of law, governance and, as a result, human rights," said Alexandre Schmidt, West African head for the U.N.

&lt;p&gt; * Cocaine use rises along trafficking routes * Experts warn of impact on health, crime in poor states  By David Lewis DAKAR, Feb 14 (Reuters) - West Africans are consuming more of the drugs trafficked between South America and Europe, raising the spectre of rising crime and health problems in already unstable states, experts said. The region, an established transit point for Latin American cocaine to big Western markets, has also become a drug processing site amid rising addiction rates, and drug-related violence will follow, they told a drug summit over the weekend. A flourishing illicit trade in the hands of organised crime is obviously a threat to the rule of law, governance and, as a result, human rights, said Alexandre Schmidt, West African head for the U.N. Office for Drugs and Crime (UNODC). But we must no longer hide the indirect consequences with regard to the increase in problems linked to drug abuse. Some 20 tonnes of cocaine passed through West Africa in 2008, worth about $1 billion, the United Nations says. The warnings came during a meeting of seven West African governments who, backed by the United Nations, France and Spain, are seeking to implement declarations of intent to curb trafficking.  ALARMING TRENDS The drugs trade through West Africa grabbed headlines in 2007 after a series of seizures of hundreds of kg of cocaine were made in the region alongside a spike up in violence. Guinea-Bissau, the landing point for most of the cocaine, saw a string of political assassinations that analysts say was linked to the drugs trade, and the notoriously brutal military in neighbouring Guinea was also believed to be involved. But now West African nations are sounding the alarm over new trends of increased domestic drug use that could boost theft, gang violence, and health problems. We are also increasingly becoming consumers of the drugs we transit, Adrienne Diop, a commissioner for regional body ECOWAS, said in a presentation made on her behalf. Although concrete figures are hard to come by, experts said there was clear evidence of a rise in local use of cocaine and crack. Citing research in Cape Verde, the region's initial drug hot-spot, Margarete Molnar, a health specialist at UNODC, said drug use was entrenched. This shows that being on the route of trafficking is a disaster, she said. (Law enforcement) may protect West Africa and Europe but I can tell you that in this region there are people who are hard drug users who need to be rehabilitated. A string of local health workers attending the summit also called for an increased focus on rehabilitating existing drug users instead of a purely law-enforcement approach to stamping down on the international trade. Strategies have not been thought of for the youth, said Aissatou Thiam an educator in Senegal's Ministry for Youth and Sport. They need to come up with plans to tackle the issues of the youth, who are turning to drugs because of poverty, amongst other issues.  (Editing by Richard Valdmanis)

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Feb 15 (Reuters) - Mexican media giant
Televisa launched a new 24-hour news channel on Monday to
compete against privately held Milenio's successful no-frills
television venture in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ForoTV will be available on Televisa's (TV.N)(TLVACPO.MX)
cable and satellite systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is the company's second attempt to run a 24-hour news
channel after axing its Noticias ECO initiative in 2001 due to
low profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa executives said last week ForoTV would focus on
debate and analysis segments and use social networks like
Twitter and Facebook to interact with viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One-year-old Milenio TV is the television venture of
newspaper group Milenio, which has been a long-standing
presence in local media. It has a strong following among cable
audiences thanks to its fast-paced, 30-minute news segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Milenio TV has broken several big stories recently,
including the killing of Mexican drug lord Arturo Beltran Leyva
by security forces in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ForoTV's two leading morning shows will be hosted by Brozo,
a foul-mouthed clown famous for his incisive interviewing
skills, while the evening news will be hosted by radio anchor
and writer Leon Krauze, son of historian Enrique Krauze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa's cable and satellite units have posted strong
revenue growth in recent years as viewers opt for U.S. sitcoms
and series, movie hits and cartoons. Combined, they now account
for about the same revenue generated by the company's core
broadcast business.

&lt;p&gt;Der neu in die Toy Hall of Fame aufgenommene John Lasseter und die Macher von
&#8222;Toy Story 3" stellen Spielzeugkollektion f&#252;r 2010 und Einzelheiten zum Film vor

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Der Film &#8222;Toy Story 3" von Disney/Pixar hat die Spielwarenmesse von New York,
die American International Toy Fair, heute mit einer Unmenge neuer Spielsachen
und Spielfiguren lanciert - zu Ehren der besten Produkte der
Spielwarenindustrie. Vor einer verspielten Kulisse mit &#8222;Toy Story"-Themen und
vor den geladenen G&#228;sten aus Mitgliedern der Spielwarenindustrie seilten sich
gr&#252;ne Spielzeugsoldaten von der Decke ab, st&#252;rmten die B&#252;hne und halfen John
Lasseter, Kreativchef der Animationsstudios von Walt Disney und Pixar, Lee
Unkrich, Regisseur von &#8222;Toy Story 3", Darla K. Anderson, Produzentin von &#8222;Toy
Story 3", und John Ratzenberger, der Stimme von Hamm, bei der erstmaligen
Pr&#228;sentation einiger der &#252;ber 250 neuen Spielwaren, die ab diesem Sommer bis zur
Vorweihnachtszeit 2010 lanciert werden. 

(Hinweis f&#252;r Redakteure: Bilder und Unterlagen zur Veranstaltung sind ohne
Anmeldung unter www.disneyconsumerproducts.com/press/us erh&#228;ltlich.)

&#8222;Toy Story" ist das gr&#246;&#223;te Lizenzierungsereignis des Jahres 2010 und die einzige
Filmreihe, welche die Spielwarenindustrie mit einer beispiellosen Auswahl an
Produkten von Disney Consumer Products und &#252;ber zwanzig weltbekannten
Spielzeugfirmen wie Thinkway Toys, Mattel, LEGO, HASBRO, JAKKS Pacific und
Fisher-Price elektrisiert. Mit Produktums&#228;tzen in H&#246;he von stolzen 8 Milliarden
US-Dollar seit dem ersten Film aus dem Jahr 1995 sorgt &#8222;Toy Story" weiterhin f&#252;r
Aufregung bei H&#228;ndlern rund um die Welt und bereitet Kindern nach wie vor
besonderen Spielspa&#223;. Die neue Spielwarenreihe aus &#8222;Toy Story 3" enth&#228;lt
Actionfiguren, Puppen, Rollenspiele, Spiel- und Bauk&#228;sten, Fahrzeuge, sprechende
Pl&#252;schtiere und Roboter, die erst wirklich zum Leben erwachen, wenn die Kinder
weg sind. 

Die Filmemacher gaben auch einen Einblick in die mit Spannung erwartete
Fortsetzung &#8222;Toy Story 3" und zeigten einen brandneuen Trailer mit einer neuen
Figur. Der Pl&#252;schb&#228;r namens Lots-O`-Huggin` Bear ist einer von 14 neuen
Spielsachen in der Kindertagesst&#228;tte Sunnyside aus &#8222;Toy Story 3" und das erste
Pl&#252;schtier, das einen Auftritt in der Filmreihe bekommt. Der Trailer, der heute
Abend auf dem Disney Channel ausgestrahlt wird, bietet auch eine Vorschau auf
eine brisante Zugszene und jede Menge neue Figuren. Die neue Produktreihe aus
&#8222;Toy Story 3" enth&#228;lt auch Spielwaren, die durch diese neuen Figuren angeregt
wurden, und bietet Kindern stundenlangen Spielspa&#223; beim Nachstellen von Szenen
aus dem neuen Film. 

&#8222;Spielsachen haben mich immer schon fasziniert, und dieser Begeisterung
entsprang die Idee zu &#8218;Toy Story`", sagte Lasseter. &#8222;Als wir mit dem Entwurf f&#252;r
&#8218;Toy Story` begannen, stellte ich mir diese wunderbare Ansammlung an Figuren
vor, die Kinder und Familien stundenlang unterhalten w&#252;rden. Und dasselbe hatten
wir mit den Spielwaren vor, die aus den Filmen entstanden. In Zusammenarbeit mit
einigen der besten Spielwarenfirmen ber&#252;cksichtigten wir jedes kleine Detail, um
eine gro&#223;artige Spielwarenreihe im Sinne dieser Filme zu entwickeln. Wenn ich
mich hier und heute umschaue, so denke ich, dass uns die Umsetzung unserer
Vision auch mit &#8218;Toy Story 3` wieder gelungen ist." 

Lasseter wurde gestern Abend anl&#228;sslich der Preisverleihung f&#252;r die besten
Spielwaren des Jahres von der Toy Industry Association in die Ruhmeshalle der
Spielwarenbranche, die Toy Hall of Fame, aufgenommen. Mit Erfolgen wie &#8222;Toy
Story" und &#8222;Cars" verzauberte er die Leinw&#228;nde mit lebensechten Spielwaren, die
bei Kindern und Sammlern von Filmnebenprodukten seit fast 15 Jahren f&#252;r
Begeisterung sorgen. Lasseter tritt damit in die Fu&#223;stapfen von Walt Disney, der
1987 in die Toy Hall of Fame aufgenommen wurde. 

&#8222;&#8218;Toy Story` ist die einzige Filmreihe, die die besten und beliebtesten
klassischen Spielwaren wie Barbie, Chatter Phone und Mr. Potato Head
zusammenbringt und sie durch Kreativit&#228;t und Erz&#228;hlkunst mit neuen &#8218;Toy
Story`-Figuren wie Woody, Buzz Lightyear und Jessie verbindet, die mittlerweile
selbst zu Klassikern geworden sind", sagte Vince Klaseus, Senior Vice President
der globalen Spielwarenabteilung bei Disney Consumer Products. &#8222;Auf Kinder
d&#252;rfte ein besonderes Vergn&#252;gen zukommen, denn die neue Spielwarenreihe von &#8218;Toy
Story 3` steckt voller Zusatzfunktionen wie Klang- und Lichteffekten sowie
Bewegungssensoren, und auch Sammler d&#252;rften nicht entt&#228;uscht sein, denn das
Sortiment an ma&#223;geblichen Actionfiguren nimmt stetig zu." 

Und dies sind einige der gefragten neuen Spielwaren aus &#8222;Toy Story 3":

* Thinkway Toys war ganz von Anfang an mit dabei - seit der Ver&#246;ffentlichung der
ersten &#8222;Toy Story"-Spielwarenreihe. Heute dehnt sich die enorm beliebte
Standardkollektion des Unternehmens mit einem g&#228;nzlich neuen Angebot weiter aus.
Dazu z&#228;hlt auch die neue Figur Lots-O`-Huggin` Bear aus &#8222;Toy Story 3": Der B&#228;r
hat &#252;ber 45 bezaubernde Spr&#252;che drauf, riecht nach Erdbeeren und verf&#252;gt &#252;ber
einen Spielzeug- und einen Interaktivmodus; er reagiert auf Stimmen, Umarmungen
und sogar, wenn man ihn kitzelt (UVP = 39,99 US-Dollar). Au&#223;erdem gibt es eine
neue &#8222;Toy Story 3"-Version des ultimativen programmierbaren
Buzz-Lightyear-Roboters mit &#252;ber 100 Spr&#252;chen - sogar auf Spanisch, wie im Film,
als Buzz aus Versehen auf Spanisch umprogrammiert wird. Au&#223;erdem ist die Figur
mit Musik und Tanzschritten ausger&#252;stet und sie reagiert auf sechs Sprachbefehle
entweder als Spielzeug oder als Space Ranger. Auch enthalten ist eine

* Die neuen &#8222;Toy Story"-Spielk&#228;sten und -Rollenspielobjekte von Mattel
definieren erlebnisreiche Abenteuer v&#246;llig neu. Der &#8222;Toy Story"-Kampfhandschuh
Ultra Blast ist eine coole Manschette, die am Unterarm getragen werden kann und
stundenlangen Spa&#223; mit Licht-, Klang- und anderen galaktischen Effekten
garantiert (UVP = 29,99 US-Dollar). Das Actionpaket mit
Buzz-Lightyear-Gleitfl&#252;geln macht es mit seiner rucksackartigen Konstruktion
jedem Kind leicht, die Rolle von Buzz Lightyear zu &#252;bernehmen, denn es ist voll
gestopft mit charakteristischen Buzz-Spr&#252;chen, mit Sensoren, die wahrnehmen,
wann das Kind &#8222;fliegt" oder &#8222;landet", und mit jeder Menge passender Kl&#228;nge zu
jedem Modus (UVP = 49,99 US-Dollar). Die ultimativen Spielbauk&#228;sten &#8222;Toy Story"
Action Links lassen sich durch einfaches Einklinken miteinander verbinden und
schaffen so eine interaktive und abenteuergeladene &#8222;Toy Story"-Welt (UVP ab
14,99 bis 39,99 US-Dollar). 
* Die erste durch &#8222;Toy Story" angeregte Spielwarenreihe von LEGO enth&#228;lt ein
unglaubliches Sortiment an Bauk&#228;sten und klassischen, aber auch neuen Figuren.
Der &#8222;Toy Story 3"-Wildwestzug (UVP = 79,99 US-Dollar) sorgt f&#252;r zahlreiche
Abenteuer, wenn die Lego-Bauer Woody, Buzz und Jessie dabei helfen, sich ihren
Weg in den Zug zu erk&#228;mpfen und alle Passagiere in Sicherheit zu bringen. Und
beim &#8222;Toy Story 3"-Kipper von Lotso helfen die Lego-Bauer dem B&#228;ren
Lots-O`-Huggin` dabei, seinen Spielzeugkipper durch die Kindertagesst&#228;tte zu
steuern. 
* HASBRO pr&#228;sentiert eine lustige neue Kollektion von &#8222;Mr. und Mrs. POTATO
HEAD"-Figuren aus &#8222;Toy Story 3". Dazu geh&#246;ren Herr und Frau Kartoffelkopf aus
dem Film, verkleidet als Buzz, Woody und Jessie. Ebenfalls im Angebot sind neue
Pl&#252;schvarianten von Mr. und Mrs. sowie ein spannender neuer Mr. POTATO HEAD aus
Pl&#252;sch und mit elektronischer Ausstattung, der Spr&#252;che aus allen drei &#8222;Toy
Story"-Filmen aufsagen kann (UVP ab 9,99 bis 19,99 US-Dollar). 
* Die neue Spielwarenreihe &#8222;Toy Story 3" von JAKKS Pacific bietet eine breite
Auswahl f&#252;r jedes Alter mit klassischen und neuen Figuren - von
Halloween-Verkleidungen von Disguise (UVP von 19,99 bis 64,99 US-Dollar) &#252;ber

US-Dollar) bis zu Spielzeugm&#246;beln von KidsOnly! (UVP = 69,99 US-Dollar) und den
neuen Videospielen Toy Story Mania - einfach einwerfen und das Spiel kann
beginnen (UVP = 39,99 US-Dollar).

Bei seiner Ver&#246;ffentlichung im Jahr 1995 schuf &#8222;Toy Story" einen Pr&#228;zedenzfall

&#220;ber &#8222;Toy Story 3" von Disney/Pixar (Kinostart in den USA: 18. Juni 2010)

W&#228;hrend sich Andy auf sein College-Studium vorbereitet, machen sich Buzz, Woody
und die &#252;brigen treuen Spielwaren Sorgen um ihre ungewisse Zukunft. &#8222;Toy Story
3" von Regisseur Lee Unkrich (Koregisseur von &#8222;Toy Story 2" und &#8222;Findet Nemo")
ist ein k&#246;stliches neues Abenteuer in Disney Digital 3D, in dem die Spielwaren
in einem Raum voller wild gewordener Kleinkinder landen, die es kaum erwarten
k&#246;nnen, die &#8222;neuen" Spielsachen mit ihren klebrigen Fingern anzufassen. Durch
chaotische Zust&#228;nde versuchen sie, zusammenzubleiben und sicherzustellen, dass
&#8222;kein Spielzeug zur&#252;ckbleibt". In der Zwischenzeit tritt Barbie ihrem Ken (ja,
dem Ken) von Angesicht zu Plastikgesicht gegen&#252;ber. Die Pixar-Veteranin Darla K.
Anderson (&#8222;Cars", &#8222;Die Monster AG") war Produzentin, und Oscarpreistr&#228;ger
Michael Arndt (f&#252;r &#8222;Little Miss Sunshine") brachte sein einzigartiges Talent und

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Barbara Walters is ending her annual Oscar night celebrity interview special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The veteran newswoman announced on "The View" that this will be the last year she does the ABC special, which has become an Oscar night tradition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ABC has asked me to keep doing these specials, as they have been so successful -- and I'm thrilled we have such great stars and have such a wonderful show -- but to be honest, I feel like I've 'been there, done that,'" Walters said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news comes shortly after ABC announced the return of Oprah Winfrey's annual Oscar special, which first aired in 2007. The Oprah special is scheduled for the week before the Oscars, on March 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walters' final Oscar-night guests will include nominees Sandra Bullock and Mo'Nique. Walters will continue her other annual ABC News special -- "The 10 Most Fascinating People," as well as additional ABC News specials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This special has been a labor of love for 29 years," Walters said. "I will always remember when Hugh Jackman gave me a private lap dance or sitting down with the legendary Bette Davis or being taught to tango by Al Pacino. It's those priceless moments that have made this special the Oscar tradition that it has become, but I truly feel enough is enough."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reigning Dancing with the Stars Champion Donny Osmond Previews Dance Star Mickey
at New York Toy Fair 2010
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The dance stars align at Toy Fair 2010 as Fisher-Price - a subsidiary of Mattel,
Inc. (NASDAQ:MAT) - and Disney introduce Dance Star Mickey. The original Disney
character, who first appeared on merchandise more than 80 years ago, will dance
his way into the hearts of a new generation of children this fall. To preview
the newest and most interactive Mickey character plush, two of the most beloved
and legendary entertainers - Mickey Mouse and Donny Osmond - joined together
today to show off some of the season`s hottest dance moves. Fresh off the heels
of his big ABC-TV Dancing with the Stars win, Mr. Osmond took to the dance floor
to stroll down memory lane and shake things up with a little friendly dance
competition with Mickey. 

"Our newest Mickey plush, Dance Star Mickey, combines the strength of the Disney
brand and its powerful storytelling content behind the Mickey Mouse character,
with the magical playtime experience that Fisher-Price has been bringing to kids
for nearly 80 years," said Gina Sirard, vice president, marketing, Fisher-Price.
"The collaboration between Fisher-Price and Disney brings Mickey Mouse to life
in an exciting new way, proving that the iconic character continues to resonate
strongly with kids today. And when it comes to dance stars, it takes one to know
one, so we are thrilled that Donny Osmond is here to help us show everyone just
what this new Dance Star Mickey can do." 

Every year Fisher-Price finds new ways to bring kids` favorite characters to
life and this year the magic is Mickey. Now kids can get up and dance as their
fun-loving pal Mickey Mouse comes to life right before their eyes! The new,
innovative Dance Star Mickey walks, talks, and dances his way into kids` hearts,
topping off his skills with an "out of this world" grand finale to one of his
signature dances. With one press of Mickey's foot, Dance Star Mickey comes to
life for a fun interactive experience that encourages kids to get up, get active
and dance. Grooving to five different songs with styles including soul, disco,
Latin and techno, the dancing Mickey plush is packed with interactive games that
will have children and parents laughing and dancing along. Fisher-Price utilizes
a new, innovative mechanism to replicate the most technologically-difficult
actions in an extremely realistic and lifelike way. 

"We worked closely with Fisher-Price to make this the most animated Mickey Mouse
toy ever made and to bring out the humor and endearing personality that has made
him one of the world`s most beloved characters for generations," said Chris
Heatherly, vice president of Disney Toys. "Kids are going to have a lot of fun
doing all the silly dances with their pal Mickey - from soul to Latin to
contemporary hits." 

"Dance Star Mickey captures the fun, playful essence of Mickey Mouse. It is
innovative, technologically advanced and packed with a lot of great content -
all of which mean exceptional play value for kids," explains Chris Byrne,
content director for TimetoPlayMag.com, also known as The Toy Guy. 

Dance Star Mickey retails for $69.99 and will be available in October at
national retailers.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft unveiled the next version of its operating system for mobile phones, Windows Phone 7 Series, featuring a move away from applications and towards functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's all about the phone and how consumers react to the device," said Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, opening a news conference held outside the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Phone 7 Series also marks a move by Microsoft to take greater control of the user interface of its phone software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We wanted to take greater accountability for the end user experience," Ballmer said. "We want more consistency in the hardware platform and in the user experience," he said, while nevertheless saying Microsoft wanted to leave room for hardware partners to innovate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also wanted the software to differentiate future phones from its past offerings, both phone and PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Phones looked like PCs, but a phone is not a PC, it's smaller, more personal," said Joe Belfiore, vice president for Windows Phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make the interface more personal, Microsoft is counting on a checkerboard of customizable "live tiles" that can update automatically with information from the phone or the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the tiles will update automatically to show frequent contacts or local information, while others can be customized manually. The tiles will be grouped into themed "hubs," for example a page of contacts called "people" or a page of photos called "pictures". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other hubs include "office," which features functions for note-taking and synchronizing documents with a PC; "games," which integrates with the company's Xbox live online community for its game consoles; and "music+video," which synchronizes songs and videos with its desktop Zune jukebox and music store software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There won't be too much personalization though: some aspects of every Windows Phone will be the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every Windows Phone 7 Series device will have three buttons on the front: 'Start,' which gives you quick access to those tiles, 'Search,' because that's how you are going to find phone numbers and restaurants, and 'Back,'" said Belfiore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belfiore showed how the software will recognize addresses in incoming e-mails or calendar entries, converting them into hotlinks to Microsoft's Bing Maps property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interface has an on-screen QWERTY keyboard and will support four-point multitouch interfaces in the same way as Windows 7 for PCs. Another feature borrowed from PCs is the Web browser: it's based on the same code as the desktop version of Internet Explorer, Belfiore said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The graphics Belfiore showed are spacious, using a thin typeface with big one-word titles for the themes of each screen -- day, local, music and so on. The text is displayed using a more precise version of Cleartype that Belfiore called sub-pixel positioning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the page transitions in the user interface slide like the cards in Palm's Web OS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first version of Windows Phone 7 Series will not include Adobe Flash -- although Ballmer said he had "no objection" to Flash support. That marks the software apart from Apple's iPhone, which does not -- and will not -- support Flash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers will have to wait until Microsoft's Mix conference in Las Vegas next month to learn whether Windows Phone 7 Series will support Microsoft's Silverlight in place of the missing Flash, said Microsoft spokesman Casey McGee after the launch presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans to release a software development kit (SDK) to enable network operators and third parties to add new services and applications to the phones. ATT, in the U.S., and Orange, in France, will be among the first operator partners to develop services specially for the phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the new software emphasizes functions rather than applications, and Microsoft intends to keep tight control of the user interface, it will be possible to download third-party applications and games certified by Microsoft through a "marketplace" hub. "There will be opportunities for partners to add value and build in functionality," said McGee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers will have to wait to learn whether the applications they created for the previous version of Microsoft's mobile operating system, Windows Mobile 6.5, can be ported to the new platform, McGee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's own mobile software developers are focusing very much on the new platform. "Windows Phone 7 Series is the priority for Microsoft's communications business," McGee said. Nevertheless, he said, the company will continue to deliver support for Windows Mobile 6.5 for three to five years from its October 2009 launch. He expects vendors to continue to launch devices based on Windows Mobile 6.5 for some time to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft expects the first phones running the software to be available by the end of the year, and says that network operators including Deutsche Telekom, Orange, Verizon and Vodafone, and vendors including Samsung, LG, Sony-Ericsson and long-time partner HTC have committed to offering devices running Windows Phone 7 Series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Media heavyweight Televisa has agreed to buy a minority stake in Nextel Mexico as long as their joint bid for new wireless capacity succeeds, a move that would increase competition in a market dominated by Carlos Slim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tie-up is the first by big corporate players as the Mexican government holds long-awaited frequency auctions that are seen leading to a shake-up in the telecom industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa (TLVACPO.MX) (TV.N) said on Monday it would pay $1.44 billion, or about half of its current cash position, for a 30 percent stake in Nextel Mexico, a unit of NII Holdings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NIHD.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alfonso de Angoitia, Televisa's executive vice president, told Reuters that the deal is subject to the success of the companies' joint bid for wireless capacity. If their effort fails, the deal will dissolve with no penalty fee for Televisa, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa wants to move into the wireless market, which is dominated by Slim's America Movil (AMXL.MX) (AMX.N). Acquiring a stake in Nextel Mexico would also let the media company bundle services of fixed-line telephone, wireless, Internet and video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico's government is auctioning spectrum in the 1.7 GHz and 1.9 GHz bands to propel competition in the cellphone market. Nextel Mexico and Televisa submitted documents on Monday saying they want to bid together in the auction, De Angoitia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ernesto Piedras, head of The Competitive Intelligence Unit consulting firm, said the market will likely see more companies teaming up to participate in the tender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The consolidation of companies via alliances, mergers, acquisitions will continue," he said. "I just think this is just one step toward that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acquiring a stake in Nextel Mexico, which has nearly 3 million customers, would help Televisa enter the cellphone industry without having to build a network from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico's government says it is auctioning enough wireless spectrum for current operators to expand and to attract a new national player to the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partnering with Televisa, a media powerhouse in Mexico, would be seen as a powerful boost to Nextel Mexico's sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal announced on Monday also includes an option for Televisa to buy an additional 7.5 percent stake in Nextel Mexico -- the country's No. 4 wireless operator -- three to four years after the completion of the initial investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reston, Virginia-based NII Holdings also operates in Brazil, Argentina, Peru and Chile. Televisa and NII do not foresee pursuing a deal similar to Mexico's in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nextel Mexico focuses on corporate clients and analysts say it generates higher revenue per customer than Iusacell CEL.MX and Spain's Telefonica (TEF.MC), the operators it trails. Unlike America Movil's Telcel, which garners a big chunk of its revenue from prepaid cards, Nextel focuses on post-pay customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim Perrott, from NII Holding's investor relations, told Reuters the company could consider the prepaid format to bolster business in Mexico but that no formal plans were in the works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa's cable companies, including Cablevision (CABLECPO.MX), already sell Internet, television and fixed-line phone services in packages for less than $40 per month under the YOO brand. Cable operator Megacable (MEGACPO.MX) last year teamed with Televisa to market similar services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa shares ended up 0.85 percent at 48.63 pesos on Monday amid unusually thin volume as a U.S. market holiday kept many international investors away from Mexican markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reigning Dancing with the Stars Champion Donny Osmond Previews Dance Star Mickey
at New York Toy Fair 2010
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The dance stars align at Toy Fair 2010 as Fisher-Price - a subsidiary of Mattel,
Inc. (NASDAQ:MAT) - and Disney introduce Dance Star Mickey. The original Disney
character, who first appeared on merchandise more than 80 years ago, will dance
his way into the hearts of a new generation of children this fall. To preview
the newest and most interactive Mickey character plush, two of the most beloved
and legendary entertainers - Mickey Mouse and Donny Osmond - joined together
today to show off some of the season`s hottest dance moves. Fresh off the heels
of his big ABC-TV Dancing with the Stars win, Mr. Osmond took to the dance floor
to stroll down memory lane and shake things up with a little friendly dance
competition with Mickey. 

"Our newest Mickey plush, Dance Star Mickey, combines the strength of the Disney
brand and its powerful storytelling content behind the Mickey Mouse character,
with the magical playtime experience that Fisher-Price has been bringing to kids
for nearly 80 years," said Gina Sirard, vice president, marketing, Fisher-Price.
"The collaboration between Fisher-Price and Disney brings Mickey Mouse to life
in an exciting new way, proving that the iconic character continues to resonate
strongly with kids today. And when it comes to dance stars, it takes one to know
one, so we are thrilled that Donny Osmond is here to help us show everyone just
what this new Dance Star Mickey can do." 

Every year Fisher-Price finds new ways to bring kids` favorite characters to
life and this year the magic is Mickey. Now kids can get up and dance as their
fun-loving pal Mickey Mouse comes to life right before their eyes! The new,
innovative Dance Star Mickey walks, talks, and dances his way into kids` hearts,
topping off his skills with an "out of this world" grand finale to one of his
signature dances. With one press of Mickey's foot, Dance Star Mickey comes to
life for a fun interactive experience that encourages kids to get up, get active
and dance. Grooving to five different songs with styles including soul, disco,
Latin and techno, the dancing Mickey plush is packed with interactive games that
will have children and parents laughing and dancing along. Fisher-Price utilizes
a new, innovative mechanism to replicate the most technologically-difficult
actions in an extremely realistic and lifelike way. 

"We worked closely with Fisher-Price to make this the most animated Mickey Mouse
toy ever made and to bring out the humor and endearing personality that has made
him one of the world`s most beloved characters for generations," said Chris
Heatherly, vice president of Disney Toys. "Kids are going to have a lot of fun
doing all the silly dances with their pal Mickey - from soul to Latin to
contemporary hits." 

"Dance Star Mickey captures the fun, playful essence of Mickey Mouse. It is
innovative, technologically advanced and packed with a lot of great content -
all of which mean exceptional play value for kids," explains Chris Byrne,
content director for TimetoPlayMag.com, also known as The Toy Guy. 

Dance Star Mickey retails for $69.99 and will be available in October at
national retailers.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co is close to a deal to buy the non-U.S. assets of commodities joint venture RBS Sempra for about $1.7 billion, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing unnamed sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sempra Energy owns 49 percent of RBS Sempra, and Royal Bank of Scotland owns the remaining 51 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBS, which is 84 percent-owned by the British government, is being forced to sell assets to comply with European Union rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deal could come as soon as Tuesday, Bloomberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is also in talks with RBS and Sempra to buy the North American operations of the commodities and energy trader, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, RBS and Sempra could not immediately be reached to comment on the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had been in exclusive talks to buy all of RBS Sempra, but the United States' plans to stop proprietary trading by banks prompted it to rethink its plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's commodities unit, run by Blythe Masters, has been expanding in recent years. The March 2008 acquisition of Bear Stearns significantly increased the second-largest U.S. bank's commodities business. Masters told Reuters a year ago it was aiming to be a top-tier franchise globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is keen to take on the top three commodities firms -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Morgan Stanley and Barclays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBS Sempra trades commodities ranging from oil and natural gas to metals and agricultural products. It was formed in 2008 when RBS bought its controlling stake for $1.7 billion and California utility Sempra Energy invested $1.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Paritosh Bansal; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's all about the phone and how consumers react to the device," said Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, opening a news conference held outside the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Phones looked like PCs, but a phone is not a PC, it's smaller, more personal," said Joe Belfiore, vice president for Windows Phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make the interface more personal, Microsoft is counting on a checkerboard of customizable "live tiles" that can update automatically with information from the phone or the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the tiles will update automatically to show frequent contacts or local information, while others can be customized manually. The tiles will be grouped into themed "hubs," for example a page of contacts called "people" or a page of photos called "pictures". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There won't be too much personalization though: some aspects of every Windows Phone will be the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every Windows Phone 7 Series device will have three buttons on the front: 'Start,' which gives you quick access to those tiles, 'Search,' because that's how you are going to find phone numbers and restaurants, and 'Back,'" said Belfiore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belfiore showed how the software will recognize addresses in incoming e-mails or calendar entries, converting them into hotlinks to Microsoft's Bing Maps property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interface has an on-screen QWERTY keyboard and will support multitouch interfaces in the same way as Windows 7 for PCs. Another feature borrowed from PCs is the Web browser: it's based on the same code as the desktop version of Internet Explorer, Belfiore said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The graphics Belfiore showed are spacious, using a thin typeface with big one-word titles for the themes of each screen -- day, local, music and so on. The text is displayed using a more precise version of Cleartype that Belfiore called sub-pixel positioning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the page transitions in the user interface slide like the cards in Palm's Web OS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft expects the first phones running the software to be available by the end of the year, and says that network operators including Deutsche Telekom, Orange, Verizon and Vodafone, and vendors including Samsung, LG, Sony-Ericsson and long-time partner HTC have committed to offering devices running Windows Phone 7 Series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Broadcaster Televisa has reached a $1.5 billion deal to buy a 30 percent stake in wireless telephone company Nextel Mexico, a unit of NII Holdings NIHD.O, a newspaper said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexico's government is auctioning wireless spectrum to increase competition in the cellphone market, and Televisa is eager to expand into the industry, which is dominated by billionaire Carlos Slim's America Movil (AMXL.MX) (AMX.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excelsior columnist Dario Celis said the deal, which would include an option to purchase an additional 7.5 percent stake in Nextel Mexico, was reached on Saturday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"NII held an extraordinary board meeting Sunday night to vote on the sale," Celis said without mentioning sources. A similar gathering of Televisa's board is expected to take place on Monday, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa (TLVACPO.MX) (TV.N) and Nextel Mexico declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico's antitrust regulator gave a green light last week to Televisa's proposal to buy up to 40 percent of NII's Mexican unit, but Televisa said a deal had yet to be reached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nextel Mexico is the country's No. 4 wireless operator with nearly 3 million customers. Acquiring a stake in it would let Televisa leap into the cellphone industry without building a network from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nextel Mexico focuses on corporate clients and analysts say it generates higher revenue per customer than Iusacell CEL.MX and Spain's Telefonica (TEF.MC), the operators it trails behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partnering with Televisa, a media powerhouse with massive influence in Mexico, would be seen as a powerful boost to Nextel Mexico's sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Televisa would bring a solid marketing background that would propel Nextel's presence across the country," said IXE brokerage in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acquiring a stake in Nextel Mexico would also let Televisa offer bundled services of fixed-line telephone, wireless, Internet and video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa's cable companies, including Cablevision (CABLECPO.MX), already sell Internet, television and fixed-line phone services in packages for less than $40 per month under the "YOO" brand. Cable operator Megacable (MEGACPO.MX) teamed with Televisa last year to market similar services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nextel Mexico's infrastructure could also help make Televisa's existing telecommunications services more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa shares rose 0.62 percent to 48.52 pesos on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Cyntia Barrera Diaz, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;BARCELONA (Reuters) - Microsoft launched its new mobile phone operating software on Monday, introducing a range of music, gaming and networking features aimed at expanding its appeal beyond its core business customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest software company, which is trying to wrest back market share from Apple's iPhone and Research in Motion's BlackBerry, said new phones featuring Windows Phone 7 would be in stores by Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overhaul of Microsoft's phone technology, a year later than expected, comes as it hemorrhages market share in the smartphone market, which many see as the key to the future of communication and media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft took just an 8.8 percent share of the global smartphone operating systems market last year, according to technology analysis firm Canalys, down from 13.9 percent the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Georgina Prodhan; Editing by Greg Mahlich)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BARCELONA (Reuters) - Microsoft's new mobile software launched on Monday should speak for itself and the company has no current need to buy a mobile device maker or materially change its license fees, its chief executive said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Ballmer declined to comment on reports Microsoft's new search engine Bing might replace Google on Apple's iPhone, but smiled when asked the question in an interview at the Mobile World Congress trade fair in Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to Reuters as Microsoft launched Phone 7, which it hopes will help it claw back some market share [ID:nLDE61B275], Steve Ballmer said the new software would distinguish Microsoft's smartphones from anything else on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Look at the user experience around these new phones, and they're really quite different from anything that lives in the smartphone world today," he told Reuters Television on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new software is more geared to the leisure aspects of the lives of its core business customers, and includes features of Microsoft's Xbox gaming and Zune music player as well as Microsoft Office and social networking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many analysts believe Microsoft needs to make a more radical move, such as buying a hardware maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked whether Microsoft might ever buy a more fashionable rival, like BlackBerry maker Research in Motion, Ballmer said: "The word 'ever' is a big word but I certainly don't feel like that's the right strategy for us today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said no major change should be expected in the company's policy of charging license fees to handset makers for its mobile software. Microsoft is the only major company to still charge a fee for using its mobile operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't comment generally but there's nothing that interestingly new," he said. Later, he told a news conference: "We plan on staying with the model that we are on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One potential bright spot in the fortunes of Microsoft's consumer business is the prospect of replacing Google as the default search engine on Apple's iPhone -- a possibility that has been rumored in recent media reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about the reports, Ballmer said "I wouldn't comment either way," but smiled, and repeated the phrase when the reporter remarked that Ballmer looked happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Apple displaced Google from its preferred status on the smartphone, it would be perhaps the clearest sign of the growing tension between two Silicon Valley icons that were considered allies in a common cause against Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google's chief mobile engineer, Vic Gundotra, said earlier that Apple was a "very close and valuable partner" and he saw no reason for that to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer also declined to comment on whether the desktop version of Windows might one day run on mobile devices based on ARM chip designs -- a move that could change the dynamics of the burgeoning netbook market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, ARM designs dominate in smartphones but Intel chips run most notebooks and also the smaller, lower-cost netbooks designed for simple tasks such as Web browsing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Matt Cowan, writing by Georgina Prodhan; editing by John Stonestreet)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAKAR (Reuters) - West Africans are consuming more of the drugs trafficked between South America and Europe, raising the specter of rising crime and health problems in already unstable states, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The region, an established transit point for Latin American cocaine to big Western markets, has also become a drug processing site amid rising addiction rates, and drug-related violence will follow, they told a drug summit over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A flourishing illicit trade in the hands of organized crime is obviously a threat to the rule of law, governance and, as a result, human rights," said Alexandre Schmidt, West African head for the U.N. Office for Drugs and Crime (UNODC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But we must no longer hide the indirect consequences with regard to the increase in problems linked to drug abuse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 20 tones of cocaine passed through West Africa in 2008, worth about $1 billion, the United Nations says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The warnings came during a meeting of seven West African governments who, backed by the United Nations, France and Spain, are seeking to implement declarations of intent to curb trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALARMING TRENDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drugs trade through West Africa grabbed headlines in 2007 after a series of seizures of hundreds of kg of cocaine were made in the region alongside a spike up in violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guinea-Bissau, the landing point for most of the cocaine, saw a string of political assassinations that analysts say was linked to the drugs trade, and the notoriously brutal military in neighboring Guinea was also believed to be involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now West African nations are sounding the alarm over new trends of increased domestic drug use that could boost theft, gang violence, and health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are also increasingly becoming consumers of the drugs we transit," Adrienne Diop, a commissioner for regional body ECOWAS, said in a presentation made on her behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although concrete figures are hard to come by, experts said there was clear evidence of a rise in local use of cocaine and crack. Citing research in Cape Verde, the region's initial drug hot-spot, Margarete Molnar, a health specialist at UNODC, said drug use was entrenched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This shows that being on the route of trafficking is a disaster," she said. "(Law enforcement) may protect West Africa and Europe but I can tell you that in this region there are people who are hard drug users who need to be rehabilitated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A string of local health workers attending the summit also called for an increased focus on rehabilitating existing drug users instead of a purely law-enforcement approach to stamping down on the international trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Strategies have not been thought of for the youth," said Aissatou Thiam an educator in Senegal's Ministry for Youth and Sport. "They need to come up with plans to tackle the issues of the youth, who are turning to drugs because of poverty, amongst other issues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Richard Valdmanis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Windows 7 phones to be in stores by Christmas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * New software comes a year later than expected&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft mobile market share fell to 9 pct in 2009&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Georgina Prodhan and Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BARCELONA/SEATTLE, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O)
launched a long-awaited revamp of its mobile phone software on
Monday, aimed at reviving the flagging fortunes of the world's
biggest software maker in the mobile world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, trying to claw back market share from Apple's
(AAPL.O) iPhone and Research in Motion's RIM.TO BlackBerry,
said Windows Phone 7 would cater for all aspects of the lives of
businesspeople, including social networking, games and music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft took just 8.8 percent share of the global
smartphone operating system market last year, according to
technology analysis firm Canalys, down from 13.9 percent the
year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It trails Symbian, which runs on Nokia (NOK1V.HE) phones,
RIM's BlackBerry and Apple's iPhone. It is even in danger of
being caught by Google's (GOOG.O) new Android system, which
already has 4.7 percent share of the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's core customers have remained firmly rooted in
the business world, while rivals have broadened their appeal to
younger buyers as prices fell. Microsoft is also the only major
phone software maker to charge a licence fee to handset makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Handset makers such as HTC (2498.TW), Samsung (005930.KS)
and Motorola MOT.N all make Windows phones but are
increasingly turning to Android, which is not only free but
attracting a fast-growing developer community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speaking to Reuters Television, Chief Executive Steve
Ballmer said Phone 7 was not aimed specifically at consumers but
rather at business people who also had a life. [ID:nLDE61E197]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're really trying to go after the life market. People
work, they live, and I think on their phone they don't make a
big distinction, so we need to support all aspects of somebody's
life," Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The update comes after a lukewarm reception for Windows
Mobile 6.5 in October, which most analysts viewed as a poor
competitor in the fast-developing market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aside from users of Windows operating systems, Microsoft's
consumer business is modest. Its entertainment and devices unit
posted a profit of $169 million last fiscal year, a fraction of
the almost $11 billion profit from its Windows franchise.

Aldata / IBM Retail CIO Survey Shows Increased IT Spending and Focus on Optimizing Processes for Fast ROI</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Aldata Solution, a leading provider of software solutions for the retail
industry, today released findings from the second annual Global Retail CIO
Survey, jointly sponsored with IBM. The survey showed that IT budgets appear to
be recovering after the initial downturn at the start of last year`s recession,
with averages for all retailers at 1.3% of sales compared to 1% last year.
Twenty-six percent of respondents expect their IT budget to increase; the same
figure as last year. However, while last year`s survey showed that increase to
relate to projects already underway, this year`s interviews revealed more
aggressive plans to implement new systems. The survey of 109 retail CIOs and IT
Directors in both the Americas and Europe was undertaken in Q4 2009 by retail
industry research specialists Martec International. 

This year`s Global Retail CIO Survey clearly shows that optimizing the product /
place / promotion offer is becoming an increasingly critical element of retail
IT spend. More than 50% of retailers will be upgrading, replacing or
implementing new systems in areas such as Automated Replenishment (52%),
Assortment Optimization (58%), Promotions Optimization (56%), Promotions
Management (54%), with a further 46% looking to invest in Demand Forecasting.
Master Data Management (MDM) has the highest planned implementation of all
applications studied in the survey, both across the Enterprise (35%) and for
Supplier Management (28%). 

"The top line statistics from this year`s survey, and indeed last year`s,
suggest that the retail sector has survived the recession remarkably
effectively," said Allan Davies, CMO, Aldata Solution. "The truth is, though,
that while the downturn hasn`t halted retailers` IT spend, it has certainly
changed the way that money is spent. Gone are the days of end-to-end, rip and
replace projects, and instead we`re seeing a big focus on process optimization.
Retail CIOs are not afraid of investing in new projects, but they need to see a
quick return on investment. And by quick, I`m talking about months, not years." 

Customer is King

Systems to attract and keep customers featured prominently in this year`s
survey. Multi-channel CRM was ranked as the most important application by
respondents, with 42% having yet to implement multi-channel CRM, but with plans
to do so within the next three years. Similarly 38% of CIOs surveyed plan to
implement Loyalty systems - with customer data linked to buying patterns and
behavior - within the next three years. And finally, systems that support the
safety of customers were considered the most important application by 47% of
respondents. 

Sustainability Not a Priority

For the first time, attitudes to sustainability were considered as part of the
research. Respondents were asked to score the impact of sustainability on IT
spend and strategy on a scale of 1 to 10 (with 10 being the highest). The
average emerged as a lukewarm 5.1. Views appeared to be polarized, with 13%
considering sustainability to have a negligible impact on IT strategy, while 6%
considered it to have a major impact. In terms of which applications retailers
feel are having the greatest impact on sustainability, applications for store
operations came top of the list. For the future, more retailers believe that
multi-channel retailing will have the biggest impact on sustainability. 

Methodology

The Aldata-IBM Global Retail CIO Survey was conducted by retail industry
research specialists Martec International to assist retailers in benchmarking
their IT strategy and use of technology against their peers. The 2010 Global
Retail CIO Survey incorporates the views of retailers from 28 countries
generating at least $100 million in annual revenue, whose combined sales
represent $528 billion from more than 62,000 stores. This equates to 8 percent
of the total retail market in the Americas and Europe by sales. A total of 109
CIOs and IT directors in category-management-style retailers were interviewed
for this report. Participants included a mix of both food and non-food retailers
from across North America and Europe. The survey provides insights into current
retail IT spending plans and priorities.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - China could be about to allow its currency to strengthen by as much as 5 percent to slow down the country's fast-growing economy, Goldman Sachs' (GS.N) chief economist was quoted as saying on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I have a strong opinion that they're close to moving the exchange rate," Jim O'Neill told Bloomberg. "Something's brewing. It could happen anytime."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news service said O'Neill believes China may allow the yuan to rise as much as 5 percent in a one-time revaluation and to then trade within a bigger band or against a larger basket of currencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They need to do something to slow the economy down and deal with the inflation consequences," he was quoted as saying. O'Neill believes China's economy is growing between 12 percent and 14 percent, Bloomberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Bank has forecast China's economy will grow 9 percent this year, faster than global growth of 2.7 percent. Beijing said it expanded by 8.7 percent in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve James; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BARCELONA Feb 15 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) launched
its new mobile phone operating software on Monday, introducing a
range of music, gaming and networking features aimed at
expanding its appeal beyond its core business customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The world's biggest software company, which is trying to
wrest back market share from Apple's (AAPL.O) iPhone and
Research in Motion's RIM.TO BlackBerry, said new phones
featuring Windows Phone 7 would be in stores by Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The overhaul of Microsoft's phone technology, a year later
than expected, comes as it haemorrhages market share in the
smartphone market, which many see as the key to the future of
communication and media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft took just an 8.8 percent share of the global
smartphone operating systems market last year, according to
technology analysis firm Canalys, down from 13.9 percent the
year before.

&lt;p&gt;TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libya has suspended the issuing of entry visas to European citizens apart from British nationals, an official at the country's main international airport said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked by Reuters to confirm reports of the move, the official, who did not want to be identified, said: "This is right. This decision has been taken. No visas for Europeans, except Britain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No explanation was given for the suspension, and there was no immediate confirmation from the Libyan government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Italy's foreign ministry confirmed the measure and said it was in retaliation for Switzerland's recent decision to publish a blacklist of 180 Libyans banned from entering the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Libya has been locked for months in a diplomatic row with Switzerland over the prosecution of two Swiss businessmen who had been working in the North African country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Libyan response to the Swiss decision has affected all the countries of the Schengen zone," said a spokesman for the Italian foreign ministry. "Contacts are under way between the countries of the zone to coordinate over this measure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Libya's Oea newspaper, which has close ties to a son of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, earlier reported that Libya would stop issuing visas to citizens of countries in the Schengen area, which includes non-EU member Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ali Shuaib; Writing by Christian Lowe; Editing by Mark Trevelyan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L`alliance vise &#224; transformer les t&#233;l&#233;phones portables en dispositifs mobiles de
paiement Visa
BARCELONE, Espagne--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE : V), le plus grand r&#233;seau du monde de paiement &#233;lectronique de
d&#233;tail1, et DeviceFidelity Inc. ont annonc&#233; aujourd`hui leur projet de
commercialiser une solution innovatrice gr&#226;ce &#224; laquelle il sera possible
d`utiliser un t&#233;l&#233;phone portable dot&#233; d`un emplacement pour carte m&#233;moire comme
dispositif mobile de paiement Visa. 

La solution allie la technologie de paiement sans contact de Visa, Visa payWave,
&#224; la technologie In2PayTM de DeviceFidelity pour transformer un t&#233;l&#233;phone
portable dot&#233; d`un emplacement pour m&#233;moire microSD en dispositif mobile de
paiement sans contact. Ceci peut donner la possibilit&#233; aux consommateurs
d`effectuer des transactions Visa payWave via mobile chez tous les commer&#231;ants
qui acceptent les paiements sans contact. Les essais devraient d&#233;buter au
deuxi&#232;me trimestre 2010. 

Cette collaboration s`inscrit dans la strat&#233;gie mobile de Visa visant &#224; &#233;tendre
la port&#233;e de son r&#233;seau international pour apporter les paiements via mobile et
les services connexes aux consommateurs du monde entier. Avec plus de 4
milliards d`appareils portables sur le march&#233; &#224; l`heure actuelle, Visa, en
partenariat avec des institutions financi&#232;res, des exploitants de r&#233;seaux
mobiles et des fabricants de combin&#233;s, s`attache &#224; faire b&#233;n&#233;ficier les
consommateurs du monde entier des avantages des services financiers via mobile. 

&#171; L`objectif de Visa est de d&#233;velopper des moyens innovants d`apporter
l`avantage de la monnaie num&#233;rique Visa aux utilisateurs d`appareils mobiles du
monde entier &#187;, a indiqu&#233; Dave Wentker, responsable du service des paiements
sans contact via mobile chez Visa Inc. &#171; Par le biais de sa collaboration avec
DeviceFidelity, Visa contribue &#224; acc&#233;l&#233;rer l`adoption des paiements sans contact
via mobile et &#224; ouvrir la voie au d&#233;ploiement &#224; l`&#233;chelle internationale des

f&#252;r Verbraucher auf der ganzen Welt. 

&#8222;Ziel von Visa ist die Entwicklung innovativer M&#246;glichkeiten, Handynutzern rund
um die Welt den Wert der elektronischen Zahlungen mit Visa n&#228;her zu bringen",
sagte Dave Wentker, Leiter der Abteilung Mobile Contactless Payments bei Visa
Inc. &#8222;Unsere Zusammenarbeit mit DeviceFidelity hilft Visa bei der Beschleunigung
der Einf&#252;hrung kontaktloser Zahlungsm&#246;glichkeiten &#252;ber Mobiltelefone und ebnet
den Weg f&#252;r den globalen Einsatz von NFC-f&#228;higen Ger&#228;ten." 

Das globale Netzwerk VisaNet zur Verarbeitung von Transaktionen und die
Technologie von Visa zur kontaktlosen Bezahlung spielen eine entscheidende Rolle
bei der sicheren Verarbeitung von Transaktionen, die mit der L&#246;sung In2Pay
ausgel&#246;st werden, denn sie bieten Echtzeitbetrugs&#252;berwachung und
Verschl&#252;sselungstechnologien, die gemeinsam betr&#252;gerische F&#228;lschungsversuche
verhindern und sicherstellen, dass die &#252;ber ein Mobiltelefon ausgel&#246;sten
Visa-Transaktionen so sicher sind wie alle anderen Zahlungsm&#246;glichkeiten mit
Visa. 

&#8222;Wir setzen uns zusammen mit der Branche daf&#252;r ein, dass das wahre Versprechen
von Mobiltelefonen eingel&#246;st und ein neues Zahlungsangebot &#252;ber drahtlose
Verbindungen eingef&#252;hrt wird, das schneller, sicherer und bequemer ist als
herk&#246;mmliche Formen des bargeldlosen Bezahlens", sagte Deepak Jain, CEO von
DeviceFidelity. &#8222;Wir freuen uns, zusammen mit Visa, dem Branchenf&#252;hrer bei
Zahlungsmethoden, an der Verwirklichung mobiler Zahlungsm&#246;glichkeiten in L&#228;ndern
rund um die Welt zu arbeiten." 

Die L&#246;sung In2Pay entspricht der Speicherchip-Industrienorm microSD und passt in
den Speicherkartenschlitz von vielen Mobilger&#228;ten auf dem heutigen Markt. 

In2Pay kann nahtlos in mehrere Betriebssysteme von Mobiltelefonen integriert
werden, wodurch eine flexible Anwendungsschnittstelle und Interaktivit&#228;t mit dem
Verbraucher erm&#246;glicht werden. In2Pay enth&#228;lt eine eingebaute,
softwaregesteuerte Antenne und einen der Industrienorm entsprechenden
Dual-Interface-Smartcard-Chip f&#252;r kontaktlose Anwendungen, der Visa payWave
sowie andere beliebte Anwendungen f&#252;r den Verkehrsbereich sowie f&#252;r
Identifikationen und Zugangskontrollen unterst&#252;tzt. 

Neben DeviceFidelity arbeitet Visa auch mit anderen wichtigen
Technologieanbietern und strategischen B&#252;ndnispartnern zusammen, um diese
innovative kontaktlose Zahlungstechnologie &#252;ber Mobilger&#228;te zu testen und
einzuf&#252;hren. Dazu z&#228;hlen die CPI Card Group, Inside Contactless, Monitise plc
und NXP Semiconductors. 

1 Gest&#252;tzt auf Zahlungsvolumen, Gesamtvolumen, Anzahl Transaktionen und
Gesamtanzahl von Karten im Umlauf. 

&#220;ber Visa

Visa ist ein im Zahlungsverkehr t&#228;tiges globales Technologieunternehmen, das
Verbrauchern, Gesch&#228;ften, Finanzinstituten und Beh&#246;rden in &#252;ber 200 L&#228;ndern und
Gebieten schnell, sicher und zuverl&#228;ssig Zugang zu elektronischem Geld gibt.
Untermauert wird dieser Zugang durch VisaNet, eines der fortschrittlichsten
Verarbeitungsnetzwerke der Welt. VisaNet kann &#252;ber 10.000 Transaktionen pro
Sekunde bew&#228;ltigen, sch&#252;tzt Verbraucher vor Betrugsf&#228;llen und garantiert
H&#228;ndlern den Zahlungseingang. Visa ist keine Bank, stellt keine Karten aus,
gew&#228;hrt keine Verl&#228;ngerungen der Zahlungsfrist und legt auch keine Tarife und
Geb&#252;hren f&#252;r Verbraucher fest. Die Innovationen von Visa machen es jedoch
m&#246;glich, dass Finanzinstitute ihren Kunden eine gr&#246;&#223;ere Produktauswahl bieten
k&#246;nnen: Zahlungen k&#246;nnen gleich mit Debit-, zum Voraus mit Prepaid- oder im
Nachhinein mit Kreditprodukten erledigt werden. Weitere Informationen finden Sie

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Feb 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
arranged a currency swap for Greece that it failed to disclose
and that allowed the country, now facing a debt crisis, to hide
the extent of its deficit, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street bank managed $15 billion of bond sales for
the European country after arranging the swap, Bloomberg
reported, citing a review of the prospectuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No mention of the swap was made in sales documents for the
securities in at least six of the 10 sales Goldman arranged for
Greece since the deal, the report said. It added the bank
helped Greece raise $1 billion of off-balance-sheet funding in
2002 through the swap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman spokesman was not immediately available to
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Greece has required a political pledge of support from the
European Union as fears over its debt sparked a market attack
that has dented the euro and lifted bond yields.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights MWI Veterinary Supply (Nasdaq: MWIV) as the
Bull of the Day and Tessera Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: TSRA) the Bear of the
Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Transocean (NYSE:
RIG), Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

MWI Veterinary Supply's (Nasdaq: MWIV) first quarter of 2010 earnings per share
came in at $0.63, well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.50 and the
year-ago earnings of $0.48. 

The company reported revenues of $236.1 million, an increase of 2% compared to
the corresponding quarter of last year. Through its latest acquisition of
UK-based Centaur Services, MWI is looking to expand its presence in the
international market as well. 

Although negative trends in the general economy could reduce consumer
discretionary spending on animal health products, we are pleased with MWIV's
robust growth over the past few years and the strong outlook. Given these
factors, we upgrade the stock to Outperform. 

Bear of the Day: 

Tessera Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: TSRA) is a provider of back-end technology
for semiconductor manufacturing. The company's technology enables
miniaturization of electronic goods, which is a driver of IC sales in the market
today. 

Consequently, the host of patents, new technologies, customer wins, volume
production at customers, ongoing strength in the DRAM market and the licensing
model that supports attractive margins are positives. However, protection of
intellectual property (IP) for a company this small is a challenge, as are the
inherent pricing pressures in the DRAM market. 

Our estimates reflect the poor performance we expect of Tessera, as the company
is impacted by its own pricing policies. We continue to expect only slight
sequential growth in each quarter of 2010, indicating another weak year. We are
reiterating our Underperform recommendation on TSRA shares.

Further Tightening from China

In sustaining a breakneck economic expansion over the last two decades that has
moved tens of millions of poor Chinese into the ranks of a growing middle class,
the Chinese authorities have charted their own course. In the process, they have
made their country the third (or almost second) largest economy in the world
behind the U.S. and Japan and a major driver of global growth. 

China`s centrality to the global economy makes today`s announcement on bank
reserves that much more important to the markets. This is particularly so given
recent market jitters about Greece-related sovereign risk issues, which only
receded to the background after eliciting a response from the EU authorities.
The U.S. Fed has also been choreographing its exit strategy by terminating its
mortgage purchases in the coming weeks and incentivizing banks to keep excess
reserves at the central bank through higher interest rates. 

All this, with a backdrop of continued doubts about the sustainability of the
U.S. recovery, has kept stocks range-bound despite solid fourth-quarter 2009
results. I don`t think today`s announcement from China will be helpful to the
markets, either. 

Particularly exposed will be commodities and basic materials, though any company
with a China exposure (effectively everyone) will be under pressure. Look for
oil, copper, coal and the other commodities to give back recent gains. As a
result, oil-levered names like Transocean (NYSE: RIG) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX)
and copper producer, Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) may be under pressure. I would
expect to see weakness in emerging-markets-related equities as well.

&lt;p&gt;ATHENS (Reuters) - A bomb exploded on Tuesday outside the Athens offices of JP Morgan, the second largest U.S. bank by assets, causing minor damage and no injuries, police and the company said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The explosion is the latest in a series of blasts that have rocked the country since the police killing of a teenager in December 2008 sparked the country's worst riots in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a time-bomb outside JP Morgan's offices at the second floor of an Athens building," said a police official who declined to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The explosion damaged the door, furniture, computers and smashed some windows," the official added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police had cordoned off the area after a local newspaper received a warning call. Ambulances and fire engines blocked streets in the upmarket central district of Kolonaki, where JP Morgan's Greek offices are situated, a Reuters witness said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan confirmed the incident and said there were no injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No one was hurt," said a JP Morgan spokesman in New York. "The company is still gathering details about the situation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, the New-York based firm came under scrutiny by Greek investigators' after underwriting 280 million euros ($382.2 million) of structured government bonds which ended up with state pension funds at inflated prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan, which denied any wrongdoing, agreed to buy back the bonds and reverse the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks, foreign companies and police are a frequent target of leftist groups in Greece. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack, the official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urban guerrillas exploded a makeshift bomb outside Greece's parliament in January, causing no injuries and minor damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other attacks since the teenager shooting, guerrilla groups killed a Greek antiterrorism officer and bombed the Athens Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Elinor Comlay in New York)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co will buy the non-U.S. assets of commodities joint venture RBS Sempra from Royal Bank of Scotland and Sempra Energy for $1.7 billion cash, roughly doubling its commodities client base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal could clear the way for Sempra (SRE.N) to buy out RBS and take total control of the joint venture's U.S. trading operation, which provides Sempra with a key profit stream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sempra executives told a conference call they may buy RBS's stake in the U.S. operations of the joint venture, although they remain open to seeking an outside buyer or partner to replace RBS (RBS.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sempra has appointed JPMorgan as its adviser as it reviews alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan (JPM.N), which has been expanding its commodities arm aggressively in recent years, will take the RBS Sempra global oil and metals and European power and gas assets under the deal, which is set to close in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank initially was in talks to buy the whole joint venture. But a proposal by the Obama administration to prohibit proprietary trading by banks prompted JPMorgan leave behind RBS Sempra's North American power and gas assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have a high probability chance that Sempra will buy it back," said Lasan Johong, analyst at RBC Capital Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valuing the entire partnership at about $4 billion, he said, Sempra could likely buy the U.S. operation for about $88 million, plus its share of the proceeds from the JPMorgan deal announced on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given the net economics of the business, this is pretty much a no-brainer," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partly-nationalized RBS has been forced to slim down and sell off a string of assets, including its stake in RBS Sempra, which it acquired in April 2008, to appease European Union antitrust concerns after it received billions in state aid during the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale of a major part of the RBS Sempra venture marks a key step forward for RBS, which has signaled it wants to move quickly to put the past, and uncertainties related to the sales, behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOP TIER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is eager to expand its commodities arm, run by Blythe Masters, who has said she wants the bank to become a top-tier franchise globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan strengthened its North American power and gas assets with the 2008 acquisition of Bear Stearns. Snapping up a large part of RBS Sempra will boost the bank's aim of taking on the top three commodities firms: Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Barclays (BARC.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This helps us build out our capabilities so that there's really nothing to separate us from the bulge bracket players who have dominated in this space for the last couple of decades," Masters told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traders at RBS Sempra -- 49 percent owned by Sempra Energy and 51 percent by RBS -- welcomed the news of the deal after months of uncertainty prompted a string of staff departures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's lovely to have some news after four months of knowing nothing. It all looks promising," said a trader at RBS Sempra. "I wouldn't expect any job losses ... This will be a complement and (it) takes us into a different league."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEMPRA OPTIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sempra Chief Executive Donald Felsinger said Sempra and RBS would adjust their current ownership to a  50-50 split after the deal closes in order to make it easier for RBS to sell its U.S. stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sempra said its share of the sale proceeds was expected to be $941 million. The San Diego utility owner generated $274 million in profit from its commodities trading operations in the first nine months of 2009, or about a third of its earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Mark Snell said the company was in talks with both RBS and JPMorgan for the banks to provide liquidity and credit support to Sempra in the event it was to buy out RBS's stake so that it would not have raise money to support the operation through a share issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That is really the only way that we think this would be a good deal for our shareholders is if we could do a transaction and keep any kind of equity dilution to an absolute minimum or none at all," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the current structure, RBS's balance sheet carried the liabilities for billions of dollars of trade from the JV's trading operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares were up 91 cents to $38.86, while Sempra shares pared earlier gains and fell 0.4 percent, or 18 cents, to $49.30, both on the New York Stock Exchange. RBS closed up 5.3 percent in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Emma Farge in London and Elinor Comlay in New York; Editing by Dan Lalor, John Wallace and Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

really nothing to separate us from the bulge bracket players
who have dominated in this space for the last couple of
decades," Masters told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traders at RBS Sempra -- 49 percent owned by Sempra Energy
and 51 percent by RBS -- welcomed the news of the deal after
months of uncertainty prompted a string of staff departures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's lovely to have some news after four months of knowing

million in profit from its commodities trading operations in
the first nine months of 2009, or about a third of its
earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Financial Officer Mark Snell said the company was in
talks with both RBS and JPMorgan for the banks to provide
liquidity and credit support to Sempra in the event it was to
buy out RBS's stake so that it would not have raise money to
support the operation through a share issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That is really the only way that we think this would be a
good deal for our shareholders is if we could do a transaction
and keep any kind of equity dilution to an absolute minimum or
none at all," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the current structure, RBS's balance sheet carried
the liabilities for billions of dollars of trade from the JV's
trading operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan shares were up 91 cents to $38.86, while Sempra
shares pared earlier gains and fell 0.4 percent, or 18 cents,
to $49.30, both on the New York Stock Exchange. RBS closed up
5.3 percent in London.

3 d&#233;voilent la ligne de jouets 2010 et des d&#233;tails sur le film 
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Toy Story 3, le film de Disney-Pixar, a donn&#233; le coup d`envoi du salon
international du jouet am&#233;ricain aujourd`hui, l`American International Toy Fair,
&#224; New York, avec une pl&#233;thore de nouveaux jouets et jeux qui rendent hommage au
meilleur de ce que le secteur du jouet a &#224; offrir. Dans un d&#233;cor ludique sur le
th&#232;me de Toy Story, devant un public nombreux d`acteurs de l`industrie admis
uniquement sur invitation, des soldats verts sont descendus du plafond en mode &#171;
prise de pouvoir &#187; et ont aid&#233; John Lasseter, pr&#233;sident directeur de la cr&#233;ation
des studios de Walt Disney et de Pixar Animation, Lee Unkrich, r&#233;alisateur de
Toy Story 3, Darla K. Anderson, productrice de Toy Story 3 et John Ratzenberger,

(Remarque du r&#233;dacteur : des images et de la documentation li&#233;es &#224; la
manifestation sont disponibles &#224; l`adresse
www.disneyconsumerproducts.com/press/us pas d`ouverture de session requise)

Toy Story est le plus grand &#233;v&#233;nement d`octroi de licences de jouets de 2010 et
la seule franchise cin&#233;matographique qui galvanise le secteur du jouet avec une
gamme sans pr&#233;c&#233;dent de la part de Disney Consumer Products et de plus de 20
fabricants de jouets de r&#233;putation mondiale, dont Thinkway Toys, Mattel, The
LEGO Group, HASBRO, JAKKS Pacific et Fisher-Price. Revendiquant &#224; ce jour 8
milliards USD de ventes mondiales de marchandises depuis sa sortie en 1995, Toy
Story continuera &#224; susciter l`enthousiasme des d&#233;taillants &#224; travers la plan&#232;te
et &#224; animer les moments de jeu des enfants. La nouvelle ligne de jouets Toy
Story 3 comprend des figurines, poup&#233;es, jeux de r&#244;le, coffrets de jeux,
panoplies, jeux de construction, v&#233;hicules, peluches et robots parlants qui
pourraient tr&#232;s bien prendre vie quand les enfants ont le dos tourn&#233;. 

Les r&#233;alisateurs du film ont &#233;galement r&#233;v&#233;l&#233; un aper&#231;u de Toy Story 3, tant
attendu, avec une nouvelle bande-annonce pr&#233;sentant un ours en peluche nomm&#233;
Lots-O`-Huggin` Bear (l`ours &#171; Tout plein de c&#226;lins &#187;), l`un des 14 nouveaux
jouets figurant dans la halte-garderie Sunnyside de Toy Story 3, et le premier
jouet en peluche &#224; faire son apparition dans la franchise du film. La
bande-annonce, qui sera diffus&#233;e ce soir sur Disney Channel, pr&#233;sente &#233;galement
en avant-premi&#232;re une s&#233;quence explosive de train ainsi qu`une foule d`autres
nouveaux personnages. La nouvelle ligne de Toy Story 3 comprendra en outre des
jouets inspir&#233;s par ces nouveaux personnages, offrant aux enfants des heures
d`amusement tandis qu`ils rejoueront des sc&#232;nes du nouveau long m&#233;trage. 

&#171; J`ai toujours eu une passion et une fascination pour les jouets, et c`est de
l&#224; que provient l`id&#233;e initiale de Toy Story, a confi&#233; John Lasseter. &#171; Lorsque
nous nous sommes lanc&#233;s dans la cr&#233;ation de Toy Story, j`ai imagin&#233; cet
extraordinaire groupe de personnages qui divertiraient enfants et familles
pendant des heures. Et c`est aussi ce que nous avons l`intention de faire avec
les jouets inspir&#233;s du film. Travaillant avec certains des meilleurs fabricants
de jouets, nous avons tenu compte de chaque d&#233;tail afin de d&#233;velopper une
excellente ligne de jouets qui soit fid&#232;le &#224; cette franchise. Si je jette un
coup d`&#339;il dans la salle aujourd`hui, je pense qu`une fois encore, nous avons
r&#233;alis&#233; notre vision avec Toy Story 3. &#187; 

Hier soir, John Lasseter a &#233;t&#233; intronis&#233; au Panth&#233;on des jouets lors du banquet
de remise des prix du Jouet de l`ann&#233;e organis&#233; par l`Association de l`industrie
du jouet (Toy Industry Association). Avec des succ&#232;s de l`ampleur de Toy Story
et de Cars, il a donn&#233; vie aux jouets &#224; l`&#233;cran d`une mani&#232;re magique, et a
suscit&#233; hors &#233;cran l`engouement des enfants et des collectionneurs envers des
produits inspir&#233;s du film depuis pr&#232;s de 15 ans. John Lasseter marche sur les
traces de Walt Disney, intronis&#233; au Panth&#233;on des jouets en 1987. 

&#171; Toy Story est la seule franchise qui r&#233;unisse les meilleurs produits
classiques ind&#233;modables tels que Barbie, Chatter Phone et Monsieur Patate, et
les associe &#224; la cr&#233;ativit&#233; et &#224; l`art de la narration qui sous-tendent les
nouveaux personnages de Toy Story, devenus des jouets classiques de plein droit,
notamment Woody, Buzz Lightyear et Jessie &#187;, a expliqu&#233; Vince Klaseus,
vice-pr&#233;sident directeur des jouets mondiaux pour Disney Consumer Products. &#171;
Les enfants vont &#234;tre s&#233;duits, car la nouvelle ligne de jouets de Toy Story 3

mouvement, et les collectionneurs ne seront pas d&#233;&#231;us &#224; l`heure o&#249; l`assortiment

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The proposed sale of RBS Sempra Commodities' LLP (SC) European and Asian
operations to J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM) was announced by The Royal Bank of
Scotland (RBS) and Sempra Energy (SRE) earlier today. If completed, proceeds
from the proposed sale are estimated at $1.7 billion, with SRE's share expected
to approximate $940 million. Fitch believes no credit rating action is currently
warranted and intends to resolve the continuing Negative Rating Watch upon
disposition of the remaining operations of the joint venture (JV). 

Fitch believes loss of earnings and cash flow from SC's European and Asian
business, which contributed just under 50% of total SC earnings in recent years,
is likely to pressure SRE's credit metrics. Fitch placed SRE and its
subsidiaries' ratings on Rating Watch Negative on Feb. 2, 2010 reflecting the
likely, moderate deterioration in SRE's credit metrics as the result of the sale
of SC, higher parent company debt leverage in recent years, and declining
profitability at Sempra Generation. Other options for SC's remaining North
American Power &amp; Gas business, including retention of a portion of the trading
business by SRE, raise additional credit concerns given the liquidity and
capital requirements to operate the business, in Fitch's opinion. (For further
information, please refer to Fitch's press release on SRE dated Feb. 2, 2010.) 

The proposed sale is an important first step in the process of finalizing the
ultimate ownership structure of the JV. The sale of the European and Asian
assets requires regulatory approval from the U.K. Financial Services Authority
and various antitrust regulators, including the Swiss Federal Market Supervisory
Authority ,and review under the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. The transaction is
expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2010. Concomitant with
announced sale, SRE disclosed that it has retained J.P. Morgan as its financial
advisor to review potential alternatives for the North American Power and Gas
business. 

In addition, SRE also announced that it is in negotiations with RBS to change
the partnership profit allocation methodology to a simple 50-50 sharing,
eliminating the preferred return structure adopted heretofore. Under the
preferred methodology, SRE and RBS earned a 15% return on regulatory capital
(approximately $240 million). After return on regulatory capital, SRE received
70% of the next $500 million of pretax income and 30% of pretax income beyond
$500 million. Importantly, RBS will continue to provide credit and liquidity
support under the original terms of the JV until the ownership issue is
resolved. Since the announcement of the JV in July 2007 and its formation in
April 2008, SRE has received approximately $1.7 billion of cash from the JV.
That amount will increase to a cumulative $2.6 billion when the European and
Asian operations sale is finalized. 

The final purchase price for SC's European and Asian operations will be
determined at the close of the transaction and based on the tangible net book
value of the business plus a fixed premium of $468 million. SC is a joint
venture formed in April 2008. RBS owns 51% of the JV and SRE the remaining 49%
ownership interest.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) added 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent to its proved oil and gas reserves in 2009, or 133 percent of its production for that year, the largest U.S. oil company said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large Western oil companies' efforts to boost reserves have been stalled as they are increasingly barred from investing in the world's richest oil prospects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Venezuela and Russia reserve their richest fields for state-owned oil companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reserve additions from the Papua New Guinea LNG project and the Gorgon Jansz liquefied natural gas project in Australia totaled almost 1 billion BOE, Exxon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To estimate its reserves, Exxon used long-term pricing instead of the 12-month averages required under rules from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the SEC's pricing basis, proved reserves replacement was 1.5 billion BOE, replacing 100 percent of production, including the effect of asset sales, oil sands extracted by mining and equity company reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On that basis, Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov described the company's 2009 reserve replacement rate as "uninspiring," but noted it was an improvement over the last two years, where Exxon reported reserve declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors see replacement of more than 100 percent of annual oil and gas output is seen as a sign of growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil's proved reserve base, using the company's definition of year-end reserves, increased to 23.3 billion BOE in 2009.

 (Adds analyst comment; updates share price)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Anna Driver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOUSTON, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) added
2 billion barrels of oil equivalent to its proved oil and gas
reserves in 2009, or 133 percent of its production for that
year, the largest U.S. oil company said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Large Western oil companies' efforts to boost reserves have

&lt;p&gt; * New national 3G coverage for Mexico&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Would allow faster delivery of wireless services&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * NII stock jumps 6 percent, Televisa flat
 (Adds Televisa, Soleil comment, byline; updates share prices)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Cyntia Barrera Diaz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MEXICO CITY, Feb 16 (Reuters) - NII Holdings Inc said on
Tuesday it would deploy a new 3G network across Mexico to allow
fast wireless access to phone, video and data services, if a
planned deal with broadcaster Televisa moves ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa (TLVACPO.MX)(TV.N) said on Monday it would buy a
30 percent stake in NII's NIHD.O Nextel Mexico wireless
operator as long as their joint bid for new wireless capacity
succeeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa would pay $1.44 billion for the Nextel Mexico
stake. The deal includes an option to purchase another 7.5
percent stake in Nextel Mexico, the country's No. 4 wireless
phone company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We plan to develop new services and applications that
capitalize on the two companies' extensive experience in
serving customers in Mexico, including plans to deploy a new 3G
network throughout the country," NII Chief Executive Officer
Steven Dussek told analysts during a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of NII Holdings, which did not trade on Monday due
to a U.S. market holiday, rose 6.7 percent to $38.49 in
mid-morning trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A 3G, or third-generation, network would mean a departure
from NII Holdings' iDen technology, which works well for
walkie-talkie types of communications, but is not optimal for
data transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe the expansion of a 3G network by NII can
significantly expand the company's addressable market and
represents substantial upside to our current estimates," said
analyst Michael Nelson from Soleil Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa wants to move into the wireless market, which is
dominated by tycoon Carlos Slim's America Movil
(AMXL.MX)(AMX.N). America Movil already offers 3G services in
Mexico and other Latin American markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Acquiring a stake in Nextel Mexico would let Televisa
bundle together fixed-line telephone, wireless, Internet and
video services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alfonso de Angoitia, Televisa's executive vice president,
said on a separate conference call Tuesday that the broadcaster
has established a dividend policy with NII Holdings that would
take effect after Televisa buys the stake in Nextel Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa will also contribute a proportional amount of the
management fee that Nextel Mexico pays parent NII Holdings, he
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tie-up would be the first by big corporate players as
the Mexican government holds long-awaited frequency auctions
that are seen leading to a shake-up in the telecommunications
industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mexico's government is auctioning spectrum in the 1.7 GHz
and 1.9 GHz bands to propel competition in the cellphone
market. Nextel Mexico and Televisa submitted documents this
week saying they want to bid together in the auction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa shares were about flat at 48.60 pesos.

&lt;p&gt;Manufacturer and retailer will address importance of standards to the supply
chain in the new economy
LAWRENCEVILLE, N.J.--(Business Wire)--
J. Alexander (Sandy) Douglas Jr., president of Coca-Cola North America (KO), and
Rollin Ford, executive vice president and chief information officer for Walmart
(WMT), will deliver keynote addresses at the 10th annual U Connect Conference&#174;
on June 8, 2010, host organizations GS1 US and VICS announced today. 

"U Connect attendees will find these keynotes extremely valuable," said Bob
Carpenter, president and chief executive officer, GS1 US. "It`s a rare
opportunity to get insights on how the world`s largest beverages producer and
largest retailer are using standards to become more efficient and effective as
they navigate the `new normal` economy. Both companies are heavy users of
supply-chain standards as well as thought leaders in this area, so small
businesses and large businesses alike will get a lot out of this program." 

The conference takes place June 7-10, in San Antonio, Texas. 

Douglas, who is also chairman of the GS1 US Board of Governors, will discuss how
Coca-Cola North America is leveraging standards to support collaborative
integrated supply chain strategies that create a more efficient and effective
supply chain and reduce disruptions. 

"Standards are a key enabler to industry-wide supply chain solutions," Douglas
said. "GS1 standards allow us to build capabilities which can be used by all of
our retail partners across multiple industries." 

Douglas has been with Coca-Cola since 1988, and has held a variety of positions,
including senior vice president and chief customer officer of The Coca-Cola
Company. 

Ford, who has been CIO of Walmart since 2006 and has previously headed logistics
and supply-chain operations for the company, will speak about the value of GS1
standards in the retailer`s efforts to optimize its value-chain processes and
sustainability. 

"Walmart is leveraging industry standards to level the playing field for our
suppliers globally, and to increase our process efficiency, which helps us take
out costs and deliver everyday low prices to our customers, so they can save
money and live better," said Ford. "This includes our work with data
synchronization-based item-file alignment, which gives us one version of truth
about product data, enabling item data accuracy, store-level inventory
management, and global replenishment. And standards help us address emerging
issues around food and product safety, sustainability, and visibility into our
global supply chain." 

The conference theme, "Build a Visible, Secure and Sustainable Value Chain,"
refers to the ability of GS1 standards to help companies better understand where
their products and assets are, how to protect them, and how to ensure ongoing
high performance of business processes. 

More than a thousand business professionals from industries including Apparel,
Fresh Foods, Foodservice, Healthcare, Retail/CPG, and Hardlines will converge at
U Connect to learn how to use new and existing standards to address emerging and
expanding issues, such as food and product safety, recalls, traceability,
sustainability, and brand integrity. 

U Connect is hosted annually by GS1 US and the Voluntary Interindustry Commerce

&lt;p&gt;IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) announced today that additions to its proved
reserves in 2009 totaled 2.0 billion oil-equivalent barrels, replacing 133
percent of production. Excluding the impact of asset sales, reserves additions
replaced 134 percent of production. These additions are based on the
corporation`s definition of proved reserves, which utilizes the long-term
pricing basis that the corporation uses to make its investment decisions. This
is a different price basis than the SEC basis, which uses 12-month average
prices for the 2009 year-end reserves calculation. 

"ExxonMobil is an industry leader in reserves replacement," said Rex W.
Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer. "We have replaced more than 100
percent of production for 16 consecutive years, reflecting our strategic focus
on resource capture, a disciplined approach to investment and excellence in
project execution. Adding new reserves ensures that ExxonMobil will continue to
develop new supplies of energy to meet future demand and support economic growth
and improved standards of living." 

The annual reporting of proved reserves is the product of the corporation`s
long-standing, rigorous process that ensures consistency and management
accountability in all reserves bookings. 

The corporation`s reserves additions in 2009, the highest in the decade, reflect
new developments with significant funding commitments as well as revisions and
extensions of existing fields resulting from drilling, studies and analysis of
reservoir performance. Reserves additions from the Papua New Guinea LNG project
and the Gorgon Jansz LNG project in Australia totaled almost one billion oil
equivalent barrels. Proved additions were also made in many other countries
including Canada, the United States, Angola and Norway. 

At year-end 2009, ExxonMobil's proved reserves base, utilizing the corporation`s
definition of year-end reserves, increased to 23.3 billion oil-equivalent
barrels, split approximately evenly between liquids and gas (51 percent liquids,
49 percent gas). The 2009 proved developed reserves add of 2.9 billion
oil-equivalent barrels was also the highest in the decade driven by the
successful startup of a number of significant projects. This increased the
portion of proved reserves already developed to 67 percent. 

Using the SEC`s pricing basis, proved reserves replacement was 1.5 billion
oil-equivalent barrels in 2009, replacing 100 percent of production, including
the effect of asset sales, oil sands extracted by mining and equity company
reserves. 

Long-Term View

The long-term nature of the industry, and the large size of the discrete
projects that provide a significant portion of the corporation`s reserves
additions, make it appropriate to consider a time horizon longer than a single
year. The 10-year average reserves replacement ratio on the corporation's basis
is 112 percent, with liquids replacement at 99 percent and gas at 131 percent.
The reserves additions made during this period comprise a diverse range of
resource types and have broad geographical representation. ExxonMobil`s reserves
life at current production rates is 15.7 years. 

Industry-Leading Resource Base

ExxonMobil added 3.9 billion oil-equivalent barrels to its resource base in
2009, with key additions from Canada, the United States, West Africa, Australia,
and the United Kingdom. These are a result of continued by-the-bit exploration
success, undeveloped resource additions and revisions to our existing resources
from ongoing studies. Overall, the corporation`s resource base grew by 2.4
billion oil-equivalent barrels to 74.8 billion oil-equivalent barrels, taking
into account production and asset sales. The resource base includes proved
reserves, plus other discovered resources that are expected to be ultimately
recovered. 

CAUTIONARY NOTE: The reserves referenced in this release are different from
proved reserves as defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
rules and included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Proxy Statement. These
reserves, unless otherwise noted, are calculated using ExxonMobil`s definition
of proved reserves, which assumes the long-term pricing basis that the
corporation uses to make its investment decisions. This differs from the SEC
basis, which calculates year-end reserves based on historical market prices:
beginning in 2009, it utilizes the average of the market prices on the first day
of each calendar month during the year. Prior to 2009, reserves on the SEC basis
were calculated based on December 31 prices. Another difference is the treatment
of oil sands reserves extracted by mining, as well as ExxonMobil's share of
equity company reserves. These reserves are included in ExxonMobil`s proved
reserves for all periods. Under SEC definitions, these volumes were included in
our reported total proved reserves beginning in 2009, but were separately
reported in prior years. 

The reserves replacement ratio is calculated for a specified period utilizing
proved oil-equivalent reserves additions divided by oil-equivalent production.
The reserves additions used in the calculation, unless otherwise noted, are
based on ExxonMobil`s definition of proved reserves. 

The terms "resources" and "resource base" include quantities of discovered oil
and gas that are not yet classified as proved reserves but that are expected to
be ultimately recovered in the future. The term "resource base" is not intended
to correspond to SEC definitions such as "probable" or "possible" reserves.

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Feb 16 (Reuters) - NII Holdings Inc said on
Tuesday it would deploy a new 3G network across Mexico,
allowing for super fast wireless access to phone, video and
data, if a planned deal with broadcaster Televisa moved ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Media heavyweight Televisa (TV.N) (TLVACPO.MX) said on
Monday it had agreed to buy a 30 percent stake in NII's
NIHD.O Mexican unit as long as their joint bid for new
wireless capacity succeeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tie-up would be the first by big corporate players as
the Mexican government holds long-awaited frequency auctions
that are seen leading to a shake-up in the telecommunications
industry.

Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE) today announced that it and The Royal Bank of

    Through the transaction, J.P. Morgan will acquire RBS Sempra Commodities'

    Sempra Energy has retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor to review

    In November 2009, RBS announced its intention to divest its share of the
joint venture, following a directive from the European Union to dispose
of certain assets.

    The transaction will require approvals from the U.K. Financial Services
Authority, the Swiss government (if necessary) and various antitrust
regulators, including approval under the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. The
transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter 2010.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Feb 16 (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L)
and Sempra Energy (SRE.N) are set to reach a deal to sell the
non-U.S. assets of their commodities joint venture to JP Morgan
Chase  Co (JPM.N) for around $1.7 billion, a person familiar
with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The source said a deal with the U.S. bank could be finalised
as early as Tuesday. Talks continue on the remaining assets,
notably U.S. power and gas businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sempra Energy owns 49 percent of RBS Sempra, and RBS owns
the remaining 51 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RBS, 84-percent owned by the UK government, has been forced
to sell a string of assets including its stake in joint venture
RBS Sempra to appease European Union antitrust concerns after it
received billions in state aid during the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan had been in exclusive talks to buy all of RBS
Sempra, but U.S. plans to stop proprietary trading by banks
prompted it to rethink its plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RBS declined to comment and JPMorgan had no immediate

ROUND ROCK, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Dell today introduced OpenManage Integration Suite for Microsoft System Center,
a portfolio of software tools designed to help customers efficiently, securely,
and cost-effectively utilize and manage standards-based IT resources. Available
at no charge to Dell customers with Microsoft System Center, these software
tools enable large enterprises, public organizations and mid-size companies to
gain visibility, control, and flexibility of their Windows-based IT
environments. 

Dell`s OpenManage Integration Suite for Microsoft System Center helps customers
get IT assets up and running quickly by streamlining the most time consuming
administrative tasks such as bare metal deployments, server provisioning, and
BIOS driver and firmware updates. In addition, these tools give businesses added
flexibility in scheduling non-disruptive IT maintenance tasks and help IT staff
allocate resources to projects that support business objectives. 

"IT professionals continue to look for solutions that help them more easily
manage their PCs using standardized tools," said Bob O`Donnell, vice president
for IDC. "Delivering an open, end-to-end solution makes it easier for customers
to integrate, deploy, and manage their IT assets. An approach like this is very
pragmatic and helps minimize software migration issues while making adoption of
Microsoft computing architectures more accessible." 

The News

Dell is making available to its customers, at no charge, a comprehensive set of
software tools that deliver hardware management functionality integrated with
Microsoft System Center applications. With Dell`s approach, IT administrators
can select and download the management tools they need, helping optimize
resource utilization for their business. Additionally, Dell has increased the
storage capacity of its PowerEdge R510 server to offer an ideal platform for
Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 and other data-intensive applications. 

Faster Deployment and Provisioning

Through the integration of Dell Lifecycle Controller with Microsoft System
Center Configuration Manager and the utilization of Dell Server Deployment Pack,
customers can increase productivity and operational cost savings through
efficient, simple, and secure remote deployment and provisioning of servers.
This solution helps reduce time and expenses required to send IT personnel to
remote sites for server install and deployments. Additionally, the operating
system deployment process is designed to install the correct drivers in the
appropriate directory - saving time associated with preparing update packages. 

End-to-End Management for Physical and Virtual IT Environments

Dell provides integration tools for Microsoft System Center Management
applications that cover a large spectrum of Dell hardware devices including Dell
PowerEdge blade, rack and tower servers, MD-series and EqualLogic storage
products, business clients (Dell Precision workstations, Latitude laptops and
OptiPlex desktops) and network printers. As a result, customers can efficiently
and cost-effectively manage their heterogeneous computing environment with
solutions that support flexibility, choice and value. 

Hardware Optimization for Microsoft Exchange 2010 Environments

Dell continually optimizes performance across its PowerEdge server line to help
ensure customers the most productivity out of the business applications they
rely on most. Recent tests conducted by the research firm Principled
Technologies determined that two PowerEdge R510 servers with eight hard drives
and Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 can support up to 10 times the mailbox size
while delivering Exchange Mail Server performance equivalent to two legacy HP
ProLiant DL385 servers with Microsoft Exchange Server 20031. Migrating to
Microsoft Exchange 2010 on a Dell PowerEdge R510 solution can also save up to
$24,000 in total cost of ownership (TCO) in a year over that same HP system1. 

In addition, the PowerEdge R510 now supports 24 terabytes of internal storage,
making it an ideal server solution for growing Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 or
other application data sets. In this configuration, large enterprise, mid-size
and public sector customers can quickly and efficiently begin taking advantage
of new Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 features, including support for 10GB
mailboxes, reduced disk I/O, enhanced mobility, greater fault-tolerance and
enhanced voicemail and email integration. For customers that require additional
capacity, new Dell PowerVault MD1200 and MD1220 storage arrays provide an ideal
direct-attached storage platform with the performance of up to 6 Gb/sec SAS hard
drives. 

Customer Migration Services

In continued support of Dell`s collaboration with Microsoft, Dell offers
consulting services to simplify the adoption process for Microsoft System
Center, helping to minimize risk and disruption to a customer`s daily
operations. The services include Dell ProConsult Technology Introduction, which
offers expert guidance to rapidly explore the features and functionality of
Microsoft Systems Center in a proof-of-concept environment, and the Dell
ProConsult FastTrack service for Microsoft System Center, which offers expert
assistance with an assessment, design and pilot testing and implementation.2

Dell ProSupport and ProConsult services continue to help companies make the
transition to the latest Microsoft software platforms such as Exchange Server
2010, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 with Hyper-V virtualization
technology2. Recent success stories from companies like Super Group, a leading
supply-chain management firm, and Betfair, one of the world`s biggest betting
communities, are using Dell PowerEdge servers and Microsoft Windows Server 2008
Hyper-V for virtualization to improve productivity, and reduce costs.

&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft executive who managed the company's Trustworthy Computing security program has left for a new role at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;George Stathakopoulos had been general manager of Microsoft's Product Security and Security Engineering and Communications Group. There, he managed the company's various security programs, which are collectively known as Trustworthy Computing. His last day with Microsoft, his employer since 1991, was Friday, Feb. 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stathakopoulos left to work a security management job at Amazon, according to sources familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is replaced at Microsoft by Matt Thomlinson,  formerly senior director of security engineering with the Trustworthy Computing group, a Microsoft spokesman said via e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"George has had a long and noteworthy career at Microsoft, working on some of the company's most widely deployed products and security initiatives," he wrote. "In the past eight years since Trustworthy Computing was launched, George has made a significant impact through sustained focus on the security of Microsoft customers and the security of the IT ecosystem at large. We appreciate his service and wish him well. "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the original members of the Internet Explorer team, Stathakopoulos was a well-regarded manager at Microsoft who was credited with helping the company build bridges with the hacker community and secure its often buggy code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've got nothing but good things to say about the guy," said security researcher Dan Kaminsky via direct message. Kaminsky's company, IOActive, has worked with Microsoft in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomlinson, like his predecessor, will now report to Scott Charney, Microsoft's corporate vice president, Trustworthy Computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon representatives did not respond to messages seeking comment for this story. Security is increasingly important to the company as it develops its Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Web-based computing infrastructure. EC2 gives anyone access to Amazon computing resources, and security experts worry that it could be misused by criminals or hacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The social network for business professionals, LinkedIn, released a beta version of its Microsoft Outlook add-on Wednesday.  LinkedIn Outlook Connector allows you to keep up to date with your LinkedIn connections, integrates their contact information into Outlook, and allows you to add new LinkedIn connections right from your desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn's new add-on capitalizes on Outlook Social Connector, an Office 2010 feature that integrates social networking feeds into Outlook, but not Outlook Express. Right now Social Connector is limited to LinkedIn, but Microsoft says connectors for MySpace, Facebook, and Windows Live are "coming soon".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting Started&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting up LinkedIn Outlook Connector in Office 2003 and 2007 is straightforward.  Just download Microsoft's Outlook Social Connector, and then install it as you would any other piece of software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you've got Outlook Social Connector ready to go, log in to LinkedIn and navigate to linkedin.com/outlook, and install the beta version of LinkedIn's new add-on.  Restart Outlook and a configuration wizard will guide you through the set up process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Installing LinkedIn Outlook Connector to work with the beta version of Office 2010 wasn't so easy.  Even though Social Connector is standard in Office 2010, the LinkedIn beta add-on is not compatible with the current preview version of Outlook 2010.  To get LinkedIn functionality to work you'll have to download a free add-on from Microsoft; however, this add-on only works with the 32-bit version of Microsoft Office 2010, and not the 64-bit version or with Office 2010 Home  Business Beta.  So if you're using either of these versions of Office 2010, the LinkedIn add-on will not work for you at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you've downloaded the Outlook Social Connector for Office 2010, you will also have to go through a relatively rigorous set-up procedure that is not for the faint of heart.  You can find installation instructions on this page at Microsoft's Website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a break down of features for LinkedIn Outlook Connector:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay current with your connections&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any time you open a message in Outlook from someone in your LinkedIn network, you will see LinkedIn information pulled from your connection's profile below the message pane.  You can see things like their profile photo, latest status messages, recently added connections and see any recent questions they've asked or answered.  LinkedIn Connector will also add a LinkedIn contacts folder where you can you see your network connections' profile photos, e-mail addresses and profile details such as their current job title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discover Connections&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to seeing your own LinkedIn connections, you can also discover new ones. Any time you receive e-mail from a LinkedIn member who you are not connected with, an "Add" button will appear below the message pane so you can add them to your network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LinkedIn connector looks like it could be a helpful add-on to keep tabs on your LinkedIn connections.  Look for more social features coming to Outlook in the coming months including Facebook, MySpace and Windows Live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn Social Connector:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connect with Ian Paul on Twitter (@ianpaul) or on Google Buzz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/189582&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CodePlex Foundation, a Microsoft-backed open source projects initiative, has accepted its first non-Microsoft project, the foundation said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MVC Contrib project, enabling developers to build and test UI elements on top of Microsoft's ASP.Net MVC framework for model view controller-based Web development, has been contributed to CodePlex. MVC Contrib is led by Eric Hexter and Jeffrey Palermo of software development and consulting firm Headspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Last week, InfoWorld's Paul Krill reported that Microsoft is moving forward with version 2 of ASP.Net MVC. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By contributing the MVC Contrib project to the CodePlex Foundation, we are stepping up to help bridge the gap between corporations and the open source community," said Hexter, who is Headspring's director of open source software initiatives, in a statement released by CodePlex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft-contributed projects at CodePlex include the Orchard Project, providing applications and reusable components for ASP.Net, and ASP.Net Ajax Library, for building database-driven Web applications to execute entirely in a browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formed last September, CodePlex Foundation is intended to bring&#160; together open source communities and software companies for the purpose of increasing participation in open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "CodePlex open source group moves beyond Microsoft," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;A storage virtualization start-up called Virsto Software has developed a Microsoft Hyper-V add-on that speeds up access to data in virtualized data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 start-ups to watch in 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virsto was founded in 2007 by former executives of Sun and Veritas Software who want to eliminate the I/O bottlenecks caused when virtual servers try to access storage systems. Virsto's first product, Virsto One, focuses on Microsoft's Hyper-V rather than VMware because VMware already has some functionality improving storage performance, says Virsto CEO Mark Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft needs more help" because its virtualization technology is newer than VMware's, Davis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When talking to customers Davis says he hears a common complaint: "People say 'we love virtualization, but storage is sort of busted.' The way storage works on physical machines doesn't translate to the virtual world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With virtualization, each physical server is packed with virtual machines, with each one taking up large amounts of storage and acting as if it owns the hardware, even though it is sharing resources with other VMs, Davis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virsto claims it can reduce VM disk consumption by as much as 90%. Virsto's software, generally available starting this week, installs into the hypervisor and manages its interaction with any type of storage, Davis says. For example, Virsto ensures that storage systems perform sequential reads and writes, rather than random, reducing the amount of time needed by the disk head to do its job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virsto also reduces storage sprawl by preventing files from being needlessly duplicated. If you have 100 copies of Windows, not every piece of the operating system needs to be stored 100 times. Virsto's process of preventing this is similar to de-duplication but "we call it no-dupe &#8211; we don't make the copies in the first place," Davis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thin provisioning, snapshots, clones and live migration are other features of the Virsto software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis previously held positions at Sun and StorageTek and most recently was CEO of storage management vendor CreekPath Systems, which was acquired by Opsware in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyper-V is obviously behind VMware in terms of adoption, but "we're not having a hard time finding customers who are excited about Hyper-V," Davis says. "They're trying to find the best way to put Hyper-V into production."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crutchfield, a consumer electronics retailer in Charlottesville, Va., has been testing Virsto and plans to put it into production soon. Roger Johnson, technical lead for Crutchfield's enterprise systems group, says he was skeptical about Virsto's claims at first but his tests have produced a 33% performance improvement in I/O throughput. Crutchfield is running 225 virtual machines on 11 servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was concerned about how it would do for large numbers of virtual machines for large periods of time," he says, but the results were "pretty impressive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virsto is operating with $8.25 million in funding from August Capital and Canaan Partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virsto One can be evaluated for free for 30 days. Perpetual licenses cost $1,250 for one or two sockets, $2,500 for three or four sockets, and $5,000 for unlimited sockets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow Jon Brodkin on Twitter: www.twitter.com/jbrodkin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Microsoft partner tackles storage problems in virtual data centers," was originally published at NetworkWorld.com.

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Research Equity Strategist, Dirk Van Dijk says that S 500 earnings are
continuing to show red ink. He tracks companies on the Zacks.com web site,
naming names, while forecasting trends for the months ahead. 

Earnings to More than Double

The revisions ratios for both 2010 and 2011 are strong, and should give us
confidence that those growth rates will actually be achieved, if not exceeded
(although it's still early for 2011). Every sector but Utilities and
Transportation has seen more estimates raised for 2010 than cut, and the
revisions ratio for 2010 stands at an extremely strong 1.67. In other words, the
positive earnings surprises are causing the analysts to raise their sights for
the future. 

Unlike the other three quarters of the year, there is no "mechanical" reason to
raise estimates in response to a positive earnings surprise. Fourth quarter 2009
earnings are not part of the full year 2010 earnings, the way the third quarter
2009 earnings were part of full year 2009 earnings. The raising of the sights
extends into 2011, where the revisions ratio stands at 1.85. 

The Auto sector`s strength is being driven by Ford (NYSE: F) and Johnson
Controls (NYSE: JCI). All three of which have double digit estimate increases,
leading to double digit increases in their mean estimates. None of the three had
any estimate cuts for 2010. 

The 2011 strength in Tech is being led by some of the biggest and most well know
Tech firms, including Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT), Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) and Texas
Instruments (NYSE: TXN).

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

JPM to Reveal RBS-Sempra Deal

JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) could announce a deal today to buy commodities
trading firm RBS-Sempra Commodities for $1.7 billion, reports the Wall Street
Journal. 

In order to comply with European Union rules, the Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:
RBS) is selling its 51% stake in RBS-Sempra, which it jointly owns with Sempra
Energy (NYSE: SRE). This step is a part of RBS`s restructuring efforts, which
includes selling its non-core businesses in selected markets to shore up its
financial standing. 

The current deal excludes RBS-Sempra`s most valuable North American operations,
which accounts for 64% of RBS-Sempra's trading revenue. However, JPMorgan is in
discussion with RBS and Sempra Energy to acquire the North American operations
of the commodities and energy trader. Macquarie has been named along with
JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank (NYSE: DB) as bidders for RBS-Sempra`s North American
operations. 

Incorporated in 2008, RBS-Sempra trades commodities ranging from oil and natural
gas to metals and agricultural products. Royal Bank of Scotland, one of the
largest victims of the global financial crisis, is at present 83% owned by
British taxpayers. The bank's woes stem from a massive number of risky
investments in areas such as commercial-property loans, leveraged finance and
derivatives. The bad assets it inherited with its 2007 acquisition of a part of
the Dutch bank ABN Amro Holding NV has also added to its problems. 

JPMorgan`s fourth quarter earnings came in at 74 cents per share, substantially
ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents. This also compares favorably
with earnings of 6 cents in the prior-year quarter. 

We view the prospective RBS-Sempra deal as positive for JPMorgan as its strong
capital position should enable it to easily manage the business. We anticipate
continued synergies from JPMorgan`s diversification and strong capital position,
but increasing provisions and rising consumer credit costs will be a drag on
upcoming results. However, we are impressed to see some improvement in credit
quality during the fourth quarter of 2009. 

Genuine Parts Profits Improve

Genuine Parts Company (NYSE: GPC) reported a 13% rise in profit to $99 million
or 62 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2009 from $88 million or 55 cents
in the prior year quarter. With this, the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus
Estimate of 51 cents per share. However, sales in the quarter fell 2% to $2.47
billion. 

Genuine Parts` Automotive Parts segment was the only segment to report an
improvement in sales. The Industrial Parts and Electrical/Electronic Material
segments were the most negatively affected during the quarter. Revenue in the
Automotive Parts segment increased 6% to $1.26 billion, Industrial Parts segment
dipped 11% to $737 million, Office Products segment slid 4% to $384 million and
Electrical Group shrank 12% to $90 million. 

In 2009, Genuine Parts has posted a 16% decline in profit to $399.6 million or
$2.50 per share, from $475.4 million or $2.92 per share in 2008. The profit was
a tad higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.38 per share.

&lt;p&gt;  WATERLOO, ONTARIO, Feb 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
DALSA Corporation (TSX: DSA) is pleased to announce the shipment of very
high resolution image sensors that will power the newest models in the
UltraCam line of aerial photogrammetry cameras produced by Microsoft's
photogrammetry business, Vexcel Imaging, GmbH.

    Featuring 196 megapixel resolution (17,310 pixels x 11,310 pixels), the
new UltraCamXp and UltraCamXp Wide Angle use multiple DALSA CCD image
sensors to provide breathtakingly detailed imagery that feeds
applications such as Microsoft(R) Bing(TM) Maps.

    "To achieve the performance we wanted in these new UltraCams, we needed
the best large and medium format image sensors available," commented
Alexander Wiechert, CEO of Vexcel. "DALSA's technology is
industry-leading, and they delivered the products and the support we
needed to succeed."

    The incredible resolution and footprint of the new UltraCams allows users
to produce high-quality urban maps, large-scale ortho photos and stereo
imagery with fewer flight lines, saving time and lowering cost. Increased
onboard storage allows for longer flights to take advantage of good
flying conditions, and the high throughput and superior dynamic range of
the DALSA sensors enable the system to capture more data with higher
image quality in less time. 

    For medium-format mapping applications, the new UltraCamLp delivers 92
megapixels (11,704 pixels x 7,920 pixels) in a package ideal for smaller
aircraft and local projects that require a rapid response with the
highest image quality, such as digital surface model production, aero
triangulation, ortho mapping and 3D technical vector mapping.

    "We are proud to provide image sensors for these impressive products,"
said Edwin Roks, Vice President and General Manager of DALSA Professional
Imaging. "This relationship further reinforces our position as the
world's supplier of choice for large format image sensors."

&lt;p&gt;MONTERREY, Mexico--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings states that Grupo Televisa, S.A.B. 's (Televisa) proposed
investment in Comunicaciones Nextel de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. (Nextel Mexico), if
completed as announced, is consistent with Televisa's strategy to position
itself as a major player in the Mexican telecommunications industry. The company
will use cash on hand to fund this investment, reducing its liquidity position
and increasing its net leverage. However, this investment makes strategic sense
as it brings additional services that can be added to the company's
telecommunications portfolio and becomes a new distribution channel for
Televisa's content, in addition to the commercial, operating and infrastructure
synergies that could be captured in the future. Further increases in leverage,
however, could pressure Televisa's credit quality. Fitch estimates that
Televisa's pro forma total debt to EBITDA and net debt to EBITDA, for the last
12 months as of Sept. 30, 2009, in addition to the recent US$600 million senior
notes issuance and the dividend paid at the end of 2009, would approximate 2.2
times (x) and 1.2x compared to 1.8x an 0.2x, respectively. 

On Feb. 15, 2010 Televisa announced it had signed an agreement with NII
Holdings, Inc. (NII) under which Televisa will invest US$1.44 billion in cash
for an initial 30% equity stake in Nextel Mexico. The agreement also considers
an option for Televisa to acquire an additional 7.5% interest which could be
exercised on either the 3rd or 4th anniversary of the initial investment, at a
price based on the fair market value of Nextel Mexico on those dates. In
addition, the transaction is conditioned upon the Nextel/Televisa consortium
being awarded licenses to use specified amounts of spectrum in the upcoming
spectrum auctions in Mexico. 

Televisa's 'BBB+' ratings (Fitch long-term and local currency IDR of 'BBB+',
both with a Stable Outlook) incorporate the company's strong business position
as one of the largest Spanish-speaking content producers worldwide, business
segment diversification and historical solid free cash flow (FCF) generation.
Fitch expects Televisa will generate FCF of at least US$800 million during 2010,
which should drive total debt to EBITDA to at or below 2.0x and net debt to
EBITDA below 1.0x. 

These ratings reflect the application of Fitch's current criteria, which are
available at 'www.fitchratings.com' and specifically include the following
report:

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * Televisa seen paying dearly for Nextel stake &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Nextel's technology not 3G-friendly &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Analysts eye better partner options &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * NII's network overhaul could take years &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Cyntia Barrera Diaz &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    MEXICO CITY, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Televisa's plan to tap Mexico's wireless market has raised concerns that the broadcaster may be risking too much to partner with an operator whose technology can't immediately offer customers cutting edge services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Televisa (TLVACPO.MX) (TV.N) said this week it has agreed to buy a 30 percent stake in Nextel Mexico, a unit of NII Holdings Inc NIHD.O, for $1.44 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The move could eventually propel the Televisa-Nextel venture past Spain's Telefonica to the No. 2 spot in the Mexican wireless market, just behind America Movil (AMX.N) (AMXL.MX), controlled by tycoon Carlos Slim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But analysts question whether Televisa should have held onto its money and pursued a deal with heavyweight Telefonica (TEF.MC) to make a bigger splash in the mobile market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We remain skeptical that Televisa's agreed-upon investment in Nextel Mexico offers an effective solution for Televisa to expand into mobile services," said analyst Gregorio Tomassi, with Banco Santander. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The deal would not go ahead if the partners failed to win the spectrum licenses they want at a government auction currently being held. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NII Holdings uses Motorola Inc's MOT.N iDen technology in the five Latin American countries where it operates. iDen is great for push-to-talk communications and uses bandwidth efficiently, but it is not optimal for data transmission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Televisa's investment in Nextel calls for a thorough upgrade of the wireless operator's network to enable it to offer clients 3G, or third generation, super-fast wireless phone, video and data transmission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    America Movil (AMX.N) (AMXL.MX) and Telefonica (TEF.MC)  already offer 3G in several Latin American countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By acquiring a stake in Nextel Mexico, Televisa wants to bundle together fixed-line telephone, wireless, Internet and video, becoming the first provider of so-called quadruple services in Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    LONG, RISKY BET &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Some analysts estimate that $500 million of the money committed by Televisa would be put toward the acquisition of spectrum licenses and at least a similar amount would be used to overhaul Nextel's network. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Televisa would spend nearly half of its existing cash position to fund the Nextel investment. The company has also established a dividend policy with NII Holdings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We see this as a risk investment and believe that it deviates from the arguments behind a mobile strategy," said UBS analyst Tomas Lajous. "More importantly, we have concerns on Nextel Mexico's business model into the future, and see Televisa as exposing itself to these unnecessarily as an equity partner." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NII Holdings, with customers in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Peru, may spend some $2.5 billion in the region to build 3G-friendly networks, analysts estimate. But they say the plan could take several years to yield profits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We believe this deal improves NII's position in Mexico, as Televisa is a strong partner," said Vera Rossi from Morgan Stanley. "This partnership does not eliminate the challenges we believe NII will face in the technological transition." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Mexican government is auctioning spectrum in the 1.7 GHz and 1.9 GHz bands and expects to announce winners in June. Authorities have set a cap of 80 MHz to prevent bidders from accumulating too much power in certain markets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Santander's Tomassi believes gaining additional spectrum gives more expansion potential to Nextel Mexico than to America Movil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    While combining Televisa's vast entertainment content with Nextel's platform is a good idea, the price the broadcaster is paying may be too high, UBS' Lajous said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We like Televisa's mobile story ... but we are not comfortable with the equity investment in Nextel Mexico, a view cast both on strategic and valuation grounds," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Cyntia Barrera Diaz, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc computer programer pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to charges he stole code from the bank's lucrative high-frequency trading platform before leaving for another company last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sergey Aleynikov, 40, said only "not guilty" at his first appearance in Manhattan federal court following last Thursday's unsealing of an indictment that formalized charges initially brought last July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, who is free on bail, is charged with theft of trade secrets, transportation of stolen property and unauthorized computer access. If convicted at trial, Aleynikov faces up to 25 years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the indictment, on his last day working for Goldman on June 5, 2009, prosecutors alleged Aleynikov transferred Goldman computer code for its trading platform to an outside computer server. They said he encrypted the files and transferred them over the Internet without informing Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. prosecutors and the FBI alleged he emailed code files to his personal email account from a Goldman email account, storing versions of the code files on home computers, a laptop and other storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They said that, on July 2, he took the laptop and another storage device to a meeting in Chicago with his new employer, Teza Technologies LLC, a high-frequency trading start-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In court on Wednesday, the U.S. prosecutor on the case, Joseph Facciponti, said the ability of investigators to search Teza computers was circumscribed. He did not provide details, but said "a preliminary search shows we did not find any Goldman Sachs source code on the computers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Denise Cote scheduled November 29 for the start of a trial, which is expected to last two to three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov and his lawyer, Sabrina Shroff, declined to comment after the court proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs' high frequency trading system makes millions of dollars a year in profits.

&lt;p&gt;ROME (Reuters) - Switzerland and Libya are ready to end a row which has stopped Europeans entering Libya, but some conditions still must be met, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said on Wednesday after meeting his Libyan counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officials said on Monday that Libya had stopped issuing entry visas to 25 European nations in response to a Swiss entry ban on scores of Libyan officials, including Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was the latest twist in a long-running dispute between Switzerland and Libya, sparked by the brief arrest of Gaddafi's son Hannibal in Geneva in 2008. The visa ban on "Schengen" countries widened that spat to affect most of western Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frattini said Swiss Foreign Minister Micheline Calmy-Rey told him by telephone on Tuesday evening that Switzerland was ready to scrap the travel ban on 186 Libyans provided that Tripoli releases two Swiss businessmen detained in 2008, in retaliation for Hannibal Gaddafi's arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his meeting on Wednesday, Libyan Foreign Minister Koussa Moussa told him that Tripoli was open to this deal but first wanted Switzerland to open an investigation into the leaking to the press of photos of Hannibal Gaddafi in police custody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My Libyan colleague told me today they have no problem with (ending the visa ban), but a key preliminary step must be the opening of an investigation into the leaking of the photos taken in a public office," Frattini told a news conference after the meeting, also attended by Maltese Foreign Minister Tonio Borg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frattini, who strongly criticised Switzerland on Tuesday for misusing the Schengen zone's visa rules to pressure Libya, said Moussa would travel to Madrid later on Wednesday to meet Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos. Spain currently holds the European Union rotating presidency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ENERGY INTERESTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's center right government has forged closer ties with former Italian colony Libya, where Eni has oil investments and Italian infrastructure companies are seeking contracts. Meanwhile Italy's ties with its Alpine neighbor have been strained by a row over bank secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil exporter Libya has been attracting growing foreign investment since it emerged from decades of international isolation and analysts said the visa move might harm its business reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EU member states and partners in Schengen -- a borderless travel zone grouping 22 EU nations plus Switzerland, Norway and Iceland -- will meet in Brussels on Thursday to discuss the problem and EU foreign ministers will take it up on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the discussions, EU officials were more downbeat than Italy on the prospect of an immediate solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is going to take a long time -- you are not going to have a miracle solution overnight. But everything that can be done is being done," Michele Cercone, European Commission spokesman on home affairs, told a briefing in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switzerland introduced its own restrictive visa policy last autumn but as a Swiss policy, it would not necessarily apply to other Schengen member states, officials say. It was not clear why Libya only reacted in the last few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switzerland says it acted within Schengen rules and that it had targeted only a small number of applicants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dispute dates back to July 2008 when Hannibal Gaddafi and his pregnant wife were arrested on charges of mistreating two domestic employees, a case which was later dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hannibal has launched a court case against Geneva authorities and a newspaper for publishing a police photo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the arrest, OPEC member Libya halted oil exports to Switzerland, withdrew $5 billion in assets from Swiss accounts and detained two Swiss businessmen in Libya, Max Goeldi and Rachid Hamdani, both of whom are still there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frattini said Libya's move had not been "a total block" on entry by Schengen citizens into Libya. "In the last 24 hours, all the Italian citizens who needed to enter Libya have entered," he said. "My Maltese colleague told me the same thing."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Libya's decision to stop issuing visas to citizens of most European states has alarmed the European Union, not least because the bloc's members have growing ties with Libya's emerging economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are details of some of the business links between Libya and European countries, and prospects for the future:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ENERGY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Libya has attracted billions of dollars in investments from international energy firms in the past decade and, as in other sectors, near-neighbor and former colonial power Italy has been at the forefront. At the end of 2008, Italy's ENI was operating 13 oil and gas permits and its production was 306,000 barrels per day of oil equivalent -- or about one-fifth of Britain's total daily oil production. Spain's Repsol is also a big player, with rights to 15 hydrocarbon blocks. Long-term prospects are excellent, but investment in new projects has been curtailed for now because Libya's top energy official, Shokri Ghanem, says no new contracts will be allocated to foreign firms before the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defense&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Libya has huge funds available to beef up its military and, since sanctions were lifted after Tripoli renounced banned weapons programs, there are no legal restrictions on European defense manufacturers selling their wares. EADS has an office in Tripoli, and the firm has said in the past it was close to a deal to sell Libya anti-tank systems. It has also sold civilian aircraft. But European firms have competition in this sector. They will have to look on from afar on Sunday when a U.S. delegation including executives from defense and aerospace firms Boeing, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman Corp, arrives in Libya as part of the first official U.S. trade mission in years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONSTRUCTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Libya is having a building boom to make up for decades of stagnation and neglect when it was under international sanctions. That means ample opportunities for European construction and infrastructure firms. The government last week announced it would be spending 82 billion Libyan dinars ($65.6 billion) in budget funds over the next three years on development and infra-structure. That is on top of non-budget infrastructure spending. Contracts to build roads, irrigation canals, power networks and schools and hospitals are likely to be on offer. There are also opportunities in the private sector, with new office buildings, hotels and shopping malls shooting up in Tripoli and Libya's second city of Benghazi. European firms have so far been slow to move into this sector, with many of the biggest projects snapped up by Turkish, Pakistani or Korean companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EQUITY INVESTMENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moribund for decades, opportunities are now opening up for investors in Libya's financial and banking sectors. The central bank said this week that, for the first time in 40 years, it was offering banking licenses to foreign banks, provided they had local partners [ID:nLDE61F1Y8]. Libya has already sold minority stakes in two existing banks to foreign investors. The chairman of Libya's Stock Market said late last year that shares in four state companies would be sold in initial public offerings in 2010. Mark Mobius, a high-profile emerging market investor with Templeton Asset Management, has called Libya an "ideal frontier market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOVEREIGN WEALTH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Libya's $65 billion sovereign wealth fund is another, very big, reason that it has close business ties to Europe. Many of the investments made to date by the fund's manager, the Libyan Investment Authority, have been in Italian stocks. It holds a 4.6 percent stake in Italy's second-biggest bank, Unicredit and has a small stake in carmaker FIAT. The Authority's chief executive told Reuters in an interview last year it planned to expand its portfolio to include European utilities and drugmakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
A Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) anunciou hoje que os acr&#233;scimos &#224;s suas
reservas provadas em 2009 totalizaram dois bilh&#245;es de barris equivalentes de
petr&#243;leo, repondo centro e trinta e tr&#234;s por cento da produ&#231;&#227;o. Excluindo o
impacto da venda de ativos, os acr&#233;scimos &#224;s reservas repuseram centro e trinta
e quatro por cento da produ&#231;&#227;o. Esses acr&#233;scimos s&#227;o baseados na defini&#231;&#227;o da
empresa de reservas provadas, que utiliza a base de pre&#231;os de longo prazo que a
empresa usa para tomar suas decis&#245;es de investimento. Esta &#233; uma base de pre&#231;os
diferente da base da SEC, que adota a m&#233;dia de pre&#231;os de doze meses para o
c&#225;lculo das reservas do fim do ano de 2009. 

"A ExxonMobil &#233; l&#237;der em reposi&#231;&#227;o de reservas no setor", declarou Rex W.
Tillerson, presidente do conselho e diretor executivo. "Foram repostas mais de
cem por cento da produ&#231;&#227;o por dezesseis anos consecutivos, refletindo nosso foco
estrat&#233;gico em captura de recursos, uma abordagem disciplinada para o
investimento e excel&#234;ncia em execu&#231;&#227;o de projetos. Adicionar novas reservas
garante que a ExxonMobil continue a desenvolver novos suprimentos de energia
para atender &#224; demanda futura, apoiar o crescimento econ&#244;mico e padr&#245;es de vida
mais elevados." 

O relat&#243;rio anual de reservas provadas &#233; produto de um processo rigoroso e
consagrado que assegura consist&#234;ncia e responsabilidade administrativa a todos
os registros de reservas. 

Os acr&#233;scimos &#224;s reservas da empresa em 2009, as mais altas da d&#233;cada, refletem
os novos desenvolvimentos com significativos compromissos de financiamento, al&#233;m
de revis&#245;es e amplia&#231;&#245;es dos campos existentes, resultantes de perfura&#231;&#245;es,
estudos e an&#225;lises de desempenho dos reservat&#243;rios. Os acr&#233;scimos &#224;s reservas
origin&#225;rias dos projetos de g&#225;s natural de Papua Nova Guin&#233; e Gorgon Jansz na
Austr&#225;lia totalizaram cerca de um bilh&#227;o de barris equivalentes de petr&#243;leo.
Acr&#233;scimos provados tamb&#233;m foram feitos em muitos outros pa&#237;ses, incluindo
Canad&#225;, Estados Unidos, Angola e Noruega. 

No fim de 2009, a base de reservas provadas desenvolvidas da ExxonMobil,
utilizando a defini&#231;&#227;o da empresa de reservas de fim de ano, aumentou para 23,3
bilh&#245;es de barris equivalentes de petr&#243;leo, distribu&#237;dos quase que
equitativamente entre combust&#237;veis l&#237;quidos e g&#225;s (51 por cento de l&#237;quidos, 49
por cento de g&#225;s). O acr&#233;scimo de reservas desenvolvidas provadas em 2009, de
2,9 bilh&#245;es de barris equivalentes de petr&#243;leo, tamb&#233;m foi o mais alto da d&#233;cada
devido ao lan&#231;amento bem sucedido de uma s&#233;rie de projetos significativos. Com
isso, a parcela de reservas provadas j&#225; desenvolvidas aumentou para sessenta e
sete por cento. 

Usando a base de pre&#231;os da SEC, a reposi&#231;&#227;o de reservas provadas foi de 1,5
bilh&#245;es de barris equivalentes de petr&#243;leo em 2009, repondo cem por cento da
produ&#231;&#227;o, incluindo o resultado das vendas de ativos, areia betuminosa extra&#237;da
por minera&#231;&#227;o e reservas de capital da empresa. 

Vis&#227;o de longo prazo

Dada a natureza de longo prazo do setor e a dimens&#227;o de projetos individuais que
garantem quantidade significativa de adi&#231;&#245;es &#224;s reservas da empresa, &#233; correto
considerar um per&#237;odo maior que um &#250;nico ano. A taxa m&#233;dia de reposi&#231;&#227;o de
reservas da empresa em dez anos &#233; de 112 por cento, com a reposi&#231;&#227;o de l&#237;quidos
de 99 por cento e de g&#225;s de 131 por cento. Os acr&#233;scimos &#224;s reservas efetuados
durante esse per&#237;odo compreendem uma grande variedade de tipos de recursos e t&#234;m
uma ampla representa&#231;&#227;o geogr&#225;fica. A vida das reservas da ExxonMobil &#224;s taxas
de produ&#231;&#227;o atuais &#233; estimada em 15,7 anos. 

Base de recursos l&#237;der no setor

A ExxonMobil acrescentou 3,9 bilh&#245;es de barris equivalentes de petr&#243;leo &#224; sua
base de recursos em 2009, com acr&#233;scimos fundamentais do Canad&#225;, Estados Unidos,
&#193;frica Ocidental, Austr&#225;lia e Reino Unido. Esses acr&#233;scimos s&#227;o resultado do
sucesso cont&#237;nuo obtido nas explora&#231;&#245;es, acr&#233;scimos de recursos
n&#227;o-desenvolvidos e revis&#227;o de recursos j&#225; existentes com base em estudos em
andamento. De modo geral, a base de recursos da empresa cresceu 2,4 bilh&#245;es de
barris equivalentes de petr&#243;leo alcan&#231;ando 74,8 bilh&#245;es de barris equivalentes
de petr&#243;leo, levando em conta a produ&#231;&#227;o e a venda de ativos. A base de recursos
inclui reservas provadas, e ainda outros recursos descobertos que se espera
sejam eventualmente extra&#237;dos no futuro. 

NOTA DE ADVERT&#202;NCIA: As reservas mencionadas neste comunicado s&#227;o diferentes das
reservas provadas, conforme definidas pelas regras da Comiss&#227;o de Valores
Mobili&#225;rios dos EUA (SEC), e inclu&#237;das em nosso Relat&#243;rio Anual no Formul&#225;rio
10-K e no Relat&#243;rio aos Acionistas. Essas reservas, salvo se especificado de
outra forma, s&#227;o calculadas utilizando a defini&#231;&#227;o da empresa de reservas
provadas, que considera a base de pre&#231;os de longo prazo que a empresa usa para
tomar suas decis&#245;es de investimento. Isso difere da base da SEC, que calcula as
reservas no fim do ano com base em pre&#231;os hist&#243;ricos do mercado. A partir 2009,
ela utiliza a m&#233;dia dos pre&#231;os de mercado no primeiro dia de cada m&#234;s civil
durante o ano. Antes de 2009, as reservas segundo a SEC eram calculadas com base
nos pre&#231;os em 31 de dezembro. Outra diferen&#231;a &#233; o tratamento dado &#224;s reservas de
areia betuminosa extra&#237;das por minera&#231;&#227;o, bem como &#224; parte da ExxonMobil nas
reservas de capital da empresa. Essas reservas est&#227;o inclu&#237;das nas reservas
provadas da ExxonMobil para todos os per&#237;odos. Sob as defini&#231;&#245;es da SEC, essas
quantias foram inclu&#237;das em nossas reservas provadas totais registradas a partir
de 2009, tendo gerado relat&#243;rios separados em anos anteriores. 

A taxa de reposi&#231;&#227;o de reservas &#233; calculada para um determinado per&#237;odo
utilizando acr&#233;scimos de reservas provadas em equivalente de petr&#243;leo divididas
pela produ&#231;&#227;o de equivalente de petr&#243;leo. Os acr&#233;scimos de reservas usados no
c&#225;lculo, salvo se especificado de outra forma, s&#227;o baseados na defini&#231;&#227;o da
ExxonMobil de reservas provadas. 

Os termos "recursos" e "base de recursos" incluem quantidades de petr&#243;leo e g&#225;s
descobertos que ainda n&#227;o foram classificados como reservas provadas mas, que se
espera, sejam eventualmente extra&#237;das no futuro. O termo "base de recursos" n&#227;o
tem a inten&#231;&#227;o de corresponder &#224;s defini&#231;&#245;es da SEC, como reservas "prov&#225;veis"
ou "poss&#237;veis".

&lt;p&gt;Clients Eliminate More Than 100 Million Paper Documents While Cutting Costs and
Boosting Efficiency
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Corporate Treasury operations are awash in paper, and a new report by J.P.
Morgan can guide them to a sustainable future. "Sustainable Treasury Management:
It`s Easier Than You Think" examines each component of Treasury operations-from
cash and receivables collection to disbursements processing and storage of
reports and other financial and customer data-and outlines best practices that
are good for business and good for the environment. Each section presents
specific case studies that demonstrate the benefits of electronic Treasury
solutions. The report also introduces function-specific Eco Analysis Worksheets
that can help corporate Treasurers calculate the benefits of going green. 

According to the 2009 PricewaterhouseCoopers 12th Annual CEO Survey, sixty
percent of CEOs indicate that they have already made operational changes to
address climate change or plan to do so within the next twelve months. Migrating
to electronic Treasury processes can have a measurable impact on a corporation`s
carbon footprint as large Treasury operations can easily generate 5.5 tons of
paper each year-the equivalent of 143 trees and 106 tons of greenhouse gasses.
Since J.P. Morgan Treasury Services` "Go Green" campaign began in 2007 the Bank
has helped Treasury clients eliminate more than 101 million paper documents and
save three million pounds of paper annually. 

"Today`s economic climate is making it even more essential for Treasury
departments to go green," observed Gregory Long, Vice President, J.P. Morgan
Treasury Services. "Many face tremendous pressure to trim costs, operate more
efficiently and improve customer service. Electronic solutions help businesses
automate workflow, give them instant access to financial data and eliminate the
costs and risks of producing and storing paper." 

The report highlights a number of best practices to help Treasury departments
move toward a "zero-return" environment, including the following:

* Reengineering Receivables. Many Treasury departments still spend time and
money manually entering receivable and invoice information into their accounts
receivable system to track payment status. Image capture and data capture in
conjunction with web based data repositories provide faster and easier access to
documentation and eliminate the cost of transporting paper from lockbox
locations. Treasury staff can then use their bank`s online channel to improve
internal workflow, receive automated exception notices and make same-day
exception decisions. 
* Streamlining Disbursements. An online disbursement platform can significantly
reduce the resources and hours required to initiate payments, research payment
status and reconcile accounts. These platforms also reduce risk by providing
safeguards against check fraud. 
* Online Reports and Statements. Treasury departments are deluged with reports
of all kinds. Bringing these reports online eliminates boxes of paper statements
and the storage fees associated with them. With an electronic archive, Treasury
staff can use the Search feature to locate specific transactions and other data.

* Document Security. Paper documents pose significant security and business
continuity risks. A paperless environment turns them into electronic images that
are stored in a central online repository that can restrict access to sensitive
information. New workflow processes can be developed for creating, saving,
filing and accessing documents that factor in security and disaster recovery
requirements, as well as regulatory considerations.

&lt;p&gt;
BALTIMORE, Md., Feb. 17, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Goldman Small Cap Research, a
stock market research firm focused on the small cap and micro cap sectors, has
initiated coverage of Rexahn Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSE Amex:RNN), a clinical
stage pharmaceutical company commercializing potential best in class oncology
and CNS therapeutics.

Rexahn has three drugs currently in Phase II clinical trials and each of these
treatments has huge market potential. Rexahn's unique technology has already
received validation via a commercialization agreement with, and equity
investment by Teva Pharmaceutical, a top 20 global pharmaceutical firm.

In the Goldman Select Research report on the Company, analyst Rob Goldman gives
a thorough explanation of Rexahn's unique therapeutic platform and potential
competitive advantages. Goldman also presents his thesis that the current value
of the Rexahn clinical and pre-clinical portfolio is not being properly
reflected in the Company's market capitalization.

According to Goldman Small Cap Research analyst Rob Goldman, "The Company
addresses unmet needs in large markets with a clever, proprietary mechanistic
actions that should demonstrate greater efficacy and fewer side effects in
current and present clinical trials. In our view, the Street has completely
overlooked the fact that this company has blockbuster-type products with
multiple indications per compound, already in Phase II trials. Yet, the present
valuation is akin to a biotech one-trick pony. This presents a rare opportunity
for investors to invest in a clinical drug firm with a broad and deep portfolio,
at the current valuation of one-product firm."

&lt;p&gt;ATHENS Feb 17 (Reuters) - Greece's 2001 debt swap deal with

compatible with Eurostat rules, the country's finance minister

&lt;p&gt;Green Card via the Red Carpet by Andrew Bartlett and Stephen Parnell Outlines
the Positives and Negatives of the EB-5 Visa Program Providing Green Cards &amp;
Permanent Residence for Foreign Citizens
BOCA RATON, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Green Card via the Red Carpet: A Comprehensive Guide to Immigrating to the U.S.
by Investing in an EB-5 Regional Center by Andrew Bartlett and Stephen Parnell
provides vital information on visa programs using job creation that allow
foreign citizens to live, work, or retire in the United States. 

According to Bartlett and Parnell, one of the fastest and safest routes to
earning permanent residency in the USA is through an EB-5 visa, an immigration
visa designed to allow foreign nationals to invest $500,000 into a government
designated EB-5 regional center program and gain legal, permanent residence for
life. The authors contend that EB-5 visas offer an opportunity for qualified
individuals to gain entry and establish a new life in America. 

"This is the only book written for the users of the EB-5 visa, it is for the
public at large and is written with that in mind," Parnell says. "As
first-generation immigrants to the United States, we have great empathy for the
readers and a unique perspective on the problems faced by new immigrants." 

The book features descriptions and implications of the various EB-5 programs.
Designed to guide immigrants through the entire relocation process, the book
offers step-by-step instructions, tips and techniques to help foreign citizens
secure residency.

by Investing in an EB-5 Regional Centeris available for sale at Amazon.com and
other channels.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ASTANA, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Chevron-led (CVX.N) Kazakh oil
venture Tengizchevroil has stopped pumping oil through the

Sauat Mynbayev said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Central Asia's largest oil producer ships most of its crude
through Russia using the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) and
the Atyrau-Samara pipelines. A small portion is shipped across
the Caspian Sea to Azerbaijan by tankers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Addressing reporters, Mynbayev said the move could be linked

Chevron to use the routes it likes better," Mynbayev said.

&lt;p&gt;IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) anunci&#243; hoy que las incorporaciones a sus
reservas probadas en 2009 sumaron un total de 2.000 millones de barriles
equivalentes de petr&#243;leo, que reemplazan el 133% de la producci&#243;n. Sin contar el
impacto de las ventas de activos, las incorporaciones de reservas reemplazaron
el 134% de la producci&#243;n. Estas incorporaciones se basan en la definici&#243;n de la
corporaci&#243;n de lo que son reservas probadas que utiliza la base de precios a
largo plazo usada por la corporaci&#243;n para tomar decisiones de inversi&#243;n. Se
trata de una base de precios diferente a la base de la Comisi&#243;n de Valores y
Bolsa (Security Exchange Commission, SEC), que usa precios promedio de 12 meses
para el c&#225;lculo de reservas al final del a&#241;o 2009. 

"ExxonMobil es un l&#237;der de la industria en el reemplazo de reservas", se&#241;al&#243; Rex
W. Tillerson, presidente y director ejecutivo. "Hemos reemplazado m&#225;s del 100%
de la producci&#243;n durante 16 a&#241;os consecutivos, lo que refleja nuestro enfoque
estrat&#233;gico en la captura de recursos, un m&#233;todo disciplinado de inversi&#243;n y
excelencia en la ejecuci&#243;n de proyectos. Al incorporar reservas nuevas, nos
aseguramos de que ExxonMobil contin&#250;e desarrollando nuevos suministros de
energ&#237;a para satisfacer la demanda futura y respaldar el crecimiento econ&#243;mico y
los est&#225;ndares de vida mejorados". 

La declaraci&#243;n anual de reservas probadas es fruto del largo y riguroso proceso
de la corporaci&#243;n que garantiza uniformidad y responsabilidad administrativa en
todos los registros de reservas. 

Las incorporaciones de reservas de la corporaci&#243;n en el a&#241;o 2009, que fueron las
m&#225;s elevadas de la d&#233;cada, reflejan desarrollos nuevos con importantes
compromisos de financiaci&#243;n, adem&#225;s de revisiones y extensiones de los campos
existentes que resultan de las perforaciones, los estudios y el an&#225;lisis del
rendimiento de los yacimientos. Las incorporaciones de reservas del proyecto de
gas natural licuado (GNL) de Pap&#250;a Nueva Guinea y del proyecto GNL de Gorgon
Jansz en Australia sumaron un total de casi mil millones de barriles
equivalentes de petr&#243;leo. Tambi&#233;n se realizaron incorporaciones probadas en
muchos otros pa&#237;ses, como Canad&#225;, Estados Unidos, Angola y Noruega. 

A fines de 2009, la base de reservas probadas de ExxonMobil, seg&#250;n la definici&#243;n
de la corporaci&#243;n de lo que son reservas al final del a&#241;o, aument&#243; a 23.300
millones de barriles equivalentes de petr&#243;leo, divididos de forma
aproximadamente equitativa entre l&#237;quidos y gas (51% l&#237;quidos, 49% gas). La
incorporaci&#243;n de reservas desarrolladas probadas de 2009 de 2.900 millones de
barriles equivalentes de petr&#243;leo tambi&#233;n fue la m&#225;s alta de la d&#233;cada,
impulsada por el inicio exitoso de una serie de proyectos importantes. Esto
elev&#243; a un 67% la porci&#243;n de reservas probadas ya desarrolladas. 

Con la base de precios de la SEC, en 2009 el reemplazo de las reservas probadas
fue de 1.500 millones de barriles equivalentes de petr&#243;leo, con lo cual se
reemplaz&#243; el 100% de la producci&#243;n, incluido el efecto de las ventas de activos,
las arenas petrol&#237;feras que se extraen por miner&#237;a y las reservas de capital de
la empresa. 

Visi&#243;n a largo plazo

La naturaleza a largo plazo que caracteriza a la industria y la gran dimensi&#243;n
de los proyectos aut&#243;nomos que constituyen una parte importante de las
incorporaciones de reservas de la corporaci&#243;n, hacen que sea adecuado pensar en
un plazo mayor a un solo a&#241;o. El porcentaje promedio de reemplazo de reservas de
10 a&#241;os seg&#250;n la base de la corporaci&#243;n es del 112%, con un reemplazo de
l&#237;quidos del 99% y de gas del 131%. Las incorporaciones de reservas realizadas
durante este per&#237;odo abarcan una gran variedad de tipos de recursos y tienen una
amplia representaci&#243;n geogr&#225;fica. La vida de las reservas de ExxonMobil con los
&#237;ndices actuales de producci&#243;n es de 15,7 a&#241;os. 

Base de recursos l&#237;der en la industria

En 2009, ExxonMobil incorpor&#243; a su base de recursos 3.900 millones de barriles
equivalentes de petr&#243;leo, con incorporaciones clave provenientes de Canad&#225;,
Estados Unidos, &#193;frica occidental, Australia y el Reino Unido. Esto es el
resultado de un &#233;xito permanente de exploraci&#243;n gradual, de la incorporaci&#243;n de
recursos no desarrollados y de las revisiones de nuestros recursos existentes a

Comisi&#243;n de Valores y Bolsa de los Estados Unidos (SEC) y que se incluyen en
nuestro Informe Anual en el Formulario 10-K y en la Declaraci&#243;n de
Representaci&#243;n de la empresa. Estas reservas, salvo que se indique lo contrario,
se calculan usando la definici&#243;n de reservas probadas de ExxonMobil, la cual
adopta la base de precios a largo plazo que usa la corporaci&#243;n para tomar
decisiones de inversi&#243;n. Esto difiere de la base de la SEC, que calcula las
reservas al final del a&#241;o en funci&#243;n de los precios hist&#243;ricos de mercado: a
partir de 2009, utiliza el promedio de los precios de mercado del primer d&#237;a de
cada mes calendario durante el a&#241;o. Antes de 2009, las reservas seg&#250;n la base de
la SEC se calculaban en funci&#243;n de los precios al 31 de diciembre. Otra
diferencia es el tratamiento de las reservas de arenas petrol&#237;feras que se
extraen mediante miner&#237;a, as&#237; como la participaci&#243;n de ExxonMobil en las
reservas de capital de la empresa. Estas reservas se incluyen en las reservas
probadas de ExxonMobil para todos los per&#237;odos. Conforme a las definiciones de
la SEC, estos vol&#250;menes se incluyeron en el total de reservas probadas
declaradas a principios de 2009, pero se declararon por separado los a&#241;os
anteriores. 

El porcentaje de reemplazo de reservas se calcula en funci&#243;n de un per&#237;odo

Los t&#233;rminos "recursos" y "base de recursos" incluyen las cantidades de petr&#243;leo

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Can anyone beat Jeff Bridges and Christoph Waltz?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's the question facing Oscar voters as they ponder this year's actor and supporting actor categories, where there are two clear favorites and everybody else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bridges and Waltz have dominated their categories this season in what has become a fairly uneventful actor race. In fact, heading into the morning of the Oscar announcements on February 2, four of the five nominees for best actor were considered sure things. Only Jeremy Renner was a bit of a question mark, but as "The Hurt Locker" gained traction, his chances improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renner and the other lead actor nominees will have a hard time beating Bridges when winners are announced on March 7. Early in the season, George Clooney was named best actor by the National Board of Review and the New York Film Critics, signaling he might be on track for his second Oscar and his first in the lead actor category (he won supporting in 2006 for "Syriana").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But since then, virtually every other awards body has rallied behind Bridges' unvarnished portrayal of alcoholic country singer Bad Blake. Long one of the most admired actors in Hollywood, he has been nominated four previous times but has never won. In the past, many think Bridges was the victim of his own unaffected naturalism; he disappeared so completely into the characters he played that it was hard for some people to believe he was acting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might explain why Bridges failed to score a nomination for his superb turn in 1991's "The Fisher King," while co-star Robin Williams earned a nod for his showier turn. But in "Crazy Heart," Bridges is in full Oscar-bait mode in a film that so showcases his performance that distributor Fox Searchlight moved up its release date so he would qualify for awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the other nominees, Clooney likely has the next best chance of winning, given his Oscar pedigree and the movie-star quality of his performance as a frequent-flying terminator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Freeman is a contender for his performance as Nelson Mandela in "Invictus," but the film failed to make the cut for best picture, hurting his chances significantly. A win for Colin Firth ("A Single Man") would be a big upset because he received the picture's only nomination. And since Renner is perceived to have snagged that fifth slot, his chances of winning are limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year's supporting actor category has been one victory lap after another for Waltz. The Austrian steamroller's diabolical turn as Nazi "Jew hunter" Hans Landa in "Inglourious Basterds" has won every single major award, and the Academy has rarely bucked this kind of unanimity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other four nominees also contended for the Golden Globe and the SAG award, so their inclusion on the Oscar ballot came with little surprise. Woody Harrelson was remembered for "The Messenger" even though it is one of the lowest-grossing films ever to receive a major nomination from the Academy ($800,000 at press time). Stanley Tucci benefited from what might be called the "two-for-one syndrome." Voters who acknowledged his creepy performance as the murderer in "The Lovely Bones" also were giving a silent nomination to his very different turn as Julia Child's wise, loving husband in "Julie  Julia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a different year, Christopher Plummer's first-ever nomination (for "The Last Station") might have made him a shoo-in to win, much like Jessica Tandy, who won the Oscar in 1990 for "Driving Miss Daisy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this year, not even an acting legend can stop the Nazi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today's decision by U.S. and European regulators to let Microsoft Corp. and Yahoo Inc. join their search businesses could significantly heat up competition in a business that in recent years has been dominated by Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This could be a big change for the search industry," said Dan Olds, an analyst at Gabriel Consulting Group. "It combines the search efforts of two large players that both have a small search presence, but have a lot of resources and assets which they can devote to competing against Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that this will ramp up both competition and innovation . Yahoo and Microsoft now have one common enemy -- Google. And they will devote all of their energies toward making their search a more attractive option both for users and advertisers," Olds added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Yahoo - both major Google rivals in multiple businesses -- announced this morning that both the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission have approved a agreement between the two firms to have Microsoft's Bing search engine power Yahoo's sites. Microsoft and Yahoo signed the agreement last summer pending regulatory approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies disclosed today that a joint engineering team will begin adapting Bing for the Yahoo site "in the coming days" and that they hope the engine is added to the Yahoo site, at least the United States, by the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partnership, which includes Yahoo selling premium search advertising services for both companies, is a direct attack on rival Google, which has long dominated the search market. Google accounts for more than 64% of worldwide searches, according to multiple research firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an email to Computerworld , Google spokesman Adam Kovacevich said the search company welcomes the new competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There has always been robust competition in our industry, which keeps us on our toes and benefits users," wrote Kovacevich. "We compete against a number of alternatives, including traditional search engines, vertical search sites, social networks, and other forms of online and offline advertising."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most analysts agreed that the Microsoft-Yahoo search plan doesn't present a short term problem for Google, Olds said the search giant should keep a close eye on on their longer-term actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google definitely needs to take this threat seriously," Olds said. "Their two biggest and most well-heeled search competitors are now joined at the hip with the single goal of taking away Google's biggest, and essentially only revenue source. This definitely should get their attention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They need to realize that this is a new entity that is going to go all out against them," he added. "Even though Bing alone hasn't made a lot of headway against Google, it did make a significant splash when it was introduced and that served notice that Microsoft is serious about competing and raising the bar. With Yahoo, they now have a shot to make it more of a fight. I think this is really the best chance anyone has to be a viable competitor to Google."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ezra Gottheil, an analyst at Technology Business Research, said that a combined Microsoft and Yahoo search business faces a very tough task to take any market share away from the very well funded Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google's the leader in search, just like Microsoft's the leader in operating systems and PC applications," Gottheil said. "Knocking off the leader is difficult. It's not like Microsoft has been underspending on search. Bing needs to be significantly better to grow faster."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen Weiner, an analyst with Gartner, Inc., doesn't expect the Microsoft-Yahoo combination will cause any panic withing Google's walls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is Google worried? Not in any way, shape or form," said Weiner. "It's a company that's not short on hubris. Even if they have any minor degree of anxiety, I think they're in the don't-let-them-see-you-sweat mode. I don't think they're motivated by a lot of externality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharon Gaudin covers the Internet and Web 2.0, emerging technologies, and desktop and laptop chips for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt; * Disney continues negotiations with European exhibitors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Theaters upset over short theatrical release for "Alice"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Disney looks to spark sales by moving up DVD release&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Alex Dobuzinskis and Sue Zeidler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES, Feb 18 (Reuters) - UK theater chain Cineworld
on Thursday said it will play Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) "Alice
in Wonderland," signaling an apparent truce in a dispute over
Disney's plans to speed up the release of the film to DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "After much speculation around whether or not major cinema
exhibitors in the UK would play the film, Cineworld has reached
an agreement with the Walt Disney Company UK," Cineworld
(CINE.L) said in a statement. The chain said it will play the
film in 150 theaters, including many screenings in 3-D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, Disney said it asked U.S. and international
theater operators to agree to a shorter gap between the debut
of its "Alice in Wonderland" theatrical release and the DVD
launch, to help spark DVD sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney continues negotiations with European theater owners
who have threatened to boycott "Alice" over concerns a shorter
theatrical release will encourage audiences to wait for the DVD
release, instead of seeing "Alice" in theaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theater chains have been spending millions of dollars to
upgrade facilities to show 3-D films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are extremely pleased to have reached a satisfactory
compromise on this matter," Cineworld Chief Executive Steve
Wiener said in a statement. Disney declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney is looking to push forward by about a month the DVD
release for "Alice," which comes out in theaters on March 5.
DVDs are traditionally released 17 weeks after debuting in
theaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. theater owners have grumbled over the plans, but so
far they appear ready to run "Alice".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Alice" is the most highly anticipated 3-D film release
since December's "Avatar" from News Corp-owned (NWSA.O)
Twentieth Century Fox. "Avatar" has become the top grossing
film of all time with $2.4 billion at worldwide box offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As leaders in 3-D we did not want the public to miss out
on such a visual spectacle," Wiener said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney CEO Bob Iger also set off a furor among theater
owners in 2005 after saying the time between movie and DVD
releases should be shortened to save on marketing dollars and
sustain consumer excitement for titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "window" was shortened from about six months to around
four months in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now other studios are expected to experiment with the
release schedule. Industry insiders also expect Comcast Corp's
(CMCSA.O) proposed $30 billion joint venture with NBC Universal
will pave the way for further innovations such as potentially
offering blockbuster films on movie-on-demand channels ahead of
their DVD release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; General Electric Co (GE.N) owns 80 percent of NBC
Universal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis and Sue Zeidler in Los

&lt;p&gt; * U.S., EU approval of deal is unconditional&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft starts to put partnership into effect&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Expected to be operating globally by early 2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft, Yahoo, Google shares all rise modestly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds Justice Department statement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEATTLE, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O)
assault on search engine leader Google Inc (GOOG.O) took a
major step forward on Thursday as U.S. and European regulators
cleared the software company's search partnership with Yahoo
Inc (YHOO.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 10-year deal, struck last July, is the biggest effort
yet by Microsoft to establish an online business to rival
Google, an area where Microsoft has lost $5 billion over the
last four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft really has room to throw money at this," said
Kim Caughey, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group. "I
think it can work. If they can make inroads in specific target
areas, they could have something positive to report."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has already made some progress with its search
engine, Bing, picking up 3.3 points of market share since its
launch last June. But Bing is not likely to "push Google off a
very big pedestal any time soon," said Caughey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The battle for online search ads is only one front on a
sprawling war for revenue between Microsoft and Google, which
also encompasses operating systems and mobile phones. But
neither has yet managed to compete on equal terms in each
other's core market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In terms of our modeling, we really don't see any impact
from Microsoft-Yahoo on our Google numbers," said Clayton
Moran, an analyst at The Benchmark Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It doesn't change much in terms of the competitive
dynamics of the industry right away," he warned. "From a Google
perspective, looking out over the next couple of years, it's a
nonevent
."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal, cleared unconditionally by the U.S. Department of
Justice and the European Commission on Thursday, is not
expected to impact Microsoft's bottom line, but could lay the
foundation of a profitable online business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Really now, the goal is about share gain. If we grow
share, we will grow our way into profitability, and we have
confidence we can do that," said Microsoft's Yusuf Mehdi, who
is charged with making Bing and the MSN portal a financial
success, in an interview with Reuters earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares rose 1.2 percent and Yahoo's rose 0.7
percent on Nasdaq, in a broadly higher tech market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Justice Department's Antitrust Division said the deal
was unlikely to substantially lessen competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. market participants had expressed support for the
partnership as a way to create a more viable alternative to
Google, the division said in a statement issued late Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google, which did not oppose the partnership, did not
comment specifically on the regulatory approval but said that
there has always been "robust" competition in the search ad
business. Its shares rose 1.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOW IT WORKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal means Bing becomes the search engine for Microsoft
and Yahoo sites, while Yahoo focuses on attracting big
advertisers. [ID:nN29216653]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft will handle the automated auction of search ads
for use on both companies' sites, and pay Yahoo a portion of
search ad sales generated on Yahoo pages. [ID:nN29285812]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft is hoping that by making itself a single conduit
for advertisers to access customers on both sites, it will
become a credible alternative to Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month Yahoo handled 17 percent of U.S. Internet
searches, while Microsoft took 11.3 percent, according to
comScore. Theoretically, that would now give Microsoft over 28
percent of search traffic, against Google's 65.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At 30 points we are now a credible option, so that number
matters," said Mehdi earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Globally, Google is even more dominant, with 90 percent of
the search market compared with 7.4 percent for a combined
Yahoo and Bing, according to November data from Web research
firm StatCounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FULLY COMPLETE EARLY 2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Microsoft-Yahoo deal was broadly expected to gain
approval, but some had thought the companies might have to
alter the deal's terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The partnership took months to hammer out last year. It
followed Microsoft's aborted $47.5 billion Yahoo takeover
attempt the year before. Google abandoned its own advertising
deal with Yahoo in 2008, which Microsoft opposed, under
pressure from the U.S. Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Approval means Microsoft can begin the task of putting its
Bing search engine into Yahoo sites. Neither company has laid
out exactly how Yahoo's new search pages will look, but they
will essentially be Bing searches with some customization of
results by Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies aim to get the partnership fully operational
in the United States by the end of this year, with the
transition of advertisers taking place before the holiday
shopping season, if possible. The partnership should be
globally complete by early 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal had already been cleared by regulators in
Australia, Brazil and Canada, but needed U.S. and European
approval to take effect. The companies said they are still
working with regulators in Korea, Taiwan and Japan.

&lt;p&gt;With Microsoft SharePoint 2010 due in the first half of this year, the time is now for enterprises to assess the suite's new features for both end-users (blogs and wikis) and IT pros (app management, backup and recovery).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's one big complicating factor: Simply managing existing SharePoint 2007 is more than a handful for IT departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ For complete coverage on Microsoft's new Windows 7 operating system -- including hands-on reviews, video tutorials and advice on enterprise rollouts -- see CIO.com's Windows 7 Bible. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many organizations are not ready to upgrade to SP 2010 until at least six months after its general availability, or they wait until service pack 1," says Scott Gode, product manager at Azaleos, a service provider that helps companies deploy and manage SharePoint and Exchange environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizations that Gode talks to are not in a rush to move to SharePoint 2010 because of dramatic feature changes and its requirement of 64-bit hardware, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SharePoint 2010: Five New and Improved FeaturesMicrosoft SharePoint: Three Sleek Social Networking Alternatives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At The SharePoint Technology Conference in San Francisco earlier this month, Azaleos Director of SharePoint Services Jason Dearinger gave a presentation focused on general management issues for SharePoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are three monitoring and management tips from that presentation that will help keep the unruly SharePoint suite under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SharePoint Is Alive ... Treat It as Such&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since SharePoint is in use nearly all the time with users and data coming and going, it must be constantly monitored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IT must always treat SharePoint as a live thing by monitoring the health of applications, the size of databases, and how quickly search is running, Gode says. Also, you need to check the status of virtual machines if you're using virtualization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slideshow: Seven Features in Windows 7 You Probably Don't Know AboutSlideshow: Windows 7 in Pictures: The Coolest New Hardware&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every part of an IT department needs attention, Gode says, but SharePoint is special.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SharePoint needs constant care and feeding. It is more alive than other applications because users are always adding new content and have more control with SharePoint than, say, a regular database."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it is so alive though, SharePoint can grow out of control and become unusable. With too much end-user control and not enough administrative oversight, too much content can be piled into SharePoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Users won't be able to find what they need," says Gode. "There's a fine line for IT to let users run with SharePoint but also reign them in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't Rush into SharePoint 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies not ready for the learning curve of an upgrade or prepared to buy the 64-bit hardware required for SharePoint 2010 should neither rush to it nor sit by waiting, says Gode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be proactive, companies should test SharePoint applications now for compatibility and not rely on beta software or wait for Microsoft to release the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've heard ship dates for SP 2010 range from April to September," says Gode. "To set testing for collaboration apps or document management around Microsoft's schedule just doesn't make sense."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't Buy Into the Wrong Configuration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Azaleos is brough in to help customers build up a SharePoint environment, it often finds that customers don't know what they want from SharePoint. Is it for a bunch of wikis? Is it a document management system? Is it a file system on steroids?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some organizations build up SharePoint too big and make it more complex than it needs to be, says Gode, or they under-invest by using Windows SharePoint Services (a free add-on to Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and 2008) as a full-on enterprise document management system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gode urges enterprises to plan how many application servers and how many back-end database servers they should set up, and whether they should use virtualization or run everything on physical hardware. They should also devise a backup and recovery plan and figure out how much high-availability is needed with regards to the SharePoint data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gode likens SharePoint to a Swiss army knife, but one that offers more tools than most companies make use of; in fact, many customers struggle to find the one or two killer SharePoint functions that make sense for their enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The trick is to figure out how best to use SharePoint and then architect the back end accordingly," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shane O'Neill is a senior writer at CIO.com.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Yahoo announced this morning that both the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission have approved an agreement between the two firms to have Microsoft's Bing search engine power Yahoo's sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies said today that engineers will begin adapting Bing for the Yahoo site "in the coming days" and that they hope work is completed, at least the United States, by the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although we are just at the beginning of this process, we have reached an exciting milestone," said Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, in a statement. "I believe that together, Microsoft and Yahoo will promote more choice, better value and greater innovation to our customers, as well as to advertisers and publishers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partnership, which also entails Yahoo selling premium search advertising services for both companies, is a frontal assault on rival Google , which has long dominated the search market. More than 64% share of worldwide searches use Google, according to multiple research firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither Microsoft or Yahoo has had much success separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This breakthrough search alliance means Yahoo can focus even more on our own innovative search experience," said Yahoo CEO Bartz in a statement. "Yahoo gets to do what we do best: combine our science and technology with compelling content to build personally relevant online experiences for our users and customers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharon Gaudin covers the Internet and Web 2.0, emerging technologies, and desktop and laptop chips for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission on Thursday both unconditionally approved Microsoft and Yahoo's plan to work together in the field of Internet search.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will acquire a 10-year exclusive license to Yahoo's search technologies. Microsoft will also hire Yahoo Internet search and search advertising staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will become the exclusive Internet search and search advertising provider used by Yahoo. In exchange, Microsoft will retain 12 percent of the search revenues generated on Yahoo's and its partners' Web sites during the first five years of the agreement, paying 88 percent to Yahoo as a traffic acquisition cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's and Yahoo's activities in Internet search and online search advertising are very limited with combined market shares generally below 10 percent. Google, by contrast, generally enjoys market shares above 90 percent, the Commission said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to looking at the search market from the perspective of search users, the Commission also examined the potential impact of the merger on the different market players, namely advertisers, online publishers and distributors of search technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission said its investigation shows that market participants expect the Microsoft-Yahoo deal "to increase competition in Internet search and search advertising by allowing Microsoft to become a stronger competitor to Google."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft welcomed the regulatory go-ahead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although we are just at the beginning of this process, we have reached an exciting milestone," Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said in a statement. "I believe that together, Microsoft and Yahoo will promote more choice, better value and greater innovation to our customers as well as to advertisers and publishers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This breakthrough search alliance means Yahoo can focus even more on our own innovative search experience," said Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz in the same statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yahoo gets to do what we do best: combine our science and technology with compelling content to build personally relevant online experiences for our users and customers," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal was announced in July of last year. At the time, the companies said it could take them up to two years to fully implement the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* More than 55 local girls participate in "Introduce a Girl to Engineering" Day 
* Activities designed to spur creativity, confidence and interest in engineering

* Invitees include students from Irving Independent School District

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
What happens when you hand a group of middle-school girls dowel sticks, index
cards, marshmallows and rubber bands and challenge them to build a catapult? 

The hope of ExxonMobil employees at the company`s headquarters in Irving is that
they will not only build a launcher, but also a desire to pursue a career in
engineering. More than 55 girls from Bowie, Crockett, Houston and Lamar Middle
Schools and Schultz Elementary School visited the site as part of the company`s
annual "Introduce a Girl to Engineering" Day. The activities at ExxonMobilsite
are part of a broader company-wide initiative designed to encourage girls`
interest in pursuing science, technology, engineering and math studies and
careers. 

While at the facility, the students learned about the wide variety of career
options available in the fields of math and science and the growing need for
more students who can solve today`s problems with creative solutions. As part of
their engineering experience, the girls heard presentations on engineering
careers, interacted with a current engineering student and participated in two
design experiments, Marshmallow Mania and Raft Rally. 

"Interest in math and science careers is not keeping pace with the need for
engineers in the workforce, and women are significantly underrepresented in
related positions," said Truman Bell, senior program officer for ExxonMobil.
"It`s imperative that we capture young women`s attention and curiosity when they
are in middle school and show them the fun and excitement that a future in
engineering can hold." 

According to the National Engineers Week Foundation, women make up 46 percent of
the U.S. workforce but hold just 26 percent of related science, engineering and
technology positions. Of the more than two million employed engineers in this
country, fewer than 10 percent are women. 

ExxonMobil recently partnered with Dr. Sally Ride, the first American woman in
space, to address the underrepresentation of women in science fields by
developing the Sally Ride Science Academy brought to you by ExxonMobil. The
Academy is based on a train-the-trainer model and works with upper elementary
and middle school teachers to equip them with tools and skills to showcase the
diverse array of creative, rewarding scientific professions. 

Dr. Ride attended the Irving "Introduce a Girl to Engineering" Day to share with
the girls her experiences as an astronaut and scientists and participate in the
hands-on experiments. 

"In order for girls to consider careers in science, they need to see themselves
as `doers` of science," said Dr. Ride. "Through the Sally Ride Science Academy
and events like Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day, girls not only engage with
science and engineering concepts through hands-on activities, but also have
access to role models and living examples of the variety of careers in science
and engineering." 

"Introduce a Girl to Engineering" Day is a national priority for ExxonMobil,
which holds events at 14 company sites and reaches more than 3,500 students
annually. It is held in conjunction with National Engineers Week, February
14-19, 2010.

&lt;p&gt;In pushing for a standard Windows Phone 7 experience across many devices and carriers, Microsoft is likely to run into problems. For as much as Microsoft wants its smartphone OS to look and act the same across many devices, carriers and hardware makers want to make their own marks, too. At stake is control of the user experience and, ultimately, of customers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will the carriers and hardware manufacturers remain top dogs, or will the operating system vendors prevail? Put another way, will smartphones end up following the PC business model, where hardware manufacturers do not control user interfaces, or will they and carriers remain an important chokepoint between a smartphone OS and its users?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses may have a special interest in the answer, given their historical role in defining PC industry practices. How much uniformity they may demand across the smartphones their workers use remains to be seen, though computer industry experience may provide a useful guide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Near the conclusion of Monday's Windows Phone 7 introduction, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer responded to a question about how Microsoft will allow its Windows Phone 7 hardware partners to differentiate their products from one another. Ballmer's answer offered a bit of a Microsoft history lesson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As an old-timer, let me remind you of maybe the first time I heard this discussion is when we moved from DOS to Windows," Ballmer said. "There was consistency about Windows that we didn't have in DOS, and it turns out everybody wound up creating a bigger pool of opportunity through that transition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think when we look back three, four, five years from now, we'll see great diversity and great innovation, and everybody will actually be quite pleased we could do that on top of a higher foundation instead of having everybody re-plumb the lower-level guts of the user interface," Ballmer added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first part of Ballmer's answer makes sense, with the caveat that Microsoft was ultimately the biggest winner, not the hardware companies or even other software developers. As for future innovation and diversity, you need only look around the Windows PC ecosystem and ask yourself, "How diverse is this, really?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That potential shift in the ability to add value, away from manufacturers and carriers and toward the smartphone operating system providers explains why Microsoft may have to work hard to drive demand for its new smartphone OS by business and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's carrier and manufacturer partners have reasons to be less than supportive. A unified Windows Phone 7 experience across all hardware and carriers seems to only work in Microsoft's--and its customers--best interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I add customers to this because of my belief that the wide availability of inexpensive, compatible hardware running a limited number of operating systems is the basis for personal computing's success. Smartphones, I believe, will eventually move to the same model, though it will take time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google, with its Android smartphone OS, shares some of Microsoft's predicament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has perhaps erred by not better controlling Android. This has allowed various Android smartphones to be quite different, even while running the same operating system. While Google's partners may love this arrangement, Android today appears somewhat fractured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With multiple releases in the market and its partners making changes to its OS, Google may need to exert more leadership if Android is to have a specific meaning--beyond chaos--to customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Google's releasing features for its Nexus One that are not available on other Android s, threatens what cohesion the Android community may have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem of renegade carriers and hardware makers seems worse for Microsoft, however. Windows Phone 7 is such an immersive experience for customers, seeming to offer little that can be added or changed without diluting what Microsoft has worked hard to create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers may be better served by smartphones that share an operating system and user interface, allowing them to all work in the same manner, as personal computers generally do. This, however, could reduce smartphone makers and carriers into mere providers of commodity products and services, dramatically reducing their value-add and profit potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer's history lesson also left out an important timing element: The move from DOS to Windows occurred when the PC market was still in its infancy, unlike today's global wireless industry. Microsoft was also the clear leader in the PC market at the time, which is a position it does not hold in smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Andy Lees, who shared the stage with Ballmer, denied his company is trying to wrest control away from carriers and smartphone makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we want to do is that we make it so that user experience is extensible rather than it has to be replaced," Lees said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So, having consistency provides an overall better user experience, but we've made it very extensible. You can do a lot of different things to add a lot of different value, because we're a platform down below. And so that's how we allow extensibility without having the chaos of everybody trying to compete and change the same thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In such a world--which exists today in PCs--the OS vendor wins, customers win, developers win, but hardware manufacturers and carriers find their role greatly limited compared to what they enjoy today. It seems unlikely they will give up that influence--and the profits that go with it--without a fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Coursey tweets as @techinciter and can be contacted via his Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/189709&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's assault on search engine leader Google Inc took a major step forward on Thursday as U.S. and European regulators cleared the software company's search partnership with Yahoo Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 10-year deal, struck last July, is the biggest effort yet by Microsoft to establish an online business to rival Google, an area where Microsoft has lost $5 billion over the last four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft really has room to throw money at this," said Kim Caughey, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group. "I think it can work. If they can make inroads in specific target areas, they could have something positive to report."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has already made some progress with its search engine, Bing, picking up 3.3 points of market share since its launch last June. But Bing is not likely to "push Google off a very big pedestal any time soon," said Caughey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battle for online search ads is only one front on a sprawling war for revenue between Microsoft and Google, which also encompasses operating systems and mobile phones. But neither has yet managed to compete on equal terms in each other's core market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In terms of our modeling, we really don't see any impact from Microsoft-Yahoo on our Google numbers," said Clayton Moran, an analyst at The Benchmark Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It doesn't change much in terms of the competitive dynamics of the industry right away," he warned. "From a Google perspective, looking out over the next couple of years, it's a non-event."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal, cleared unconditionally by the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission on Thursday, is not expected to impact Microsoft's bottom line, but could lay the foundation of a profitable online business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Really now, the goal is about share gain. If we grow share, we will grow our way into profitability, and we have confidence we can do that," said Microsoft's Yusuf Mehdi, who is charged with making Bing and the MSN portal a financial success, in an interview with Reuters earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares rose 1.2 percent and Yahoo's rose 0.7 percent on Nasdaq, in a broadly higher tech market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google, which did not oppose the partnership, did not comment specifically on the regulatory approval but said that there has always been "robust" competition in the search ad business. Its shares rose 1.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOW IT WORKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal means Bing becomes the search engine for Microsoft and Yahoo sites, while Yahoo focuses on attracting big advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will handle the automated auction of search ads for use on both companies' sites, and pay Yahoo a portion of search ad sales generated on Yahoo pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is hoping that by making itself a single conduit for advertisers to access customers on both sites, it will become a credible alternative to Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month Yahoo handled 17 percent of U.S. Internet searches, while Microsoft took 11.3 percent, according to comScore. Theoretically, that would now give Microsoft over 28 percent of search traffic, against Google's 65.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At 30 points we are now a credible option, so that number matters," said Mehdi earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, Google is even more dominant, with 90 percent of the search market compared with 7.4 percent for a combined Yahoo and Bing, according to November data from Web research firm StatCounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FULLY COMPLETE EARLY 2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft-Yahoo deal was broadly expected to gain approval, but some had thought the companies might have to alter the deal's terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partnership took months to hammer out last year. It followed Microsoft's aborted $47.5 billion Yahoo takeover attempt the year before. Google abandoned its own advertising deal with Yahoo in 2008, which Microsoft opposed, under pressure from the U.S. Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approval means Microsoft can begin the task of putting its Bing search engine into Yahoo sites. Neither company has laid out exactly how Yahoo's new search pages will look, but they will essentially be Bing searches with some customization of results by Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies aim to get the partnership fully operational in the United States by the end of this year, with the transition of advertisers taking place before the holiday shopping season, if possible. The partnership should be globally complete by early 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal had already been cleared by regulators in Australia, Brazil and Canada, but needed U.S. and European approval to take effect.

 (Adds analyst comment, context; previous dateline BRUSSELS)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEATTLE, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O)
assault on search engine leader Google Inc (GOOG.O) took a
major step forward on Thursday as U.S. and European regulators
cleared the software company's search partnership with Yahoo
Inc (YHOO.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 10-year deal, struck last July, is the biggest effort
yet by Microsoft to establish an online business to rival
Google, an area where Microsoft has lost $5 billion over the
last four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft really has room to throw money at this," said
Kim Caughey, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group. "I
think it can work. If they can make inroads in specific target
areas, they could have something positive to report."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has already made some progress with its search
engine, Bing, picking up 3.3 points of market share since its
launch last June. But Bing is not likely to "push Google off a
very big pedestal any time soon," said Caughey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The battle for online search ads is only one front on a
sprawling war for revenue between Microsoft and Google, which
also encompasses operating systems and mobile phones. But
neither has yet managed to compete on equal terms in each
other's core market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In terms of our modeling, we really don't see any impact
from Microsoft-Yahoo on our Google numbers," said Clayton
Moran, an analyst at The Benchmark Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It doesn't change much in terms of the competitive
dynamics of the industry right away," he warned. "From a Google
perspective, looking out over the next couple of years, it's a
non-event."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal, cleared unconditionally by the U.S. Department of
Justice and the European Commission on Thursday, is not
expected to impact Microsoft's bottom line, but could lay the
foundation of a profitable online business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Really now, the goal is about share gain. If we grow
share, we will grow our way into profitability, and we have
confidence we can do that," said Microsoft's Yusuf Mehdi, who
is charged with making Bing and the MSN portal a financial
success, in an interview with Reuters earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares rose 1.2 percent and Yahoo's rose 0.7
percent on Nasdaq, in a broadly higher tech market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google, which did not oppose the partnership, did not
comment specifically on the regulatory approval but said that
there has always been "robust" competition in the search ad
business. Its shares rose 1.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOW IT WORKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal means Bing becomes the search engine for Microsoft
and Yahoo sites, while Yahoo focuses on attracting big
advertisers. [ID:nN29216653]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft will handle the automated auction of search ads
for use on both companies' sites, and pay Yahoo a portion of
search ad sales generated on Yahoo pages. [ID:nN29285812]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft is hoping that by making itself a single conduit
for advertisers to access customers on both sites, it will
become a credible alternative to Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month Yahoo handled 17 percent of U.S. Internet
searches, while Microsoft took 11.3 percent, according to
comScore. Theoretically, that would now give Microsoft over 28
percent of search traffic, against Google's 65.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At 30 points we are now a credible option, so that number
matters," said Mehdi earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Globally, Google is even more dominant, with 90 percent of
the search market compared with 7.4 percent for a combined
Yahoo and Bing, according to November data from Web research
firm StatCounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FULLY COMPLETE EARLY 2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Microsoft-Yahoo deal was broadly expected to gain
approval, but some had thought the companies might have to
alter the deal's terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The partnership took months to hammer out last year. It
followed Microsoft's aborted $47.5 billion Yahoo takeover
attempt the year before. Google abandoned its own advertising
deal with Yahoo in 2008, which Microsoft opposed, under
pressure from the U.S. Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Approval means Microsoft can begin the task of putting its
Bing search engine into Yahoo sites. Neither company has laid
out exactly how Yahoo's new search pages will look, but they
will essentially be Bing searches with some customization of
results by Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies aim to get the partnership fully operational
in the United States by the end of this year, with the
transition of advertisers taking place before the holiday
shopping season, if possible. The partnership should be
globally complete by early 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal had already been cleared by regulators in
Australia, Brazil and Canada, but needed U.S. and European
approval to take effect. The companies said they are still
working with regulators in Korea, Taiwan and Japan.

&lt;p&gt;CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc sued seven former wealth management division executives for courting Goldman employees and clients soon after quitting the bank to join rival Credit Suisse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman, in a lawsuit, accused the Swiss bank of inducing the defection of the Goldman team in Atlanta, Georgia, with tens of millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three investment professionals at the vice-president level, two associates and two managers left Goldman on February 5 to join Credit Suisse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seven immediately began "pirating" Goldman clients and colleagues to join them at Credit Suisse, according to the suit, filed in federal court in Atlanta on Wednesday. The seven violated their non-solicitation agreements and stole confidential information, the suit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse and Goldman declined to comment on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's lawsuit comes amid heated competition among the largest U.S. wealth management firms to poach advisers and their customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse's Americas private banking head told Reuters earlier this month that he wants to grow the U.S. wealth management business from 400 advisers to 700 over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, the recruiting frenzy has led to legal fights. On February 1 an industry arbitration panel ordered Raymond James Financial Inc to pay $12.1 million to Wells Fargo  Co for improperly raiding employees from four former A.G. Edwards  Sons branches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Goldman lawsuit, one of the seven defectors, David Greene, told Goldman Atlanta office head David Fox that Credit Suisse agreed to pay him $11 million to join the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greene was not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other defendants listed in the complaint are Craig Savage, Andrew Thompson, Sharran Srivatsaa, John Pitt, Stephanie Dennard and Kim Tyson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seven began soliciting Goldman's clients and employees on February 6, a day after they resigned from Goldman, according to the suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greene called Goldman Sachs Vice President Justin Berman on February 8 at 6:15 a.m. and offered him $10 million to join Credit Suisse, the suit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also accused the defectors of telling Goldman clients that the defections had "destabilized" the Atlanta office, which is in the same building as Credit Suisse's wealth managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's Atlanta team advised 140 Goldman clients in several Southeast states, according to the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit alleges that the departing advisers attempted to skirt non-solicitation agreements by having Dennard and Tyson -- who did not sign such agreements -- call former clients on behalf of the team. Clients were asked to contact Goldman advisers who were moving to Credit Suisse, the suit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The departing executives also targeted Goldman's internal list of potential wealth management clients, another violation of their employment agreements, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman asked the court to restrain the seven defectors from using Goldman information and order them to return documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is In re: Goldman, Sachs  Co. v.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft late on Wednesday confirmed that a rootkit caused Windows PCs to crash after users applied a security patch issued last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only systems infected with the Alureon rootkit were incapacitated with Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) errors that prevented booting, said Mike Reavey, the director of the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), in an announcement on the center's blog . "Our investigation has concluded that the reboot occurs because the system is infected with malware," said Reavey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that the MS10-015 update was not at fault. "We have not found quality issues with security update MS10-015," Reavey maintained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft 's conclusion that malware was to blame was not unexpected. Last week, the rootkit -- also called TDSS, Tidserv and TDL3 -- had been named by security researchers as the likely culprit .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within hours of the Jan. 9 release of MS10-015 and 12 other security updates, users reported that their computers wouldn't restart. Two days later, Microsoft halted automatic distribution of MS10-015 and launched an investigation, which revealed that malware might be the cause .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Reavey echoed independent researchers who earlier had blamed an address conflict between MS10-015 and the rootkit for the debacle. "Malware writers modified Windows behavior by attempting to access a specific memory location, instead of letting the operating system determine the address," explained Reavey. "MS10-015 was downloaded and installed, during which the location of Windows code changed. On the next reboot the malware code crashed attempting to call a specific address in Windows code which was no longer the intended OS function."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MS10-015 patched a 17-year-old bug in the kernel of all 32-bit versions of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reavey acknowledged that Microsoft's patch quality control did not catch the conflict because it's difficult to create malware interaction tests. "These types of infections often leave the machine in such an unstable state that it cannot be reliably tested," said Reavey. He also confirmed that all 32-bit versions of Windows were susceptible to Alureon-caused crashes, including Windows 7 , even though the bulk of complaints came from users running Windows XP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That shouldn't be a surprise: XP is the dominant operating system worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although several security firms have published instructions and tools for users trapped with a BSOD, Microsoft hasn't issued any advice for those already affected. Reavey's recommendation was brutal: "If customers cannot confirm removal of the Alureon rootkit using their chosen anti-virus/anti-malware software, the most secure recommendation is for the owner of the system to back up important files and completely restore the system from a cleanly formatted disk," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not explain how users were to regain control of their non-booting PCs, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaspersky Lab offers a less extreme workaround: a free utility that seeks out and destroys the rootkit ( download .zip file for Windows PCs). Symantec, meanwhile, has urged users to replace rootkit-infected drivers with clean copies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will provide a way for users to detect and remove the Alureon rootkit from infected PCs, but Reavey said it would be "a few weeks" before it is ready. In the past, Microsoft has used its Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT), a free program updated each Patch Tuesday, to seek out and destroy rootkits. The next scheduled refresh of the MSRT is March 9, nearly three weeks away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the rootkit only infects machines running 32-bit Windows, Microsoft has lifted the Automatic Updates embargo on MS10-015 for 64-bit systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;ROME (Reuters) - Switzerland and Libya are ready to end a row which has stopped Europeans entering Libya, but some conditions still must be met, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said on Wednesday after meeting his Libyan counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officials said on Monday that Libya had stopped issuing entry visas to 25 European nations in response to a Swiss entry ban on scores of Libyan officials, including Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was the latest twist in a long-running dispute between Switzerland and Libya, sparked by the brief arrest of Gaddafi's son Hannibal in Geneva in 2008. The visa ban on "Schengen" countries widened that spat to affect most of western Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frattini said Swiss Foreign Minister Micheline Calmy-Rey told him by telephone on Tuesday evening that Switzerland was ready to scrap the travel ban on 186 Libyans provided that Tripoli releases two Swiss businessmen detained in 2008, in retaliation for Hannibal Gaddafi's arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his meeting on Wednesday, Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa told him that Tripoli was open to this deal but first wanted Switzerland to open an investigation into the leaking to the press of photos of Hannibal Gaddafi in police custody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My Libyan colleague told me today they have no problem with (ending the visa ban), but a key preliminary step must be the opening of an investigation into the leaking of the photos taken in a public office," Frattini told a news conference after the meeting, also attended by Maltese Foreign Minister Tonio Borg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frattini, who strongly criticised Switzerland on Tuesday for misusing the Schengen zone's visa rules to pressure Libya, said Koussa would travel to Madrid later on Wednesday to meet Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos. Spain currently holds the European Union rotating presidency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ENERGY INTERESTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's center right government has forged closer ties with former Italian colony Libya, where Eni has oil investments and Italian infrastructure companies are seeking contracts. Meanwhile Italy's ties with its Alpine neighbor have been strained by a row over bank secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil exporter Libya has been attracting growing foreign investment since it emerged from decades of international isolation and analysts said the visa move might harm its business reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EU member states and partners in Schengen -- a borderless travel zone grouping 22 EU nations plus Switzerland, Norway and Iceland -- will meet in Brussels on Thursday to discuss the problem and EU foreign ministers will take it up on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the discussions, EU officials were more downbeat than Italy on the prospect of an immediate solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is going to take a long time -- you are not going to have a miracle solution overnight. But everything that can be done is being done," Michele Cercone, European Commission spokesman on home affairs, told a briefing in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switzerland introduced its own restrictive visa policy last autumn but as a Swiss policy, it would not necessarily apply to other Schengen member states, officials say. It was not clear why Libya only reacted in the last few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switzerland says it acted within Schengen rules and that it had targeted only a small number of applicants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dispute dates back to July 2008 when Hannibal Gaddafi and his pregnant wife were arrested on charges of mistreating two domestic employees, a case which was later dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hannibal has launched a court case against Geneva authorities and a newspaper for publishing a police photo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the arrest, OPEC member Libya halted oil exports to Switzerland, withdrew $5 billion in assets from Swiss accounts and detained two Swiss businessmen in Libya, Max Goeldi and Rachid Hamdani, both of whom are still there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frattini said Libya's move had not been "a total block" on entry by Schengen citizens into Libya. "In the last 24 hours, all the Italian citizens who needed to enter Libya have entered," he said. "My Maltese colleague told me the same thing."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Completion of U.S., European Review Clears Way for Agreement to Move Forward
SUNNYVALE, Calif. &amp; REDMOND, Wash.--(Business Wire)--
Microsoft (Nasdaq:MSFT) and Yahoo! (Nasdaq:YHOO) announced today that they have
received clearance for their search agreement, without restrictions, from both
the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission, and will now turn
their attention to beginning the process of implementing the deal. 

Implementation of the deal is expected to begin in the coming days and will
involve transitioning Yahoo!`s algorithmic and paid search platforms to
Microsoft, with Yahoo! becoming the exclusive relationship sales force for both
companies` premium search advertisers globally. Once the transition is
completed, the companies` unified search marketplace will deliver improved
innovation for consumers, better volume and efficiency for advertisers and
better monetization opportunities for web publishers through a platform that
contains a larger pool of search queries. 

"This breakthrough search alliance means Yahoo! can focus even more on our own
innovative search experience," said Yahoo! Chief Executive Officer Carol Bartz.
"Yahoo! gets to do what we do best: combine our science and technology with
compelling content to build personally relevant online experiences for our users
and customers." 

Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer concurred with Bartz`s assessment. "Although we are
just at the beginning of this process, we have reached an exciting milestone,"
Ballmer said. "I believe that together, Microsoft and Yahoo! will promote more
choice, better value and greater innovation to our customers as well as to
advertisers and publishers." 

Consumer Search Experience

Under terms of the agreement, which was announced in late July 2009, Microsoft
will provide Yahoo! with the same search result listings available through Bing,
and Yahoo! will innovate around those listings by integrating rich Yahoo!
content, enhanced listings with conveniently organized information about key
topics, and tools to tailor the experience for Yahoo! users. 

Yahoo! will focus on providing a compelling and innovative search experience
that allows people to find and explore the things, people and sites that matter
most to them. While Microsoft will provide the underlying platform, both
companies will continue to create different, compelling and evolving
experiences, competing for audience, engagement and clicks. 

Transition Timeline

Yahoo! and Microsoft will work with advertisers, publishers and developers on a
customized plan designed to make the transition as efficient and seamless as
possible. Both companies will begin working closely with most partners well in
advance of their planned transition to the Microsoft platform and will
communicate important information to partners about the transition periodically
via phone, email, webinars and a newly created website at
www.searchalliance.com. 

The companies will begin the transition of algorithmic search and have set a
goal of completing that effort in at least the United States by the end of 2010.
The companies also hope to make significant progress transitioning U.S.
advertisers and publishers prior to the 2010 holiday season, but may wait until
2011 if they determine that the transition will be more effective after the
holiday season. All global customers and partners are expected to be
transitioned by early 2012. 

Customer Relationships

Once the transition is in place, Yahoo! and Microsoft will each represent and
provide customer support to different advertiser segments. Yahoo!`s sales team
will exclusively represent and support high volume advertisers, SEO and SEM
agencies, and resellers and their clients. Microsoft will represent and support
self-service advertisers. 

Regulatory Summary

Although the transaction previously was cleared by regulators in Australia,
Brazil and Canada, the terms of the agreement required clearance by U.S. and
European regulators before it could commence. Meanwhile, Microsoft and Yahoo!
continue to work with regulators in Korea, Taiwan, and Japan to ensure that they
have all relevant information necessary to evaluate the transaction before the
deal commences in those specific jurisdictions.

&lt;p&gt;IRVING, Texas (USA)--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) hat heute bekannt gegeben, dass die Zug&#228;nge
zu den nachgewiesenen Reserven im Jahr 2009 insgesamt 2 Milliarden Barrel
&#214;leinheiten ausmachten und somit 133 Prozent der F&#246;rdermengen ersetzten. Ohne
Einrechnung der Auswirkung durch Abg&#228;nge aus Verk&#228;ufen ersetzten die
Reservenzug&#228;nge 134 Prozent der F&#246;rdermengen. Diese Zug&#228;nge basieren auf der
Definition des Unternehmens f&#252;r nachgewiesene Reserven, die sich der
langfristigen Preisgrundlage bedient, um Anlageentscheidungen zu treffen. Diese
Preisgrundlage unterscheidet sich von der der SEC, die sich der zw&#246;lfmonatigen
Durchschnittspreise f&#252;r die Berechnung der Reserven f&#252;r Ende 2009 bedient. 

&#8222;ExxonMobil ist hinsichtlich der Erneuerung von Reserven branchenf&#252;hrend",
erkl&#228;rte Rex W. Tillerson, Chairman und Chief Executive Officer. &#8222;Wir haben im
Laufe der letzten 16 Jahre mehr als 100 Prozent unserer F&#246;rdermengen erneuert,
eine Tatsache, die unseren strategischen Fokus auf die Sicherung neuer
Ressourcen, eine disziplinierte Herangehensweise an Investitionen und eine
herausragende Projektabwicklung widerspiegelt. Die Zuf&#252;hrung neuer Reserven
gew&#228;hrleistet, dass ExxonMobil weiterhin neue Energiequellen erschlie&#223;t, um auch
in der Zukunft den Bedarf decken, die Wirtschaftsentwicklung unterst&#252;tzen und
den Lebensstandard heben zu k&#246;nnen." 

Der j&#228;hrliche Bericht &#252;ber die nachgewiesenen Reserven ist das Ergebnis des seit
langem vom Unternehmen angewandten stringenten Prozesses, der die Kontinuit&#228;t
und die Verantwortung des Managements in Bezug auf alle Buchungen von Reserven
gew&#228;hrleistet. 

Die Reservenzug&#228;nge des Unternehmens im Jahr 2009, die h&#246;chsten in diesem
Jahrzehnt, spiegeln sowohl neue Erschlie&#223;ungen mit erheblichen
Finanzierungsverpflichtungen als auch &#196;nderungen und Erg&#228;nzungen bei bestehenden
Feldern durch Bohrungen, Studien und Analysen der Feldesperformance wider. Die
Reservenzug&#228;nge aus dem LNG-Projekt in Papua Neuguinea und dem
Gorgon-Jansz-LNG-Projekt in Australien beliefen sich insgesamt auf fast eine
Milliarde Barrel &#214;leinheiten. Nachgewiesene Zug&#228;nge konnten auch in vielen
anderen L&#228;ndern wie zum Beispiel Kanada, den USA, Angola und Norwegen verbucht
werden. 

Ende 2009 hatten sich die nachgewiesene Reserven von ExxonMobil gem&#228;&#223; der
Definition des Unternehmens f&#252;r Jahresendreserven auf 23,3 Milliarden Barrel
&#214;leinheiten erh&#246;ht, relativ gleichm&#228;&#223;ig verteilt zwischen Fl&#252;ssigkeiten und
Erdgas (51 Prozent Fl&#252;ssigkeiten, 49 Prozent Gas). Die Zuf&#252;hrung der in 2009
nachgewiesen erschlossenen Reserven in H&#246;he von 2,9 Milliarden Barrel
&#214;leinheiten war ebenfalls die gr&#246;&#223;te Erh&#246;hung in diesem Jahrzehnt, und l&#228;sst
sich im wesentlichen mit dem erfolgreichen Beginn einer Reihe gro&#223;er Projekte
erkl&#228;ren. Dies erh&#246;ht den Anteil nachgewiesener und schon erschlossener Reserven
auf 67 Prozent. 

Unter Zuhilfenahme der Preisgrundlage der SEC betrug die Reservenerneuerung 2009
1,5 Milliarden Barrel &#214;leinheiten, was bei Einrechnung der Auswirkungen von
Abg&#228;ngen durch Verk&#228;ufe eine Erneuerungsrate, den Abbau von &#214;lsand und den
eigenen Reserven des Unternehmens von 100 Prozent der F&#246;rdermenge ausmacht. 

Langfristige Aussichten

Bei dem langfristigen Charakter der &#214;lbranche und dem bedeutenden Umfang der
einzelnen Projekte, die einen wesentlichen Teil der Reservenzug&#228;nge des
Unternehmens ausmachen, ist bei Entscheidungen ein l&#228;ngerer Zeithorizont als ein
Jahr angemessen. Die durchschnittliche Erneuerungsrate des Unternehmens betrug
w&#228;hrend der letzten 10 Jahre 112 Prozent, wobei die Fl&#252;ssigkeitserneuerung bei
99 Prozent und die Gaserneuerung bei 131 Prozent lagen. Die in diesem Zeitraum
zus&#228;tzlich erworbenen Reserven erstrecken sich &#252;ber die verschiedensten Arten
von Ressourcen und ein breites geografisches Spektrum. Die Reserven von
ExxonMobil werden bei den aktuellen F&#246;rderraten noch 15,7 Jahre halten. 

Branchenf&#252;hrende Ressourcenbasis

ExxonMobil hat seine Ressourcenbasis 2009 um 3,9 Milliarden Barrel &#214;leinheiten
erh&#246;ht, wobei die meisten Zug&#228;nge in Kanada, den USA, Westafrika, Australien und
in Gro&#223;britannien zu verzeichnen waren. Diese umfasst die stetigen
Explorationserfolge, noch nicht erschlossene Ressourcenerh&#246;hungen und
Ver&#228;nderungen, die aufgrund laufender Forschungen an unseren bestehenden
Ressourcen gemacht werden. Insgesamt stieg die Ressourcenbasis des Unternehmens
um 2,4 Milliarden Barrel &#214;leinheiten auf 74,8 Milliarden Barrel &#214;leinheiten mit
Einrechnung der F&#246;rdermenge und der Auswirkungen von Abg&#228;ngen durch Verk&#228;ufe.
Die Ressourcenmasse umfasst nachgewiesene Reserven sowie auch entdeckte
Ressourcen, die voraussichtlich noch erschlossen werden. 

RECHTLICHER HINWEIS: Die Nutzung des Begriffs &#8222;Reserven" in dieser
Pressemitteilung unterscheidet sich von der Definition f&#252;r nachgewiesene
Reserven in den Regelungen der US-B&#246;rsenaufsichtsbeh&#246;rde SEC. Diese Reserven
werden, wenn nicht anderweitig angegeben, unter Verwendung der Definition von
ExxonMobil f&#252;r nachgewiesene Reserven berechnet. Diese Definition basiert auf
der langfristigen Preisgrundlage, der sich das Unternehmen f&#252;r
Anlageentscheidungen bedient. Diese unterscheidet sich von der Vorgehensweise
der SEC, die Reserven zu Jahresende unter Einbeziehung der historischen
Marktpreise berechnet: Seit 2009 nutzt die SEC die durchschnittlichen
Marktpreise vom Ersten eines jeden Monats im entsprechenden Berechnungsjahr. Vor
2009 hatte die Berechnung der Reserven der SEC auf den Preisen vom 31. Dezember
beruht. Ein weiterer Unterschied ist die Einbeziehung abgebauter &#214;lsandreserven
sowie der Anteil von ExxonMobil an den Unternehmensreserven. Diese Reserven sind
f&#252;r alle Berechnungszeitr&#228;ume in den nachgewiesenen Reserven von ExxonMobil
einbezogen. Gem&#228;&#223; den Definitionen der SEC wurden diese Vorkommen ab Anfang 2009
in die Gesamtsumme der nachgewiesenen Reserven mit einbezogen, waren aber in den
Jahren davor separat ausgewiesen worden. 

Die Reservenerneuerungsrate wird f&#252;r einen festgelegten Zeitraum berechnet, und
zwar, indem nachgewiesene Reserven an &#214;leinheiten durch die F&#246;rdermenge von
&#214;lanteilen dividiert werden. Die bei dieser Berechnung genutzten Reservenzug&#228;nge
basieren, wenn nicht anderweitig festgelegt, auf der Definition von ExxonMobil
f&#252;r nachgewiesene Reserven. 

Die Begriffe &#8222;Ressourcen" und &#8222;Ressourcenmasse" beziehen sich auf &#214;l und Gas,
das bereits entdeckt wurde, aber das noch nicht als nachgewiesen klassifiziert
wurde, und das voraussichtlich noch erschlossen werden wird. Der Begriff
&#8222;Ressourcenmasse" entspricht nicht den Definitionen der SEC wie zum Beispiel der
Definition f&#252;r &#8222;wahrscheinliche" oder &#8222;m&#246;gliche" Reserven.

&lt;p&gt;Now in Development, the Sequel to the Award-Winning Club Penguin: Elite Penguin
Force Game Will Further Enhance the Club Penguin Virtual World Experience on
Nintendo DS
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Agents of the exclusive Elite Penguin Force are being called back into action.
Disney Interactive Studios officially announced today the development of Club
Penguin: Elite Penguin Force: Herbert`s Revenge, the sequel to the 2008 top
Nintendo DS title, Club Penguin: Elite Penguin Force. This follows the initial
unveiling earlier this week by Lane Merrifield, co-founder of Club Penguin and
executive vice president of Disney Online Studios, and Steve Wadsworth,
president of Disney Interactive Media Group, during their respective keynote
addresses at the Engage! Expo at Toy Fair and the D.I.C.E. Summit. 

The original DS game, which was released holiday 2008, offered an innovative new
way to extend the adventure and storyline of Club Penguin onto a portable
platform. For the first time, fans were able to experience the fun and
imagination of their favorite virtual world while on the go. The game sold more
than 1.5 million units worldwide and spawned a popular downloadable mission,
"The Puffle Pranksters," which has been downloaded by kids around the globe at
an incredible rate since it launched this past holiday season. 

"We were very pleased with the incredible response to the first DS title, and
the kids have given us tremendous feedback, making it clear they want to
experience even more Club Penguin adventures on DS," said Merrifield.
"Developing a sequel was a great way to meet that need while exploring more ways
for fans to experience the Club Penguin virtual world offline." 

Club Penguin: Elite Penguin Force: Herbert`s Revenge follows the misadventures

&lt;p&gt;BARCELONA Feb 18 (Reuters) - Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC
(2498.TW) will stick with phone software from both Microsoft
(MSFT.O) and rival Google (GOOG.O) for the long term, Chief
Executive Peter Chou told Reuters on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; HTC, which specialises in smartphones that run computer-like
functions such as Web browsing and email, has long been a
staunch partner of Microsoft, and is also the maker of Google's
first own-branded phone, based on Google's Android software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our commitment to Microsoft has never changed," Chou said
in a meeting at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the
world's biggest wireless industry fair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Of course, we are very committed to Android as well. We are
very long-term committed to those two."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier in the week at the show Microsoft launched Windows
Phone 7, a revamped version of its mobile phone operating
software, [ID:nLDE61B275], while Google's (GOOG.O) chief
executive Eric Schmidt made his first appearance at the fair and
gave a keynote speech [ID:nN16234267].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HTC announced two Android phones and one Microsoft phone
thie week as well as a budget smartphone, the Smart, based on
neither Microsoft nor Google software but a chipset from
Qualcomm (QCOM.O) that will likely sell at about half the price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HTC, the world's fourth-largest maker of smartphones, said
last month that gross profit margins would fall to about 30
percent this quarter from 32 percent in the fourth quarter of
last year, but Chou said investor concern was overdone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think there's some misunderstanding that we're
sacrificing our margin tremendously," he said. "We're adding
overall absolute profit to the company, making HTC competitive,
much stronger over time," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our margins just changed 1-2 percent. It's not a big deal,"
he said. "We think we are doing the right thing for our future,
our competitiveness and we are very confident on our strategy."

&lt;p&gt;Feb 18 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) is expected to secure
the blessing of the U.S. Department of Justice for its landmark
search deal with Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), to challenge market leader
Google (GOOG.O), the New York Post quoted a source as saying.&lt;/p&gt;

reached for comment by Reuters out of regular U.S. business

increase security and make life simpler for their users," said E. K. Koh,
program director for single sign-on, IBM Tivoli software. "Others need to
replace aging authentication tokens with more comprehensive solutions supporting
digital credentials and signatures.Gemalto`s smart card technology provides
solutions that meet these requirements, and is a valuable addition to the IBM
Tivoli single sign-on suite of products."

&lt;p&gt;Security auditing vendor nCircle Network today announced free priority ratings for patches coming from Microsoft, Adobe, Apple and others, offering IT managers and end users help in deciding what should be fixed first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubbed "Patch Priority Index," nCircle's scoring system is not meant to replace the security update guidance that a company like Microsoft offers, said Andrew Storms, nCircle's director of security operations. But for patches issued by other firms, such as Adobe and Apple , the index will bring some of Microsoft's benchmark-setting practices to fixes that currently aren't ranked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For Adobe, which generally just uses one sentence to describe each vulnerability it's patching, it's all or nothing, either download and install it, or don't," Storms said, referring to that company's lack of any ranking or rating system to help users prioritize patches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;nCircle's index will start prioritizing Adobe's patches in April, when Adobe delivers its next regularly-scheduled set of security updates for its PDF viewing and editing software, Reader and Acrobat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a deluge of patches," said Storms. "This has everything to do with prioritization and resources. But we've always been focused on today," he said, pointing out that Microsoft's patch advice only concerns the updates issued that month. "They're just using a month's timeframe to tell you what's most important, but [our index] will include the entire 12 trailing months because we recognize that many can't get their patches out within 30 days, or even 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our idea is that while today is important and the patches should be reviewed, it's often more important that you're caught up," said Storms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A trial run of the index done last week, after Microsoft shipped this month's 13 updates, showed 10 patches from 2009. In other words, none of the 35 vulnerabilities patched thus far in 2010 made nCircle's top 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's because one of the factors nCircle uses to calculate the index is the length of time since a patch was issued. "The longer a vulnerability is known, the more likely that exploit code is available," said Storms. Other criteria used to create a given patch's priority include the class of the underlying vulnerability -- bugs that can be used to hijack a system get a higher number than those that cannot, for example -- and what nCircle describes as the vulnerability's "skill set."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's how easy our researchers think the vulnerability is to exploit," said Storms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;nCircle researchers evaluate each vulnerability and patch to determine the class and skill set components to the final index value. "Every single CVE gets a human eye," said Storms, talking about the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures identifier each security bug is assigned by the patching vendor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The free priority index uses a scoring system that will be unfamiliar to people used to Microsoft's four-step rankings of critical through low: "We don't stop at 10," said Storms. There's no upper range."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed. nCircle's February top 10 Microsoft patches start with No. 10, which has an index value of 3011, but climbs to 13,868 for No. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not saying ours is the best [patch priority ranking], but we do think it's complementary to what's already out there," said Storms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The index can be viewed on nCircle's site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's assault on search engine leader Google Inc took a major step forward on Thursday as U.S. and European regulators cleared the software company's search partnership with Yahoo Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 10-year deal, struck last July, is the biggest effort yet by Microsoft to establish an online business to rival Google, an area where Microsoft has lost $5 billion over the last four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft really has room to throw money at this," said Kim Caughey, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group. "I think it can work. If they can make inroads in specific target areas, they could have something positive to report."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has already made some progress with its search engine, Bing, picking up 3.3 points of market share since its launch last June. But Bing is not likely to "push Google off a very big pedestal any time soon," said Caughey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battle for online search ads is only one front on a sprawling war for revenue between Microsoft and Google, which also encompasses operating systems and mobile phones. But neither has yet managed to compete on equal terms in each other's core market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In terms of our modeling, we really don't see any impact from Microsoft-Yahoo on our Google numbers," said Clayton Moran, an analyst at The Benchmark Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It doesn't change much in terms of the competitive dynamics of the industry right away," he warned. "From a Google perspective, looking out over the next couple of years, it's a nonevent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal, cleared unconditionally by the Department of Justice and the European Commission on Thursday, is not expected to impact Microsoft's bottom line, but could lay the foundation of a profitable online business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Really now, the goal is about share gain. If we grow share, we will grow our way into profitability, and we have confidence we can do that," said Microsoft's Yusuf Mehdi, who is charged with making Bing and the MSN portal a financial success, in an interview with Reuters earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares rose 1.2 percent and Yahoo's rose 0.7 percent on Nasdaq, in a broadly higher tech market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department's Antitrust Division said the deal was unlikely to substantially lessen competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. market participants had expressed support for the partnership as a way to create a more viable alternative to Google, the division said in a statement issued late Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google, which did not oppose the partnership, did not comment specifically on the regulatory approval but said that there has always been "robust" competition in the search ad business. Its shares rose 1.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOW IT WORKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal means Bing becomes the search engine for Microsoft and Yahoo sites, while Yahoo focuses on attracting big advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will handle the automated auction of search ads for use on both companies' sites, and pay Yahoo a portion of search ad sales generated on Yahoo pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is hoping that by making itself a single conduit for advertisers to access customers on both sites, it will become a credible alternative to Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month Yahoo handled 17 percent of U.S. Internet searches, while Microsoft took 11.3 percent, according to comScore. Theoretically, that would now give Microsoft over 28 percent of search traffic, against Google's 65.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At 30 points we are now a credible option, so that number matters," said Mehdi earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, Google is even more dominant, with 90 percent of the search market compared with 7.4 percent for a combined Yahoo and Bing, according to November data from Web research firm StatCounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FULLY COMPLETE EARLY 2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft-Yahoo deal was broadly expected to gain approval, but some had thought the companies might have to alter the deal's terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partnership took months to hammer out last year. It followed Microsoft's aborted $47.5 billion Yahoo takeover attempt the year before. Google abandoned its own advertising deal with Yahoo in 2008, which Microsoft opposed, under pressure from the U.S. Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approval means Microsoft can begin the task of putting its Bing search engine into Yahoo sites. Neither company has laid out exactly how Yahoo's new search pages will look, but they will essentially be Bing searches with some customization of results by Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies aim to get the partnership fully operational in the United States by the end of this year, with the transition of advertisers taking place before the holiday shopping season, if possible. The partnership should be globally complete by early 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal had already been cleared by regulators in Australia, Brazil and Canada, but needed U.S. and European approval to take effect. The companies said they are still working with regulators in Korea, Taiwan and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Foo Yun Chee in Brussels and Ian Sherr in San Francisco; editing by Andre Grenon and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - The new Windows phone software is a big improvement on its predecessor but may not be enough to reverse market share losses, and Microsoft Corp may have to eventually buy a Nokia or BlackBerry maker RIM to get back into the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc has raised the smartphone bar with its distinctive iPhone, and Google Inc is catching up fast with its Nexus One phone and Android mobile software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, used to a near monopoly in the PC market even though it doesn't make any hardware, has found the same rules do not apply in phones. Its Windows software has not been able to deliver the same consistency of performance across a range of different phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's something I know they've talked about -- buying Research in Motion or even Nokia," Toan Tran, an analyst at Morningstar, said of Microsoft. "To really compete in this business, Microsoft needs to get into the hardware business, where they are able to control the entire user experience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Apple has shown that's the model that works," Tran added. "In a consumer device, people just want something that works, they don't want something as complicated as a PC."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which has $9.4 billion in cash and equivalents and $26.7 billion in short-term investments, declined comment on whether it has considered buying Finland's Nokia, with a market value of some $51 billion, or Canada's Research in Motion Ltd, with a value of about $39 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street has long speculated that Microsoft might make a play for RIM, Nokia or Palm Inc. But such talk is almost always accompanied by skepticism over whether Microsoft would want to get into the hardware business and compete with phones that already use its Windows software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's attempted $47.5 billion takeover of Yahoo in 2008 shows that it is not afraid of large deals, but Chief Executive Steve Ballmer this week poured cold water on the suggestion of a big acquisition in the mobile sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The word 'ever' is a big word, but I certainly don't feel like that's the right strategy for us today," Ballmer told Reuters at the launch of the new phone software in Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ERODING SHARE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest smartphone market figures show Microsoft's share fell to 8.8 percent last year from 13.9 percent the year before, according to tech research firm Canalys. In the same time, Apple's share jumped to 15.1 percent from 9.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symbian, the system used by most Nokia phones, remained the leader last year with 47.2 percent of the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft pledged to work more closely with handset makers -- such as HTC, Samsung and Sony Ericsson -- to ensure a level of consistency across many phone models, and to make the most of the touchscreen and multi-application functions of the new Windows Phone 7 software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some analysts say Microsoft should build its own phone. Tech blogs have published photos of what they say is Microsoft's planned "Project Pink" smartphone, which would be a more direct rival to the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Buying somebody would be a shortcut," said Kim Caughey, an analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which owns Microsoft shares. "But if they can give business users more functionality (with the new phones), they have a shot."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Keegan analyst Tavis McCourt said he could only see Microsoft buying a phone company if its mobile software lost so much market share that upsetting other phone partners was no longer a concern. But he said Microsoft was not at that stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft doesn't want to be in the hardware space. It would alienate its other hardware customers," said McCourt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any event, Windows Phone 7 will not hit the market until the holiday shopping season, so it will be at least a year before its success can be gauged. In that time, Apple, RIM and Nokia will all have upgraded their own offerings, changing the game once again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's a lifetime in the mobile space," said Jack Gold, head of J. Gold Associates, a technology research firm that focuses on the mobile sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Microsoft's focus should be on making sure that as many mobile users as possible can connect to its services, such as Outlook e-mail, Windows Live and Excel, or the newer Zune online marketplace and Xbox gaming system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's like Exxon Mobil saying 'I don't care what brand car you buy, just come and get gas from me'," said Gold. Making a hardware acquisition would be a "mistake," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Sinead Carew; editing by Tiffany Wu and Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

"In a consumer device, people just want something that works, they don't want something as complicated as a PC." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft, which has $9.4 billion in cash and equivalents and $26.7 billion in short-term investments, declined comment on whether it has considered buying Finland's Nokia (NOK1V.HE), with a market value of some $51 billion, or Canada's Research in Motion Ltd RIM.TO, with a value of about $39 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Wall Street has long speculated that Microsoft might make a play for RIM, Nokia or Palm Inc PALM.O. But such talk is almost always accompanied by skepticism over whether Microsoft would want to get into the hardware business and compete with phones that already use its Windows software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company's attempted $47.5 billion takeover of Yahoo in 2008 shows that it is not afraid of large deals, but Chief Executive Steve Ballmer this week poured cold water on the suggestion of a big acquisition in the mobile sector.  "The word 'ever' is a big word, but I certainly don't feel like that's the right strategy for us today," Ballmer told Reuters at the launch of the new phone software in Barcelona. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ERODING SHARE &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The latest smartphone market figures show Microsoft's share fell to 8.8 percent last year from 13.9 percent the year before, according to tech research firm Canalys. In the same time, Apple's share jumped to 15.1 percent from 9.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Symbian, the system used by most Nokia phones, remained the leader last year with 47.2 percent of the market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft pledged to work more closely with handset makers &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- such as HTC (2498.TW), Samsung (005930.KS) and Sony Ericsson -- such as HTC (2498.TW), Samsung (005930.KS) and Sony Ericsson &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- to ensure a level of consistency across many phone models, -- to ensure a level of consistency across many phone models, and to make the most of the touchscreen and multi-application functions of the new Windows Phone 7 software. [nLDE61B275] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But some analysts say Microsoft should build its own phone. Tech blogs have published photos of what they say is Microsoft's planned "Project Pink" smartphone, which would be a more direct rival to the iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Buying somebody would be a shortcut," said Kim Caughey, an analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which owns Microsoft shares. "But if they can give business users more functionality &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(with the new phones), they have a shot." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Morgan Keegan analyst Tavis McCourt said he could only see Microsoft buying a phone company if its mobile software lost so much market share that upsetting other phone partners was no longer a concern. But he said Microsoft was not at that stage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Microsoft doesn't want to be in the hardware space. It would alienate its other hardware customers," said McCourt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In any event, Windows Phone 7 will not hit the market until the holiday shopping season, so it will be at least a year before its success can be gauged. In that time, Apple, RIM and Nokia will all have upgraded their own offerings, changing the game once again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "That's a lifetime in the mobile space," said Jack Gold, head of J. Gold Associates, a technology research firm that focuses on the mobile sector. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He said Microsoft's focus should be on making sure that as many mobile users as possible can connect to its services, such as Outlook e-mail, Windows Live and Excel, or the newer Zune online marketplace and Xbox gaming system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It's like Exxon Mobil saying 'I don't care what brand car you buy, just come and get gas from me'," said Gold. Making a hardware acquisition would be a "mistake," he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Sinead Carew; editing by Tiffany Wu and Steve Orlofsky) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((bill.rigby@thomsonreuters.com; +1 206 418 9236; Reuters Messaging: bill.rigby.reuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: MICROSOFT/PHONES  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2010.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Feb 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Prolifics, the largest end-to-end systems integrator specializing in IBM
technologies, today announced that it will introduce its Autonomic
Monitoring Platform at IBM's Pulse Conference being held in Las Vegas
from February 21st - 24th. 

    Prolifics' Autonomic Monitoring Platform (AMP) provides an
intelligence-based monitoring platform that will eliminate common
problems and reduce much of the guesswork when diagnosing bottlenecks for
its customers. AMP enables organizations to prevent problems before users
report them, identify most probable fixes, and automates resolution for
common problems. The three key elements of this new and innovative
platform are 1) Self-Identification, 2) Self-Diagnosing and 3)
Self-Healing.

    Self-Identification includes monitoring performance problems and
essential application resources while displaying all single/in-flight
request details. It also includes providing notifications based on
alerts, thresholds, failures and custom events.

    Self-Diagnosis includes performing analysis of memory leaks, performance,
SQL, etc. and determining sources of bottlenecks. In addition, it enables
in-flight request diagnostics with real-time transaction tracing, log
monitoring and event correlation.

    Self-Healing includes leveraging a comprehensive knowledge base
repository of over 4,000+ common problems and resolutions that assist in
automatically correcting problems before or while they are happening. The
repository and automation is further extended based on custom
environments and types of common issues. Additionally, the AMP can stop,
restart or change configurations or initiate failover automatically for
various components.

&lt;p&gt;Conclus&#227;o da an&#225;lise na Europa e nos EUA abre caminho para avan&#231;o do acordo
SUNNYVALE, Calif&#243;rnia, e REDMOND, Washington--(Business Wire)--
A Microsoft (Nasdaq:MSFT) e a Yahoo! (Nasdaq:YHOO) anunciaram hoje que seu
acordo no segmento de busca foi aprovado, sem restri&#231;&#245;es, pelo Departamento de
Justi&#231;a dos EUA e pela Comiss&#227;o Europeia e que v&#227;o agora voltar sua aten&#231;&#227;o para
o in&#237;cio do processo de implementa&#231;&#227;o do neg&#243;cio. 

A implementa&#231;&#227;o do neg&#243;cio deve ter in&#237;cio nos pr&#243;ximos dias e vai envolver a
transi&#231;&#227;o das plataformas de busca pagas e algor&#237;tmicas da Yahoo! para a
Microsoft, com a Yahoo! tornando-se a for&#231;a de vendas de relacionamento
exclusiva dos anunciantes premium em mecanismos de busca das duas empresas.
Quando a transi&#231;&#227;o for conclu&#237;da, o mercado de busca unificado das empresas vai
oferecer mais inova&#231;&#227;o para os consumidores, maior volume e efici&#234;ncias para os
anunciantes e melhores oportunidades de monetiza&#231;&#227;o para os editores da
Internet, por meio de uma plataforma com um conjunto maior de consultas de
busca. 

"Esta revolucion&#225;ria alian&#231;a no segmento de busca significa que a Yahoo! pode se
concentrar at&#233; mais em nossa inovadora experi&#234;ncia em busca", disse a diretora
executiva da Yahoo!, Carol Bartz. "A Yahoo! tem de fazer o que faz de melhor:
combinar nossa ci&#234;ncia e tecnologia com conte&#250;do atraente para criar
experi&#234;ncias on-line pessoalmente relevantes para nossos usu&#225;rios e clientes." 

O diretor executivo da Microsoft, Steve Ballmer, concorda com a avalia&#231;&#227;o de
Bartz. "Apesar de estarmos apenas no in&#237;cio desse processo, alcan&#231;amos um marco
estimulante", disse Ballmer. "Acredito que, juntas, a Microsoft e a Yahoo! v&#227;o
promover mais escolha, mais valor e mais inova&#231;&#227;o para os clientes, anunciantes
e editores." 

Experi&#234;ncia de busca do consumidor

De acordo com os termos do acordo, que foi anunciado no final de julho de 2009,
a Microsoft vai fornecer &#224; Yahoo! as mesmas listagens de resultados de busca
dispon&#237;vel atrav&#233;s do Bing, e a Yahoo! vai inovar essas listagens integrando
conte&#250;do Yahoo! rico, listagens aprimoradas com informa&#231;&#227;o convenientemente
organizada sobre t&#243;picos essenciais e ferramentas para oferecer uma experi&#234;ncia
sob medida para os usu&#225;rios do site Yahoo! 

A Yahoo! vai se concentrar na oferta de uma experi&#234;ncia de busca inovadora e
empolgante, que permita &#224;s pessoas encontrar e conhecer melhor as coisas,
pessoas e sites que mais importam para elas. Apesar de a Microsoft fornecer a
plataforma subjacente, as duas empresas continuar&#227;o a criar experi&#234;ncias
diferentes, evolutivas e instigantes, concorrendo por p&#250;blico, engajamento e
cliques. 

Cronograma da transi&#231;&#227;o

A Yahoo! e a Microsoft v&#227;o trabalhar com anunciantes, editores e desenvolvedores
num plano sob medida, desenhado para tornar a transi&#231;&#227;o o mais eficiente e
cont&#237;nua poss&#237;vel. As duas empresas come&#231;ar&#227;o a trabalhar com a maioria dos
parceiros antes da planejada transi&#231;&#227;o para a plataforma Microsoft e,
periodicamente, levar&#227;o aos parceiros todas as informa&#231;&#245;es importantes sobre a
transi&#231;&#227;o, por telefone, e-mail, semin&#225;rios pela Internet e no rec&#233;m-criado site
www.searchalliance.com. 

As empresas v&#227;o come&#231;ar a transi&#231;&#227;o da busca algor&#237;tmica e estabeleceram a meta
de completar essa iniciativa, pelo menos nos Estados Unidos, at&#233; o final de
2010. As empresas esperam tamb&#233;m avan&#231;ar significativamente na transi&#231;&#227;o de
anunciantes e editores dos EUA antes das festas de fim de ano de 2010, mas podem
esperar at&#233; 2011, se entenderem que a transi&#231;&#227;o ser&#225; mais eficaz depois daquele
per&#237;odo. Todos os clientes e parceiros globais devem ter feito a transi&#231;&#227;o at&#233; o
in&#237;cio de 2012. 

Rela&#231;&#245;es com o cliente

Uma vez feita a transi&#231;&#227;o, a Yahoo! e a Microsoft v&#227;o representar e oferecer
apoio para diferentes segmentos de anunciantes. A equipe de vendas da Yahoo! vai
representar e apoiar, com exclusividade, os anunciantes com alto volume de
an&#250;ncios, as ag&#234;ncias de otimiza&#231;&#227;o para mecanismos de busca (SEO) e marketing
de busca (SEM) e os revendedores e seus clientes. A Microsoft vai representar e
apoiar os anunciantes de autosservi&#231;o. 

Resumo regulat&#243;rio

Apesar de a transa&#231;&#227;o ter sido anteriormente aprovada por autoridades
reguladoras na Austr&#225;lia, no Brasil e no Canad&#225;, os termos do acordo exigiam
aprova&#231;&#227;o nos EUA e na Europa antes do in&#237;cio de sua efetiva&#231;&#227;o. A Microsoft e a
Yahoo! continuam a trabalhar com as autoridades reguladoras da Coreia, de Taiwan
e Jap&#227;o para garantir que tenham todas as informa&#231;&#245;es necess&#225;rias para avaliar a
transa&#231;&#227;o antes de seu in&#237;cio efetivo nessas jurisdi&#231;&#245;es espec&#237;ficas.

Fundada em 1975, a Microsoft (Nasdaq:MSFT) &#233; a empresa l&#237;der mundial em

&lt;p&gt;Apr&#232;s examen, les autorit&#233;s am&#233;ricaines et europ&#233;ennes ent&#233;rinent l`accord qui
peut ainsi passer &#224; la phase suivante
SUNNYVALE, Californie et REDMOND, Washington--(Business Wire)--
Microsoft (Nasdaq : MSFT) et Yahoo! (Nasdaq : YHOO) ont annonc&#233; aujourd`hui
avoir re&#231;u les autorisations, sans restrictions, concernant leur accord de
recherche sur Internet, du Minist&#232;re de la justice am&#233;ricain et de la Commission
europ&#233;enne, et que les deux soci&#233;t&#233;s allaient &#224; pr&#233;sent porter leur attention
sur la mise en route du processus de mise en &#339;uvre de la transaction. 

La mise en &#339;uvre de la transaction, qui devrait d&#233;buter dans les prochains
jours, comportera le passage des plates-formes algorithmiques et de recherche
sponsoris&#233;e de Yahoo! &#224; Microsoft, Yahoo! devenant l`interm&#233;diaire exclusif des
deux soci&#233;t&#233;s pour la commercialisation de la publicit&#233; contextuelle premium
aupr&#232;s des annonceurs au niveau mondial. Une fois la transition achev&#233;e, le
march&#233; unifi&#233; de recherche sur Internet des soci&#233;t&#233;s offrira une innovation
am&#233;lior&#233;e aux internautes, de meilleurs volumes et une plus grande efficacit&#233;
aux annonceurs et de meilleures opportunit&#233;s de mon&#233;tisation aux &#233;diteurs Web,
gr&#226;ce &#224; une plateforme qui contient un pool plus vaste de requ&#234;tes
d`interrogation. 

&#171; Cette alliance de recherche r&#233;volutionnaire signifie que Yahoo! peut focaliser
son attention encore plus sur sa propre exp&#233;rience de recherche sur Internet
novatrice &#187;, a d&#233;clar&#233; Carol Bartz, la PDG de Yahoo!. &#171; Yahoo! a la possibilit&#233;
de se concentrer sur ce qu`elle fait le mieux, &#224; savoir allier son expertise
scientifique et technologique &#224; des contenus captivants afin de d&#233;velopper des
exp&#233;riences en ligne pertinentes sur le plan personnel pour ses utilisateurs et
clients. &#187; 

Le PDG de Microsoft, Steve Ballmer, est d`accord avec Mme Bartz sur ce point. &#171;
Bien que nous ne soyons qu`au d&#233;but de ce processus, nous avons atteint un
formidable jalon &#187;, a confi&#233; M. Ballmer. &#171; Je crois qu`ensemble, Microsoft et
Yahoo! vont promouvoir un choix plus important, une meilleure valeur et une plus
grande innovation aupr&#232;s de leurs clients, des annonceurs et des &#233;diteurs. &#187; 

Exp&#233;rience de l`internaute de la recherche sur Internet

En vertu des termes de l`accord, lequel a &#233;t&#233; annonc&#233; fin juillet 2009,
Microsoft fournira &#224; Yahoo! les m&#234;mes listes de r&#233;sultats de recherche
disponibles via Bing, et Yahoo! innovera autour de ces listes en y int&#233;grant du
contenu Yahoo! enrichi, des listes am&#233;lior&#233;es d`informations organis&#233;es de fa&#231;on
pratique sur des sujets cl&#233;s, et des outils permettant aux utilisateurs de
Yahoo! de personnaliser leur exp&#233;rience. 

Yahoo! s`attachera &#224; offrir une exp&#233;rience de recherche sur Internet innovante
et captivante permettant aux internautes de trouver et d`explorer les choses,
les personnes et les sites qui ont le plus d`importance pour eux. Alors que
Microsoft fournira la plateforme sous-jacente, les deux soci&#233;t&#233;s continueront &#224;
cr&#233;er des exp&#233;riences diff&#233;rentes passionnantes et &#233;volutives, restant
concurrentes pour ce qui est du public, de l`engagement et du nombre de clics. 

Calendrier de la transition

Yahoo! et Microsoft vont collaborer avec des annonceurs, des &#233;diteurs et des
d&#233;veloppeurs &#224; l`&#233;laboration d`un plan personnalis&#233; destin&#233; &#224; rendre la
transition aussi efficiente et aussi transparente que possible. Les deux
soci&#233;t&#233;s commenceront &#224; travailler &#233;troitement avec la plupart des partenaires
bien avant leur transition pr&#233;vue vers la plateforme Microsoft, et leur
communiqueront p&#233;riodiquement des informations importantes au sujet de la
transition via t&#233;l&#233;phone, courriels, webinaires et un site Internet nouvellement
cr&#233;&#233; :www.searchalliance.com. 

Les soci&#233;t&#233;s vont commencer la transition de la recherche algorithmique et ont
fix&#233; comme objectif de terminer cette phase d`ici fin 2010, du moins pour ce qui
est des &#201;tats-Unis. Elles esp&#232;rent par ailleurs r&#233;aliser d`importants progr&#232;s au
niveau de la transition des annonceurs et &#233;diteurs aux &#201;tats-Unis avant la
p&#233;riode des f&#234;tes 2010, mais pourront &#233;ventuellement attendre 2011 si elles
jugent que la transition sera plus efficace apr&#232;s les f&#234;tes. La transition de
tous les clients et partenaires &#224; l`&#233;chelle mondiale devrait &#234;tre termin&#233;e d`ici
&#224; d&#233;but 2012. 

Relations clients

Une fois la transition en place, Yahoo! et Microsoft repr&#233;senteront chacune
diff&#233;rents segments d`annonceurs auxquels elles fourniront un support client.
L`&#233;quipe de vente de Yahoo! repr&#233;sentera et fournira le support client
exclusivement aux annonceurs &#224; gros volume, aux agences SEO et SEM et aux
revendeurs et &#224; leurs clients. Microsoft repr&#233;sentera et fournira le support
client aux annonceurs en self-service. 

R&#233;sum&#233; sur les autorisations r&#233;glementaires

Bien que la transaction ait d&#233;j&#224; re&#231;u l`accord des instances r&#233;glementaires en
Australie, au Br&#233;sil et au Canada, les termes de l`accord n&#233;cessitaient
l`autorisation des autorit&#233;s am&#233;ricaines et europ&#233;ennes avant que celui-ci ne
puisse commencer. Entre-temps, Microsoft et Yahoo! continuent &#224; travailler avec
les instances r&#233;glementaires cor&#233;ennes, ta&#239;wanaises et japonaises pour s`assurer
que celles-ci soient bien en possession de toutes les informations dont elles
ont besoin pour &#233;valuer la transaction avant que cette derni&#232;re ne commence dans
ces juridictions en question.

&lt;p&gt;La finalizaci&#243;n de las revisiones estadounidenses y europeas abre el camino para
que avance el acuerdo
SUNNYVALE, California y REDMOND, Washington--(Business Wire)--
Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) y Yahoo! (Nasdaq: YHOO) anunciaron hoy que han obtenido
autorizaci&#243;n para su acuerdo relacionado con las b&#250;squedas, sin restricciones,
tanto del Departamento de Justicia de los EE. UU. como de la Comisi&#243;n Europea, y
ahora centrar&#225;n su atenci&#243;n en el inicio del proceso de implementaci&#243;n del
acuerdo. 

Se espera que la implementaci&#243;n del acuerdo comience en los pr&#243;ximos d&#237;as e
implicar&#225; la transici&#243;n de las plataformas de b&#250;squeda algor&#237;tmica y pagada de
Yahoo! a Microsoft, convirti&#233;ndose Yahoo! en la fuerza de ventas exclusiva para
los anunciantes premium de ambas compa&#241;&#237;as a nivel mundial. Una vez se complete
la transici&#243;n, el mercado unificado de b&#250;squedas de las compa&#241;&#237;as brindar&#225; una
mayor innovaci&#243;n a los consumidores, mejor eficacia y mayor volumen para los
anunciantes, as&#237; como m&#225;s oportunidades de monetizaci&#243;n para los editores web
por medio de una plataforma que incluye una mayor fuente de consultas de
b&#250;squeda. 

"Esta innovadora alianza de sistemas de b&#250;squeda significa que Yahoo! puede
concentrarse a&#250;n m&#225;s en su propia e innovadora experiencia de b&#250;squeda",
manifest&#243; Carol Bartz, directora ejecutiva de Yahoo!. "En Yahoo! ahora podemos
dedicarnos a lo que mejor hacemos: combinar nuestra ciencia y tecnolog&#237;a con
contenidos atractivos para desarrollar experiencias en Internet relevantes a
nivel personal para nuestros clientes y usuarios". 

Steve Ballmer, director ejecutivo de Microsoft, coincidi&#243; con la declaraci&#243;n de
Bartz. "Aunque hasta ahora nos encontramos en el inicio de este proceso, hemos
alcanzado un hito emocionante", expres&#243; Ballmer. "Pienso que en conjunto,
Microsoft y Yahoo! promover&#225;n m&#225;s opciones, mayor valor y m&#225;s innovaci&#243;n para
nuestros clientes y tambi&#233;n para los anunciantes y editores". 

Experiencia de b&#250;squeda del consumidor

Seg&#250;n las condiciones del acuerdo, anunciado a fines de julio de 2009, Microsoft
proporcionar&#225; a Yahoo! las mismas listas de resultados de b&#250;squeda que se
encuentran disponibles a trav&#233;s de Bing y, a su vez, Yahoo! innovar&#225; en relaci&#243;n
a esas listas al combinar listas mejoradas gracias al rico contenido de Yahoo!
con informaci&#243;n organizada de manera pr&#225;ctica acerca de temas clave y
herramientas para personalizar la experiencia de los usuarios de Yahoo!. 

Yahoo! se concentrar&#225; en ofrecer una experiencia de b&#250;squeda innovadora y
atractiva que permita que los usuarios exploren y encuentren las cosas, las
personas y los sitios que m&#225;s les interesen. Si bien Microsoft proporcionar&#225; la
plataforma principal, ambas compa&#241;&#237;as continuar&#225;n creando experiencias
diferentes, atractivas y en evoluci&#243;n, y compitiendo por la audiencia, la
participaci&#243;n y los clics. 

Cronograma de la transici&#243;n

Yahoo! y Microsoft trabajar&#225;n con anunciantes, editores y desarrolladores
siguiendo un plan personalizado, que est&#225; dise&#241;ado para que la transici&#243;n sea lo
m&#225;s eficaz posible y sin inconvenientes. Las dos compa&#241;&#237;as comenzar&#225;n a trabajar
en estrecha colaboraci&#243;n con la mayor&#237;a de los socios con bastante anterioridad
a la fecha prevista de transici&#243;n a la plataforma de Microsoft y comunicar&#225;n de
manera peri&#243;dica a los socios informaci&#243;n importante acerca de la transici&#243;n v&#237;a
telef&#243;nica, mediante correo electr&#243;nico, seminarios web y un sitio web
recientemente creado: www.searchalliance.com. 

Las compa&#241;&#237;as comenzar&#225;n con la transici&#243;n de la b&#250;squeda algor&#237;tmica y se han
fijado la meta de finalizar ese esfuerzo, al menos en los Estados Unidos, a
fines del a&#241;o 2010. Las compa&#241;&#237;as tambi&#233;n esperan haber logrado un progreso
importante en cuanto a la transici&#243;n de anunciantes y editores estadounidenses
antes de la temporada de fiestas de 2010, pero posiblemente esperen hasta 2011
si determinan que la transici&#243;n ser&#225; m&#225;s eficaz luego de las fiestas. Se espera
que a principios de 2012 ya se haya completado la transici&#243;n de todos los
clientes y socios a nivel mundial. 

Relaciones con los clientes

Una vez que se implemente la transici&#243;n, cada una de las compa&#241;&#237;as representar&#225;
y proporcionar&#225; atenci&#243;n al cliente a distintos segmentos de anunciantes. El
equipo de ventas de Yahoo! representar&#225; y proporcionar&#225; soporte de manera
exclusiva a los anunciantes de gran volumen, a las agencias de marketing en
motores de b&#250;squeda (Search Engine Marketing, SEM) y de optimizaci&#243;n de motores
de b&#250;squeda (Search Engine Optimization, SEO), a los revendedores y a sus
clientes. Microsoft representar&#225; y proporcionar&#225; soporte a los anunciantes de
autoservicio. 

Resumen normativo

Si bien la transacci&#243;n anteriormente fue autorizada por agencias reguladoras de
Australia, Brasil y Canad&#225;, las condiciones del acuerdo requer&#237;an el permiso de
las agencias reguladoras estadounidenses y europeas antes de que se iniciara.
Mientras tanto, Microsoft y Yahoo! contin&#250;an trabajando con agencias reguladoras
de Corea, Taiw&#225;n y Jap&#243;n para asegurarse de que tienen toda la informaci&#243;n
relevante necesaria para evaluar la transacci&#243;n antes de que comience el acuerdo
en esas jurisdicciones espec&#237;ficas.

&lt;p&gt;Procter &amp; Gamble Strongly Urged to Follow GlaxoSmithKline's Example, and Stop
the Manufacture, Distribution and Advertising of Fixodent Denture Cream
GREAT NECK, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
The attorneys of Parker Waichman Alonso LLP urge Procter &amp; Gamble to take steps
to protect consumers from the serious health risks posed by Fixodent, a denture
adhesive that contains zinc. GlaxoSmithKline announced yesterday their decision
to voluntarily stop the manufacture, distribution and advertising of three
varieties of Super PoliGrip denture adhesive products that are made with zinc. 

Parker Waichman Alonso LLP has filed numerous lawsuits on behalf of the victims
of Fixodent and Super PoliGrip. These lawsuits allege that the manufacturers of
these denture creams misled consumers about their risks and failed to provide
adequate warnings and instructions to prevent deviation from accepted use. 

A small amount of zinc is necessary for a balanced diet. However, being exposed
to an excessive amount of zinc can result in copper depletion and serious
negative adverse neurological effects. In August 2008, the peer reviewed journal
"Neurology" reported on four patients suffering from neuropathy and other
neurological symptoms typical of zinc poisoning and copper depletion. The
article specifically linked excess zinc in denture adhesives to "profound
neurologic disease" in the patients reviewed. 

Despite falling short of a full recall of its product, Parker Waichman Alonso
applauds the decision GlaxoSmithKline has finally made to protect the public
from zinc-containing Super PoliGrip varieties, even though these actions come
too late to help those already afflicted with denture cream zinc poisoning.
"While we believe GlaxoSmithKline has made a good decision here, unfortunately
it comes too late for some of our clients who have struggled, sometimes for
years, trying to find the source of their problems," says Andres Alonso, a
partner of Parker Waichman Alonso. "We sincerely hope that GlaxoSmithKline will
ultimately issue a full recall of all zinc-containing Super PoliGrip products
given their devastating impact on consumers and strongly urge Procter &amp; Gamble
to act in a similar fashion to protect the public from the risks posed by
Fixodent, the other zinc-containing denture cream on the market." 

Unfortunately, Procter &amp; Gamble remains silent and has failed to warn its
customers about the serious health hazards they face from excessive exposure to
the zinc in Fixodent. Procter &amp; Gamble should follow GlaxoSmithKline's example,
and immediately take strong steps to address this serious public health threat. 

Dozens of denture cream zinc poisoning lawsuits have been consolidated in the
Denture Cream Products Liability Multidistrict Litigation currently pending in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Miami
Division, before the Honorable Judge Cecilia Altonaga (MDL No. 2051). In an
order filed on July 13, 2009, Judge Altonaga appointed Andres F. Alonso Esq., a
partner with Parker Waichman Alonso LLP, as Co- Lead Counsel to the Plaintiffs'
Steering Committee in the Denture Cream Products Liability Litigation. 

Parker Waichman Alonso has received thousands of calls from denture cream users
and continues to offer free consultations to the victims of denture cream zinc
poisoning. If you or a loved one uses or have used Super PoliGrip or Fixodent
and now suffer from neurological problems, please contact our office by visiting

&lt;p&gt;  TORONTO, ONTARIO, Feb 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
iSIGN Media Solutions Inc. ("iSIGN" or "Company") (TSX VENTURE: ISD), is
pleased to announce that is has partnered with Skipton Group Inc.
("Skipton") on two Original Equipment Manufacturer ("OEM") initiatives
for the IBM AnyPlace(TM) Kiosk.

    As a software solutions partner, iSIGN will license its patent pending
interactive proximity messaging solution to Skipton - a Premier IBM
Business Partner with expertise in self-service technology solution
design, integration and deployment - for the purposes of enhancing two
innovative self-service offerings based on IBM's AnyPlace(TM) Kiosk
platform. Consumers will soon be able to interact with two new kiosk
innovations - a "Digital Greeter", and an Interactive cosmetic try-on
tool, dubbed, the 'Virtual Makeover Kiosk'.

    The Digital Greeter, designed for retail chains to virtually "greet" and
communicate with consumers' cell phones, offers loyalty membership
coupons and brand advertising at no cost to the consumer. 

    "There is a very high demand for in-store promotional delivery methods
that bypass printed leaflets and coupons while capturing consumer
responses and participation," states Alex Romanov, iSIGN's Chief
Executive Officer. "This Digital Greeter will set the standard for
interactive Bluetooth messaging technology with an exclusive host of
shopper conveniences and unprecedented access to valuable shopper
insight."

    An innovative hardware enclosure design for the Digital Greeter is in
development by one of Canada's most innovative and trusted consumer
packaged goods strategy consultants, The Central Group.

    The Virtual Makeover Kiosk is powered by innovative cosmetic try-on
application software. It is designed to provide North America's most
prominent cosmetic retailers with an innovative and relevant solution to
reach shoppers at the point of purchase in a market worth over $20
billion annually.

    iSIGN's licensed Bluetooth transmission solution is embedded in the kiosk
to deliver user-relevant product offerings and brand-sponsored beauty
tips directly to a shopper's mobile phone - providing an opportunity to
influence purchase decisions in real time. iSIGN will power their
interactive messaging solution on the IBM AnyPlace(TM) Kiosk platform,
seen as the industry's most reliable, proven and supported self-service
technology solution.

    Retailers will be introduced to both the Digital Greeter and Virtual
Makeover Kiosk at the Digital Signage Expo (DSE) in Las Vegas, booth
#1450, February 24-25, 2010. 

    "This route to market - leveraging the contributing partners'
complementary skill-sets with IBM's proven technology and iSIGN's
innovative approach to reaching consumers - will be an industry first,"
adds Andy Bruce, Business Development Manager for Skipton Group. "Both
kiosks are supported by scalable and customizable software platforms from
industry leading independent software vendors."

    iSIGN is now poised to become a software vendor to several other major
enterprises this quarter.

&lt;p&gt;Abschluss der beh&#246;rdlichen Pr&#252;fung in den USA und Europa ebnet Weg f&#252;r
Kooperation
SUNNYVALE, Kalifornien, &amp; REDMOND, Staat Washington (USA)--(Business Wire)--
Microsoft (Nasdaq:MSFT) und Yahoo! (Nasdaq:YHOO) haben heute bekannt gegeben,
dass sie sowohl vom US-Justizministerium als auch von der Europ&#228;ischen
Kommission die uneingeschr&#228;nkte Genehmigung f&#252;r ihre Kooperation im Bereich der
Online-Suche erhalten haben und dass sie nunmehr ihre Aufmerksamkeit der
Realisierung der Kooperationsvereinbarung widmen werden. 

Es wird erwartet, dass die Umsetzung des Vertragsabschlusses in den n&#228;chsten
Tagen eingeleitet wird. Das bedeutet, dass die algorithmische und kommerzielle
Suche von Yahoo! auf die Microsoft-Plattform &#252;bergeleitet wird und Yahoo! den
Exklusivvertrieb f&#252;r die Premium-Werbekunden beider Unternehmen weltweit
&#252;bernehmen wird. Nach Abschluss der &#220;berleitung wird der gemeinsame
Suchmarktplatz der Unternehmen durch einen gr&#246;&#223;eren Pool an Suchanfragen viele
Vorteile bieten: mehr Innovationen f&#252;r Verbraucher, h&#246;here Volumina und bessere
Effizienz f&#252;r Werbekunden und bessere Monetarisierungschancen f&#252;r Web-Publisher.


&#8222;Diese revolution&#228;re Suchallianz bedeutet, dass sich Yahoo! zuk&#252;nftig noch
st&#228;rker auf seine eigene innovative Suchumgebung konzentrieren kann", erkl&#228;rt
Carol Bartz, Chief Executive Officer von Yahoo!. &#8222;Yahoo! kann tun, was das
Unternehmen am besten kann: Wir k&#246;nnen unser wissenschaftliches und
technologisches K&#246;nnen mit attraktiven Inhalten kombinieren, um unseren Nutzern
und Kunden pers&#246;nlich relevante Online-Angebote zur Verf&#252;gung zu stellen." 

Microsoft-CEO Steve Ballmer bekr&#228;ftigt die Einsch&#228;tzung von Bartz: &#8222;Auch wenn
wir erst am Anfang stehen, haben wir bereits jetzt einen interessanten
Meilenstein erreicht.Ich bin mir sicher, dass Microsoft und Yahoo! zusammen mehr
Vielfalt, gr&#246;&#223;eren Nutzen und ein h&#246;heres Ma&#223; an Innovationen f&#252;r unsere Nutzer
ebenso wir f&#252;r unsere Werbekunden und Publisher anbieten k&#246;nnen." 

Suchumgebung f&#252;r Verbraucher

Gem&#228;&#223; den Bedingungen der Vereinbarung, die Ende Juli 2009 angek&#252;ndigt wurde,
wird Microsoft Yahoo! die gleichen Suchergebnislisten zur Verf&#252;gung stellen, die
auch &#252;ber Bing verf&#252;gbar sind. Yahoo! wird auf diese Listen aufbauend
umfangreiche Yahoo!-Inhalte, erweiterte Listen mit passend organisierten
Informationen zu Schl&#252;sselthemen und Tools zur individuellen Anpassung der
Suchumgebung f&#252;r die Yahoo!-Nutzer einbinden. 

Yahoo! wird sich auf das Angebot einer ansprechenden und innovativen Suche
konzentrieren, mit deren Hilfe die Nutzer alle jene Dinge, Menschen und Websites
finden und erkunden k&#246;nnen, die ihnen am wichtigsten sind. W&#228;hrend Microsoft die
zugrunde liegende Plattform liefern wird, werden beide Unternehmen weiterhin
unterschiedliche, attraktive und sich st&#228;ndig weiterentwickelnde Umgebungen
schaffen und damit um Besucher, Auftr&#228;ge und Klicks werben. 

Zeitplan f&#252;r die &#220;berleitung

Yahoo! und Microsoft werden gemeinsam mit Werbekunden, Publishern und
Entwicklern einen ma&#223;geschneiderten Plan entwickeln, der eine m&#246;glichst
effiziente und reibungslose &#220;berleitung gew&#228;hrleisten soll. Beide Unternehmen
werden bereits lange vor der geplanten &#220;berleitung auf die Microsoft-Plattform
anfangen, mit den meisten Partnern zusammenzuarbeiten und werden ihren Partnern
regelm&#228;&#223;ig wichtige Informationen zur &#220;berleitung per Telefon, per E-Mail, in
Webinars und auf einer neu geschaffenen Website unter www.searchalliance.com zur
Verf&#252;gung stellen. 

Die Unternehmen werden mit der &#220;berleitung der algorithmischen Suche beginnen
und haben es sich zum Ziel gesetzt, diese, zumindest in den USA, bis Ende 2010
abgeschlossen zu haben. Ebenso hoffen die Unternehmen, noch vor der
Weihnachtssaison 2010 ma&#223;gebliche Fortschritte bei der &#220;berleitung der
US-Werbekunden und Publisher zu machen, werden aber m&#246;glicherweise bis 2011
warten, sollten sie feststellen, dass die &#220;berleitung nach der Weihnachtssaison
effektiver sein sollte. Die &#220;berleitung aller Kunden und Partner weltweit soll
bis Anfang 2012 abgeschlossen sein. 

Kundenbeziehungen

Nach der &#220;berleitung werden sich Yahoo! und Microsoft jeweils um
unterschiedliche Werbekundensegmente k&#252;mmern und f&#252;r diese den Kundendienst
anbieten. Das Vertriebsteam von Yahoo! wird ausschlie&#223;lich Werbe-Gro&#223;kunden,
SEO- und SEM-Agenturen sowie Wiederverk&#228;ufer und deren Kunden betreuen.
Microsoft wird sich um Selbstbedienungs-Werbekunden k&#252;mmern und f&#252;r diese auch
den Kundendienst anbieten. 

Aufsichtsbeh&#246;rden - Zusammenfassung

Obwohl der Gesch&#228;ftsabschluss zuvor bereits von den Beh&#246;rden in Australien,
Brasilien und Kanada genehmigt wurde, war gem&#228;&#223; den Bedingungen der Vereinbarung
vorher auch noch die Zustimmung der Beh&#246;rden in den USA und Europa notwendig.
Mittlerweile arbeiten Microsoft und Yahoo! weiter mit den Beh&#246;rden in Korea,
Taiwan und Japan zusammen, um sicherzustellen, dass diese &#252;ber alle relevanten
Informationen verf&#252;gen, um den Gesch&#228;ftsabschluss vor dem Start der Kooperation
in diesen spezifischen L&#228;ndern zu pr&#252;fen. 

&#220;ber Microsoft

&lt;p&gt;  ORLANDO, FL, Feb 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Walt Disney World Resort hotels are working with Clean the World to
recycle all the partially used amenities from their nearly 28,000 Central
Florida hotel rooms. Clean the World sanitizes the soap and shampoo that
would be discarded and distributes these amenities to people in need
around the world.

    "With the support of Walt Disney World, even more supplies will reach
those in desperate need," said Paul Till, co-founder and managing
director of Clean the World, who is responsible for recruiting new hotels
to join the "Clean the World Hospitality Recycling Program." Through this
program, hotels financially contribute a tax-deductible recycling fee in
exchange for collection, recycling and free redistribution of
partially-used amenities to those suffering due to a lack of available
hygiene products. In 2009, Clean the World distributed more than 230 tons
of hygiene products to countries worldwide including Haiti, Mexico,
Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Uganda, Mali, Zimbabwe, Swaziland,
Mongolia and Romania. 

    By participating in this program, Walt Disney World Resort hotels are
showing a commitment to saving lives and protecting the environment. 

    Clean the World in Haiti
 In the wake of the devastating earthquake in
Haiti, Clean the World has stepped up its commitment to provide basic
necessities to the impoverished people of the island nation, and has
included medical supplies, food, water and other essentials as well.
Since January 2010, Clean the World has delivered over 150 tons of
supplies directly to Haiti.

    In 2009, Clean the World delivered 200,000 bars of soap to schools,
orphanages, clinics and churches in Cap Haitien, Haiti. Though its
Haitian partnerships and distribution network, Clean the World is
providing free soap to people in desperate need for proper hygiene. In
Haiti alone, 8,000 children die annually from diarrheal disease, which is
preventable by up to 62% with proper hand washing.

    About Clean the World, Inc.

Clean the World, Inc. is committed to the prevention of illness and death
caused by acute respiratory infection and diarrheal disease in countries

appropriate educational materials to domestic homeless shelters and
impoverished people worldwide. In 2009, Clean the World collected,
recycled and distributed over 230 tons of soap and other bathroom
amenities to impoverished people worldwide. With the donations of these

    Clean the World in Haiti
 In the wake of the devastating earthquake in
Haiti, Clean the World has stepped up its commitment to provide basic
necessities to the impoverished people of the island nation, and has
included medical supplies, food, water and other essentials as well.

Haitian partnerships and distribution network, Clean the World is
providing free soap to people in desperate need for proper hygiene. In
Haiti alone, 8,000 children die annually from diarrheal disease, which is
preventable by up to 62% with proper hand washing.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Europe's top movie theater chain plans to withdraw from screening the Walt Disney Co's latest film "Alice In Wonderland", escalating a dispute over the U.S. studio's proposal to release the movie's DVD weeks earlier than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Disney's long-term strategy calls for less reliance on those chains in favor of revenue from Blu-ray video and online distribution, analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, less than two weeks before the movie's March 5 debut, exhibitor Odeon  UCI Cinemas Group, owned by the London-based private equity firm Terra Firma, said it does not plan to show the movie in its UK, Irish or Italian cinemas because Disney wants to sell the DVD five weeks earlier than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theater owners worry audiences will skip seeing the movie on the big screen in favor of a shorter wait for the DVD, if Disney moves up its release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decade ago, DVDs were typically released six months after a film's theatrical debut. But Hollywood studios have been gradually moving up their DVD releases, to tap those consumers who rarely go to the theater. Disney's move will shrink that time to 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Odeon Cinemas operates 110 theaters in the UK and 22 in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negotiations continued this week between Disney and No. 2 U.S. chain AMC Entertainment Inc, which boasts more than 4,500 screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, analysts said U.S. theater chains are unlikely to boycott en-masse the year's first blockbuster release, wary of the hit to their bottom line -- at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMC did not return calls, and Disney declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"AMC's a major exhibitor chain, obviously that makes a difference, but my guess is this (dispute) will be settled close to the opening-day release," said analyst Hal Vogel of Vogel Capital Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Disney understands the implications of what they're doing," Vogel said. "They're looking to the long-term future, and the long-term future is less reliance on theaters and more reliance on new technology."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That new technology involves getting movies into homes through Blu-ray discs, as well as other delivery methods such as video-on-demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Theaters are obviously very important still, and any distribution company would be foolish to upset the relationships to any great degree," Vogel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Edwin Chan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple, Google and Microsoft  are locked in a three-way struggle for industry dominance, competing to varying degrees on hardware, computer and cell phone operating systems, applications, entertainment, Internet search and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Google owns Internet search, Microsoft owns operating systems and applications, and Apple owns high-end hardware and entertainment and media devices. That may well change, though. So it's worthwhile to ask: As each company looks to encroach on the turf of the others, which one is best positioned for the future -- and which is most likely to fall?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Apple is riding high now, it's the most vulnerable of the three. That's because its success is built on the singular vision and talent of one person -- Steve Jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In plenty of companies, if someone else took the place of an existing CEO, the company would do just about as well. That's not the case with Apple and Jobs, though -- for all intents and purposes, he is Apple. Before he returned to Apple in 1996, the company was floundering. He killed money-losing projects like the Newton; oversaw the creation of a host of innovative products, including Mac OS X, the iPod, the iPhone and the iMac; and rejuvenated the company. Harvard Business Review last year named him the most valuable CEO in the world, because under his leadership, Apple's market value increased by approximately $150 billion, delivering a 3,188% industry-adjusted return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's both the good news and the bad news for Apple. As long as Jobs is on the job, great. But he won't be CEO forever, and there's no heir apparent who can match his vision. My guess is that after he leaves, Apple will experience a long, slow decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple, far more than Microsoft or Google, has a business model somewhat akin to that of a Hollywood studio: It requires blockbuster hits in order to bring in big profits. When Jobs leaves, those hits will stop coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the three companies, Google is best positioned to thrive in the future. It has a near monopoly on Internet search, the core of the world economy's greatest growth engine. That gives it both an excellent base to expand upon, as well as a massive war chest it can depend on to fund new ventures. Although at times Google takes a scattershot approach to product development, it has heavily targeted high-growth areas as well, notably mobile devices. Because of that, it is well positioned to take advantage of the mobile device advertising boom that is likely to develop in the coming years. And although Google isn't likely to compete seriously against Microsoft in the operating systems and applications markets, it will gain enough revenue from its offerings to make it a player in those businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, there's Microsoft, which falls somewhere between Apple and Google. Unlike Apple, it doesn't need big hits in order to grow. With a stranglehold on operating systems and productivity applications, and with solid enterprise tools, it will grow steadily. Google won't be able to break its near monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The success of Windows 7 shows that the release of a new operating system still brings in plenty of revenue. Recently, Microsoft had a blowout quarter, increasing revenue by 14% over the year-earlier period, thanks to skyrocketing Windows 7 sales. And although Microsoft won't unseat Google as the Internet search leader, Bing shows that it can make plenty of money in that business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So looking ahead, expect Google to thrive, Microsoft to stay the course, and Apple eventually to lose its Jobs-driven magic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preston Gralla is a contributing editor for Computerworld.com and the author of more than 35 books, including How the Internet Works (Que, 2006).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more about management in Computerworld's Management Knowledge Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Feb 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Investment firm W. P. Carey &amp; Co. LLC (NYSE: WPC) announced today that it
has purchased the JPMorgan Chase Operations Center office building from
Brookfield Real Estate Opportunity Group, an affiliate of Brookfield
Asset Management. Located in the CentrePort Business Park two miles south
of the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and equidistant from the
Dallas Central Business District and downtown Fort Worth, the 386,000
square foot facility is leased to JPMorgan Chase Bank, National

conjunction with the recently announced closing of Brookfield's
acquisition of a 16 property, 2.9 million square foot building portfolio
from JPMorgan Chase.

    Commenting on the acquisition, W. P. Carey President and CEO Gordon DuGan
noted, "The acquisition of the JP Morgan Chase facility adds a
well-located, quality property leased to a premier tenant to our public
company property portfolio. This investment extends the average lease term
for the portfolio and replaces real estate revenue from assets sold over
the last year. As real estate owned is an important segment of adjusted
cash flow, which in turn is a key metric for determining our dividend
distributions, we are pleased to add this property to the public company
property portfolio."

    Steve Ganeless, Senior Vice President of Brookfield Real Estate
Opportunity Fund, noted, "Working with W. P. Carey on the sale of the

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Past deals by Greece and others to massage public deficits lacked transparency, a senior Goldman Sachs banker said, the first time it talked openly about financial instruments it and other banks sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currency swaps entered into by his bank and Greece helped reduce that country's budget deficit, but the instruments were not uncommon at the time and there was nothing inappropriate about them, the banker told British lawmakers on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the benefit of hindsight ... in the particular cases going back to the late 1990s and early 2000s ... the standards of transparency could have been and probably should have been higher," Goldman Sachs managing director Gerald Corrigan told a parliamentary committee in a public hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately on Monday, Goldman detailed cross-currency derivatives it conducted for Greece in 2001, which reduced the country's debt at a time it was keen to meet criteria for entering the euro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nine-year old swaps have re-emerged after several months of concern about Greece's budget and debt levels. But financial market participants have always known about them, and several publications reported about them at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those transactions were very much consistent with and comparable with the standard of behavior and measures used by the European Community. There was nothing inappropriate," he said, adding many other banks provided similar other instruments to other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal with Greece did "produce a rather small but nevertheless not insignificant reduction in Greece's debt to GDP ratios at that time," said Corrigan, a former president of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has borne the brunt of public anger over gold-plated banker pay packages, not helped by comment such as chief executive Lloyd Blankfein's assertion the bank was doing "God's work" in an interview in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman Sachs has been disproportionately singled out," Corrigan said. "I don't think it's unfair ... It's perfectly understandable that people are angry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corrigan is a member of the Group of Thirty, a non-profit organization of bankers, financial regulators and academics chaired by Paul Volcker, the former Fed chairman who is now a top economic advisor to President Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama shocked markets in January with a crackdown on banks' risk taking, proposing to limit proprietary trading -- or buying and selling of investments for their own accounts -- and exposure to hedge funds and private equity business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risks of new market upheavel remained, Corrigan said, despite the fact banks were now much safer than before the crisis, when looking at metrics such as capital, leverage ratios, and excess liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do have some concerns that if we are not very careful at some point we could see animal spirits beginning to pop up here and there again. We have to be much more aggressive and vigilant in the future than in the past," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Dan Lalor)&lt;/p&gt;

instruments used by investment banks and governments to mask

&lt;p&gt;  PRINCETON, NJ, Feb 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
A new report prepared by Educational Testing Service (ETS) concludes that
historically the Goldman Sachs Foundation (GSF) invested in highly
effective educational, leadership development, and entrepreneurial
programs for high-potential, but disadvantaged youth. ETS calculates
return on GSF's investment as $15 for each dollar it invested over the
course of its decade-long program.

    Developing High-Potential Youth Program: A Return on Investment Study for
U.S. Programs, examines the work of the GSF's U.S. grantees in their
Developing High-Potential Youth Program. Highlights of the report include
the evaluation of prominent activities, outcomes, value and impact of
seven grantees who have helped young people gain admission to, and
succeed at, the most selective colleges and universities in the United
States.

    "The GSF has established a strong track record of generating a clear ROI,"
explains Dr. Catherine Millett, ETS Senior Research Scientist. "We found
that students who participated in each of the seven programs have higher
rates of applying to, enrolling and succeeding at selective colleges and
universities than their peers. The programs that work with high-potential
youth to help them access the top universities not only are needed, but
incredibly effective."

    In the report, Millett and co-author Dr. Michael Nettles, ETS Senior Vice
President, conclude that GSF has made enormous contributions to
strengthening programs that support high-potential youth who are
economically disadvantaged and in great need of support; inventing models
that can be replicated to increase the college preparation and achievement
of high-potential youth; increasing the earnings of individuals over what
they would have earned without the support; and expanding the pool of
underrepresented students in both selective colleges and universities, and
subsequently in prestigious work environments.

    The complete report shares insights from a university president, a program
director, a current student and a college graduate into what the
Developing High-Potential Youth Program has meant to them.

&lt;p&gt;  MONTREAL, QUEBEC, Feb 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
As the world rushes to Haiti's aid and talks of a global effort to
rebuild the impoverished nation begin to surface, leading poverty expert
Jeffrey Sachs explains why eradicating poverty is not only possible, but
in the world's best interest.

    Read Jeffrey Sachs' take on how eradicating extreme poverty by 2025 is
achievable in the latest issue of the (warehouse) magazine. The
bestselling author offers insightful opinions on the Millennium
Development Goals, workable solutions to eradicate extreme poverty, and
why addressing this issue is in the rich countries' best interests.

self-styled "social revolt" aims to "mobilize consciousness and
compassion", striking a balance between fun living and important issues
by merging art, style and urban life with awareness. "It's a magazine
first and foremost, but we're also trying to build something vibrant,
something accountable" says Kevin Wilson, the magazine's editor.

    Primarily an online publication with a growing print distribution
throughout the Montreal region, the (warehouse) plans to expand to other
major Canadian cities within two years.

&lt;p&gt;To enable Hosted Exchange providers to bolster messaging security and
differentiate their offerings


SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Commtouch (NASDAQ:CTCH) announced the upcoming release of its connector for
Microsoft Exchange Server, allowing operators of hosted and managed Microsoft
Exchange environments to easily reduce costs and differentiate their email
offerings. This latest innovation will allow these operators to enjoy the same
ease of integration that is already experienced by service providers that have
deployed Commtouch on their open source infrastructure. 

The new Commtouch connector will enable operators of Microsoft Exchange
environments to benefit from the industry`s leading spam, phishing and malware
outbreak protection technology:

* Commtouch Anti-Spam: Catches 98% of spam through its cloud-based Recurring
Pattern Detection technology. 
* Zero-Hour Virus Outbreak Protection: Shields infrastructure from new malware
variants in the earliest moments of their release.

Both of these technologies are now available as a simple connector to hosted and
managed Microsoft Exchange providers` environment. Additionally, these providers
can deploy Commtouch`s GlobalView Mail Reputation for blocking of up to 90% of
unwanted mail at the perimeter of their network. 

"Commtouch continues to invest in helping its partners leverage their existing
messaging products," said Francois Depayras, vice president of sales and
business development, Americas. "We have long supported hosting and service
providers utilizing open source technologies. We now look forward to enabling
our existing and future partners offering hosted and managed Microsoft Exchange
services to benefit from our advanced email defense solutions." 

Commtouch`s cloud-based anti-spam, along with its perimeter filtering
technologies, have been shown to reduce hosting providers` hardware expenses by
up to 85%, user bandwidth costs by as much as 80% and notably decrease help-desk
calls and IT administration time. 

Commtouch`s support of the service provider industry now encompasses a wide
range of technologies: Integration with Parallels Plesk, H-Sphere and cPanel;
plug-ins for common open source email filtering packages such as SpamAssassin; a
connector for Microsoft Exchange; and a Milter for Sendmail and Postfix. 

Members of the Commtouch team will be available to discuss the company`s
messaging security solutions for Microsoft Exchange and open source technologies
at Parallels Summit 2010, Booth #103, from February 22-24, 2010 in Miami, FL.

&lt;p&gt;LAS VEGAS &amp; WESTON, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Thales, leader in information systems and communications security, announces it
is working with IBM to integrate IBM Tivoli Key Lifecycle Manager) into Thales
Encryption Manager for Storage (TEMS 2.0) to provide customers with a hardened
tamper-resistant key management solution that fully exploits IBM Tivoli Key
Lifecycle Management capability. TEMS will be expanded to address the key
management requirements of the IBM storage portfolio of products, to provide
important operational and security benefits to both IBM and Thales customers,
including the convenience and assurance of a hardware appliance and
standards-based key management controls needed to protect and store data and
demonstrate compliance. 

"The use of encryption within the switching fabric, back-up tapes, drives,
arrays, and host adapters is rapidly becoming a popular security measure to help
ensure data privacy and confidentiality, but many organizations are concerned
about resilience and data recoverability issues," says Jon Oltsik, senior
analyst with Enterprise Strategy Group. "These issues can be addressed by the
adoption of best practice key management, which when deployed correctly can
unify security practices and reduce operational burden. The integration of
Thales Encryption Manager for Storage with IBM Tivoli Key Lifecycle Manager will
help customers adopt leading-edge storage encryption with the confidence that
their encryption keys are under control and secured in a cost-effective and
future proof management system." 

TEMS 2.0 is an easily deployed key management solution that consolidates and
automates the management of encryption keys for heterogeneous storage
environments delivering unified, fine-grained and auditable security controls
and therefore greatly simplifies compliance reporting obligations. TEMS is
delivered as a hardened tamper-resistant security appliance providing industry
leading levels of protection* ensuring that keys are safe from attack and
accidental loss and yet available on demand for legitimate data retrieval,
emergency recovery and forensic activities. TEMS is the first key manager to
support the draft IEEE P1619.3 key management standard and now with the
integration of IBM Tivoli Key Lifecycle Manager functionality, customers will be
able to manage keys across an even broader range of encryption-enabled storage
devices and end-points - in particular IBM`s LTO4 tape and DS8000 disk storage
systems. 

"Key management provides a cryptographic layer of security that helps clients
meet the stringent internal and external compliance mandates that require proper
storage and protection of data and information," said Gordon Arnold, security
software architect and product manager, IBM Tivoli software. "The integration of
Thales Encryption Manager with IBM Tivoli Key Lifecycle Manager will provide our
customers with the choice between hardware secured and software key management
to help them centralize and better manage their storage security processes." 

"We are extremely excited about working with IBM to provide a leading-edge
storage encryption key management appliance. We are committed to providing
secure and cost effective key management solutions enabling customers to deploy
encryption throughout the enterprise whether at the network, storage or
application level. For many, performing encryption within the storage
environment is an increasingly attractive proposition but with it come the
challenges of scalability, security and resilience," says Franck Greverie, vice
president, managing director for the information systems security activities of
Thales. "TEMS successfully embodies a wide range of key management best
practices and this new partnership with IBM is further testament to Thales`s
commitment to provide encryption key management support for the broadest range
of storage encryption endpoints in the market." 

Thales will be both speaking and exhibiting at IBM Pulse 2010, the premier
service management event, Las Vegas, Nevada February 21-24, 2010. Visit Thales
on Booth #E122. 

Bob Lockhart, Senior Solutions Architect at Thales will be speaking at the event
about key management standards and the adoption of the recently introduced Key
Management Interoperability Protocol on a panel entitled `KMIP Standard Adoption
- Storage and Beyond`, Monday February 22, 2010.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said on Monday that benchmark oil prices will rise to $85-$95 a barrel this year as global economic growth accelerates, up from the low-$70 to low-$80 range since October last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Positive economic news from the United States and Japan has boosted prices already this year, the U.S.-based investment bank said in a report, and a tighter supply-demand balance will draw OPEC spare capacity back into the market, it added. The United States has reported positive year-on-year growth in industrial production for the first time since the start of the recession, while Japan's economy expanded at a 4.6 annual rate in fourth-quarter 2009, above expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to expect that as the near-term fundamentals of the oil market continue to improve, strengthening timespreads will lift WTI crude oil prices into this $85-$95 per barrel range."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. crude for March delivery rose 23 cents to $80.04 a barrel at 0713 GMT, after hitting a six-week high of $80.51.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Goldman report said refining margins however are likely to remain under pressure because of large increases in Asian capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Further, we expect that simple refining margins relative to WTI prices will come under pressure as OPEC spare capacity enters the market in the second half of 2010 as the resulting downward pressure on heavy crudes should allow complex refiners to increase production at the expense of simple light crude refiners."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Seng Li Peng; Editing by Ramthan Hussain and Ed Lane)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's to-do list in the software development space includes continued or new investments in multiple areas, including cloud computing, the Web, parallel computing, devices, and agile and distributed development, a company executive said in a blog entry on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In setting its investment priorities, Microsoft is being mindful of an increasing number of choices developers have in programming styles, said S. Somasegar, senior vice president of the Microsoft Developer Division, in a blog entitled, "Key Software Development Trends."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Get all the details you need on deploying and using Windows 7 in the InfoWorld editors' 21-page Windows 7 Deep Dive PDF special report. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"More than ever before, today's developers are open to considering and using multiple technologies to enable them to build solutions smoothly and deliver them to their customers quickly," Somasegar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With cloud computing, Microsoft has "committed to bringing the best cloud computing platform and services to the Windows ecosystem," he said. Microsoft's cloud platform, while not specifically named in the blog, is Windows Azure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The cloud is just one example of a virtualized computing platform and the next generation of developer tools must enable developers to build software that deploys and performs well in cloud and other virtual environments," Somasegar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the banner of "The Web as a Platform," Somasegar said the browser provides a rich runtime environment and "friction-free access" to applications. He noted the use of JavaScript libraries to help Web developers get more done with JavaScript and cited Microsoft's Silverlight platform as an example of a technology allowing for "immersive Internet applications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Developers are increasingly choosing the Web as their platform of choice for software and software development.&#160; Increasingly, developers and designers are using tools that offer a rich development, debugging, and profiling experience designed for the Web," said Somasegar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In parallel computing, Somasegar said Moore's Law, in which CPU performance doubles every 18 months, now is being fulfilled by adding more processor cores rather than boosting single-core performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today, a small handful of programmers have the skills to write code that performs well in multi-core and many-core environments," Somasegar said. "In the future, parallel libraries, debugging, profiling, and diagnostic tools will enable more developers to take advantage of parallel computing resources."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior parallel computing efforts at Microsoft have included the company's Concurrency Runtime, offering a scheduling layer to control application resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To accommodate the proliferation of devices, Microsoft is evolving its software to take advantage of new user interface paradigms such as speech-, camera-, and touch-based solutions, said Somasegar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Windows 7 provides great support for touch-enabled applications in the platform. Silverlight and WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) have embraced camera-based interactions and multi-touch, as has MFC (Microsoft Foundation Class Library).&#160; I expect user interface paradigms to continue to evolve and become more intuitive and powerful," Somasegar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the trend toward use of agile development methodologies, which allow for more iterative development, Microsoft will make accommodations for agile in the upcoming Visual Studio 2010 IDE due in April, Somasegar said. The IDE supports agile processes such as unit testing and iteration planning, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Within Microsoft, many teams have integrated elements of agile development practices to their process," Somasegar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the distributed development space, Somasegar said the experience of teams working across time zones and borders should equal the experience of a single developer, but also include cloud-based development activities such as code reviews and remote paired programming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Great distributed team development tools will enable developers to build the next generation of software, leveraging the worldwide talent pool," Somasegar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He asked blog readers to note other important trends for Microsoft to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Microsoft sets app dev investment priorities," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt; * Restructuring news division, eliminating redundancies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Offering voluntary separation packages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; *
 (Byline, analyst, industry background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Sue Zeidler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) said
it was revamping ABC News in a move aimed at reducing more than
20 percent or 300 to 400 jobs, according to a source familiar
with the division's biggest cutback in years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The restructuring at ABC News is the latest to occur among
major broadcast news divisions who have had to face declining
viewership, challenges from the Internet and the recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a memo to staff, ABC News President David Westin said on
Tuesday the operation needed to re-think how it carried out its
role and anticipate change rather than just respond to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said ABC would dramatically expand its use of new
technology, digital journalists and reporters capable of
shooting and editing their own material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Westin said ABC would offer voluntary separation packages
to all full-time, U.S.-based, non-union, non-contract
employees, Westin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The response to the voluntary program will determine the
extent to which ABC will need to make further cuts, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source, who was not authorized to speak officially
about any of ABC's actions, said ABC News hoped to reduce staff
by 300 to 400 people. ABC News employs about 1,500 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When we are finished, many job descriptions will be
different, different skill sets may be required, and, yes, we
will likely have substantially fewer people on staff at ABC
News," Westin said in the memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Westin also said ABC will combine its weekday and weekend
operations for both Good Morning America and World News and
eliminate redundancies wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is all about the transition from television to
digital," said Dave Smith, chief executive officer of
SmithGeiger, a television research and strategy firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While ABC is competitively in good shape, all ratings for
national news on broadcast continue to see a slippage of their
audience particularly in the key 18-49 year old and the 25-54
year old demographic groups," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When asked in late November at Reuters Media Summit,
whether ABC's news budgets would keep shrinking, ABC chief Anne
Sweeney said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The budgets are going to keep changing. You can no more
predict when the next great national emergency is going to
happen, and you're going to have to deploy those resources
because people are counting on you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CBS Corp (CBS.N) and General Electric's (GE.N) NBC have
both cut news divisions as weak demand for advertising impacted
operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ABC's parent Disney has also been aggressively
restructuring its other divisions. Rich Ross, the new chairman
of the company's film studio is leading the charge on
reformatting the studio to address changes in the delivery of
content in the digital era, while a year ago the company
announced a broad restructuring of its parks and resorts
operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Bernard Orr)

&lt;p&gt;BOGOTA (Reuters) - Peru could overtake Colombia as the world's biggest cocaine producer if its eradication policies keep lagging, a U.N. body said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The International Narcotics Control Board said in its annual report that coca bush cultivation in South America decreased in 2008 to 167,600 hectares, an 8 percent drop from the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of that total, Colombia's cultivation area accounted for 48.3 percent, followed by Peru with 33.5 percent. But Colombia's area was declining, while Peru's was growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the republic of Peru does not take more aggressive methods to destroy and control coca-growing, it could be the biggest cocaine producer among the Andean nations in the next five to ten years," board member Camilo Uribe said at a presentation of the report in Bogota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the U.N. body, Colombia produced 430 tons of cocaine in 2008, while Peru produced 302 tons. Bolivia is the third biggest cocaine producer in South America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Nelson Bocanegra; Writing by Andrew Cawthorne, Editing by Stacey Joyce)&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Schlumberger Acquires Smith Int`l

Oilfield services giant Schlumberger Ltd. (NYSE: SLB) has acquired lesser rival
Smith International Inc. (NYSE: SII) for approximately $11 billion in an
all-stock deal, which is the biggest acquisition in the United States so far
this year. 

The Wall Street Journal had reported on Friday that Schlumberger was in advanced
talks to buy Smith. Following this news, Smith`s shares jumped 13% but
Schlumberger`s shares fell 2.9%. 

As the economy has shown signs of recovery and oil prices have seen an uptrend,
industry giants want to acquire smaller rivals to increase their business. While
the Schlumberger&#8722;Smith deal is in the oilfield space, last December`s ExxonMobil
(NYSE: XOM)-XTO deal was in the integrated space. 

We view the transaction a win-win for the shareholders of both companies, as
they would get a more diversified oilfield services exposure. Given that both
companies cover the same geographical regions, Smith is a good strategic fit for
Schlumberger. 

Following the completion of this transaction, Schlumberger will rule the
oilfield services industry with the merged company`s revenue (nearly $30.9
billion in 2009, comprising Schlumberger`s $22.7 billion and Smith`s $8.2
billion) will be more than double that of its nearest rival Halliburton
Company`s (NYSE: HAL) $14.7 billion. 

With an increasing global energy demand, producers need to have drilling
equipment and advanced technology to cope with drilling in increasingly
difficult environments. In addition to Schlumberger`s product lines, customers
of the merged company will be able to drill more economically in a challenging
environment through Smith`s drilling fluids, drill bits and accelerated
technology development. 

First Solar Tops, Reaffirms View

First Solar Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) surpassed the Zacks Consensus earnings per share
(EPS) estimate of $1.49 by 16 cents to reach $1.65 in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2009. It also beat the year-ago quarterly EPS figure of $1.61 by 4 cents.


The upbeat trend was reflected in fiscal 2009 results as well, where an EPS of
$7.53 exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.34 and almost doubled,
compared to the fiscal 2008 EPS of $4.24. 

Out of the 31 analysts covering the stock, 5 and 2 have revised their estimates
downward for fiscal 2010 in the last 30 and 7 days, respectively. The fiscal
2010 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate is presently at $6.45. This is in line with
the company`s EPS projection of $6.05 to $6.85. 

The company has provided positive surprises over the last 4 quarters. First
Solar has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22.4% on average over that time

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

2010 Bank Failures Grow to 20

Though the economy is showing signs of a gradual recovery, bank failures
continue as U.S. regulators on Friday closed down four more banks in California,
Illinois, Texas and Florida. This brings the total number of bank failures to 20
so far in 2010, compared to 140 in 2009, 25 in 2008 and 3 in 2007. 

While we expect economic recovery to gain momentum soon, there remain lingering
concerns in the banking industry. Failure of both residential and commercial
real estate loans as a result of the credit crisis was the primary reason that
wounded banks. As the industry tolerates bad loans made during the credit
explosion, the trouble in the banking system goes even deeper, increasing the
possibility of more bank failures. 

The failed banks were - La Jolla, California-based La Jolla Bank, FSB with
assets of $3.6 billion and deposits of $2.8 billion, Oak Park, Illinois-based
George Washington Savings Bank with assets of $412.8 million and deposits of
$397 million, La Coste, Texas-based La Coste National Bank with assets of $53.9
million and deposits of $49.3 million and Marco Island, Florida-based Marco
Community Bank with assets of $119.6 million and deposits of $117.1 million. 

These bank failures will deal another blow to the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation`s (FDIC) fund meant for protecting customer accounts, as it has been
appointed receiver for these banks. The FDIC insures deposits at 8,195
institutions with roughly $13.5 trillion in assets. When a bank fails, it
reimburses customers for their deposits of up to $250,000 per account. The
outbreak of bank failures has significantly stretched the regulator`s deposit
insurance fund. However, the FDIC has about $21 billion in cash available in
reserve to cover losses of bank failures. Also, the FDIC has access to the
Treasury Department`s credit line of up to $500 billion. 

The failure of La Jolla Bank, FSB is expected to cost the deposit insurance fund
about $882.3 million, George Washington Savings Bank is expected to cost about
$141.4 million, La Coste National Bank is expected to cost about $3.7 million
and Marco Community Bank is estimated to cost about $38.1 million. 

Pasadena, California-based OneWest Bank, FSB assumed all of the deposits of La
Jolla Bank and agreed to purchase almost all of its assets. FirstMerit Bank,
National Association of Akron, Ohio, assumed almost all of George Washington
Savings Bank's assets and deposits. Hondo, Texas-based Community National Bank
agreed to buy the deposits and assets of La Coste National Bank. FDIC has
entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with Mutual of Omaha Bank for
Marco Community Bank. 

Increasing loan losses on commercial real estate are expected to cause hundreds
more bank failures in the next few years. The FDIC anticipates bank failures to
cost about $100 billion over the next three years. 

The failure of Washington Mutual in 2008 was the largest in U.S. banking
history. It was acquired by JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM). The other major
acquirers of failed institutions since 2008 include Fifth Third Bancorp (Nasdaq:
FITB), U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB), Zions Bancorp (Nasdaq: ZION) and Regions
Financial (NYSE: RF).

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co said on Tuesday it was restructuring its ABC News division to eliminate redundancies, and a source familiar with the situation said it was seeking to cut 300 to 400 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a memo to staff, David Westin, president of ABC News, said the operation needed to re-think how it carried out its role and anticipate change rather than just respond to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we are finished, many job descriptions will be different, different skill sets may be required, and, yes, we will likely have substantially fewer people on staff at ABC News," Westin said in the memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that to ease the transition, ABC was offering voluntary separation packages to all full-time, U.S.-based, non-union, non-contract employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman said the division employs about 1,500 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Qatar Petroleum et Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE : XOM) ont annonc&#233; aujourd`hui
que le projet Al Khaleej Gas-Phase 2 (AKG-2), d`une capacit&#233; commercialisable de
gaz de 1 250 millions de m&#232;tres cubes par jour (mmcj), a &#233;t&#233; mis en service en
d&#233;cembre 2009. 

Les nouvelles installations sont con&#231;ues pour r&#233;pondre &#224; la demande croissante

&lt;p&gt;Financial close process standardized, improving productivity and creating
enterprise-wide accounting uniformity
BOSTON--(Business Wire)--
Nucleus Research analysts examined the deployment of IBM Cognos TM1 at Huntsman
Corporation, which generated a return on investment (ROI) of 1,060% with a
payback in five weeks. 

Huntsman Corporation manufactures products for a variety of global industries,
including chemicals, plastics, automotive, aviation, textiles, footwear, paints
and coatings, construction, technology, agriculture, health care, detergent,
personal care, furniture, appliances and packaging. Operating in five segments,
the publicly held company employing approximately 12,000 people identified an
opportunity to achieve cost reductions while upgrading its systems for
compliance with Sarbanes Oxley. 

Administrators at Huntsman initially relied on three different deployments for
closing monthly, quarterly and annual statements, each requiring different
systems for multiple ERP solutions. Analytical tools available from non-IBM
reporting vendors were not flexible enough to provide the granularity of
financial analysis required. A systems review found the fully automated IBM
Cognos TM1, already in use in an existing deployment, was the most functional
solution and was implemented enterprise-wide across all accounting workflows. 

In using pre-existing accounting software, the full deployment of IBM Cognos TM1
increased reporting visibility and did not require additional accounting staff
to achieve Sarbanes Oxley compliance. Audit fees were greatly reduced because
all data resided in one deployment and audit reporting became far more rapid.
Accountant efficiencies have improved enterprise-wide, eliminating manual
workflows, reconciliations and rework during the financial close process and
increasing productivity by 50%. 

"The Huntsman deployment had a high ROI because it created enterprise-wide
uniformity in the financial close. This meant that Sarbanes-Oxley compliance was
achieved without adding headcount, accountants became more productive and the
annual audit resulted in far fewer billable hours," said David O`Connell, senior
analyst, Nucleus Research. 

All Nucleus Research ROI case studies are independent assessments, evaluating
the costs and benefits from the IT deployment. The case study is available at
www.NucleusResearch.com.

&lt;p&gt;Publicly Available Genomic Database of Profiled Tumor Samples to Provide a
Resource for Biomedical Researchers Worldwide
INDIANAPOLIS, WHITEHOUSE STATION, N.J. &amp; NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Eli Lilly and Company, Merck (also known as Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme (MSD) outside
the USA and Canada), and Pfizer Inc. today announced the formation of the Asian
Cancer Research Group, Inc., (ACRG), an independent, not-for-profit company
established to accelerate research and ultimately improve treatment for patients
affected with the most commonly-diagnosed cancers in Asia. 

The ACRG`s formation represents a prime example of a growing trend in
pre-competitive collaboration in which large pharmaceutical companies combine
their resources and expertise to rapidly increase knowledge of disease and
disease processes. The goal of the ACRG is to improve the knowledge of cancers
prevalent in Asia and to accelerate drug discovery efforts by freely sharing the
resulting data with the scientific community. 

"Through its work and the subsequent sharing of information, the ACRG hopes to
empower researchers, foster innovation and improve the prognosis and treatment
of patients with cancer," said Gary Gilliland, M.D., Ph.D., senior vice
president and franchise head, Oncology, Merck Research Laboratories. 

Initially, the ACRG will focus on lung and gastric cancers, two of the most
common forms of cancer in Asia. As many as 40 percent of patients with lung
cancer in Asia demonstrate a mutation that is relatively rare in Western
patients (EGFR mutation).1 This mutation has resulted in differences in response
to some types of agents, suggesting that a different research approach is needed
for developing treatments for certain patient populations. 

Gastric cancer has reached near epidemic proportions in some countries in Asia.
Despite its relatively low incidence in the West, gastric cancer is the second
largest cause of cancer death in the world, killing more than 630,000 patients
per year, more people than all cancers combined in the United States.2

"Environmental and genetic factors are believed to underlie the dramatic
differences in the molecular subtypes and incidence of cancers in Asia and other
parts of the world," said Neil Gibson, Ph.D., chief scientific officer of
Pfizer`s Oncology Research Unit. "Although some progress has been achieved in
the last few years in understanding and treating these cancers, they remain a
huge unmet need and a disproportionate health burden to Asian patients." 

Over the next two years, Lilly, Merck and Pfizer have committed to create one of
the most extensive pharmacogenomic cancer databases known to date. This database
will be composed of data from approximately 2,000 tissue samples from patients
with lung and gastric cancer that will be made publicly available to researchers
and, over time, further populated with clinical data from a longitudinal
analysis of patients. Comparison of the contrasting genomic signatures of these
cancers could inform new approaches to treatment. 

Today`s announcement marks the formation of the ACRG. The company is currently
focused on establishing collaborative relationships throughout Asia to collect
the tissue samples and data. All tissue samples and data will be collected and
shared in accordance with good medical practices and local laws. 

Lilly has assumed responsibility for ultimately providing the data to the
research public through an open-source concept managed by Lilly`s Singapore
research site. Moreover, Lilly, Merck and Pfizer will each provide technical and
intellectual expertise. 

"The ACRG is about sharing information for the common good," said Kerry
Blanchard, M.D., Ph.D., vice president and leader of drug development in China
for Lilly and who represented Lilly in the ACRG`s formation. "This company will
aid researchers around the world to develop diagnostics, tailor current
treatments and develop novel therapies to improve outcomes for affected patients
with lung, gastric and perhaps other forms of cancer."

&lt;p&gt;IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Qatar Petroleum and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) today announced the Al
Khaleej Gas-Phase 2 (AKG-2) project, with 1,250 million cubic feet per day
(mcfd) of sales gas capacity, initiated operations in December 2009. 

The new facilities are designed to meet the growing demand of local industries.
Combined with Al Khaleej Gas-Phase 1 (AKG-1), which began production in 2005,
AKG will have a total capacity of 2,000 mcfd, making it the largest source of
domestic gas supply in the State of Qatar. 

The AKG-2 project involved construction of onshore gas treating, liquids
recovery and fractionation facilities and two additional offshore wellhead
platforms. ExxonMobil utilized state-of-the-art technologies, including its
proprietary Fast Drill and well completion technologies, to reduce drilling time
and optimize the costs of the new North Field wells. The onshore facilities are
integrated with the Ras Laffan Liquefied Natural Gas Company Limited (3)
facilities in Ras Laffan Industrial City. Initial production occurred in
December 2009. 

His Excellency Abdulla Bin Hamad Al-Attyiah, Deputy Premier Minister of Energy
and Industry, Chairman and Managing Director of Qatar Petroleum, said, "We
consider the AKG project as one of the strategic development projects of the
North Field as it supplies gas to various power and desalination plants, as well
as petrochemical and other energy intensive industries in Qatar. This project is
another example of our long-term relationship with ExxonMobil that is based upon
mutual benefits." 

"Working in partnership, Qatar Petroleum and ExxonMobil are successfully
commercializing the world`s largest non-associated natural gas field," said Neil
Duffin, president of ExxonMobil Development Company. "This is another major
achievement to ensure the optimal use of Qatar`s hydrocarbon resources to meet
increasing local demand and contribute to further development of Qatar`s
industrial base. This project is helping to support the country`s rapid economic
expansion." 

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT: Estimates, expectations, and business plans in this
release are forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including
production rates and sales volumes, cost efficiencies, project plans, schedules,
and costs, and commercial arrangements could differ materially due to changes in
long-term oil and gas price levels or other market conditions affecting the oil
and gas industry; political or regulatory developments; reservoir performance;
timely completion of development projects; technical or operating factors; the
outcome of commercial negotiations; and other factors discussed under the
heading "Factors Affecting Future Results" included in Item 1A of ExxonMobil's
most recent Form 10-K and posted on our website (www.exxonmobil.com). References
in this release to quantities of gas include amounts that may not yet be
classified as proved reserves but that we believe will ultimately be produced.

&lt;p&gt;Enhanced Mailbox and Recovery Management Tool Offers Unique Migration Path and
Complete Support for Primary, Archive and Recoverable E-mail, Allowing Companies
to More Efficiently Manage Relevant Data for Legal and Compliance Purposes and
Business Continuity
MINNEAPOLIS--(Business Wire)--
Kroll Ontrack, the leading provider of information management and legal
technologies products and services, today announced the availability of Ontrack
PowerControls version 6.0. Providing complete support for Microsoft Exchange
Server 2010, the enhanced tool offers primary mailbox, Personal Archive and

reduce the time and resources required to search, identify, copy, restore and
export data from the increasingly robust messaging platform. 

In addition to compatibility with the most current version of Exchange Server,
Ontrack PowerControls 6.0 specifically:

* Supports the Exchange Personal Archive mailbox feature. Associated with a
user`s primary mailbox, the Personal Archive provides users with direct access
to e-mail within the archive, just as they would their primary mailboxes. With
Ontrack PowerControls 6.0, IT administrators can search, restore, export and
report all mailbox data, including archived items, in one centralized tool. This

restoring single mailboxes, identifying potentially relevant data for legal
discovery or compliance, and exporting data for further investigation or
business continuity purposes. 
* Supports the Exchange Recoverable Items feature. Exchange 2010 is equipped
with retention management policies, which allows IT to retain and place a hold
on e-mail that a user has edited or deleted. Supporting Recoverable Items
ensures comprehensive management of all e-mail associated with Exchange
including Recoverable Items, in addition to primary mailboxes and Personal
Archives.

administrators, Ontrack PowerControls 6.0 ensures that IT`s Exchange 2010
migration requirements are met," said Jim Reinert, vice president of product
development, Kroll Ontrack. "Furthermore, using Ontrack PowerControls 6.0 to

a unique migration path that does not require an old server to be online
simultaneously with the new server. This eliminates the work required to prepare
an old server or capably coexist with Exchange 2010." 

With a unique migration path to Exchange 2010 and complete support for all
primary, Archive and Recoverable e-mail associated with a user, Ontrack

&lt;p&gt;  SANTA CLARA, CA, Feb 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
BLADE Network Technologies, Inc. (BLADE), the trusted leader in data
center networking, announced today the delivery of the industry's first
and only fully integrated Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) solution
inside a blade chassis. This integration significantly reduces power,
cost, space and complexity over external FCoE implementations.

    This single-chassis FCoE solution is based on IBM BladeCenter H equipped
with BLADE's BNT Virtual Fabric 10G Switch Module and QLogic Virtual
Fabric Extension Module and Converged Network Adapters. BLADE's
FCoE-ready switch is a key element of BLADE's Unified
FabricArchitecture(TM) (UFA), which provides a faster, virtual machine
aware, and proven data center networking platform that allows customers
to tie together best-of-breed servers, storage, hypervisors and core
networking systems. BLADE's Unified FabricArchitecture and Rackonomics
approach ensure that customers that have already invested millions of
dollars in their data centers can take advantage of the best innovations
in the industry and achieve the lowest possible cost of ownership for
their IT infrastructure.

    "The IBM BladeCenter is the only 100-percent internal FCoE solution
currently available," said Bob Laliberte, senior analyst, Enterprise
Strategy Group. "Leveraging QLogic CNAs and FCoE technology with BLADE
Network Technologies' Ethernet switch modules, IBM is able to deliver an
internal FCoE switch solution for IBM BladeCenter. BLADE's BNT switch
acts as the Ethernet LAN portion of the solution, and the QLogic Virtual
Fabric Extension Module acts as the Fibre Channel Forwarder (FCF) with
the FCoE capabilities. The result is less rack space consumed and a more
attractive entry point."

    The new solution converts CEE (Converged Enhanced Ethernet) packets to
native Fibre Channel, so IBM BladeCenter customers can directly attach to
their existing storage targets without any impact to their SAN
infrastructure. By comparison, this integrated FCoE solution is 3x less
expensive, 2x more energy efficient and requires no cabling between the
switch and the gateway compared with external top-of-rack gateway designs.

    "Our integrated FCoE solution enables enterprises to take an open
approach to unifying their data and storage networks without requiring
them to overhaul their existing SAN infrastructures," said Tim
Shaughnessy, vice president of Marketing, BLADE Network Technologies. "As
one of the industry's top providers of 10 Gigabit Ethernet switches,
BLADE Network Technologies has provided the essential datacenter
networking for more than three million IBM servers to date. Now, our 10
Gigabit Ethernet switch for IBM BladeCenter enables enterprises to deploy
converged data and storage networks while reducing networking costs by up
to 50 percent, cabling costs by up to 90 percent and energy costs by up
to 50 percent." 

    The lossless, low-latency, low-power and low-cost BLADE switch performs
at 10G line-rate throughput with no packet loss as required by Fibre FCoE
and the CEE standards for open unified networking. This switch for IBM
BladeCenter consumes less power than a standard light bulb -- up to 75
percent less than external switches -- and supports BLADE's VMready(TM)
software for Virtual Machine-aware networking.

    BLADE's BNT Virtual Fabric 10G Switch Module can also be combined with
Emulex's Virtual Fabric Adapter CFFh based on its OneConnect UCNA
architecture for IBM BladeCenter HS22 blade servers to provide an
end-to-end converged networking solution. This IBM BladeCenter Virtual
Fabric solution provides the flexibility of 100Mb-to-10Gb Ethernet
connectivity, virtual port switching and converged networking with iSCSI
or FCoE. 

Availability
 BLADE's BNT Virtual Fabric 10G Switch is
available now from IBM (Part number: 46C7191) for IBM BladeCenter H/HT.

&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com has agreed to pay Microsoft an undisclosed sum as part of a patent cross-licensing deal between the companies announced on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement gives each company access to the other's patent portfolio and covers a wide range of products and technologies, Microsoft said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among them, the agreement will shield Amazon from patent litigation against its Kindle e-reader, which includes some open-source software components, and against its use of Linux-based servers, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has asserted in the past that Linux and other open-source software may violate hundreds of its technology patents. The assertion angered open-source advocates, in part because Microsoft did not disclose the patents it said were being infringed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Microsoft has signed patent deals with several vendors that include coverage for their use of Linux and open source, including Novell, LG Electronics and Fuji Xerox. The deals are part of a broader IP licensing program that Microsoft kicked off in 2002. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early last year Microsoft sued TomTom, a maker of in-car navigation systems, for allegedly violating eight of its patents, including three related to TomTom's implementation of Linux. TomTom paid to settle the suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday's statement doesn't refer to any specific Microsoft products covered by the Amazon agreement. Terms of the deal are confidential, Microsoft said, and a company spokesman declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said its licensing program is designed to give other companies access to its research and development efforts and its growing portfolio of patents. It has entered into more than 600 licensing deals since 2002, it said.&lt;/p&gt;

Publicly Available Genomic Database of Profiled Tumor Samples to Provide a
Resource for Biomedical Researchers Worldwide
INDIANAPOLIS, WHITEHOUSE STATION, N.J. &amp; NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Eli Lilly and Company, Merck (also known as Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme (MSD) outside
the USA and Canada), and Pfizer Inc. today announced the formation of the Asian
Cancer Research Group, Inc., (ACRG), an independent, not-for-profit company
established to accelerate research and ultimately improve treatment for patients
affected with the most commonly-diagnosed cancers in Asia. 

The ACRG`s formation represents a prime example of a growing trend in
pre-competitive collaboration in which large pharmaceutical companies combine
their resources and expertise to rapidly increase knowledge of disease and
disease processes. The goal of the ACRG is to improve the knowledge of cancers
prevalent in Asia and to accelerate drug discovery efforts by freely sharing the
resulting data with the scientific community. 

"Through its work and the subsequent sharing of information, the ACRG hopes to
empower researchers, foster innovation and improve the prognosis and treatment
of patients with cancer," said Gary Gilliland, M.D., Ph.D., senior vice
president and franchise head, Oncology, Merck Research Laboratories. 

Initially, the ACRG will focus on lung and gastric cancers, two of the most
common forms of cancer in Asia. As many as 40 percent of patients with lung
cancer in Asia demonstrate a mutation that is relatively rare in Western
patients (EGFR mutation).1 This mutation has resulted in differences in response
to some types of agents, suggesting that a different research approach is needed
for developing treatments for certain patient populations. 

Gastric cancer has reached near epidemic proportions in some countries in Asia.
Despite its relatively low incidence in the West, gastric cancer is the second
largest cause of cancer death in the world, killing more than 630,000 patients
per year, more people than all cancers combined in the United States.2

"Environmental and genetic factors are believed to underlie the dramatic
differences in the molecular subtypes and incidence of cancers in Asia and other
parts of the world," said Neil Gibson, Ph.D., chief scientific officer of
Pfizer`s Oncology Research Unit. "Although some progress has been achieved in
the last few years in understanding and treating these cancers, they remain a
huge unmet need and a disproportionate health burden to Asian patients." 

Over the next two years, Lilly, Merck and Pfizer have committed to create one of
the most extensive pharmacogenomic cancer databases known to date. This database
will be composed of data from approximately 2,000 tissue samples from patients
with lung and gastric cancer that will be made publicly available to researchers
and, over time, further populated with clinical data from a longitudinal
analysis of patients. Comparison of the contrasting genomic signatures of these
cancers could inform new approaches to treatment. 

Today`s announcement marks the formation of the ACRG. The company is currently
focused on establishing collaborative relationships throughout Asia to collect
the tissue samples and data. All tissue samples and data will be collected and
shared in accordance with good medical practices and local laws. 

Lilly has assumed responsibility for ultimately providing the data to the
research public through an open-source concept managed by Lilly`s Singapore
research site. Moreover, Lilly, Merck and Pfizer will each provide technical and
intellectual expertise. 

"The ACRG is about sharing information for the common good," said Kerry
Blanchard, M.D., Ph.D., vice president and leader of drug development in China
for Lilly and who represented Lilly in the ACRG`s formation. "This company will
aid researchers around the world to develop diagnostics, tailor current
treatments and develop novel therapies to improve outcomes for affected patients
with lung, gastric and perhaps other forms of cancer."

They will also be able to share documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has lined up partnerships with a number of thin-client device makers that could provide the workstations for these setups, including DisplayLink, Hewlett-Packard, NComputing and Wyse Technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of educational software vendors have also promised to craft versions of their products for MultiPoint, including AB Consulting, LanSchool Technologies and NetSupport Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Coca-Cola Co close to buying NA bottling ops-source&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Equity, debt of deal would total about $15 bln-source
 (Adds analyst's comments, details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jessica Hall and Martinne Geller&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PHILADELPHIA/NEW YORK, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co
(KO.N) is in talks to buy most of its largest bottler for
roughly $15 billion, including debt, marking a shift in its
strategy to keep its bottling operations separate, a person
familiar with the situation said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the deal goes through, Coke would buy Coca-Cola
Enterprises Inc's (CCE.N) North American operations.
Meanwhile, the rest of the bottling company would remain
independent and would acquire some Coca-Cola assets in
Scandinavia and Germany, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The North American operations represent the bulk of
Coca-Cola Enterprises's business, accounting for 70 percent of
its net operating revenue in 2009, according to a report by The
Wall Street Journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal could be announced as early as this week since the
boards of both companies were evaluating the transaction on
Wednesday night, the source said. Talks could still break down
and a deal could fail to materialize, said the source. The
source, who was not authorized to speak with the media,
declined to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola Enterprises could not be reached
immediately for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Such a deal would represent an about-face for Coca-Cola,
which pioneered the model of separating the bottlers from the
concentrate company decades ago. It also would follow a similar
deal by rival PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N), which is aiming to close on
the $7.8 billion acquisition of its two largest bottlers this
week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since PepsiCo first launched its bid for its bottlers in
April, with the aim of streamlining its decision-making,
cutting costs and reducing tension between it and the bottlers,
analysts and investors have questioned whether Coke would have
to follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tom Pirko, founding partner of beverage industry
consultants Bevmark LLC, who has advised Coca-Cola in the past,
described the possible move by Coke as something the company
has to do because of the evolving nature of the U.S. soft drink
market and the move by PepsiCo, rather than something it wants
to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a tit-for-tat business. They're responding," Pirko
said. "This is something that they've been publicly committed
to not doing. It's something they're getting pulled into."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke Chief Executive Muhtar Kent has repeatedly expressed
his commitment to the current franchise system, where it sells
beverage concentrate to a network of independent bottlers that
mix the drink, bottle it, and distribute it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Pirko said the North American soft drink business
now has so many small, niche beverages with different
distribution needs that it is difficult for the concentrate
company to maintain control as it did when the industry was
more focused on a few giant carbonated soft drink brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The one thing you gain by reeling them in is that you are
in command ... if there's any reason for doing this, it's the
unspooling of the business. It's all these new products that
are driving them crazy," Pirko said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke is both the largest supplier and the largest
shareholder of Coca-Cola Enterprises with a roughly 35 percent
stake.

&lt;p&gt;The story "Microsoft rolls out cloud for U.S. federal users" that ran on Tuesday, incorrectly described the availability of dedicated data connections to Microsoft data centers. The eighth through tenth paragraphs have been updated on the wire and the corrected paragraphs follow: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judging from the questions from the audience at the event, federal agencies may be interested in the concept but worry about a couple of potential issues including connectivity and security. "The more that's in the cloud, the more bandwidth you need," one conference attendee said during a question-and-answer period, complaining about connections from commercial Internet providers. "What's the strategy for helping us get to the cloud reliably?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most customers that would use the federal service are likely to use dedicated network connections to Microsoft's data centers, Markezich said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But dedicated lines come with additional costs that often-strapped government agencies likely don't have. Other attendees asked if government programs like E-rate, which helps connect schools and libraries to the Internet, or Internet 2, a consortium of universities that works with the government to build networks, might help fund such dedicated connections. Microsoft said it has begun investigating whether that might be a possibility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Prevnar 13 was key product acquired from Wyeth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Vaccine advisers recommend new shot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Pfizer shares gain 0.8 percent
 (Recasts; Adds details on price, analyst comment, closing
share price)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Lisa Richwine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WASHINGTON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) new
version of a blockbuster vaccine that fights pneumonia,
meningitis and other infections won approval from U.S. health
officials on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Government vaccine advisers recommended the new Prevnar 13
shot for infants who have not been immunized with the original.
They also urged one dose for children up to age 5 who already
received all four doses of the earlier vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prevnar 13 was the most important experimental product
Pfizer acquired in last year's purchase of Wyeth. It fights 13
strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria, or pneumococcus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The original Prevnar, which targeted seven strains, was
introduced in 2000 and has annual sales around $3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Infections caused by pneumococcus greatly declined after
the original Prevnar was launched. At the time, the seven
targeted strains accounted for 80 percent of invasive
pneumococcal infections in young children in North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By 2007, cases had dropped 99 percent in children younger
than 5 years old, according to the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Studies also showed disease rates fell in unvaccinated
people, especially the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Although the rates of invasive pneumococcal disease have
declined dramatically, there are still children in the United
States who are suffering with this serious illness," Dr. Karen
Midthun, acting head of the FDA's unit that reviewed Prevnar
13, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new version "will help prevent pneumococcal disease
caused by" the six additional strains, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer has estimated that the added protection could reduce
deaths from pneumococcus by an extra 9,800 over 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new vaccine targets a strain called 19A that has
emerged as the most common cause of pneumococcal infection in
the United States. That strain is becoming harder to treat as
it develops resistance to antibiotics, said Dr. Emilio Emini,
Pfizer's chief scientific officer for vaccine research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deutsche Bank analyst Barbara Ryan said approval of Prevnar
13 "was expected, and is an incremental opportunity for the
current $3 billion Prevnar franchise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She said sales of the vaccine could grow to $4.5 billion a
year if Prevnar 13 is approved for adults. Pfizer hopes to
apply for approval for adult use by year's end, Emini said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pneumonia caused by the pneumococcal organism is one of the
biggest causes of death in older people and its incidence
begins to increase after age 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FDA approved the four-dose Prevnar 13 for infants and
children ages 6 weeks through 5 years for preventing invasive
diseases caused by the 13 strains. It also approved the vaccine
for preventing ear infections caused by the original seven
strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In studies in children, potential side effects were similar
in Prevnar 13 and the original shot and included tenderness at
the injection site and irritability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer will charge private providers $108 for Prevnar 13,
company spokeswoman Kristen Neese said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez said the pricing was
higher than he had expected and reiterated his "outperform"
rating on Pfizer shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L) has a rival vaccine called
Synflorix that is active against 10 strains. Synflorix is
approved in Europe and some other markets, but not in the
United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merck (MRK.N) also sells the Pneumovax 23 vaccine, which
fights 23 types of pneumococcus and is the only vaccine of its
type that is FDA-approved for adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's shares rose 0.8 percent to close at $17.81 on the
New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Players will uncover clues to deduce the identity of the culprit in the family
friendly whodunit video game exclusively for Wii


BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
There`s been a crime&#8230; can you follow the clues to find the Guilty Party? Disney
Interactive Studios today announced Disney Guilty Party, a family-friendly
mystery party game being developed exclusively for the Wii console. Created by
Wideload Games, Disney Interactive Studios` Chicago development studio, Guilty
Party is scheduled for release in the second half of 2010. 

Guilty Party tells the thrilling tale of the Dickens Detective Agency as they
solve crimes set in motion by the master criminal known as Mr. Valentine. Up to
four players can solve crimes in a variety of locations all over the world to
unlock the secrets of Mr. Valentine`s grand scheme. 

Guilty Party offers both cooperative and competitive gameplay for all ages.
Players choose a detective and take turns exploring the environment to uncover
clues to discover the culprit`s identity. When players have enough evidence,
they can accuse their prime suspect and try to solve the case. 

"Mysteries are one of the world's most beloved forms of storytelling, and Guilty
Party brings mysteries to Wii in a way that the whole family can play together,"
said Tom Kang, studio head and general manager, Wideload Games. "Everyone loves
a good mystery, especially when they get to be the detective." 

Players step into the shoes of the Dickens family and work together to explore
crime scenes and play mini-games to collect clues and interrogate suspects.
Guilty Party transforms the Wii Remote into classic detective tools: a
magnifying glass, a flashlight, a lock-pick, a fingerprint kit, and more.
Players then discuss and piece together the clues in their detective notebooks
to deduce the identity of the culprit. 

The Dickens family tracks Mr. Valentine across the globe, from a high-speed
train to a leaky aquarium to many other locations to solve new mysteries. Once
the mysteries are solved, players can play again with a new set of clues,
suspects and mini-games with a different experience every time. It takes more
than quick reflexes to win, it also takes quick wits. 

"We`re packing an amazing amount of play-time into a single game," said Patrick
Curry, game director, Wideload Games. "Guilty Party is a bit like a board game,
since families can play each mystery over and over again and never have the same
experience twice." 

Guilty Party is the first new franchise developed by Wideload Games for Disney
Interactive Studios. The game`s characters and locations are inspired by classic
detective lore, with the storytelling, unique humor and art style that have
distinguished Wideload Games. Guilty Party will have players applying logic to
solve the mysteries while laughing at the wacky cast of characters, situations
and animated scenes. 

"Wideload Games is a leader in unique creative games that keep players
entertained and amused for hours," said Craig Relyea, senior vice president of
global marketing, Disney Interactive Studios. "Guilty Party was a natural fit
for Disney and the beneficial working relationship led to the highly creative
studio joining our portfolio of talented studios." 

In September 2009, Disney Interactive Studios acquired Wideload Games and studio
founder Alexander Seropian took on the role of vice president of creative at
Disney Interactive Studios in Glendale, Calif. 

Disney Guilty Party is Rating Pending by the Entertainment Software Rating Board
(ESRB).

&lt;p&gt;Recommendations Include Primary Dosing Series and a Supplemental Dose for
Children Fully Immunized with Prevnar
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) announced today that the United States Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention's (CDC`s) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
(ACIP) has recommended the use of Prevnar 13 (Pneumococcal 13-valent Conjugate
Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197 Protein]) for healthy children aged 2 months through
59 months for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by the 13
pneumococcal serotypes included in the vaccine. 

The ACIP's recommendations include the routine use of Prevnar 13 for infants and
toddlers, as well as a supplemental dose for children through 59 months of age
who have completed the 4-dose immunization series with Prevnar&#174; (Pneumococcal
7-valent Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197 Protein]). In addition, the ACIP
recommended that children who have started their immunization series with
Prevnar should complete the series by switching to Prevnar 13 at any point in
the schedule. 

Prevnar 13 includes the seven serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) in
Prevnar - available in the United States since 2000 - plus six additional
serotypes (1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A). Together, these 13 serotypes are
responsible for the majority of remaining invasive pneumococcal disease in
infants and young children in the United States. In particular, serotype 19A is
now the most common cause of invasive pneumococcal disease among children
younger than 5 years of age in the United States. 

"We are pleased that the Advisory Committee has recommended the use of Prevnar
13, with coverage for 13 important invasive disease-causing serotypes, in
infants and young children in the United States," says Emilio Emini, Ph.D.,
chief scientific officer, Vaccine Research, Pfizer Inc. "The incidence of
disease caused by serotypes not included in Prevnar has been increasing in
children younger than 5 years of age in the United States, including 19A , the
most common serotype." 

The ACIP`s recommendations for Prevnar 13 vaccination of healthy unimmunized
children 2 months through 59 months of age are identical to those previously
recommended by ACIP for Prevnar, with Prevnar 13 replacing Prevnar for all
doses. 

Highlights of the ACIP recommendations included the following:

* Prevnar 13 is administered as a 4-dose series at 2, 4, 6 and 12 through 15
months of age. 
* Children who have begun their vaccination series with Prevnar should complete
the series by switching to Prevnar 13 at any point in the schedule. 
* A single supplemental dose of Prevnar 13 is recommended for children through
59 months of age who have completed the 4-dose immunization series with
Prevnar.

Earlier today, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved
Prevnar 13 for active immunization of children 6 weeks through 5 years of age
for the prevention of invasive disease caused by 13 Streptococcus pneumoniae (S.
pneumoniae) serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F).
Prevnar 13 is also indicated for the prevention of otitis media caused by
serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F. No otitis media efficacy data are
available for serotypes 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A. 

In the United States, the Prevnar 13 product label recommends a 4-dose series at
2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months of age. Children who have received one or more
doses of Prevnar may complete the 4-dose immunization series with Prevnar 13.
Additionally, children 15 months through 5 years of age who have received four
doses of Prevnar may receive one dose of Prevnar 13 to elicit immune responses
to the six additional serotypes. The immune responses induced by this Prevnar 13
transition schedule may result in lower antibody concentrations for the six
additional serotypes (types 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A), compared to antibody
concentrations following four doses of Prevnar 13 (given at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to
15 months). The clinical relevance of these lower antibody responses is not
known. 

Pfizer expects Prevnar 13 to be introduced commercially in the United States in
the first quarter of 2010. In addition to the approval of Prevnar 13 in the
United States, Prevenar 13* (Pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine
[13-valent, adsorbed]), as it is known in most countries outside the United
States, has been approved for use in infants and young children in 38 other
countries. Further regulatory filings for Prevnar 13 for pediatric use are in
advanced stages of review in various countries spanning six continents. Prevnar
13 is also being studied in global Phase III clinical trials in adults, with
regulatory submissions expected later this year. 

Pneumococcal Disease

According to a World Health Organization (WHO) 2002 estimate, pneumococcal
disease is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable death worldwide in children
younger than 5 years. Pneumococcal disease is complex and describes a group of
illnesses, all caused by the bacterium S. pneumoniae. It affects infants and
young children and includes invasive infections such as bacteremia/ sepsis and
meningitis, as well as non-invasive disease including acute otitis media. 

Indication for Prevnar 13

Prevnar 13 is a vaccine approved for use in children 6 weeks through 5 years of
age (prior to the 6th birthday). 

Prevnar 13 is indicated for active immunization for the prevention of invasive
disease caused by 13 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B,
7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F). 

Prevnar 13 is also indicated for the prevention of otitis media (ear infection)
caused by 7 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and
23F). No efficacy data for ear infections are available for strains 1, 3, 5, 6A,
7F, and 19A. 

Important Safety Information for Prevnar 13

Prevnar 13 should not be given to anyone with a severe allergic reaction to any
component of Prevnar 13, Prevnar or any diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine. 

Prevnar 13 may not protect all individuals receiving the vaccine. Protection
against ear infections is expected to be less than that for invasive disease.
Children with weakened immune systems may have a reduced immune response to
Prevnar 13. A temporary pause of breathing following vaccination has been
observed in some infants born prematurely. 

The most common side effects are redness, swelling and tenderness at the
injection site, fever, decreased appetite, irritability, increased sleep, and
decreased sleep. Any side effects associated with the vaccination should be
reported to your child`s health care provider. 

Indication for Prevnar

Prevnar is indicated for active immunization of infants and toddlers against
serious invasive disease caused by S. pneumoniae, including bacteremia
(bloodstream infection) and meningitis (infection of the membranes surrounding
the brain and spinal cord) caused by the seven serotypes in the vaccine. The
seven serotypes (strains) of S. pneumoniae included in the vaccine (4, 6B, 9V,
14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) were the strains that most commonly caused these serious
diseases in children prior to the introduction of the vaccine. The routine
schedule is 2, 4, 6, and 12-15 months of age. 

Prevnar is also indicated for immunization of infants and toddlers against
otitis media (ear infections) caused by the seven serotypes in the vaccine.
Protection against ear infections is expected to be less than that for invasive
disease. 

As with any vaccine, Prevnar may not protect all individuals receiving the
vaccine from serious invasive disease caused by S. pneumoniae. This vaccine
should not be used for treatment of active infection. 

Important Safety Information for Prevnar

In clinical studies, the most frequently reported adverse events included
injection site reactions, fever (&#8805;38&#186;C/100.4&#186;F), irritability, drowsiness,
restless sleep, decreased appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and rash. 

Risks are associated with all vaccines, including Prevnar. Hypersensitivity to
any vaccine component, including diphtheria toxoid, is a contraindication to its
use. Prevnar does not protect 100 percent of children vaccinated. Immunization
with Prevnar does not substitute for routine diphtheria immunization.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today that the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has granted approval for Prevnar 13 (Pneumococcal 13-valent
Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197 Protein]), the Company`s 13-valent
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Prevnar 13 is indicated for active immunization
of children 6 weeks through 5 years of age for the prevention of invasive
disease caused by 13 Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) serotypes 1, 3, 4,
5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F. Prevnar 13 is also indicated for
the prevention of otitis media caused by serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and
23F. No otitis media efficacy data are available for serotypes 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F,
and 19A. 

Invasive pneumococcal disease includes sepsis and bacteremia (bloodstream
infections), meningitis (inflammation of the coverings of the brain and spinal
cord), bacteremic pneumonia, and empyema (accumulation of pus in the cavity
surrounding the lungs). 

"The approval of Prevnar 13 means that infants and young children in the United
States will have access to a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine that provides
coverage against 13 serotypes that could potentially result in life-threatening
illnesses," says Emilio Emini, Ph.D., chief scientific officer, Vaccine
Research, Pfizer Inc. "Together, these 13 serotypes are responsible for the
majority of invasive pneumococcal disease in the United States. Notably,
serotype 19A is now the most common invasive disease-causing serotype in young
children." 

Prevnar 13 includes the seven serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) in
Prevnar&#174; (Pneumococcal 7-valent Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197 Protein]) -
the first pneumococcal conjugate vaccine introduced in 2000 - plus six
additional serotypes (1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A). 

"While the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by the serotypes in
Prevnar has been substantially reduced since the introduction of the vaccine in
2000, invasive pneumococcal disease remains a serious health threat to infants
and young children," adds Dr. Emini. 

In connection with the approval by the FDA, the Company has agreed to certain
post-marketing commitments involving conducting a study to further evaluate the
safety profile of Prevnar 13, a study to evaluate the prevention of overall
invasive pneumococcal disease and various studies to evaluate reduction in
otitis media. The approval of Prevnar 13 is based on the review of 13 Phase III
studies involving more than 7,000 infants and young children. Data from the
Phase III trials support the safety and efficacy of Prevnar 13 for the
prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease in infants and young children.
Clinical trial data indicate that Prevnar 13 can be administered with all
routine pediatric vaccines studied. 

Prevnar 13 is recommended to be administered as a 4-dose series at 2, 4, 6, and
12 to 15 months of age. Children who have received one or more doses of Prevnar
may complete the 4-dose immunization series with Prevnar 13. Children 15 months
through 5 years of age who have received four doses of Prevnar may receive one
dose of Prevnar 13 to elicit immune responses to the six additional serotypes.
The immune responses induced by this Prevnar 13 transition schedule may result
in lower antibody concentrations for the six additional serotypes (types 1, 3,
5, 6A, 7F, and 19A), compared to antibody concentrations following four doses of
Prevnar 13 (given at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months). The clinical relevance of
these lower antibody responses is not known. 

"This approval is a significant milestone for Pfizer and yet another expression
of our mission to improve health and well-being at every stage of life," says
Geno Germano, president and general manager, Specialty Care Business Unit,
Pfizer Inc. "Prevnar 13 is an important priority for the entire Pfizer
organization as we continue to expand our presence in the vaccine category." 

Prevnar 13 will be discussed today at the upcoming meeting of the Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the Company expects the vaccine
to be introduced commercially in the United States in the first quarter of this
year. In addition to its approval in the United States, Prevenar 13*
(Pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine [13-valent, adsorbed]), as it is
known in most countries outside the United States, has been approved for use in
infants and young children in 38 other countries. Further regulatory filings for
Prevnar 13 for pediatric use are in advanced stages of review in various
countries. Prevnar 13 is also being studied in global Phase III clinical trials
in adults, with regulatory submissions expected later this year. 

Pneumococcal Disease

According to a World Health Organization (WHO) 2002 estimate, pneumococcal
disease is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable death worldwide in children
younger than 5 years. Pneumococcal disease is complex and describes a group of
illnesses, all caused by the bacterium S. pneumoniae. It includes invasive
infections such as bacteremia/sepsis and meningitis, as well as non-invasive
disease including acute otitis media. 

Indication for Prevnar 13

Prevnar 13 is a vaccine approved for use in children 6 weeks through 5 years of
age (prior to the 6th birthday). 

Prevnar 13 is indicated for active immunization for the prevention of invasive
disease caused by 13 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B,
7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F). 

Prevnar 13 is also indicated for the prevention of otitis media (ear infection)
caused by 7 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and
23F). No efficacy data for ear infections are available for strains 1, 3, 5, 6A,
7F, and 19A. 

Important Safety Information for Prevnar 13

Prevnar 13 should not be given to anyone with a severe allergic reaction to any
component of Prevnar 13, Prevnar or any diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine. 

Prevnar 13 may not protect all individuals receiving the vaccine. Protection
against ear infections is expected to be less than that for invasive disease.
Children with weakened immune systems may have a reduced immune response to
Prevnar 13. A temporary pause of breathing following vaccination has been
observed in some infants born prematurely. 

The most common side effects are redness, swelling and tenderness at the
injection site, fever, decreased appetite, irritability, increased sleep, and
decreased sleep. Any side effects associated with the vaccination should be
reported to your child`s health care provider. 

Indication for Prevnar

Prevnar is indicated for active immunization of infants and toddlers against
serious invasive disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, including
bacteremia (bloodstream infection) and meningitis (infection of the membranes
surrounding the brain and spinal cord) caused by the seven serotypes in the
vaccine. The seven serotypes (strains) of S. pneumoniae included in the vaccine
(4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) were the strains that most commonly caused
these serious diseases in children prior to the introduction of the vaccine. The
routine schedule is 2, 4, 6, and 12-15 months of age. 

Prevnar is also indicated for immunization of infants and toddlers against
otitis media (ear infections) caused by the seven serotypes in the vaccine.
Protection against ear infections is expected to be less than that for invasive
disease. 

As with any vaccine, Prevnar may not protect all individuals receiving the
vaccine from serious invasive disease caused by S. pneumoniae. This vaccine
should not be used for treatment of active infection. 

Important Safety Information for Prevnar

In clinical studies, the most frequently reported adverse events included

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today that the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has granted approval for Prevnar 13 (Pneumococcal 13-valent
Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197 Protein]), the Company`s 13-valent
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Prevnar 13 is indicated for active immunization
of children 6 weeks through 5 years of age for the prevention of invasive
disease caused by 13 Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) serotypes 1, 3, 4,
5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F. Prevnar 13 is also indicated for
the prevention of otitis media caused by serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and
23F. No otitis media efficacy data are available for serotypes 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F,
and 19A. 

Invasive pneumococcal disease includes sepsis and bacteremia (bloodstream
infections), meningitis (inflammation of the coverings of the brain and spinal
cord), bacteremic pneumonia, and empyema (accumulation of pus in the cavity
surrounding the lungs). 

"The approval of Prevnar 13 means that infants and young children in the United
States will have access to a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine that provides
coverage against 13 serotypes that could potentially result in life-threatening
illnesses," says Emilio Emini, Ph.D., chief scientific officer, Vaccine
Research, Pfizer Inc. "Together, these 13 serotypes are responsible for the
majority of invasive pneumococcal disease in the United States. Notably,
serotype 19A is now the most common invasive disease-causing serotype in young
children." 

Prevnar 13 includes the seven serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) in
Prevnar&#174; (Pneumococcal 7-valent Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197 Protein]) -
the first pneumococcal conjugate vaccine introduced in 2000 - plus six
additional serotypes (1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A). 

"While the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by the serotypes in
Prevnar has been substantially reduced since the introduction of the vaccine in
2000, invasive pneumococcal disease remains a serious health threat to infants
and young children," adds Dr. Emini. 

In connection with the approval by the FDA, the Company has agreed to certain
post-marketing commitments involving conducting a study to further evaluate the
safety profile of Prevnar 13, a study to evaluate the prevention of overall
invasive pneumococcal disease and various studies to evaluate reduction in
otitis media. The approval of Prevnar 13 is based on the review of 13 Phase III
studies involving more than 7,000 infants and young children. Data from the
Phase III trials support the safety and efficacy of Prevnar 13 for the
prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease in infants and young children.
Clinical trial data indicate that Prevnar 13 can be administered with all
routine pediatric vaccines studied. 

Prevnar 13 is recommended to be administered as a 4-dose series at 2, 4, 6, and
12 to 15 months of age. Children who have received one or more doses of Prevnar
may complete the 4-dose immunization series with Prevnar 13. Children 15 months
through 5 years of age who have received four doses of Prevnar may receive one
dose of Prevnar 13 to elicit immune responses to the six additional serotypes.
The immune responses induced by this Prevnar 13 transition schedule may result
in lower antibody concentrations for the six additional serotypes (types 1, 3,
5, 6A, 7F, and 19A), compared to antibody concentrations following four doses of
Prevnar 13 (given at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months). The clinical relevance of
these lower antibody responses is not known. 

"This approval is a significant milestone for Pfizer and yet another expression
of our mission to improve health and well-being at every stage of life," says
Geno Germano, president and general manager, Specialty Care Business Unit,
Pfizer Inc. "Prevnar 13 is an important priority for the entire Pfizer
organization as we continue to expand our presence in the vaccine category." 

Prevnar 13 will be discussed today at the upcoming meeting of the Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the Company expects the vaccine
to be introduced commercially in the United States in the first quarter of this
year. In addition to its approval in the United States, Prevenar 13*
(Pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine [13-valent, adsorbed]), as it is
known in most countries outside the United States, has been approved for use in
infants and young children in 38 other countries. Further regulatory filings for
Prevnar 13 for pediatric use are in advanced stages of review in various
countries. Prevnar 13 is also being studied in global Phase III clinical trials
in adults, with regulatory submissions expected later this year. 

Pneumococcal Disease

According to a World Health Organization (WHO) 2002 estimate, pneumococcal
disease is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable death worldwide in children
younger than 5 years. Pneumococcal disease is complex and describes a group of
illnesses, all caused by the bacterium S. pneumoniae. It includes invasive
infections such as bacteremia/sepsis and meningitis, as well as non-invasive
disease including acute otitis media. 

Indication for Prevnar 13

Prevnar 13 is a vaccine approved for use in children 6 weeks through 5 years of
age (prior to the 6th birthday). 

Prevnar 13 is indicated for active immunization for the prevention of invasive
disease caused by 13 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B,
7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F). 

Prevnar 13 is also indicated for the prevention of otitis media (ear infection)
caused by 7 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and
23F). No efficacy data for ear infections are available for strains 1, 3, 5, 6A,
7F, and 19A. 

Important Safety Information for Prevnar 13

Prevnar 13 should not be given to anyone with a severe allergic reaction to any
component of Prevnar 13, Prevnar or any diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine. 

Prevnar 13 may not protect all individuals receiving the vaccine. Protection
against ear infections is expected to be less than that for invasive disease.
Children with weakened immune systems may have a reduced immune response to
Prevnar 13. A temporary pause of breathing following vaccination has been
observed in some infants born prematurely. 

The most common side effects are redness, swelling and tenderness at the
injection site, fever, decreased appetite, irritability, increased sleep, and
decreased sleep. Any side effects associated with the vaccination should be
reported to your child`s health care provider. 

Indication for Prevnar

Prevnar is indicated for active immunization of infants and toddlers against
serious invasive disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, including
bacteremia (bloodstream infection) and meningitis (infection of the membranes
surrounding the brain and spinal cord) caused by the seven serotypes in the
vaccine. The seven serotypes (strains) of S. pneumoniae included in the vaccine
(4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) were the strains that most commonly caused
these serious diseases in children prior to the introduction of the vaccine. The
routine schedule is 2, 4, 6, and 12-15 months of age. 

Prevnar is also indicated for immunization of infants and toddlers against
otitis media (ear infections) caused by the seven serotypes in the vaccine.
Protection against ear infections is expected to be less than that for invasive
disease. 

As with any vaccine, Prevnar may not protect all individuals receiving the
vaccine from serious invasive disease caused by S. pneumoniae. This vaccine
should not be used for treatment of active infection. 

Important Safety Information for Prevnar

In clinical studies, the most frequently reported adverse events included
injection site reactions, fever (&#8805;38&#186;C/100.4&#186;F), irritability, drowsiness,
restless sleep, decreased appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and rash. 

Risks are associated with all vaccines, including Prevnar. Hypersensitivity to
any vaccine component, including diphtheria toxoid, is a contraindication to its
use. Prevnar does not protect 100 percent of children vaccinated. Immunization
with Prevnar does not substitute for routine diphtheria immunization.

&lt;p&gt;Feb 24 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities cut its rating on
Stec Inc STEC.O to "neutral" from "overweight," citing
concerns about inventory overhang at the flash memory storage
product maker's top customer EMC Corp (EMC.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Shares of Stec fell 29 percent in morning trade Wednesday,
a day after the company warned of inventory carryover at EMC
continuing to hurt sales in the first half of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We had been too optimistic, thinking the EMC inventory
overhang would be a one-quarter issue," analyst Mark Moskowitz
wrote in a note to clients. Moskowitz also said the
lower-than-expected revenue outlook is likely to fan fears that
the decline stems from competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wedbush Securities' analyst Betsy Van Hees said investors
should remain on the sidelines till there is more clarity on
adoption rates of solid state drives (SSDs), customer
production ramps, single-level cell (SLC) NAND flash pricing
trends and the competitive landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SSDs, viewed by many as the future of the disk drive
industry, are still more expensive than traditional hard drives
and concerns remain about whether end-customers will really
take to enterprise SSDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Van Hees, who has a "neutral" rating on Stec shares, cut
her target price on the stock to $10 from $14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stec shares were down $3.15, or 23 percent at $10.27 in
morning trade, making them one of the top percentage losers
Wednesday on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
It is not a question of if LTE will be the dominant 4G mobile technology, the
question is when LTE networks will proliferate, according to a new report from
Visant Strategies. In many cases wireless mobile operators across the globe will
implement HSPA+ before transitioning fully to LTE the second half of this
decade. 

"HSPA+ is expected to be the dominant form of mobile broadband internet for the
next five to ten years especially since LTE-oriented spectrum is being slowly
released throughout the world," said Andy Fuertes of Visant Strategies.
"Carriers will need to deploy LTE to remain competitive in many cases, but today
HSPA+ is an attractive choice to solve the smart phone capacity crunch many
operators face due to its relatively cheaper investment." 

According to "3.5G and 4G 2010: The Move to Worldwide Mobile Broadband," LTE
deployments will gain momentum in 2014, although some major carriers will have
deployed the consensus 4G winner by then. 

"By 2015 the 3.5G/4G subscriber distribution will consist of HSPA+ with over
half of all 3.5G and 4G subs, LTE with about one-third and mobile WiMAX
accounting for close to one-tenth of all 3.5G and 4G subs worldwide," said Larry
Swasey of Visant Strategies. "Backhaul in all of the advanced wireless networks
needs to be beefed up as well in order to take real advantage of 3.5G and 4G." 

WiMAX remains strong as a 3.5 GHz fixed/portable platform but a lack of support
from major carriers is resulting in a minimal role in the mobile wireless
market, the report finds. HSPA+ and LTE may be used in traditional 3.5 GHz bands
over the long term. 

The report includes annual shipments and revenues through 2015 for LTE, WiMAX
and HSPA+ handset/user devices, femtocells and base stations with subscribers
and revenues given as well. 3.5G/4G users by region, device shipments and
revenues and base station shipments, deployments and revenues are also given
through 2015.

&lt;p&gt; * Derivatives business also seen taking a hit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Feb 24 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
warned investors that increased regulation could hurt revenue
this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Warnings about the costs of increased regulation have
become a common refrain in the financial industry as lawmakers
have stepped up efforts to increase oversight of Wall Street to
prevent a repeat of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's credit card business is expected to come under
particular pressure as new rules restrict certain fees card
issuers can charge, among other things, the bank said in an
annual 10-K report filed with U.S. securities regulators on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank previously warned that annual net income from its
card business could fall by $500 million to $750 million as a
result of the new rules, which took effect on Monday. It said
in the filing that it expects the card business to report a net
loss of $1 billion in the first quarter and "somewhat less than
that" in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second-quarter estimate appears to be a slight
improvement from a January presentation that said the unit
could lose about $1 billion in that period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second-largest U.S. bank by assets noted in the filing
that recent regulatory proposals have included calls to limit
the size of banks and some of their businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said proposals to centrally clear standardized
over-the-counter derivatives contracts and tighten capital and
margin requirements on these instruments could hurt revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York-based bank, the largest derivatives dealer on
Wall Street, could see as much as a $3 billion hit to revenue
from the proposed derivatives rules, Sanford C. Bernstein
analysts estimated in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The filing repeated recent remarks by executives that the
bank is interested in raising its dividend. According to the
filing, JPMorgan would like to raise its annual payout to
between 75 cents and $1 a share, subject to its board of
directors deciding the broader economic environment has
improved sufficiently.

&lt;p&gt;DHAKA Feb 24 (Reuters) - Bangladesh's oil and gas authority
said on Wednesday it had approved a plan by U.S. energy firm
Chevron (CVX.N) to share its stake in a gas block with a leading
South Korean oil company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We have approved the U.S. firm's plan to share almost half
of its stake with GS Caltex [GSCAL.UL] to tying up the first
ever Korean company for hydrocarbon exploration in Bangladesh,"
said Mohammad Hussain Monsur, chairman of the state-run
Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Mineral Corporation or Petrobangla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But Chevron will remain as the operator of the block,"
Monsur told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Confirming this to Reuters, Chevron said that GS Caltex
would join it and state-managed Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration
and Production Company (BAPEX) as partners in block 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The agreement, approved by the Bangladesh government,
results in GS Caltex assuming a 45 percent interest. Chevron is
the operator and holds a 45 percent interest, and BAPEX a 10
percent interest," the company said in a statement.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron had submitted the proposal several months ago to
Petrobangla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has already conducted a 2D seismic survey covering
1,040 square kilometers, spending $14 million in 2006 and found
prospecs there.     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said it had also completed a comprehensive 3D survey
in block 7 and was analysing data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has also started mobilizing equipment to initiate
drilling in the field which might cost of $20 million to
delineate hydrocarbon reserve potentials in the block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron supplies around 950 million cubic feet of gas per
day (mmcfd), which is almost half of the country's total gas
production of 1996 mmcfd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bangladesh suffers a daily gas shortage of up to 300 mmcf
that has forced at least 300 manufacturing firms in the southern
Chittagong area to halt operations, officials said.    ($1=69.30

&lt;p&gt;Works with Any Authentication Device; Lowers Costs of Strong Authentication
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Passlogix&#174;, Inc., today announced v-GO Universal Authentication Manager (v-GO
UAM), the first strong authentication solution that will enable Microsoft
Windows to accept any identification device for logon - including door access
(RFID) badges, government-issued citizen identity cards, standalone or built-in
laptop biometrics, one time passwords via mobile phones, and question and answer
sequences. The solution provides fast and secure network access for users and
lowers the cost of back-end strong authentication infrastructure in corporate
networks from more than $100 to just $15 per user. 

According to Phil Schacter, Vice President and Service Director for Burton Group
Security and Risk Management Strategies, "Many organizations require the
flexibility to maintain a mix of password and stronger authentication
credentials, depending on the risk profile associated with each use case and its
community of users." 

v-GO UAM delivers major savings for strong authentication deployments by
eliminating the need to maintain a separate infrastructure with proprietary
authentication servers. Instead, Microsoft Active Directory is used for data
storage and administration. Organizations that are already using authentication
devices such as proximity badges for door access can achieve additional savings
by using those same devices for Windows logon, removing the need for additional
device investment to secure network access. 

v-GO UAM also keeps the user logon process simple. Users who have door access
badges, for example, simply tap their badge on a badge reader attached to their
computer and enter a PIN code. They tap their badge again to lock their computer
or log out. Users with smart cards, such as government-issued identity cards,
insert and remove their card from the smart card reader in the computer. 

"Until now, organizations that wanted to use strong authentication for Windows
logon had to pay more than $100 per user for the supporting software and
servers. They were also usually limited to one type of authentication device,
had costly changes of the back-end infrastructure if they wanted to switch
authenticators, and had to impose a confusing logon process on their end-users,"
said Stephane Fymat, Vice President of Strategy and Product Management for
Passlogix. "By solving these problems with a universal device strategy, simple
interface and affordable non-proprietary back-end, v-GO UAM finally makes it
possible to deploy strong authentication enterprise-wide." 

Advantages of v-GO UAM include:

* An open architecture that supports any type of device from any manufacturer,
rather than locking organizations into a single method that is typically
proprietary. This open approach enables organizations to leverage their physical
access control infrastructure for network logon if desired, buy new
authentication credentials from any vendor, switch authenticators without
changing their infrastructure, and support multiple authentication methods that
may be required by different end users from a single administrative interface. 
* Faster and more secure logon to Windows than passwords, particularly for
organizations that are subject to data protection regulations such as HIPAA, PCI
DSS and FISMA. It also eliminates forgotten Windows passwords. 
* An intuitive user interface that usually eliminates the need for end-user
training. 
* No need for dedicated servers, eliminating deployment and administrative
complexity, scalability barriers, and central points of failure associated with
strong authentication in large organizations. 
* Roaming capabilities, allowing users to sign on to the network from any
enterprise workstation. 
* Low total cost of ownership, at just $15 per user, that cost-justifies
enterprise-wide strong authentication deployments. 
* Optional deployment with v-GO Single Sign-On, the market-leading enterprise
single sign-on solution. While v-GO UAM can be deployed on a standalone basis,
v-GO UAM and v-GO SSO work together to enable users to be re-authorized to
sensitive applications with the same identification device they used to logon to
Windows.

Pricing and Availability

v-GO UAM is available both on a standalone basis at $15 per user and as part of
Passlogix`s v-GO Access Accelerator Suite. Volume discounts are also available.
The first release will support a broad range of cards including smart cards,
door access cards and government-issued identification cards. Support for
biometrics, question and answer validation (challenge &amp; response) and other
methods will be available shortly thereafter.

"Today's announcement will help clients manage more data with less infrastructure, simplify information protection, while helping to reduce operational cost and energy usage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's ProtecTIER brand uses de-duplication technology that the company acquired in its 2008 purchase of Diligent Technologies Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ProtecTIER Deduplication Gateway combines a virtual tape library, which is a disk array that emulates a tape library to backup servers, with an inline data de-duplication algorithm called HyperFactor, a tool that indexes the complete content of a repository. HyperFactor indices can be permanently hosted in the RAM because of its small footprint, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TS7680, which will have a price tag of around $300,000, also features two-node clustering for up to a petabyte of storage capacity per system under one management interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM claims the combination of a virtual tape library and data de-duplication can help boost efficiency by rapidly improving the time for backup and restore operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This allows applications to complete faster and improve the batch-processing window," IBM stated. "Also, since virtual tape systems are seen by the mainframe as a standard tape library, existing processes and procedures need not be changed to accommodate the new technology, and little or no operating system modification is required."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucas Mearian covers storage; disaster recovery and business continuity; financial services infrastructure; health care IT for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are probing how Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs (GS.N) helped debt-stricken Greece arrange derivatives deals that critics say were used to disguise the size of its budget deficits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are looking into a number of questions related to Goldman Sachs and other companies in their derivatives arrangements with Greece," Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told a Senate committee on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also is "interested" in Wall Street's activities in helping Greece do derivatives deals, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. central bank, which regulates bank holding companies such as Goldman Sachs, is still in a fact-finding mode, checking Wall Street firms that have the sophistication to handle derivatives deals like the one with Greece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it was discovered bank supervisory rules were violated, the offending bank could be called upon to put in place a corrective plan or potentially face a more-formal enforcement action, up to and including fines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revelations that Greece's deficit was three times bigger than originally forecast plunged the country into a debt crisis. The European Union has voiced support for a plan by Greece to tighten its purse strings, but has not pledged aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernanke's comments coincided with a warning from ratings agencies that they might downgrade Greece's sovereign debt, which refocused attention on the weak fiscal health of some euro-zone countries and weighed on global stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously, using these instruments in a way that potentially destabilizes a company or a country is counterproductive," Bernanke said, as he began a second day of testimony on the state of the U.S. economy. "We'll certainly be evaluating what we learn from the activities of the holding companies that we supervise here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMPLIFYING PUBLIC CRISIS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernanke was responding to a question from Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, who wondered whether Greece was a case in which major financial institutions were "amplifying a public crisis purely for private gain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about Bernanke's comments, Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally said, "As a matter of policy, we don't comment on legal or regulatory matters."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Managing Director Gerald Corrigan told British lawmakers on Monday there was nothing inappropriate in the deals his firm arranged, although he agreed there could have been more transparency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC would not confirm or deny it was investigating Goldman's role in helping Greece, but indicated it had concerns about the potential impacts of derivatives deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As an agency, we have been examining potential abuses and destabilizing effects related to the use of credit default swaps and other opaque financial products and practices," SEC spokesman John Nester said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernanke did not specify whether regulators were simply trying to learn more to restrict future similar deals, of if they were concerned fraud or disclosure violations may have occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Greek crisis has pressured the euro and Greece's EU partners fear it may spread to weaker euro-zone economies like Portugal and Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cross-currency derivatives that Goldman Sachs conducted for Greece in 2001 helped reduce the size of its debt at a time when the country was keen to meet criteria for entering the EU and adopting the euro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Pedro Nicolaci da Costa; Editing by Andrea Ricci)&lt;/p&gt;

revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grupo Televisa (TV.N)(TLVACPO.MX), the world's largest

Nation`s Leading Multi-Sport Venue for Amateur and Professional Events
Re-Launches as ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex and Features Signature ESPN
Elements; One-of-a-Kind Initiative to Take Youth Sports to the Next Level
LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
The widely acclaimed sports facility at Walt Disney World Resort was officially
re-launched as ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex on Thursday, Feb. 25, in an
elaborate Hollywood-style "turf carpet" event that featured celebrities,
Florida`s governor, ESPN on-air commentators and sports stars from the NFL, MLB,
LPGA, Olympics and more. 

Shawn Johnson (Olympic gold medal gymnast), Chad Ochocinco (Cincinnati Bengals),
Jennie Finch (Olympic softball gold medalist), Santonio Holmes (Pittsburgh
Steelers Super Bowl MVP) and Annika Sorenstam (LPGA) were among the star
athletes who joined popular ESPN on-air personalities on the red carpet that was
painted green with yard lines to resemble a football field. Florida governor
Charlie Crist and senior executives from Disney and ESPN officially re-launched
the 220-acre sports complex as Super Bowl champion New Orleans Saints kicker
Garrett Hartley booted a football over the re-designed complex entrance amid
fireworks and a sea of confetti. Immediately afterwards, Mickey Mouse led a
throng of youth and pro athletes -- representing the 60-plus sports held at the
complex -- through a huge ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex banner draped over
the entrance. 

Afterwards, the celebrities, athletes and ESPN personalities attended a special
reception at the complex`s re-themed ESPN Wide World of Sports Grill, followed
by a special performance by the Harlem Globetrotters that featured Hartley,
Sorenstam, Maurice Jones-Drew, Brandi Chastain and ESPN radio personalities Mike
Greenberg and Mike Golic, who served as honorary assistant coaches. The game,
called by ESPN`s SportsNation co-hosts Colin Cowherd and Michelle Beadle, airs
Friday on ESPN2. 

"At ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex, we are giving America`s youth athletes a
one-of-a-kind youth sports experience that leaves them feeling as if they have
reached the big time and made it onto ESPN," said Ken Potrock, senior vice
president of Disney Sports Enterprises. "Our goal is to ensure that the millions
of athletes, coaches and fans who come through this sports complex at Walt
Disney World Resort will walk in loving sports and walk out knowing that sports
loves them back." 

The re-imagined ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex is taking youth sports to the
next level by providing an immersive sports experience for the more than 2
million athletes, coaches and fans who come to the complex each year, while also
connecting them to their favorite ESPN programs, personalities and elements. It
also provides advertisers a new platform to reach the youth sports market. 

As part of the project, Disney and ESPN have added many technological and
experiential enhancements designed to replicate the signature elements of ESPN
throughout the complex, including 56 high-definition cameras (42 robotic, 10
handheld and four studio), 40 high-definition video screens at 17 locations
(including three jumbo screens) and a 2,500-square-foot Production Center with
links to ESPN facilities in Bristol, Conn., New York and Los Angeles. Also,
there is a 20-zone audio system, a welcome center, a huge complex marquee and
the Innovation Lab where the ESPN Emerging Technology group is testing and
developing innovative new on-air applications. 

"This complex embodies the ESPN and Disney commitment to excellence, ensuring
that athletes and their families have the best possible experience," said George
Bodenheimer, president, ESPN, Inc. and ABC Sports and co-chairman, Disney Media
Networks. "It is our hope that, win or lose, every athlete who competes at the
complex will walk away with lifelong memories." 

The re-imagining of ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex is the latest initiative
in the growing sports business at Walt Disney World Resort. In late 2007, the
sports complex added additional outdoor playing fields for football, soccer,
lacrosse and field hockey competitions. And in 2008, the sports complex opened
Jostens Center, a state-of-the-art fieldhouse that allows Disney to accommodate
twice as many indoor sports events each year. Additional expansion plans are in
development, including a planned 100-lane bowling facility. 

Disney Sports annually stages more than 300 events and has accommodated
approximately 60 different sports involving athletes from more than 70
countries. Among those events are Atlanta Braves spring training, Chelsea
Football Club events, the Pop Warner Super Bowl, AAU National Championships,
Varsity Cheer events, the World Cheerleading Championships, the ESPN RISE Games,
USSSA events and the Walt Disney World Marathon, one of the top marathons in the
nation. ESPN televises dozens of sporting events from the complex, and Walt
Disney World Resort and ESPN also annually work together to host the popular
ESPN The Weekend presented by Dick`s Sporting Goods event at Disney`s Hollywood
Studios and the complex.

&lt;p&gt;A prominent security researcher today said he doubts Microsoft's take-down of the Waledac botnet would have any impact on spam levels, as the company claimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Waledac just is not a hugely prolific spammer," said Joe Stewart, director of malware analysis at SecureWorks and a noted botnet researcher. "So I don't think it's going to affect spam [volume]. What it does do lately..., what it's used for, is to install rogue antivirus software."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.K.-based anti-spam service Spamhaus echoed Stewart today. "If [Microsoft's take-down] did affect spam, we haven't noticed," said Richard Cox, the chief information officer at Spamhaus. Like Stewart, Cox also dismissed Waledac's threat as a spam engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Waledac was not a high threat, it's less than 1% of the spam traffic," Cox said. "What we're worried about is Zeus, which is a far more damaging botnet, which is creating a substantial amount of spam."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Postini, the message security and filtering firm owned by Google, also said it had not detected any drop in spam. "The team hasn't seen any change so far," said Google spokesman Jay Nancarrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, Microsoft said that the Waledac botnet, which it claimed controls hundreds of thousands of infected PCs -- is a "major distributor of spam globally." Microsoft also said that its researchers had snatched about 60,000 machines away from the botnet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stewart wasn't seeing any evidence of those claims, either. "I haven't seen any decrease in [Waledac's] activity, the researcher said. "To me, it looks like business as usual."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late Wednesday, Microsoft announced it had won a federal court order that cut off 277 .com domains associated with the botnet, and said that by knocking those sites off the Internet, it would seriously disrupt Waledac's operation. "This action has quickly and effectively cut off traffic to Waledac at the '.com' or domain registry level, severing the connection between the command and control centers of the botnet and most of its thousands of zombie computers around the world," Tim Cranton , an associate general counsel with Microsoft, said in a blog entry yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Stewart said it's very unlikely that the move had actually crippled the botnet. "Waledac uses a peer-to-peer protocol for its command and control," he said, referring to the mechanism that the most technically-advanced zombie PC commanders use to control their armies. "But the bots don't really [depend] on those domain names to communicate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, said Stewart, Waledac bots will be able to communicate "indefinitely" by using the IP (Internet Protocol) addresses that are hard-coded into the bot Trojan. To kill off a botnet like Waledac, Microsoft would have had to target not only the domains it did, but also every possible IP address coded into the malware. "I don't see how you can kill a botnet like this," Stewart said. "There's no single point of failure for these botnets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, he applauded Microsoft's move. "...This is a good start, it's a good step in the right direction," Stewart said, offering up other ways the company's resources might have been better spent. "There are plenty of other botnets where this approach might work -- any that depend on a centralized command and control server."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waledac was created by, and is maintained by, hackers who previously flooded the Internet with the Storm bot Trojan. The people behind this botnet aren't rookies, Stewart said. "We're dealing with the same people behind Storm, and they definitely know the ins and outs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all likelihood, he added, Microsoft's maneuver won't stop an established botnet like Waledac. "They're attacking the very, very front end of the whole scheme of the bot," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft acknowledged that its work isn't done. "[This] is not a silver bullet for undoing all the damage we believe Waledac has caused," said Cranton. "Although the zombies are now largely out of the bot-herders' control, they are still infected with the original malware."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message security companies that monitor the pulse of spam, including Symantec's MessageLabs and Google 's Postini, were not able to immediately come up with data to show whether the purported demise of Waledac has, as Microsoft claimed, depressed spam levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has targeted Waledac before. In April 2009, the company issued a version of its Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) that scrubbed the malware from Waledac-infected Windows PCs. In the second half of last year, MSRT and other Microsoft software, notably the free anti-virus program Microsoft Security Essentials, cleaned 96,000 systems of Waledac, boasted Jeff Williams , the director of Microsoft's Malware Protection Center, today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams, who urged users to run MSRT and keep their anti-virus software up to date, also hinted that Microsoft had more on Waledac than it had disclosed. "We're not done," he said. "Stay tuned."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert McMillan, of the IDG News Service, contributed to this report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;SAN DIEGO--(Business Wire)--
Robbins Umeda LLP has commenced an investigation into possible breaches of
fiduciary duty and other violations of state law by the officers and members of
the Board of Directors of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. ("Coca-Cola Enterprises" or
the "Company") (NYSE: CCE) in connection with their decision to sell the
Company's North American operations to The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO). If the
transaction is approved under the terms of the agreement, Coca-Cola Enterprises'
shareholders will exchange each share for $10 in cash and a share of a new
Coca-Cola Enterprises focused solely on Europe. The new company will retain the
Company's name. The Company's North American operations accounted for over half
of its operating income in 2009. The deal is expected to close in the fourth
quarter of 2010. 

Robbins Umeda LLP's investigation concerns whether Coca-Cola Enterprises' Board
of Directors' decision to enter into the sale of its North American assets to
The Coca-Cola Company was the product of a good faith business decision and in
the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today withdrew its demand that Cryptome.org yank the "Microsoft Global Criminal Spy Guide" document from the site, and said it had never intended for the whistleblower's domain to be knocked off the Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In this case, we did not ask that this site be taken down, only that Microsoft copyrighted content be removed," said a Microsoft spokeswoman in an e-mailed statement early Thursday. "We are requesting to have the site restored and are no longer seeking the document's removal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The document, a 17-page guide to law enforcement on how to obtain information about users of Microsoft 's online services, including its Windows Live Hotmail, the Xbox Live gaming network and its Windows Live SkyDrive storage service, was published by John Young, who runs Cryptome.org , on Feb. 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Microsoft demanded that Young remove the document from his site, citing the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). When Young refused, his Internet provider shut down the site, and Network Solutions, the registrar of Young's domain, put a "legal lock" on the domain name. The last prevented him from transferring the URL to another ISP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally, Young had been told he had until today to remove the document from his site or face the consequences. Instead, his ISP pulled the plug and Network Solutions locked the domain name a day early, forcing him to scramble Wednesday to find a temporary home for his site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Network Solutions has unlocked the domain -- meaning Young can now transfer it to another ISP -- Cyrptome.org was still offline as of 2 p.m. ET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We removed the legal lock as soon as we received the notification from Microsoft that they withdrew their [DMCA]-based complaint," said Susan Wade, a spokeswoman for Network Solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the Microsoft turn-about, Young remained combative, effectively daring the company to fight. "We really want this to go to court," he said in a telephone interview early Thursday. "The DMCA needs to be modified, because it's catching a lot of innocent people in its net."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DMCA, Young argued, makes it much too easy for large companies like Microsoft to demand, and get, cooperation from Internet providers and domain registrars like Network Solutions when the issue is not copyright, but more in the confidentiality arena. "This is an abuse of the copyright law," Young maintained, adding that it wasn't lawmakers' intent to let firms use the DMCA to quash leaked information. "We want to go to court so [Congress] comes out with a better version [of the DMCA]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cryptome.org has rebuffed efforts by other major Internet companies, most recently Yahoo , when they have demanded the site take down documents spelling out how police can request user information. "They're all bluffing," he said earlier today, putting Microsoft in that crowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Young's site published the "Microsoft Global Criminal Spy Guide," other sites posted the document. It can currently be downloaded from Wikileaks ( download PDF ), for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft defended the two-year-old document that caused the ruckus. "Like all service providers, Microsoft must respond to lawful requests from law enforcement agencies to provide information related to criminal investigations," the company spokeswoman said today. "We take our responsibility to protect our customers privacy very seriously, so have specific guidelines that we use when responding to law enforcement requests."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computerworld blogger Preston Gralla dug into the document today in his "Leaked Microsoft intelligence document: Here's what Microsoft will reveal to police about you" post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;Since 1996, the whistleblower site Cryptome has been posting sensitive government and corporate documents. Now Cryptome has been stricken from the Web after releasing the Microsoft Online Services Global Criminal Compliance Handbook , a "spy guide" for law enforcement detailing what data Microsoft has, keeps, and can relinquish. Since most of you are Microsoft users, there are a few tidbits of information you'll need to know before purchasing Xbox Live points, logging onto Office Live, or sending an e-mail through Hotmail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the "Spy Guide"?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Global Criminal Compliance Handbook is a quasi-comprehensive explanatory document meant for law enforcement officials seeking access to Microsoft's stored user information. It also provides sample language for subpoenas and diagrams on how to understand server logs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I call it "quasi-comprehensive" because, at a mere 22 pages, it doesn't explore the nitty-gritty of Microsoft's systems; it's more like a data-hunting guide for dummies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which of My Microsoft Services are Affected?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All sorts. Microsoft keeps user information related to its online services. The data ranges from past e-mails to credit card numbers. The information is kept for a designated period of time, sometimes forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sites referenced are:&lt;/p&gt;

Windows Live
Windows Live ID
Microsoft Office Live
Xbox Live
MSN
Windows Live Spaces
Windows Live Messenger
Hotmail
MSN Groups&lt;p&gt;Some of these Microsoft services may not apply to a whole lot of people. Who uses MSN Groups, for instance? But accessing personal information from Xbox Live accounts, for example, could be a big problem for 23 million subscribers; especially since Xbox Live keeps more data than many of Microsoft's other services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Information Does Microsoft Have?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It depends on the service. We'll deal with the big dogs here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Live ID&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Live ID is a one-stop shop for user info retention and is used on a multitude of sites to limit scattered user names and passwords. Due to its wide reach, Windows Live ID could allow law enforcement agencies to access tons your personal Web surfing information. Microsoft keeps "the last 10 Microsoft site and IP connection record combinations (not the last 10, consecutive IP connection records)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All things considered, that's not bad. It gets worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hotmail&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"E-mail account registration records are retained for the life of the account. Internet Protocol connection history records are retained for 60 days," according to the document. But if you, like many, switched over to Gmail and let your Hotmail account lapse, all e-mail content is "typically deleted after 60 days of inactivity.   Then if the user does not reactivate their account, the free MSN Hotmail and free Windows Live Hotmail account will become inactive after a period of time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;E-mail content that is older than 180 days can be disbursed "as long as the governmental entity follows the customer notification provisions in ECPA (see 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2703(b), 2705)." If the content is less than 181 days, you need a search warrant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xbox Live&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xbox Live stores a lot of information:&lt;/p&gt;
Gamertag 
Credit card number 
Phone number 
First/last name with zip code Serial number but only if box has been registered online 
Service request number from Xbox Hotline (e.g. SR 103xx-xx-xx) 
E-mail account (e.g. @msn.com, @hotmail.com or any other Windows Live ID account name) 
IP history for the lifetime of the gamertag (only one gamertag at a time)&lt;p&gt;This information comes in handy for non-nefarious purposes, just so you don't get completely paranoid. For instance, if your Xbox 360 console is stolen, Microsoft can hunt it down lickety-split using its vast tracking records of you and your machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office Online and Windows Live SkyDrive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scariest part of the handbook comes here. Office Online and Windows Live SkyDrive are both services that store documents and files in the cloud. The two pages devoted to these services describe only what the products are and not the access Microsoft has to pertinent information. What can Microsoft get at? How long is everything stored? What are the legal parameters? All of this is uncertain and worthy of a little spine-shake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing is the next big thing in technology. Companies are apt to store sensitive financial and human relations documents in one of Microsoft's clouds. If prompted by the government, Microsoft could (or couldn't?) dip its fingers into your spreadsheets and extract all it wants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Legalese&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last page of the document details the legal procedures required to obtain Microsoft's information, but with warrantless wiretapping being such a big fad lately -- as evidenced lately by Google's shady dealings with the NSA -- one never knows how many reams of red tape the government can snip through to get what it wants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Brief Case History&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's uncertain as to how John Young, Cryptome's proprietor, obtained The Global Criminal Compliance Handbook; what's assured is that it caught Microsoft's attention. The corporation quickly filed a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) notice alleging copyright infringement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1998, the DMCA criminalized production and dissemination of tech methods intended to skirt protections such as DRM that control access to copyrighted works. It also criminalizes the act of circumventing an access control, whether or not there is actual infringement of copyright itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some organizations have a problem with Microsoft's use of the DMCA in this case. "[The Electronic Frontier Foundation" find[s] it troubling that copyright law is being invoked here. Microsoft doesn't sell this manual. There's no market for this work. It's not a copyright issue. John [Young's] copying of it is fair use. We don't do this anywhere else in speech law," Cindy Cohn of the Electronic Frontier Foundation told ReadWriteWeb. Cohn stated that in cases involving libel or trade secrets there is a procedure of going to court, making a case, and getting an injunction -- filing a DMCA complaint "makes censorship easy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either way, Microsoft prevailed. Cryptome's host, Network Solutions, tore the site down. Young filed a counterclaim yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I feel The Global Criminal Compliance Handbook isn't as nightmarish as some may paint it (save for the cloud computing part). Microsoft needs to have measures to work with the government in cases of danger, plain and simple. But with so much data out there, so much of it "owned" by Microsoft, I cannot help but feel exposed and vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for the sake of Internet freedom, it's crucial that Cryptome is released back into the wild. The site serves a clear and important purpose; its latest -- and perhaps last -- release proves that point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/190233&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co's (JPM.N) chief executive said he is in no hurry to raise the bank's dividend due to an economy that he warned could still be threatened by a "double dip" scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We don't mind holding extra capital right now because we don't know what's going to happen," Jamie Dimon said on Thursday during an investor day presentation. "There are huge potential negatives out there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that he wanted to see consistent rise in employment numbers over a period of months before increasing the bank's dividend. Some analysts have speculated that a boost in the bank's 20-cent annual payout could be close, given its return to multibillion dollar profits last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon has said the bank would like to increase its annual dividend to around 75 cents to $1 but the bank's board would like to be convinced the worst of the crisis is over before it makes this move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said on Thursday that the bank sees an opportunity to expand its Chase retail banking network and is gearing up to open about 300 branches a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, who has emerged as one of the industry's most prominent voices after his bank, the nation's second largest, weathered the credit crisis better than most, also said he was opposed to the Obama administration's proposed consumer protection agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're getting into the capricious and arbitrary punitive behavior" on the regulatory side, he said, although he insisted he wanted better consumer regulation and supported a systemic regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he expressed optimism on the regulations' ultimate form saying that he expected them to end up in a more "rational" place in the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day, JPMorgan's head of investment banking said the company can continue to meet profitability targets through growth areas such as emerging markets and commodities trading, even as fixed income trading margins narrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's planned acquisition of commodities joint venture RBS Sempra should boost the bank's trading efforts, Jes Staley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has not historically been sufficiently committed to staying in emerging markets, but now it is, Staley added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay; writing by Dan Wilchins; editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

Nation`s Leading Multi-Sport Venue for Amateur and Professional Events
Re-Launches as ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex and Features Signature ESPN
Elements; One-of-a-Kind Initiative to Take Youth Sports to the Next Level
LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
The widely acclaimed sports facility at Walt Disney World Resort was officially
re-launched as ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex on Thursday, Feb. 25, in an
elaborate Hollywood-style "turf carpet" event that featured celebrities,
Florida`s governor, ESPN on-air commentators and sports stars from the NFL, MLB,
LPGA, Olympics and more. 

Shawn Johnson (Olympic gold medal gymnast), Chad Ochocinco (Cincinnati Bengals),
Jennie Finch (Olympic softball gold medalist), Santonio Holmes (Pittsburgh
Steelers Super Bowl MVP) and Annika Sorenstam (LPGA) were among the star
athletes who joined popular ESPN on-air personalities on the red carpet that was
painted green with yard lines to resemble a football field. Florida governor
Charlie Crist and senior executives from Disney and ESPN officially re-launched
the 220-acre sports complex as Super Bowl champion New Orleans Saints kicker
Garrett Hartley booted a football over the re-designed complex entrance amid
fireworks and a sea of confetti. Immediately afterwards, Mickey Mouse led a
throng of youth and pro athletes -- representing the 60-plus sports held at the
complex -- through a huge ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex banner draped over
the entrance. 

Afterwards, the celebrities, athletes and ESPN personalities attended a special
reception at the complex`s re-themed ESPN Wide World of Sports Grill, followed
by a special performance by the Harlem Globetrotters that featured Hartley,
Sorenstam, Maurice Jones-Drew, Brandi Chastain and ESPN radio personalities Mike
Greenberg and Mike Golic, who served as honorary assistant coaches. The game,
called by ESPN`s SportsNation co-hosts Colin Cowherd and Michelle Beadle, airs
Friday on ESPN2. 

"At ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex, we are giving America`s youth athletes a
one-of-a-kind youth sports experience that leaves them feeling as if they have
reached the big time and made it onto ESPN," said Ken Potrock, senior vice
president of Disney Sports Enterprises. "Our goal is to ensure that the millions
of athletes, coaches and fans who come through this sports complex at Walt
Disney World Resort will walk in loving sports and walk out knowing that sports
loves them back." 

The re-imagined ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex is taking youth sports to the
next level by providing an immersive sports experience for the more than 2
million athletes, coaches and fans who come to the complex each year, while also
connecting them to their favorite ESPN programs, personalities and elements. It
also provides advertisers a new platform to reach the youth sports market. 

As part of the project, Disney and ESPN have added many technological and
experiential enhancements designed to replicate the signature elements of ESPN
throughout the complex, including 56 high-definition cameras (42 robotic, 10
handheld and four studio), 40 high-definition video screens at 17 locations
(including three jumbo screens) and a 2,500-square-foot Production Center with
links to ESPN facilities in Bristol, Conn., New York and Los Angeles. Also,
there is a 20-zone audio system, a welcome center, a huge complex marquee and
the Innovation Lab where the ESPN Emerging Technology group is testing and
developing innovative new on-air applications. 

"This complex embodies the ESPN and Disney commitment to excellence, ensuring
that athletes and their families have the best possible experience," said George
Bodenheimer, president, ESPN, Inc. and ABC Sports and co-chairman, Disney Media
Networks. "It is our hope that, win or lose, every athlete who competes at the
complex will walk away with lifelong memories." 

The re-imagining of ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex is the latest initiative
in the growing sports business at Walt Disney World Resort. In late 2007, the
sports complex added additional outdoor playing fields for football, soccer,
lacrosse and field hockey competitions. And in 2008, the sports complex opened
Jostens Center, a state-of-the-art fieldhouse that allows Disney to accommodate
twice as many indoor sports events each year. Additional expansion plans are in
development, including a planned 100-lane bowling facility. 

Disney Sports annually stages more than 300 events and has accommodated
approximately 60 different sports involving athletes from more than 70
countries. Among those events are Atlanta Braves spring training, Chelsea
Football Club events, the Pop Warner Super Bowl, AAU National Championships,
Varsity Cheer events, the World Cheerleading Championships, the ESPN RISE Games,
USSSA events and the Walt Disney World Marathon, one of the top marathons in the
nation. ESPN televises dozens of sporting events from the complex, and Walt
Disney World Resort and ESPN also annually work together to host the popular
ESPN The Weekend presented by Dick`s Sporting Goods event at Disney`s Hollywood
Studios and the complex.

&lt;p&gt; * Overall reserves up 1 pct at 11.3 bln barrels&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Reserves content confirms move toward more natural gas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Feb 25 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said
on Thursday its overall oil and gas reserves grew 1 percent in
2009, with growth in its consolidated operations offsetting a
decline for its affiliates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second-largest U.S. oil and gas company said in a
regulatory filing that its consolidated companies saw net
proved reserves grow 5 percent to 8.3 billion barrels of oil
equivalent, while affiliates reported an 8 percent decline to
just over 3 billion barrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The filing also showed a continuation of the trend of more
natural gas production for Chevron, with liquid reserves
falling to 62 percent of overall reserves from 66 percent a
year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Larger rival Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) added 2 billion
barrels of oil equivalent to its proved reserves in 2009, or
133 percent of production for the year. [ID:nN16128784]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among Chevron's big projects, the company said it would
make final investment decisions on two projects in the Gulf of
Mexico, Jack/St Malo and the second phase of Tahiti, later this
year, with Jack/St Malo's start-up expected in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First oil is expected from another Gulf of Mexico project,
Perdido, in the first half of 2010, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Africa, the Moho-Bilondo deepwater development in Congo
will hit maximum production of 90,000 BOE per day in the third
quarter, while the Lucapa project in Angola will enter
front-end engineering and design in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also put an $8.4 billion price tag on Nigeria's
Usan deepwater development, a project in which Chevron owns 30
percent that is due to start up in 2012 and produce as much as
180,000 barrels per day within a year.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Smucker Beats, Raises Guidance

The J.M. Smucker Company (NYSE: SJM) reported results for the third quarter of
2010 with earnings of $1.17 per share. Earnings were well above the Zacks
Consensus Estimate of 90 cents per share and were up 34.5% year-over-year. 

Gross margin for the quarter expanded 409 basis points (bps) to 38.0% versus
34.0% in the prior-year quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to
Folgers. Moreover, the impact of lower green coffee raw material costs, freight
costs and the extra five days of business also had a favorable impact on the
gross margin. 

The operating margin for the quarter expanded 593 bps to 17.4% from 11.5% in the
comparable prior-year quarter. 

Year-to-date, cash provided by operations was $508.7 million compared to $289.0
million in the prior-year period. The company has a debt-to-capitalization ratio
of 14.7%. 

Concurrent with the earnings release, management raised its guidance for fiscal
2010. Net sales growth is expected in the range of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion.
Annual earnings are now expected to be in the range of $4.02 to $4.07, compared
to earlier guidance of $3.95 to $4.05 per share. 

The company remains committed to its long-term strategic objectives of 6% annual
sales growth and greater than 8% earnings growth, excluding charges. 

Concerns Over Avandia Hurt GSK

GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK) recently issued a statement regarding the findings
of a Senate Committee on the company's diabetes drug Avandia. The company stated
that the conclusions drawn by the Committee on the safety of Avandia are based
on analyses that are not consistent with the scientific evidence supporting the
safety of the drug. 

According to the report issued by the Committee, Glaxo was aware of the
potential heart risk associated with the use of Avandia before this information
became known to the public. The Committee has also recommended that Avandia
should be withdrawn from the market. 

Avandia is a thiazolidinedione anti-diabetic agent indicated as an adjunct to
diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type II diabetes.
The product first came under fire in 2007 when the New England Journal of
Medicine published an analysis of studies conducted with people who had taken
Avandia. 

According to the analysis, a higher risk of heart attack was observed in
patients taking Avandia compared to patients taking other diabetes drugs or no
diabetes medication. Avandia's label was revised to include a warning regarding
the potential cardiovascular risk. 

Following the emergence of safety concerns related to the use of Avandia,
Avandia/Avandamet franchise sales plunged to $1.5 billion in 2008 from $2.4
billion in 2007. 

Washington Post Earnings Jump

The Washinton Post Company (NYSE: WPO) recently reported fourth-quarter 2009
results. Quarterly earnings jumped to $8.71 per share from $2.01 reported in the
prior-year quarter. 

However, excluding one-time items, quarterly earnings fell 16% to $8.82 per
share from $10.54 posted in the year-ago quarter. While times are tough, the
company`s diversified business mix is faring better than many of its publishing
house competitors. 

Revenue for the quarter rose by 6% year-on-year to $1,238.4 million, driven by
revenue growth at the Education and Cable Television divisions, offset by
revenue declines at the Newspaper, Magazine and Television Broadcasting
divisions. 

The Education division delivered strong performance -- revenue was up 16% to
$709.3 million, which we think will continue in fiscal 2010. At fiscal year-end
2009, enrollment totaled 104,900, up 32%. The increase in enrollment was
particularly strong at Kaplan University`s online offerings, which surged 47% in
the year. 

The Cable division is also performing well -- revenue was up 4% to $190.6
million, driven by sustained growth in cable modem and telephone revenue, and
rate increase in June 2009. 

UTX Raises $2.25 Billion in Debt

United Technologies Corp (NYSE: UTX) sold $2.25 billion in debt in a two-part
sale. This includes $1.25 billion of 10-year notes priced to yield 87 basis
points over comparable U.S. Treasuries and $1.0 billion of 30-year bonds priced
to yield 109 basis points more than U.S. Treasuries. 

The notes of each series will bear interest at the applicable rate and will
accrue interest from the most recent date till which interest has been paid or
duly provided for. Interest will be payable on the notes semiannually in arrears
on April 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing on October 1, 2010. 

The notes of each series will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option
of the company at any time, at a redemption price in U.S. dollars equal to the
greater of the following:

* 100% of the principal amount of the applicable series of notes to be redeemed;
or 
* The sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal
and interest on the applicable series of notes to be redeemed, discounted to the
redemption date on a semiannual basis, assuming a 360-day year consisting of
twelve 30-day months.

The redemption price will also include interest accrued till the date of
redemption on the principal balance of the notes being redeemed. 

These net proceeds will be used primarily to fund the acquisition from General
Electric Company (NYSE: GE) of the GE Security business for a purchase price of
approximately $1.8 billion pursuant to an agreement it entered into in November
2009 with General Electric. 

Subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, the closing is
anticipated to take place late in the first quarter or early in the second
quarter of 2010. GE Security, part of GE Technology Infrastructure, supplies
security and fire safety technologies for commercial and residential
applications through a broad product portfolio that includes fire detection and
life safety systems, intrusion alarms, video surveillance and access control
systems.

 (Updates with Lehman statement, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/BANGALORE Feb 25 (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK agreed with JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are probing how Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs (GS.N) helped debt-stricken Greece arrange derivatives deals that critics say were used to disguise the size of its budget deficits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are looking into a number of questions related to Goldman Sachs and other companies in their derivatives arrangements with Greece," Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told a Senate committee on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also is "interested" in Wall Street's activities in helping Greece do derivatives deals, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. central bank, which regulates bank holding companies such as Goldman Sachs, is still in a fact-finding mode, checking Wall Street firms that have the sophistication to handle derivatives deals like the one with Greece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it was discovered bank supervisory rules were violated, the offending bank could be called upon to put in place a corrective plan or potentially face a more-formal enforcement action, up to and including fines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revelations that Greece's deficit was three times bigger than originally forecast plunged the country into a debt crisis. The European Union has voiced support for a plan by Greece to tighten its purse strings, but has not pledged aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernanke's comments coincided with a warning from ratings agencies that they might downgrade Greece's sovereign debt, which refocused attention on the weak fiscal health of some euro-zone countries and weighed on global stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously, using these instruments in a way that potentially destabilizes a company or a country is counterproductive," Bernanke said, as he began a second day of testimony on the state of the U.S. economy. "We'll certainly be evaluating what we learn from the activities of the holding companies that we supervise here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMPLIFYING PUBLIC CRISIS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernanke was responding to a question from Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, who wondered whether Greece was a case in which major financial institutions were "amplifying a public crisis purely for private gain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about Bernanke's comments, Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally said, "As a matter of policy, we don't comment on legal or regulatory matters."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Managing Director Gerald Corrigan told British lawmakers on Monday there was nothing inappropriate in the deals his firm arranged, although he agreed there could have been more transparency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC would not confirm or deny it was investigating Goldman's role in helping Greece, but indicated it had concerns about the potential impacts of derivatives deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As an agency, we have been examining potential abuses and destabilizing effects related to the use of credit default swaps and other opaque financial products and practices," SEC spokesman John Nester said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernanke did not specify whether regulators were simply trying to learn more to restrict future similar deals, of if they were concerned fraud or disclosure violations may have occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Greek crisis has pressured the euro and Greece's EU partners fear it may spread to weaker euro-zone economies like Portugal and Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cross-currency derivatives that Goldman Sachs conducted for Greece in 2001 helped reduce the size of its debt at a time when the country was keen to meet criteria for entering the EU and adopting the euro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Pedro Nicolaci da Costa; Editing by Andrea Ricci)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kristin Peck to Succeed Ringo
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. today announced that William Ringo will retire from the company. Mr.
Ringo made many important contributions to advance the company`s innovative
business development activities. 

"Bill has accomplished a great deal in positioning Pfizer for future success,"
said Jeff Kindler, chairman and chief executive officer, Pfizer. "He has helped
diversify Pfizer`s portfolio through our acquisition of Wyeth; worked to create
a new world-leading, specialist HIV company, called ViiV Healthcare, through our
joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline; and played a leadership role in securing
rights to novel, promising compounds." 

"He also connected the company more closely with the expanding opportunities in
biotechnology," Mr. Kindler said. "I know I join all Pfizer colleagues in
thanking Bill for his tireless efforts and wishing him and his family all the
best as he embarks on the next stage of his life." 

Mr. Ringo joined Pfizer in April 2008, after retiring from Eli Lilly &amp; Company,
where over his 28-year tenure he held a number of senior positions. Between
working for Lilly and Pfizer he served in leadership roles for both venture
capital and biotechnology companies. 

"It has been a real pleasure to be part of Pfizer's Executive Leadership Team,"
Mr. Ringo said. "Based on my four decades of experience in the industry, I truly
believe the future for Pfizer is extremely bright, as our colleagues provide
quality medicines to patients around the world," he added. 

Mr. Ringo, whose retirement will be effective April 30, 2010, will help his
successor during a transition period. 

Kristin Peck, who will succeed Mr. Ringo, has been named Senior Vice President
of Worldwide Business Development, Strategy and Innovation. Most recently, she
played a leadership role in the integration of Wyeth`s global operations, while
serving as Senior Vice President of Worldwide Strategy and Innovation. 

Working closely with the business leadership, Ms. Peck will assume
responsibility for business development activities, ensuring their alignment
with Pfizer`s strategic objectives. She will report directly to Mr. Kindler and
join Pfizer`s Executive Leadership Team. 

"Kristin has already been playing a leadership role in strategic planning for
the company. Her knowledge, expertise and energy make her an excellent choice
for this leadership position," Mr. Kindler said. "Kristin will work closely with
me and other Pfizer executives to advance our business development goals
effectively and with an efficient use of our owners` capital." 

Ms. Peck joined Pfizer in 2004 in the company`s strategic planning organization.
Prior to Pfizer, she was a principal with the Boston Consulting Group, focusing
on strategy and merger-related issues in the pharmaceutical and financial
services industries, and worked in real estate financial services and private
equity at Prudential and The O`Connor Group. 

Ms. Peck earned her bachelor`s degree from Georgetown University and her M.B.A.
from Columbia Business School.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Disney's Pixar Animation Studios head into the next week's Oscars with the only movie ever nominated for both best film and best animated film, "Up," about an old man and boy on an adventure in a faraway land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its release last spring, "Up" has sold more than $725 million worth of tickets worldwide. It follows a string of successes that include "The Incredibles" and "Cars."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney/Pixar chief creative officer John Lasseter, a major star in the world of animation, spoke to Reuters about "Up" and the company's moviemaking philosophy, including another Disney Oscar hopeful, "The Princess and the Frog."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: Any film with the Pixar stamp seems to spell success. Do you ever worry that a film may stumble?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: "Probably more than any other movie we've made here at Pixar, "Up" was the one we were the most nervous about ... Our audience is so important to us. Every single day, the question that is foremost in my mind is: 'Are we holding our audience?' We think our audience is very smart, especially kids. But when someone describes "Up" to you, it doesn't seem like a movie kids would like. It's about a 78-year-old guy!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: What kept you going with it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: "When (writer/co-director) Bob Peterson read me the treatment, with that opening sequence (in which a boy and girl grow up, get married and live life), I had tears in my eyes. It was so moving. That was the core of the story, so we held on to that and said, 'We have potential here; stay focused on that.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: A lot of people are saying this year's animated Oscar nominees -- including Disney's "The Princess and the Frog" are the best ever. Describe the state of animation in Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: "There were 20 animated films released in 2009, which is a record. But more than that, it was the quality of the films and the wide variety. There were computer animated, hand drawn animated and stop motion animated films like "Coraline" and "The Fantastic Mr. Fox." It was a spectacular year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: Four years ago, Disney bought Pixar and made you chief creative officer of the animation unit. What's changed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: "The very first thing I wanted to do was hand-drawn animation again. So we hired (animation team) John Musker and Ron Clements back to the studio. They had been let go because Disney stopped doing hand-drawn animation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: The result was "The Princess and the Frog," which gave birth to Disney's first black princess and earned three Oscar nominations including best animated feature. With all the computer technology in films today, why go back to hand drawn?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: "I love the medium. It was where I got my training. Never in the history of cinema has a medium entertained an audience. It's what you do with the medium. But for some reason, hand-drawn animation became the scapegoat for bad storytelling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: Why do you think that was?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: "Toy Story" was the first computer animated feature ever, so I think others kept looking at the success we had and thought it must be because of the computer animation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: But you say it's not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: "If you're sitting in your minivan, playing your computer animated films for your children in the back seat, is it the animation that's entertaining you as you drive and listen? No, it's the storytelling. That's why we put so much importance on story. No amount of great animation will save a bad story."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: Clearly it works. "Toy Story," "Finding Nemo," "The Incredibles," "Ratatouille" "Wall-E" and now "Up" have all earned best screenplay Oscar nominations. What's the secret?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: "I believe in research. Each movie at Pixar involves research with college professors or taking trips to learn as much as we can about a particular subject matter...I have met a lot of top chefs around the world during my travels. Each one of them has said "Ratatouille" is their favorite movie and the only movie that truly captures what they do. Auto Week called "Cars" the best car movie because the details were spot on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: Pixar's 11th film is "Toy Story 3," due out June 18th. What can you say about this third installment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: "In "Toy Story 2," Barbie appeared. In "Toy Story 3" she meets Ken, who makes his film debut. He is voiced by Michael Keaton and it's one of the funniest things you have ever seen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Bob Tourtellotte and Patricia Reaney)&lt;/p&gt;

RBS Sempra should boost the bank's trading efforts, Staley
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan has not historically been sufficiently committed

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are looking into how Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs (GS.N) helped debt-stricken Greece arrange derivatives deals that critics say were used to disguise the size of its budget deficits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke made the disclosure on Thursday and suggested securities regulators also wanted the information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are looking into a number of questions related to Goldman Sachs and other companies in their derivatives arrangements with Greece," Bernanke said in response to a question from U.S. Senate banking Committee Chairman Sen. Christopher Dodd before testifying to the group for a second day on the state of the U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernanke said the Securities and Exchange Commission similarly was "interested" in Wall Street's activities in helping Greece do derivatives deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stopped short of saying an official inquiry of Goldman Sachs' activities was under way by either the Fed or SEC. The SEC had no immediate comment when contacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously, using these instruments in a way that potentially destabilizes a company or a country is counterproductive," Bernanke said. "We'll certainly be evaluating what we learn from the activities of the holding companies that we supervise here in the U.S."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally said, "As a matter of policy, we don't comment on legal or regulatory matters."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FED HAS STRONGER HAND NOW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the midst of the severe financial crisis that swept the U.S. economy from 2007 to 2009, Goldman and other Wall Street firms converted to bank holding companies, putting supervision of them more firmly in the Fed's hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has come under scrutiny for deals it did with Greece before it staggered into a debt crisis that has raised fears of a sovereign debt default and forced the European Union to say it will help if necessary to avert one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Greek crisis has pressured the euro and EU partners fear it may spread to weaker euro zone economies like Portugal and Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs entered into currency swaps with Greece, which critics say helped it disguise its debt, and has defended them as neither uncommon at the time nor inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cross-currency derivatives that Goldman Sachs conducted for Greece in 2001 helped reduce the size of its debt at a time when the country was keen to meet criteria for entering the EU and adopting the euro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has a particularly high profile in Washington, having produced numerous alumni including former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, many of whom still play active roles in key agencies like Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also has attracted a heavy share of public anger over gold-plated banker pay packages, not helped by comments such as chief executive Lloyd Blankfein's assertion last November that the bank was doing "God's work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bulk of Bernanke's testimony was a repeat of remarks he made on Wednesday when he told the U.S. House of Representatives that a weak U.S. job market means interest rates must stay low for a long time to try to spur activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key uncertainty is whether the economy can grow fast enough in future to bring unemployment down at an acceptable rate, Bernanke said, a particularly poignant remark in view of a Labor Department report on Thursday that showed unemployment insurance benefit claims rising for a second straight week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FINANCIAL SERVICES TOO BIG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Senate working toward a bill on financial regulatory reform, expected to be unveiled by Dodd early next week, Bernanke said in response to questions that he hoped it would lead to a downsizing in the importance of the financial services sector, which he said has become too big.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He appeared to pour cold water on the idea of a "Volcker rule" that would ban banks from engaging in so-called proprietary trading -- using government-guaranteed capital to make bets for their own account -- as the Obama administration had advocated but Congress seemed to be moving away from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We all agree that we don't want excessive risk-taking, particularly not on a 'tails I win, heads you lose basis,' certainly, "Bernanke said, but added there could be "unintended consequences" from such a rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has said that banking regulators should get more powers to monitor and stop some bank trading activities if they deem it necessary to protect financial stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key theme that Bernanke turned to repeatedly during a question-and-answer session was the need for lawmakers to come to agreement on measures for shrinking soaring U.S. budget deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans are reluctant to raise taxes and Democrats have measures before Congress, including healthcare reform, that would at least initially raise deficits, leaving the two sides stalemated on a wide range of fiscal issues and making progress on deficit reduction next to impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It could become a problem tomorrow if bond markets are not persuaded that Congress is serious about bringing down the deficit over time," Bernanke warned. Big deficits can erode confidence in a country's ability to repay debt, in turn driving the value of currency down and push inflation up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Andrew Hay)&lt;/p&gt;

U.S. economy from 2007 to 2009, Goldman and other Wall Street
firms converted to bank holding companies, putting supervision
of them more firmly in the Fed's hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs has come under scrutiny for deals it did with

to say it will help if necessary to avert one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Greek crisis has pressured the euro and EU partners
fear it may spread to weaker euro zone economies like Portugal

which critics say helped it disguise its debt, and has defended

Greece in 2001 helped reduce the size of its debt at a time
when the country was keen to meet criteria for entering the EU
and adopting the euro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs has a particularly high profile in
Washington, having produced numerous alumni including former
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, many of whom still play
active roles in key agencies like Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also has attracted a heavy share of public anger over
gold-plated banker pay packages, not helped by comments such as
chief executive Lloyd Blankfein's assertion last November that
the bank was doing "God's work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bulk of Bernanke's testimony was a repeat of remarks he
made on Wednesday when he told the U.S. House of

enough in future to bring unemployment down at an acceptable
rate, Bernanke said, a particularly poignant remark in view of
a Labor Department report on Thursday that showed unemployment
insurance benefit claims rising for a second straight week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FINANCIAL SERVICES TOO BIG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the Senate working toward a bill on financial
regulatory reform, expected to be unveiled by Dodd early next
week, Bernanke said in response to questions that he hoped it
would lead to a downsizing in the importance of the financial
services sector, which he said has become too big.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He appeared to pour cold water on the idea of a "Volcker
rule" that would ban banks from engaging in so-called
proprietary trading -- using government-guaranteed capital to
make bets for their own account -- as the Obama administration
had advocated but Congress seemed to be moving away from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We all agree that we don't want excessive risk-taking,
particularly not on a 'tails I win, heads you lose basis,'
certainly, "Bernanke said, but added there could be "unintended
consequences" from such a rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has said that banking regulators should get more powers
to monitor and stop some bank trading activities if they deem
it necessary to protect financial stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One key theme that Bernanke turned to repeatedly during a

&lt;p&gt;With the help of a U.S. federal judge, Microsoft has struck a blow against one of the Internet's worst sources of spam: the notorious Waledac botnet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said late Wednesday that it had been granted a court order that will cut off 277 .com domains associated with the botnet. This will effectively knock the brains of Waledac off the Internet, by removing the command-and-control servers that criminals use to send commands to hundreds of thousands of infected machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thought to be used by Eastern European spammers, Waledac has been a major source of computer infections and spam over the past year. Microsoft believes the botnet can send over 1.5 billion spam messages daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a lawsuit against the unknown spammers behind Waledac, filed Monday with the  U.S. District Court of Eastern Virginia, Microsoft argues that Verisign, which manages the .com domain, is a choke-point for the botnet. The court has apparently ordered Verisign to remove the botnet's command-and-control domains from the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This action has quickly and effectively cut off traffic to Waledac at the '.com' or domain registry level, severing the connection between the command and control centers of the botnet and most of its thousands of zombie computers around the world," Microsoft said in its blog post announcing the effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft designed its lawsuit so the court order would sever the control ties to the botnet before its controller had time to react. "That unplugging of the Internet connection had to be done without him knowing," said Richard Boscovich, a senior attorney at Microsoft's digital crimes unit, in a video on the blog post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the affected domains already appeared to be gone after Microsoft's announcement, but others still appeared to be up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verisign could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Waledac uses peer-to-peer techniques to control hacked boxes as well, Microsoft has more work to do, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a busy night tonight and tomorrow is probably going to be a busy day as well," said Jeff Williams, director of Microsoft's Malware Protection Center in an e-mail interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams didn't provide details on what Microsoft was doing to further attack Waledac, but in its blog posting the company said it is "taking additional technical countermeasures to downgrade much of the remaining peer-to-peer command and control communication within the botnet." Microsoft expects to "continue to work with the security community to mitigate and respond to this botnet," the post states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known internally as Operation b49, Microsoft's takedown operation "was the result of months of investigation and the innovative application of a tried and true legal strategy," Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft tried to strike a blow against Waledac last April, by adding detection for the infection to its Malicious Software Removal tool. But that didn't stop the botnet, and spam levels have remained high. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They didn't kill it," said Paul Ferguson , a researcher with Trend Micro, via instant message. "I've been getting a boat-load of Waledac spam lately."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of the domains ordered cut off are listed as having owners with contact details in China. The domains were registered with a small number of Chinese domain registrars, according to the Microsoft complaint, including one that was recently ordered by China's domain name overseer to improve its verification of customer information used to register domains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Owen Fletcher in Beijing contributed to this story.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As promised, Microsoft has started offering Windows 7 users an update to the company's anti-piracy software via Windows Update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The update to Windows Activation Technologies (WAT), the anti-counterfeit program formerly known as Windows Genuine Advantage (WGA), has been slammed by critics, including the Internet advocate who blasted Microsoft in 2006 over the daily "phone home" habits of WGA running on Windows XP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Lauren Weinstein, the co-founder of People For Internet Responsibility (PFIR), urged Windows 7 users to block the optional update , calling the revamped WAT unacceptable because it will examine consumers' Windows 7 PCs every 90 days to make sure they're running legitimate copies of the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Microsoft announced the WAT update on Feb. 11, it said the revision was necessary to detect more than 70 "activation exploits," Microsoft's term for what others call "cracks" that sidestep the product activation process or use stolen keys to illegally activate counterfeit copies of Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, Microsoft also revealed that the updated WAT would periodically "phone home" to Microsoft's servers to re-validate the copy of Windows 7 as legitimate, as well as use those opportunities to update activation signatures to detect newer cracks. Initially, said Joe Williams, the general manager of Microsoft's activation group, WAT is set to connect to Microsoft's severs every 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The repeated validation is new to Windows with the now-available update, Williams confirmed in an interview the next day. Neither Windows XP or Vista had reevaluated already-activated Windows PCs on a regular schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 7 users who have Windows Update set to automatically download and install all updates will receive the WAT update -- tagged as KB971033 -- without taking any action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To block the update, which is marked "Important," users must set Automatic Updates so that they are only notified of pending updates, or set so that they must explicitly approve to install those updates that have already been downloaded to the PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with any Windows update, KB971033 is tersely marked, showing just the cryptic "Update for Windows 7 (KB971033)" in Windows Update. Only when customers select the update does a more detailed description appear at the right. Even then, the short description doesn't note the repetitive validation feature that Weinstein called "entirely unacceptable" earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users whose PCs have already downloaded and installed the WAT update can uninstall it from the Control Panel. The uninstall option is also new for Microsoft's anti-piracy software; in the past, once installed, WGA updates could not be removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

&lt;p&gt;  WASHINGTON, DC, Feb 25 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) today recognized the
StartUpVisa Act of 2010, introduced by Senators John Kerry (D-MA) and
Richard Lugar (R-IN), as a critical piece of legislation that will foster
job creation and economic growth in America. The proposal will grant
immigrant entrepreneurs a two year visa if they have the support of a
qualified U.S. investor for their startup venture. The NVCA has supported
highly skilled immigration reform for decades and asserts that this
legislation addresses a new economic reality.

    "We applaud Senators Kerry and Lugar for recognizing the importance of
foreign-born entrepreneurs to U.S. economic growth," said Mark Heesen,
president of NVCA. "These individuals want to build their companies in
the United States, but many have been discouraged in the past by
difficult immigration laws. Today entrepreneurs can build their companies
and create jobs anywhere. This bill sends the right signal that we want
them here."

    According to American Made: The Impact of Immigrant Entrepreneurs and
Professionals on U.S. Competitiveness, a 2006 study commissioned by the
NVCA, 25 percent of U.S. public companies that were venture-backed were
founded by immigrants. These companies include Intel, Sun Microsystems,
eBay, Yahoo! and Google. Further, it is estimated that close to 50
percent of current venture-backed companies were founded by immigrant
entrepreneurs.

    "Venture-backed companies employ millions of Americans and many of them
would not be here today were it not for the immigrant entrepreneur who
founded them," continued Heesen. "This bill will help to ensure that the
best and brightest innovate and grow their companies in the United
States. We wholeheartedly support this bill and look forward to working
with Senators Kerry and Lugar to move this important legislation forward."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Feb 25 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service on
Thursday cut its ratings on some of Goldman Sachs Group's
(GS.N) hybrid and subordinated debt, citing declining
government support for debt securities of systemically
important institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Prior to the global financial crisis, Moody's had
incorporated into its ratings an assumption that support
provided by national governments and central banks to shore up
a troubled bank would, to some extent, benefit the subordinated
debt holders as well as the senior creditors," Moody's said in
a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The systemic support for these instruments has not been
forthcoming in many cases," the rating agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moody's cut its ratings on Goldman's junior subordinated
debt with cumulative deferral features one notch to A3, the
seventh highest investment grade, from A2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also downgraded Goldman's cumulative preferred
securities one step to Baa1, the eighth-highest investment
grade and cut the bank's noncumulative preferred securities two
notches to Baa2, the ninth-highest investment grade, or two
steps above junk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rating action affects approximately $13 billion in
debt. Moody's rates Goldman's issuer rating A1, the
fifth-highest investment grade, and has a negative outlook on
the company, indicating a rating downgrade may be more likely
over the coming 12 to 18 months.

business development teams are aggressively working on POS and Data
Capture channel opportunities for the N37B in supply chain management,
retail, government, military, law enforcement, telecom, industrial
process and control, and automotive markets," said Newport Digital's CEO,
Michael Lutton. "The N37B launch has been the initial major initiative
for NDT. This product line reflects the company's ability to bring
cutting edge technology to market in a cost effective manner and is now
available to our AT and Ingram Micro sales channels. We anticipate this
unique, RFID enabled computing device to generate significant revenue for
NDT in calendar years 2010 &amp; 2011."
 
 "The 3G option will enable this
handheld computing devise to have data connectivity anywhere AT's
nationwide 3G service is available, making for a 'connect anywhere'
scenario for RFID business applications," commented Richard Tanimoto,
NDTs Senior Managing Director. "The GPS option will allow for the N37B to
not only collect RFID data from item level inventory but to pinpoint and
report the location of the inventory scanned by the RFID reader. This
greatly enhances and expands the applications that can be offered from
NPDTs relationships with Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), Independent
Hardware Vendors (IHV) such as Socket Mobile and Middleware Software
Vendors (MSV) such as Shovon and Workbridge to enhance the N37B
application offerings."

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Feb 25 (Reuters Life!) - Disney's Pixar
Animation Studios head into the next week's Oscars with the
only movie ever nominated for both best film and best animated
film, "Up," about an old man and boy on an adventure in a
faraway land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Since its release last spring, "Up" has sold more than $725
million worth of tickets worldwide. It follows a string of
successes that include "The Incredibles" and "Cars."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney/Pixar chief creative officer John Lasseter, a major
star in the world of animation, spoke to Reuters about "Up" and
the company's moviemaking philosophy, including another Disney
Oscar hopeful, "The Princess and the Frog."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q: Any film with the Pixar stamp seems to spell success. Do
you ever worry that a film may stumble?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A: "Probably more than any other movie we've made here at
Pixar, "Up" was the one we were the most nervous about ... Our
audience is so important to us. Every single day, the question
that is foremost in my mind is: 'Are we holding our audience?'
We think our audience is very smart, especially kids. But when
someone describes "Up" to you, it doesn't seem like a movie
kids would like. It's about a 78-year-old guy!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q: What kept you going with it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A: "When (writer/co-director) Bob Peterson read me the
treatment, with that opening sequence (in which a boy and girl
grow up, get married and live life), I had tears in my eyes. It
was so moving. That was the core of the story, so we held on to
that and said, 'We have potential here; stay focused on that.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q: A lot of people are saying this year's animated Oscar
nominees -- including Disney's "The Princess and the Frog" are
the best ever. Describe the state of animation in Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A: "There were 20 animated films released in 2009, which is
a record. But more than that, it was the quality of the films
and the wide variety. There were computer animated, hand drawn
animated and stop motion animated films like "Coraline" and
"The Fantastic Mr. Fox." It was a spectacular year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q: Four years ago, Disney bought Pixar and made you chief
creative officer of the animation unit. What's changed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A: "The very first thing I wanted to do was hand-drawn
animation again. So we hired (animation team) John Musker and
Ron Clements back to the studio. They had been let go because
Disney stopped doing hand-drawn animation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q: The result was "The Princess and the Frog," which gave
birth to Disney's first black princess and earned three Oscar
nominations including best animated feature. With all the
computer technology in films today, why go back to hand drawn?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A: "I love the medium. It was where I got my training.
Never in the history of cinema has a medium entertained an
audience. It's what you do with the medium. But for some
reason, hand-drawn animation became the scapegoat for bad
storytelling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q: Why do you think that was?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A: "Toy Story" was the first computer animated feature
ever, so I think others kept looking at the success we had and
thought it must be because of the computer animation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q: But you say it's not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A: "If you're sitting in your minivan, playing your
computer animated films for your children in the back seat, is
it the animation that's entertaining you as you drive and
listen? No, it's the storytelling. That's why we put so much
importance on story. No amount of great animation will save a
bad story."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q: Clearly it works. "Toy Story," "Finding Nemo," "The
Incredibles," "Ratatouille" "Wall-E" and now "Up" have all
earned best screenplay Oscar nominations. What's the secret?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A: "I believe in research. Each movie at Pixar involves
research with college professors or taking trips to learn as
much as we can about a particular subject matter...I have met a
lot of top chefs around the world during my travels. Each one
of them has said "Ratatouille" is their favorite movie and the
only movie that truly captures what they do. Auto Week called
"Cars" the best car movie because the details were spot on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q: Pixar's 11th film is "Toy Story 3," due out June 18th.
What can you say about this third installment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A: "In "Toy Story 2," Barbie appeared. In "Toy Story 3" she
meets Ken, who makes his film debut. He is voiced by Michael
Keaton and it's one of the funniest things you have ever
seen."

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Feb 25 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Riverbed Technology (NASDAQ: RVBD), the IT infrastructure performance
company for networks, applications and storage, today announced that AKI
Portugal, a leading DIY (do-it-yourself) retailer, has installed 27
Riverbed(R) Steelhead(R) appliances in its data center, warehouse and
retail outlets across Portugal. With Riverbed deployed, AKI employees can
now process orders in a matter of seconds rather than minutes, resulting
in improved business and employee productivity. In addition, AKI Portugal
was able to avoid an expensive bandwidth upgrade, resulting in savings of
approximately EUR 58,000 ($79,000) per year.

    AKI Portugal is part of the French group Adeo, which operates 60 retail
outlets across Spain and Portugal. AKI Portugal was the first major DIY
retailer in Portugal, with 25 stores across the country, and now supplies
over 25,000 products for home and garden improvements.

    AKI Portugal relies upon Microsoft SharePoint for file sharing and order
processing, with employees accessing documents via the company intranet.
Retail staff in the stores was struggling to process orders in a timely
fashion due to the delays encountered when accessing the intranet, and
then waiting for documents to download. Large numbers of orders are
transferred between the stores and head office every day, and these
delays were seriously impacting both employee and business performance.
To make matters worse, employees resorted to sending orders over email.
This workaround not only increased the amount of data traversing the WAN,
but also introduced the possibility of mistakes occurring when orders
were not processed correctly.

    "We needed to improve application performance over the WAN and considered
upgrading our bandwidth link from 2Mbps to 4Mpbs," explains Ruben 
Salgueiro, IT director at AKI Portugal, who knew that upgrading bandwidth
would not have completely resolved the issue due to file latency
associated with Windows file sharing applications. "This would have
increased our costs by almost EUR 58,000 per year, which was unacceptable
to us. As a retail outlet working on tight margins, any increase in cost
that delivers minimal benefits is not an option."

    Salgueiro decided to evaluate WAN optimization offerings from Riverbed and
Cisco by running a small pilot between the company headquarters and two
stores. "We needed a solution that would be quick and easy to install
because we wanted minimal disruption to the company's operations," says
Salgueiro. "The Riverbed solution was just impressive. Not only was it
easier to install, but it provided the IT team with access to bandwidth
utilization and data reduction statistics. A clear winner all around."

    With the Steelhead appliances installed, the company has reduced bandwidth
utilization by more than 50 percent. Employees can now access and process
orders via SharePoint in seconds rather than minutes, resulting in secure
order procedures and improved business productivity. Salgueiro's team has
also seen an immediate benefit. As he explains, "Before using Riverbed,
the retail staff constantly complained about the time taken to process
orders. Now those complaints are rare and my team can concentrate on
other projects. Overall the business has benefited in a number of ways,
thanks to Riverbed."

&lt;p&gt;With the help of a U.S. federal judge, Microsoft has struck a blow against one of the Internet's worst sources of spam: the notorious Waledac botnet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said late Wednesday that it had been granted a court order that will cut off 277 .com domains associated with the botnet. This will effectively knock the brains of Waledac off the Internet, by removing the command-and-control servers that criminals use to send commands to hundreds of thousands of infected machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thought to be used by Eastern European spammers, Waledac has been a major source of computer infections and spam over the past year. Microsoft believes the botnet can send over 1.5 billion [b] spam messages daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a lawsuit against the unknown spammers behind Waledac, filed Monday with the  U.S. District Court of Eastern Virginia, Microsoft argues that Verisign, which manages the .com domain, is a choke-point for the botnet. The court has apparently ordered Verisign to remove the botnet's command-and-control domains from the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This action has quickly and effectively cut off traffic to Waledac at the '.com' or domain registry level, severing the connection between the command and control centers of the botnet and most of its thousands of zombie computers around the world," Microsoft said in its blog post announcing the effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verisign could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Waledac uses peer-to-peer techniques to control hacked boxes as well, Microsoft has more work to do, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a busy night tonight and tomorrow is probably going to be a busy day as well," said Jeff Williams, director of Microsoft's Malware Protection Center in an e-mail interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams didn't provide details on what Microsoft was doing to further attack Waledac, but in its blog posting the company said it is "taking additional technical countermeasures to downgrade much of the remaining peer-to-peer command and control communication within the botnet." Microsoft expects to "continue to work with the security community to mitigate and respond to this botnet," the post states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known internally as Operation b49, Microsoft's takedown operation "was the result of months of investigation and the innovative application of a tried and true legal strategy," Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft tried to strike a blow against Waledac last April, by adding detection for the infection to its Malicious Software Removal tool. But that didn't stop the botnet, and spam levels have remained high. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They didn't kill it," said Paul Ferguson , a researcher with Trend Micro, via instant message. "I've been getting a boat-load of Waledac spam lately."&lt;/p&gt;

The Coca-Cola Company to Acquire CCE`s North American Bottling Business

CCE Has Agreed in Principle to Buy The Coca-Cola Company`s Bottling Operations
in Norway and Sweden, and to Obtain the Right to Acquire the German Bottler
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) and Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (NYSE: CCE):

* Advancement fully aligns with the Coca-Cola system`s 2020 Vision and drives
long-term value for all shareowners
* Evolves The Coca-Cola Company`s North American business to more profitably
deliver the world`s greatest brands in the largest NARTD profit pool in the
world
* CCE shareowners will benefit from the improved financial growth profile and
expansion of the Western European business
* The Coca-Cola Company will generate immediate efficiencies with expected
operational synergies of $350 million over four years, and the transactions,
which are substantially cashless, are expected to be accretive to EPS on a fully
diluted basis by 2012
* CCE shareowners to exchange each CCE share for a share in a new CCE, focused
solely on Europe, and $10 per share in cash at closing

The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) and Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (NYSE: CCE)
announce that they have entered into agreements that will strategically advance
the Coca-Cola system in North America and drive long-term value for all
shareholders. In addition, the parties have an agreement in principle to expand
CCE`s European business. 

"Our 2020 Vision calls for decisive and timely action to continuously improve
and evolve our global franchise system to best serve our customers and consumers
everywhere. Consistent with the 2020 Vision, our roadmap for winning together,
we act today as an aligned system," said The Coca-Cola Company`s Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent. "We are not acquiring CCE, rather we are
acquiring their North American operations, and they remain one of our key
bottling partners with world-class management, financial and operational
capabilities. We have a strong and unrelenting belief in our unique and thriving
global bottling system. Our new North American structure will create an
unparalleled combination of businesses, which will serve as our passport to
winning in the world`s largest nonalcoholic ready-to-drink profit pool. This
transaction offers compelling value to both The Coca-Cola Company and CCE
shareowners and will create substantial and sustainable benefits for both
companies` stakeholders." 

Mr. Kent continued, "Our North American business structure has remained
essentially the same since CCE was founded in 1986, while the market and
industry have changed dramatically. With this transaction, we are converting
passive capital into active capital, giving us direct control over our
investment in North America to accelerate growth and drive long-term
profitability. We will work closely with our bottling partners to create an
evolved franchise system for the unique needs of the North American market.
Additionally, we will reconfigure our manufacturing, supply chain and logistics
operations to achieve cost reductions over time. Importantly, the creation of a
unified operating system will strategically position us to better market and
distribute North America`s most preferred nonalcoholic beverage brands. At the
same time, in Europe, we are further strengthening our franchise system to
provide broader, contiguous geographic coverage and optimizing our marketing and
distribution leadership." 

CCE`s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Brock said, "This transformation
creates significant near-term shareowner value through the sale of the North
American business for fair value, delivering over $4 billion in cash to CCE
shareowners, through cash distributions and planned share repurchases. At the
same time, this enables our shareowners to retain equity in a sales and
distribution company with an improved growth profile. In the future, CCE
shareowners will also benefit from the expansion of our European business and
our improved financial flexibility." 

Mr. Brock added, "CCE remains the preeminent Western European bottler and a key
strategic partner with The Coca-Cola Company. Our European business serves an
attractive market with growing volumes and profit driven by rising per capita
consumption. As such, CCE will have an improved profile with enhanced revenue,
margins and EPS growth prospects. Together with The Coca-Cola Company, we will
continue to improve the effectiveness of our operations in our expanded presence
in Europe. These actions strengthen our ability to compete effectively and
sustainably in Europe and represent the beginning of an exciting new era of
long-term growth for CCE`s business and shareowners." 

Mr. Kent concluded, "This is a truly historic day for the Coca-Cola system. As
the world`s leading beverage Company, we are very excited about the vast
opportunities before us and I can say with confidence there is no better
business to be in. Over the next several years, the nearly $650 billion dollar
global nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry is expected to grow faster
than worldwide GDP and we are best positioned to capitalize on this enormous
industry opportunity in North America and Europe. These joint actions further
reinforce our confidence in achieving our 2020 Vision to more than double system
revenue and double servings to over 3 billion per day. With our system more
aligned than ever, the timing is right, and we believe that these actions will
usher in a new era of winning for our Coca-Cola system." 

Details of the Transactions

The Coca-Cola Company, in a substantially cashless transaction, will acquire
CCE`s entire North American business, which consists of approximately 75 percent
of U.S. bottler-delivered volume and almost 100 percent of Canadian
bottler-delivered volume. At the close of the transaction, The Coca-Cola Company
will have direct control over approximately 90 percent of the total North
America volume, including its current direct businesses. The Coca-Cola Company`s
acquisition of the assets and liabilities of CCE`s North American business
includes consideration of The Coca-Cola Company`s current 34 percent equity
ownership in CCE, valued at $3.4 billion, based upon a thirty day trailing
average as of February 24, 2010. In addition, consideration includes the
assumption of $8.88 billion of CCE debt and all of the North American assets and
liabilities - including CCE`s accumulated benefit obligation for North America
of $580 million as of December 31, 2009, and certain other one-time costs and
benefits. 

In a concurrent agreement, The Coca-Cola Company and CCE have agreed in
principle that CCE will buy The Coca-Cola Company`s bottling operations in
Norway and Sweden for $822 million, subject to the signing of definitive
agreements, and that CCE will have the right to acquire The Coca-Cola Company`s
83 percent equity stake in its German bottling operations 18 to 36 months after
closing for fair value. 

A new entity, which will retain the name Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., will be
created through a split-off that will hold CCE`s European businesses. CCE`s
public shareowners will exchange each existing CCE share for a share in the new
entity and will hold 100 percent of this new entity. 

CCE will provide its shareowners, excluding The Coca-Cola Company, with a
special one-time cash payment of $10 per share. In connection with the
transactions, CCE expects to raise initial debt financing of up to 3.0x EBITDA
to pay shareowners $10 per share in cash at closing, to acquire the Norway and
Sweden bottlers and to fund the expected share repurchase program. Following
completion of the transaction, it is expected that CCE will adopt a program to
repurchase up to approximately $1 billion of shares and a policy of paying an
expected annual dividend of $0.50 per share subject to the discretion of CCE`s
Board of Directors and its consideration of various factors. 

The Coca-Cola Company and CCE expect the transactions to close in the fourth
quarter of 2010. 

About CCR-USA and CCRC

At the close, The Coca-Cola Company will rename the sales and operational
elements of the North American businesses Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc.
("CCR-USA") and Coca-Cola Refreshments Canada, Ltd. ("CCRC"), which will be
wholly-owned subsidiaries of The Coca-Cola Company. Following the close, The
Coca-Cola Company will combine the Foodservice business, The Minute Maid
Company, the Supply Chain organization, including finished product operations,
and our company-owned bottling operations in Philadelphia with CCE`s North
American business to form CCR-USA and CCRC. In the U.S., CCR-USA will be
organized as a unified operating entity with distinct capabilities to include
supply chain and logistics, sales and customer service operations. In Canada,
CCRC will be a single dedicated production, marketing, sales and distribution
organization. The Coca-Cola Company`s remaining North American operation will
continue to be responsible for brand marketing and franchise support. Details
regarding the structure, leadership and integration plans will be forthcoming. 

Once completed, the transactions are expected to generate operational synergies
of approximately $350 million over four years for The Coca-Cola Company and are
expected to be accretive to EPS on a fully diluted basis by 2012. Further, in
North America, this will generate system synergies that will increase the growth
rate and cash flow on a pro forma basis over time. Pro forma for this
acquisition, the North American business, including CCR-USA and CCRC, would have
generated approximately $19.2 billion in revenues and $3.6 billion of EBITDA in
2009. 

The Coca-Cola Company 2010 Outlook

As a result of these agreements, The Coca-Cola Company has not made any share
repurchases during the current fiscal year and will continue to be out of the
market until the close of these transactions. However, the Company remains
committed to repurchasing $1.5 billion in 2010. 

About new CCE

CCE will be The Coca-Cola Company's strategic bottling partner in Western Europe
and the third-largest independent bottler globally. Reflecting CCE`s position as
The Coca-Cola Company's strategic bottling partner in Western Europe, the
companies will enter into a 10+10 year bottling agreement and a 5-year incidence
pricing agreement. Pro forma, including the contributions of Norway and Sweden,
CCE would have generated approximately $7.3 billion in revenues, $850 million in
operating income, and $1.2 billion of EBITDA in 2009. 

At closing, before planned share repurchases, CCE expects to have net debt of
approximately $2 billion. Immediately after closing and before share repurchase,
CCE is expected to have approximately 350-360 million outstanding shares on a
fully diluted basis, substantially comparable to the publicly owned shares of
CCE today. 

Shortly after closing, the Board of CCE is expected to announce a planned share
repurchase program of approximately $1 billion and an initial annual dividend of
$0.50 per share. Payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases by CCE will be
at the discretion of CCE`s Board of Directors in accordance with applicable law
after taking into account various factors, including, but not limited to, CCE`s
financial condition, operating results, current and anticipated cash needs and
plans for growth. Therefore, no assurance can be given that CCE will pay any
dividends to its shareowners or make share repurchases, and no assurance can be
given to the amount of any such dividends or share repurchases if CCE`s Board of
Directors determines to do so. 

CCE will retain the Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. corporate name and remain
headquartered in Atlanta. CCE will continue to be traded on the NYSE under the
CCE ticker. John Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Douglas,
Chief Financial Officer, Hubert Patricot, President of the European Group, and
other members of the CCE corporate management team will continue to lead the
company. In addition, the current independent directors will continue to
comprise the CCE Board. 

CCE 2010 Outlook

As a result of these agreements, CCE has not made any share repurchases during
the current fiscal year, and it does not plan to do so before the transactions
close. CCE intends to provide additional details on FY 2010 outlook during its
upcoming first quarter call. 

Additional Information

CCE`s independent Affiliated Transaction Committee recommended that CCE`s Board
approve the transactions. The Boards of Directors of both The Coca-Cola Company
and CCE have approved the transactions, which are subject to approval by CCE`s
public shareowners and customary regulatory approvals.

 The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information additional meaningful comparisons. Management is providing pro forma financial information for the Company's North American business reflecting the acquisition of the North American business of Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE), including CCE Corporate. 
 See the table below for the pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2009. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company`s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

&lt;p&gt;IBM researchers have developed a new algorithm that could in minutes analyze terabytes' worth of raw data to more quickly predict weather and electricity usage, the company said Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mathematical algorithm, developed by IBM's laboratories in Zurich, can sort, correlate and analyze millions of random data sets, a task that could otherwise take days for supercomputers to process, said Costas Bekas, a researcher at IBM. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The algorithm is just under a thousand lines of code and will be instrumental in establishing usage patterns or trends based on data gathered from sources such as sensors or smart meters, he said. The algorithm could be used to analyze a growing mass of data measuring electricity usage trends as well as air or water pollution levels. The algorithm could also break down data from global financial markets and assess individual and collective exposure to risk, Bekas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are interested in measuring the quality of data," Bekas said. Efficient analysis of large data sets requires new mathematical techniques that reduce computational complexity, Bekas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The algorithm combines models of data calibration and statistical analysis that can assess measurement models and hidden relationships between data sets. IBM has been working on the research for two years, Bekas said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The algorithm can also reduce the cost burden on companies by analyzing data in a more energy-efficient way, Bekas said. The lab used a Blue Gene/P Solution system at the Forschungszentrum Julich research center in Germany to validate 9TBs of data in less than 20 minutes. Analyzing the same amount of data without the algorithm would have taken a day with the supercomputer operating at peak speeds, which would have added up to higher electricity bills, Bekas said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Top500.org, the Blue Gene/P is the fourth-fastest supercomputer in the world as of last November, with 294,912 IBM Power processing cores that can provide peak performance of up to 1 petaflop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The traditional approach to data analysis is to take multiple data sets and look at them individually, said Eleni Pratsini, manager of mathematical and computational sciences at the IBM research labs. However, the algorithm compares data sets against each other, which could help enterprises point toward larger trends in particular areas, such as risk reduction in financial portfolios. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprises will want faster ways of generating business intelligence as masses of data flood servers with the expansion of computing to new devices, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that the algorithm has been proven to work scientifically, the research lab is collaborating with IBM's Global Services unit to use it for specific services, Pratsini said. Ultimately, the algorithm could make its way to IBM applications such as the SPSS statistical analysis software, but the company didn't provide a specific time frame for that.&lt;/p&gt;

PORTLAND, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
Portland General Electric Company (NYSE:POR) today reported net income of $95
million, or $1.31 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2009,
compared to $87 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, for the year ended December
31, 2008. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $8 million, or $0.11 per
diluted share, compared to $20 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the
fourth quarter of 2008. 

Lower net income in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of
2008 continues to reflect the effects of the economy, with a 1% decrease in
total retail energy deliveries and a 0.5% decrease on a weather adjusted basis.
Higher retail prices were offset by higher power costs. Operating results were
also impacted by a write-off in 2009 of approximately $18 million related to
deferred excess replacement power costs associated with Boardman's forced outage
in late 2005 and early 2006 and $6 million related to a delay in the
construction of the Selective Water Withdrawal project. These items were
partially offset by an increase of $9 million in the fair value of non-qualified
benefit plan assets. 

"Despite a challenging year, we continued our focus on efficient and effective
operations, proactively supporting our customers and making progress on
strategic initiatives," said Jim Piro, President and Chief Executive Officer.
"We completed Phase II of Biglow Canyon Wind Farm on time and under budget and
continue to plan for Oregon's energy future through our 2009 Integrated Resource
Plan." 

"On February 16, we filed a 2011 general rate case to align prices with the
costs necessary to deliver safe, reliable power and high-quality customer
service while providing our shareholders a reasonable rate of return." 

Net income increased $8 million, or 9%, for the year ended December 31, 2009,
relative to the year ended December 31, 2008, and reflects the sustained effects
of the economy. Operating results for 2009 reflect higher prices, offset by a 3%
decline in retail energy deliveries, and the effects of a 37% decline in average
wholesale prices and higher power costs. Higher power costs were primarily due
to a 5% decrease in power provided by hydroelectric resources and incremental
replacement power costs of approximately $16 million due to extended maintenance
and repair outages at the Colstrip (approximately $12 million) and Boardman
(approximately $4 million) coal plants. In addition, a refund to customers of
$33 million recorded in 2008 related to OPUC's order concerning certain Trojan
matters and an increase in the fair value of non-qualified benefit plan assets,
partially offset by the write-off of approximately $18 million related to
deferred excess replacement power costs associated with Boardman's forced outage
in late 2005 and early 2006, contributed to the increase in net income. 

Fourth Quarter Highlights

* Filed an Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) with the OPUC in November 2009. The
IRP proposes to meet the projected future energy gap with emphasis on energy
efficiency, new natural gas-fired and renewable resource generation, and new
transmission capacity. In addition, the IRP proposes the continued operation of
Boardman through 2040. PGE is working with various stakeholders to evaluate an
alternative strategy for Boardman under which the plant would cease operations
in 2020 or discontinue the use of coal as a fuel source. The Company is
committed to seeking the plan for Boardman that best meets customers' needs for
reliable, responsibly generated and reasonably priced electricity. 
* Issued $150 million of 5.43% First Mortgage Bonds. 
* Increased revolving credit capacity by replacing an expiring $125 million
revolver with a new $200 million revolver, expiring in December 2012.

Fourth Quarter Operating Results

* Revenues increased $36 million, or 8%, in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared
to the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily due to:

* A $30 million increase related to a 7% increase in retail prices resulting
from the general rate case that became effective January 1, 2009; 
* A $7 million increase from oil sales (with $5 million of oil sales costs
included in Purchased power and fuel expense); 
* A $4 million increase related to a 1% increase in retail energy sales
(excluding Direct Access customers); partially offset by 
* A $15 million decrease in wholesale sales, consisting of a 22% decline in
market prices and an 18% decrease in volume.

Total retail energy deliveries, which include deliveries to Direct Access
customers, decreased 0.9% in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth
quarter of 2008, consisting of a 3.9% decrease in commercial and industrial
energy deliveries, partially offset by a 3.4% increase in residential energy
deliveries.

* Purchased power and fuel expense increased $54 million, or 24%, in the fourth
quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily due to:

* A $26 million increase related to a 22% increase in the average cost of
purchased power; 
* An $18 million increase related to the reversal of a regulatory asset deferred
in early 2007 in connection with Boardman's outage in late 2005 to early 2006.
In February 2010, the OPUC denied the amortization of 50% of the original amount
of costs deferred; and 
* A $10 million increase related to a 9% increase in the average cost of power
generated, driven by higher fuel costs.

Included in the above is $4 million related to incremental replacement power
costs due to the Colstrip outage. Colstrip came back online at the end of
October 2009.

* PGE was authorized to include in rates the Selective Water Withdrawal project,
effective February 1, 2010. Pursuant to a stipulation entered into with the OPUC
and other interested parties, PGE agreed to not seek the recovery of certain
costs related to a delay in the construction of the project, of which $6 million
was charged to production and distribution expense in the fourth quarter of
2009.

* Administrative and other expense decreased by $3 million, or 6%, as compared
to the fourth quarter of 2008. 
* An increase of $9 million in other income (expense) related to the change in
the fair value of non-qualified benefit plan assets. In the fourth quarter of
2009, PGE recorded a $1 million gain, compared to an $8 million loss recorded in
the fourth quarter of 2008.

2009 Annual Highlights

* Completed Biglow Canyon Phase II on schedule and under budget, resulting in 65
wind turbines supplying power to PGE's customers. Wind generation increased 31%
in 2009 compared to 2008, representing 3% of the Company's retail load
requirement in 2009 compared to 2% in 2008. Revenue requirements related to
Phase II started as the turbines were placed in service, which was completed by
the end of August 2009. 
* Total retail energy deliveries decreased 3.3% in 2009 compared to 2008,
consisting of a 5.6% decrease in commercial and industrial deliveries, partially
offset by a 0.3% increase in residential energy deliveries. 
* On a weather adjusted basis, retail energy deliveries decreased 2.4% in 2009,
with deliveries to residential, commercial, and industrial customers increasing
(decreasing) by 1.1%, (2.7%), and (8.4%), respectively. 
* An increase of $26 million in other income related to the change in the fair
value of non-qualified benefit plan assets. In 2009, PGE recorded a $9 million
gain, compared to a $17 million loss recorded in 2008. 
* Administrative and other expenses decreased by $11 million, or 6%, as compared
to 2008 due to a decrease in incentive compensation from changes in the plan
provisions and 2009 results. 
* Issued a total of $580 million of first mortgage bonds. 
* Issued 12.5 million shares of common stock in March 2009 for net proceeds of
$170 million. 
* Increased the quarterly stock dividend 4% in May 2009, from 24.5 cents per
share to 25.5 cents per share.

2011 General Rate Case

On February 16, 2010, PGE filed a general rate case for a $125 million, or 7.4%,
overall increase in rates, which is based on a 2011 test year. The goal of the
general rate case is to provide prices that allow the recovery of costs
necessary to provide safe and reliable service, recovery of capital costs and a
reasonable rate of return. PGE is requesting modification of the power cost
adjustment mechanism for closer alignment with other utilities, a mechanism for
recovery of costs from major storm damage, recovery of costs related to
collateral requirements and pension plan funding, and continuation of the
decoupling mechanism. In addition, PGE is proposing a capital structure of 50%
debt and 50% equity, a return on equity of 10.5%, a cost of capital of 8.3%, and
an average rate base of approximately $3.2 billion. A final order from the OPUC
is expected before the end of 2010, with new rates expected to be effective
January 1, 2011. 

2010 Earnings Guidance

PGE revises 2010 earnings guidance from the previously reported range of $1.50
to $1.65 earnings per diluted share to $1.30 to $1.45 earnings per diluted
share. The two key drivers for the guidance revision include:

* Unfavorable hydro conditions resulting in lower-than-forecasted energy
expected to be received from hydroelectric resources; and 
* Decline in retail margins due to the reduction in load primarily caused by
warmer-than-expected weather in January and February.

The combined impact of the above two factors results in lower income taxes,
which in turn would require customer refunds under SB 408, an Oregon utility tax
law. Reduced hydro, a decline in retail margins, and the related impact from SB
408 represent approximately 50%, 25%, and 25%, respectively, of the total
reduction in earnings guidance. 

Capital Expenditures and Funding

The Company estimates capital expenditures to be $540 million in 2010, the
majority of which relate to Biglow Canyon Phase III ($210 million), the smart
meter project ($40 million) and upgrades to and replacement of generation,
transmission and distribution infrastructure ($260 million). PGE plans on
issuing approximately $250 million of debt in 2010 to finance its capital
expenditures, of which $70 million was issued in January 2010.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Feb 25 (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings LEHMQ.PK has
agreed with JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) to settle about $7.68
billion in collateral obligations that were pending following

primary broker-dealer unit prior to the latter's bankruptcy
filing in September 2008. Banks normally collect collateral from
their counterparties as a way of hedging risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the summer of 2008, JPMorgan had asked Lehman Brothers to

cover that guaranty, according to the documents filed with the
Bankruptcy Court of Southern District of New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although the collateral posted by Lehman had a face value in
the billions of dollars, it consisted of illiquid securities
whose actual value was difficult to ascertain, the court papers
show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Between Sept. 9, and Sept. 12, 2008, Lehman posted an
estimated $8.57 billion in cash and money market funds as
additional collateral security, the papers show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As part of the settlement, JPMorgan will reduce its
remaining claims from about $7.68 billion to about $557 million
after adjusting for Lehman's cash collateral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In return, Lehman will have to make a one-time cash payment
of about $557 million to JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As per the deal, JPMorgan will transfer the remaining
illiquid collateral back to Lehman, according to the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman hopes the illiquid collateral -- that is to be
returned by JPMorgan -- would rise in value over a period of
time, the filings show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is In re: Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, U.S.

Recommendations Include Primary Dosing Series and a Supplemental Dose for
Children Fully Immunized with Prevnar
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Regulatory News: 

Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) announced today that the United States Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention's (CDC`s) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
(ACIP) has recommended the use of Prevnar 13 (Pneumococcal 13-valent Conjugate
Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197 Protein]) for healthy children aged 2 months through
59 months for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by the 13
pneumococcal serotypes included in the vaccine. 

The ACIP's recommendations include the routine use of Prevnar 13 for infants and
toddlers, as well as a supplemental dose for children through 59 months of age
who have completed the 4-dose immunization series with Prevnar&#174; (Pneumococcal
7-valent Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197 Protein]). In addition, the ACIP
recommended that children who have started their immunization series with
Prevnar should complete the series by switching to Prevnar 13 at any point in
the schedule. 

Prevnar 13 includes the seven serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) in
Prevnar - available in the United States since 2000 - plus six additional
serotypes (1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A). Together, these 13 serotypes are
responsible for the majority of remaining invasive pneumococcal disease in
infants and young children in the United States. In particular, serotype 19A is
now the most common cause of invasive pneumococcal disease among children
younger than 5 years of age in the United States. 

"We are pleased that the Advisory Committee has recommended the use of Prevnar
13, with coverage for 13 important invasive disease-causing serotypes, in
infants and young children in the United States," says Emilio Emini, Ph.D.,
chief scientific officer, Vaccine Research, Pfizer Inc. "The incidence of
disease caused by serotypes not included in Prevnar has been increasing in
children younger than 5 years of age in the United States, including 19A , the
most common serotype." 

The ACIP`s recommendations for Prevnar 13 vaccination of healthy unimmunized
children 2 months through 59 months of age are identical to those previously
recommended by ACIP for Prevnar, with Prevnar 13 replacing Prevnar for all
doses. 

Highlights of the ACIP recommendations included the following:

* Prevnar 13 is administered as a 4-dose series at 2, 4, 6 and 12 through 15
months of age. 
* Children who have begun their vaccination series with Prevnar should complete
the series by switching to Prevnar 13 at any point in the schedule. 
* A single supplemental dose of Prevnar 13 is recommended for children through
59 months of age who have completed the 4-dose immunization series with
Prevnar.

Earlier today, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved
Prevnar 13 for active immunization of children 6 weeks through 5 years of age
for the prevention of invasive disease caused by 13 Streptococcus pneumoniae (S.
pneumoniae) serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F).
Prevnar 13 is also indicated for the prevention of otitis media caused by
serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F. No otitis media efficacy data are
available for serotypes 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A. 

In the United States, the Prevnar 13 product label recommends a 4-dose series at
2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months of age. Children who have received one or more
doses of Prevnar may complete the 4-dose immunization series with Prevnar 13.
Additionally, children 15 months through 5 years of age who have received four
doses of Prevnar may receive one dose of Prevnar 13 to elicit immune responses
to the six additional serotypes. The immune responses induced by this Prevnar 13
transition schedule may result in lower antibody concentrations for the six
additional serotypes (types 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A), compared to antibody
concentrations following four doses of Prevnar 13 (given at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to
15 months). The clinical relevance of these lower antibody responses is not
known. 

Pfizer expects Prevnar 13 to be introduced commercially in the United States in
the first quarter of 2010. In addition to the approval of Prevnar 13 in the
United States, Prevenar 13* (Pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine
[13-valent, adsorbed]), as it is known in most countries outside the United
States, has been approved for use in infants and young children in 38 other
countries. Further regulatory filings for Prevnar 13 for pediatric use are in
advanced stages of review in various countries spanning six continents. Prevnar
13 is also being studied in global Phase III clinical trials in adults, with
regulatory submissions expected later this year. 

Pneumococcal Disease

According to a World Health Organization (WHO) 2002 estimate, pneumococcal
disease is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable death worldwide in children
younger than 5 years. Pneumococcal disease is complex and describes a group of
illnesses, all caused by the bacterium S. pneumoniae. It affects infants and
young children and includes invasive infections such as bacteremia/ sepsis and
meningitis, as well as non-invasive disease including acute otitis media. 

Indication for Prevnar 13

Prevnar 13 is a vaccine approved for use in children 6 weeks through 5 years of
age (prior to the 6th birthday). 

Prevnar 13 is indicated for active immunization for the prevention of invasive
disease caused by 13 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B,
7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F). 

Prevnar 13 is also indicated for the prevention of otitis media (ear infection)
caused by 7 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and
23F). No efficacy data for ear infections are available for strains 1, 3, 5, 6A,
7F, and 19A. 

Important Safety Information for Prevnar 13

Prevnar 13 should not be given to anyone with a severe allergic reaction to any
component of Prevnar 13, Prevnar or any diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine. 

Prevnar 13 may not protect all individuals receiving the vaccine. Protection
against ear infections is expected to be less than that for invasive disease.
Children with weakened immune systems may have a reduced immune response to
Prevnar 13. A temporary pause of breathing following vaccination has been
observed in some infants born prematurely. 

The most common side effects are redness, swelling and tenderness at the
injection site, fever, decreased appetite, irritability, increased sleep, and
decreased sleep. Any side effects associated with the vaccination should be
reported to your child`s health care provider. 

Indication for Prevnar

Prevnar is indicated for active immunization of infants and toddlers against
serious invasive disease caused by S. pneumoniae, including bacteremia
(bloodstream infection) and meningitis (infection of the membranes surrounding
the brain and spinal cord) caused by the seven serotypes in the vaccine. The
seven serotypes (strains) of S. pneumoniae included in the vaccine (4, 6B, 9V,
14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) were the strains that most commonly caused these serious
diseases in children prior to the introduction of the vaccine. The routine
schedule is 2, 4, 6, and 12-15 months of age. 

Prevnar is also indicated for immunization of infants and toddlers against
otitis media (ear infections) caused by the seven serotypes in the vaccine.
Protection against ear infections is expected to be less than that for invasive
disease. 

As with any vaccine, Prevnar may not protect all individuals receiving the
vaccine from serious invasive disease caused by S. pneumoniae. This vaccine
should not be used for treatment of active infection. 

Important Safety Information for Prevnar

In clinical studies, the most frequently reported adverse events included
injection site reactions, fever (&#8805;38&#186;C/100.4&#186;F), irritability, drowsiness,
restless sleep, decreased appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and rash. 

Risks are associated with all vaccines, including Prevnar. Hypersensitivity to
any vaccine component, including diphtheria toxoid, is a contraindication to its
use. Prevnar does not protect 100 percent of children vaccinated. Immunization
with Prevnar does not substitute for routine diphtheria immunization.

&lt;p&gt;Netherlands Trial Demonstrates How Advanced Road Pricing Technology Can
Incentivize Drivers to Change Their Behavior and Reduce Traffic Congestion
EINDHOVEN, Netherlands--(Business Wire)--
NXP Semiconductors and IBM today announced the final results of a landmark road
pricing trial conducted in the Netherlands, which demonstrated that with the
help of technology, drivers can be motivated to change their driving behavior,
reducing traffic congestion and contributing to a greener environment. The
six-month road pricing trial, conducted in the city of Eindhoven, was designed
to provide the Dutch government with insights to address the challenge of
traffic congestion in the Netherlands. The test was overwhelmingly successful,
with 70 percent of drivers changing their behavior to avoid rush-hour travel
when presented with the right incentives, demonstrating that road pricing
systems can have a positive effect on driving habits and help alleviate traffic.


"The test has vastly exceeded our expectations," said Maurice Geraets, senior
director, NXP Semiconductors. "Together, NXP and IBM have logged more than
200,000 test kilometers as part of the trial, and the complete system has proven
to be highly reliable. The technology is ready to charge car owners fairly for
the use of the car based on road type, time of day and the environmental
characteristics of the car, and to give effective feedback to drivers to
influence their behavior - helping them save money and make more efficient,
greener driving choices on a daily basis. Further, the Eindhoven trial has
demonstrated that our technology is ready for implementation in any large-scale
traffic management program." 

"The results of our GPS-based solution in Eindhoven show that nationwide
implementation of road user charging is feasible. Already successful IBM
implementations of congestion charging schemes in Stockholm, Brisbane, Singapore
and London are now also achievable with GPS which makes countrywide
implementations possible for millions of cars," said Eric-Mark Huitema, mobility
executive at IBM. "Smart traffic and transportation systems have tremendous
potential to reduce traffic congestion, contribute to a cleaner environment with
reduced carbon dioxide and small particles emissions." 

Key findings of the trial included:

* 70 percent of drivers improved their driving behavior by avoiding rush-hour
traffic and using highways instead of local roads. 
* On average, these drivers in the trial saw an improvement of more than 16
percent in average cost per kilometer. 
* A clear system of incentives is critical to changing driving behavior. 
* Instant feedback provided via an On-Board Unit display on the price of the
road chosen and total charges for the trip are essential to maximizing the
change in behavior.

The Netherlands Road Pricing Trial in Context

The Netherlands will be introducing a new road-use charge starting in 2012 for
trucks and lorries, and 2013 for passenger cars. The new road pricing system -
Paying differently for mobility (Anders Betalen voor Mobiliteit) - is expected
to be up and running nationwide by 2016. 

Many EU countries are now in the process of exploring road pricing programs as
one of the measures to reduce congestion and CO2 emissions. In the Netherlands,
once fully implemented, the Price per Kilometer (De kilometerprijs) system is
expected to achieve the following benefits1:

* A 58 percent reduction in delays caused by traffic jams; 
* A 15 percent reduction in the total number of kilometers driven annually; 
* A 10 percent reduction in CO2 emissions; 
* A 6 percent increase in total passenger kilometers via public transportation; 
* More than 50 percent of Dutch households will pay less than they do currently
for the motor vehicle tax and vehicle purchase tax.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Google are stepping up their war of words. This time it's Microsoft's turn: It says Google is pointing fingers rather than addressing the European Commission's investigation into the search giant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, the European Commission acknowledged that it had begun looking into three antitrust complaints filed against Google. In response, Google has defended its search policies but has also blamed Microsoft for triggering the investigation, because Microsoft owns one of the companies that complained and is linked to another. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google is telling reporters that antitrust concerns about search are not real because some of the complaints come from one of its last remaining search competitors," Dave Heiner, vice president and deputy general counsel at Microsoft, wrote in a blog post on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a reason for that, he said. "Complaints in competition law cases usually come from competitors," he wrote. "Google hasn't been shy about raising antitrust concerns about Microsoft in the last few years, either. ... Ultimately what's important is not who is complaining, but whether or not the challenged practices are anticompetitive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which has faced its share of antitrust complaints, is "among the first to say that leading firms should not be punished for their success," he said. "Our concerns relate only to Google practices that tend to lock in business partners and content (like Google Books) and exclude competitors, thereby undermining competition more broadly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From its side, Google on Thursday generally described its search ranking technology and said it never manually chooses results. One of the companies that complained to the commission, Foundem, suggests otherwise. Foundem believes it was essentially blacklisted from Google's search results for a while because the company competes with Google. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google also stressed the challenges involved in processing hundreds of millions of queries a day. The company didn't reveal anything new about the way it handles search, but it said news of the Commission's investigation had prompted "lots of questions" about how Google's ranking works. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google dominates the European search market, with about 85 percent market share in many countries, while Microsoft's Bing typically has closer to a 3 percent share. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who enjoy security news, this week offered plenty of topics to digest. Microsoft attempted to shut down a botnet network by obtaining a court order that called for the closing of nefarious .com domains. Attackers are exploiting flaws in multimedia software, but overall instances of buggy software decreased last year, according to an IBM study. And not to frighten you, but the U.S. would lose a cyberwar, according to a security expert. Finally, we need to mention Google and its challenging week. In one day, three of its executives were convicted of privacy violations and European regulators announced an antitrust review of its search rankings. And the spat between the company and China still isn't resolved, resulting in Google supposedly canceling a Beijing developers event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. IBM: Vulnerabilities fell in 2009, but other risks abound: An IBM security study offered mixed news on security vulnerabilities. The report found that the number of software flaws decreased in 2009, but the amount of flaws in multimedia applications and document readers, which IBM classifies as client vulnerabilities, increased by 50 percent. Browsers, though, had the most client-side flaws, with Mozilla's Firefox having twice as many critical to high vulnerabilities as Microsoft's Internet Explorer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Support decision looms for SAP users: The deadline for SAP customers to select standard support or Enterprise Support, which offers more features for a higher price, is nearing. Businesses that move from standard support to the more advanced support before March 15 receive a pricing discount. An analyst divided SAP customers into four groups and offered advice for users in each category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Web app developers showered with advice: Web application developers should discuss ideas with people, since this provides feedback, and save time by using existing technologies to automate work. This was just some of the advice offered by successful developers at a Web application conference this week. While we sometimes dismiss advice, we'd be more inclined to heed these words since they came from the founders of Mint and Reddit, startups that were both sold to major businesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. US government to review Toyota electronics:The U.S. government will review the electronics in Toyota automobiles to determine if faults in those systems caused the company's cars to rapidly accelerate, the country's transportation secretary told a Congressional committee. Toyota claims floor mats or sticky accelerators, not the vehicles' electronic braking systems, caused the unwanted accelerations. However, the U.S. Department of Transportation received enough input from drivers to launch a review of the cars' electronics systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Mobile carriers defend early termination fees: If you like buying a smartphone at a reduced price then you have to accept early termination fees, mobile-phone carriers told the U.S. Federal Communications Commission this week. The agency requested comments from the carriers and Google, which sells the Nexus One smartphone, on why customers are charged what some label excessive fees for exiting a contract early. The carriers responded that the charges are necessary to subsidize the handset's cost and without the fees, customers would pay much more for a phone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Source: Google cancels Android developer event in China, Google hit with antitrust probe in Europe and Three Google execs convicted over Italian bullying video: The week proved challenging for Google, which appeared a few times in the headlines for less-than-positive reasons. On Wednesday the European Commission announced that it launched an antitrust probe after receiving three complaints about Google's search engine results. That same day an Italian judge found three company executives guilty of privacy violations related to a Google Video video showing a handicapped boy being bullied. Finally, Google's clash with the Chinese government over Internet freedom allegedly resulted in Beijing being dropped as a stop on an Android developer tour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. Security expert: US would lose cyberwar: The U.S. government won't bolster the nation's cybersecurity defenses until after a major "catastrophic" attack on the Internet, a security expert told Congress. Moreover, the U.S. would not win a cyberwar if attacked today, said Mike McConnell, a former U.S. director of national intelligence. Another speaker also called for government regulation of cybersecurity, saying that the private sector's defense efforts have proved ineffective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8.&lt;p&gt;"&gt;Court order helps Microsoft tear down Waledac botnet: Microsoft turned to the U.S. court system to help it take down the Waledac botnet, which spreads spam and malicious software. In a lawsuit Microsoft argued that Verisign, which manages the .com domain, can cut off the domains associated with the botnet, severing the link between the servers and the infected machines that sent the spam. Verisign then cut off 277 .com domains associated with the botnet, which sent approximately 1.5 billion spam messages each day, according to Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;9. Baidu: Registrar 'incredibly' changed our e-mail for hacker: Finding quality customer service usually proves challenging, but a tech support representative for U.S. domain name registrar Register.com proved too accommodating. Last month a Register.com worker unknowingly helped a hacker take down China's top-ranked search engine, Baidu.com., according to a complaint the company filed in the U.S. court system. The staff member changed the e-mail address to a bogus one requested by the hacker, even after the attacker failed to answer security questions correctly. The hacker then reset the password for Baidu's account and, in less than an hour, changed the account settings to send visitors to different Web pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10. Are Hollywood hackers bogus or bright?: While reading this week's column may give the impression that security stories are only about botnets and cyberwar, we give you some lighter fare on how movies portray hackers. A college lecturer watched several hacker movies in an effort to understand why computer attackers are portrayed as acne-plagued teenagers and wrote an academic paper on the subject. &lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

MetLife Seeks $5B Loan for ALICO

On Feb 23, 2010, Bloomberg reported that MetLife Inc. (NYSE: MET) is looking for
a $5 billion loan in order to complete the long pending acquisition of American
International Group Inc.`s (NYSE: AIG) American Life Insurance Co. (ALICO) unit.
For this, MetLife has already solicited some firms, namely, Bank of America
Corp. (NYSE: BAC), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM), Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:
DB), among others, to tender pledges for a bridge term loan of $5 billion. A
final decision is expected very soon. 

MetLife had been involved in an advanced round of negotiations with AIG since
Jan 2010 to purchase its ALICO unit for about $14-$15 billion. For this, MetLife
expects to fund the acquisition by paying about $8-$9 million in cash, while the
rest will be in the form of debt. This debt would be sought by the $5 billion
bridge loan that the company is negotiating from other banks. 

Although the negotiations towards the final completion had been delayed for the
past couple of weeks due to a tax liability dispute about sale of products to
foreign customers, we believe an agreement on the loan will hasten the process
of final closure of the ALICO deal.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has assigned 'AAA' ratings with Stable Outlooks to seven classes
of J.P. Morgan Resecuritization Trust 2010-1. This transaction consists of six
non-crossed groups. Each group is a resecuritization of a residential mortgage
backed securities certificate. Fitch is rating the Group 3 certificates and is
not rating the Group 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 certificates. 

As resecuritizations, the certificates will receive their cash-flows from the
underlying classes of certificates. The underlying certificates represent
beneficial ownership interest in fixed-rate, conventional, first lien
residential mortgage loans, substantially all of which have original terms to
stated maturity of 30 years. 

This transaction contains certain classes designated as Base Certificates and
others as Exchangeable Certificates. Class 3-A-1 certificate is a Base
Certificate and can be exchanged for certain combinations of 3-A-3 through
3-A-8. 

ResiLogic, the regression-based model used by Fitch, takes into account multiple
risk factors which can broadly be placed into three categories in the following
order of influence: seasoned loan risks, economic risks, and collateral risks.
For seasoned loan risks, the delinquency status and volatility are the most
important with regards to Frequency of Foreclosure (FOF), while change in home
price index and loan age are the most important with regards to Loss Severity
(LS). Economic risk is solely comprised of state and MSA level risk multipliers
as well as a national multiplier. In the category of collateral risk, the credit
score, credit sector, and combined loan-to-value (CLTV) ratio are the most
heavily-weighted risk factors in calculating the FOF. Closing balance,
loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and loan coupon are the most heavily-weighted risk
factors in calculating Loss Severity. Due to concerns over recent pool
performance and volatility, loss levels were adjusted higher than the ResiLogic
model results. 

Group 3 is a resecuritization of 42.22% interest in GSR Mortgage Loan Trust
2007-3F, Class 3A-7. Credit enhancement for the 3-A-1, and 3-A-3 through 3-A-8
certificates is provided by the structural support on the underlying transaction
and the 28.75% class 3-A-2 bond. Due to concerns over recent pool performance
and volatility, loss levels were adjusted higher than the ResiLogic model
results. 

The loan level information used in analyzing pools is taken from the Loan
Performance database. In general, fields in the data tapes are complete unless
otherwise noted. In this transaction the back-end debt-to-income (DTI) ratio
field was missing. For loans missing DTI information, Fitch uses a standard
assumption of 35%. 

The underlying collateral and cashflow structure were analyzed according to
Fitch's 'Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria', 'U.S. Residential Mortgage
Re-REMIC,' 'ResiLogic: U.S. Residential Mortgage Loss Model' and 'U.S. RMBS Cash
Flow Analysis' criteria. 

Fitch rates the J.P. Morgan Resecuritization Trust 2010-1 as follows: 

--$20,823,000 class 3-A-1 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$18,996,000 exchangeable class 3-A-3 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$1,827,000 exchangeable class 3-A-4 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$17,535,000 exchangeable class 3-A-5 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$3,288,000 exchangeable class 3-A-6 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$16,074,000 exchangeable class 3-A-7 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$4,749,000 exchangeable class 3-A-8 'AAA'; Outlook Stable.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A head of origination of North American environmental markets at JP Morgan Chase has left the company, a bank spokesman said on Wednesday, as the future of a broad U.S. carbon market looks grim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben Feldman, who had been an executive director in the environmental markets division at JP Morgan, is no longer with the bank, a spokesman said. He would not say if Feldman would be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan hired Feldman from Natsource LLC, a carbon asset management company, where he had worked for seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feldman had moved to Washington late last year after working in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feldman's leaving was not a layoff, a source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the climate bill being stalled in the Senate as it faces tough opposition from lawmakers in energy-dependent states, JP Morgan has made two recent acquisitions related to the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan purchased clean energy project developer EcoSecurities late last year. It is now one of the world's largest companies that aggregates carbon offsets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month the bank also bought non-U.S. assets of commodities joint venture RBS Sempra from Britain's Royal Bank of Scotland and Sempra Energy in a deal that included carbon assets, the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

this year, with half of that funneled into Cablevision
(CABLECPO.MX), the leading cable operator in the Mexico City
area, Executive Vice President Alfonso de Angoitia told a
conference call with analysts on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; De Angoitia also said Televisa might restructure its
publishing unit -- which sells 400 magazines in 20 countries in
Latin America -- by the second quarter. Last year, Televisa's
publishing sales fell 9.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa shares were down 2.59 percent at 47.01 pesos on
Friday, a day after the company posted a 58 percent drop in
fourth-quarter net profit. It benefited from strong foreign
exchange gains in the year-earlier quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The profit fall was also due to goodwill impairment and
losses on asset sales, Barclays said in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cablevision and SKY, Televisa's satellite-to-home signal,
are expected to have another strong year in 2010, helped by
broadening high-definition services and the airing of shows
related to the soccer World Cup in South Africa, ahead of and
during the summer tournament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa also plans to expand into the wireless phone
market this year if its joint bid with Nextel Mexico, a unit of
NII Holdings NIHD.O, for a chunk of spectrum succeeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company recently announced it plans to buy a 30 percent
stake in Nextel Mexico for $1.44 billion, but the deal will be
called off if they don't win the auction.

&lt;p&gt;A federal judge has dismissed a year-old lawsuit against Microsoft over alleged antitrust violations for the "downgrade" rules it set for Windows Vista and XP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order issued Monday by U.S. District Court Judge Marsha Pechman put an end to the lawsuit filed by Emma Alvarado in February 2009. In her original complaint, the Los Angeles resident accused Microsoft of coercing computer makers into forcing consumers who wanted to run Windows XP to first buy Vista, or later, Windows 7, before they were allowed to downgrade to XP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're pleased the Court agreed that Plaintiff's complaint failed to state a viable claim and dismissed it in its entirety," Microsoft spokesman Kevin Kutz said in an e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pechman rejected Alvarado's accusations, saying that she had not proved Microsoft benefited from the downgrade practices it created and OEMs implemented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nowhere does she allege that she paid to downgrade or that she did not receive a copy of Vista when she freely chose to purchase her new computer with that software," said Pechman. "That she chose to downgrade to XP without extra cost does not demonstrate that Microsoft retained a benefit without giving value. Nor does the fact that she chooses to use only one version nullify the fact that Microsoft gave her value for the bargain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Pechman's perspective, Alvarado got as much as Microsoft out of the deal. "If anything, it appears that Plaintiff obtained two versions of Microsoft's operating software for the price of one," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Alvarado claimed that she had paid a $59.25 fee in mid-2008 to downgrade her new Lenovo laptop from Vista to XP, Microsoft denied it had profited . "Microsoft does not charge or receive any additional royalty if a customer exercises those [downgrade] rights," a Microsoft spokesman said last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computer makers, not Microsoft, charged users the additional fees for downgrading a new PC from Vista to XP at the factory. However, Alvarado did not name Lenovo in her lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Downgrade" describes the Windows licensing rights that Microsoft gives users, who are allowed under some circumstances to replace newer versions of Windows with an older edition without having to pay for another license. In effect, the license for the newer Windows is transferred to the older edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Windows downgrade policies came under fire long before Alvarado sued. In 2008, for example, Dell was accused of gouging customers to downgrade a new computer to XP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downgrading became popular in 2007 when users, unhappy with Vista's performance on the new PCs they bought, instead sought ways to run the leaner XP. Last year, Microsoft revealed that it would let users downgrade from Windows 7 to XP Professional until April 2011. Some computer manufacturers, including Dell, continue to offer factory downgrades from Windows 7 to XP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;Lauren Engineers Enjoys Greater Time-Savings and Human Resources Flexibility 
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Partnering with leading global immigration service provider, VISANOW, has
allowed Lauren Engineers &amp; Constructors Corporation, an international
Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contractor, to staff key
positions with the best candidates from around the globe. This access to the
most highly-skilled talent, regardless of their nationality, coupled with an
efficient work authorization process has become a competitive advantage and key
growth driver for Lauren Engineers. 

Previously, lacking process and responsiveness from traditional immigration law
firms overtaxed human resources, hindering the ability to hire crucial talent,
putting large projects at risk. After several failed attempts of working with
various immigration service providers, Levi Taylor, HR Manager at Lauren
Engineers, switched to VISANOW in July 2008 because of its patented online
immigration platform that streamlines the process. "Switching to VISANOW has
freed up about 40 hours of my time every month, giving me the opportunity to
approach immigration more strategically," said Taylor. Lauren Engineers is now
able to confidently bid on immigration-dependent jobs and even use immigration
as a tool to create strategic business opportunities in new markets. 

"Lauren Engineers` immigration success illustrates that employers are continuing
to utilize immigration as a business strategy to hire the best and brightest
from around the globe, despite government protectionism arising from the
economic recession," commented VISANOW CEO, Robert Meltzer. "Our streamlined
immigration process is now even more important than ever, and makes VISANOW an
ideal partner for companies like Lauren Engineers to address their human
resource needs during this period of increased government scrutiny and in
preparation for the post-recession business world."

feuille de route que nous avons &#233;tablie pour gagner ensemble, nous agissons
aujourd`hui comme un syst&#232;me align&#233; &#187;, a d&#233;clar&#233; M. Muhtar Kent, PDG de la
Coca-Cola Company. &#171; Nous ne faisons pas l`acquisition de CCE, seulement de ses
op&#233;rations en Am&#233;rique du Nord, et CCE reste l`un de nos principaux partenaires

essentiellement la m&#234;me depuis la fondation de CCE en 1986, m&#234;me si le march&#233; et
l`industrie ont connu un changement radical. Cette transaction nous permet de
convertir du capital massif en capital actif, et de contr&#244;ler directement nos
investissements en Am&#233;rique du Nord, afin d`acc&#233;l&#233;rer la croissance et d`assurer

En outre, nous allons proc&#233;der &#224; une r&#233;organisation de nos op&#233;rations ayant
trait &#224; la manufacture, &#224; la cha&#238;ne d`approvisionnement et &#224; la logistique, de

temps, cela va permettre &#224; nos actionnaires de garder des participations dans
une soci&#233;t&#233; de vente et de distribution dont le profil de croissance est
am&#233;lior&#233;. &#192; l`avenir, les actionnaires de CCE pourront &#233;galement tirer parti de
l`expansion de nos activit&#233;s en Europe et de notre plus grande souplesse
financi&#232;re. &#187; 

M. Brock a &#233;galement confi&#233; : &#171; CCE reste le principal embouteilleur de l`Europe
occidentale, ainsi qu`un partenaire strat&#233;gique cl&#233; pour la Coca-Cola Company.
Nos entreprises europ&#233;ennes servent un march&#233; attractif o&#249; les volumes et les
profits sont en croissance gr&#226;ce &#224; une augmentation de la consommation par
habitant. &#192; ce titre, CCE devrait b&#233;n&#233;ficier d`un profil am&#233;lior&#233;, ainsi que
d`une augmentation des revenus, des marges et des perspectives de croissance
BPA. Ensemble avec la Coca-Cola Company, nous allons continuer &#224; am&#233;liorer
l`efficacit&#233; de nos op&#233;rations dans notre pr&#233;sence &#233;tendue en Europe. Ses
actions renforcent notre capacit&#233; &#224; concourir efficacement et de mani&#232;re durable
en Europe, et elles repr&#233;sentent le d&#233;but d`une &#232;re passionnante en termes de
croissance &#224; long terme pour les activit&#233;s et les actionnaires de CCE. &#187; 

Et M. Kent de conclure : &#171; Il s`agit v&#233;ritablement d`une journ&#233;e historique pour
le syst&#232;me Coca-Cola. En tant que plus grande entreprise mondiale de l`industrie
des boissons, nous sommes tr&#232;s enthousiastes &#224; l`id&#233;e des vastes opportunit&#233;s
qui nous attendent, et je peux affirmer en toute confiance qu`il n`y a pas de
business qui vaille celui-ci. Au cours des ann&#233;es &#224; venir, on pr&#233;voit que
l`industrie mondiale des boissons non alcoolis&#233;es pr&#234;tes &#224; consommer, qui &#224;
l`heure actuelle repr&#233;sente pr&#232;s de 650 milliards de dollars, augmentera plus
rapidement que le PIB mondial, et nous sommes parfaitement positionn&#233;s pour
tirer parti de cette &#233;norme opportunit&#233; industrielle en Am&#233;rique du Nord et en
Europe. Ces actions conjointes me renforcent dans la certitude que nous allons
&#234;tre capables de r&#233;aliser notre Vision 2020, qui est de doubler les revenus et
les ventes d`ici 2020, pour arriver &#224; vendre 3 milliards de boissons par jour.
Maintenant que le temps est venu et que notre syst&#232;me est plus align&#233; que
jamais, nous pensons que ces actions vont inaugurer une nouvelle &#232;re de succ&#232;s
pour notre syst&#232;me Coca-Cola. &#187; 

D&#233;tail des transactions

Dans le cadre d`une transaction ne faisant pour l`essentiel pas intervenir de
liquidit&#233;s, la Coca-Cola Company fera l`acquisition de l`ensemble des activit&#233;s
nord-am&#233;ricaines de CCE, soit environ 75 % du volume d`embouteillage pour les
&#201;tats-Unis et pratiquement 100 % du volume d`embouteillage pour le Canada. Au
terme de la transaction, la Coca-Cola Company contr&#244;lera directement environ 90
% de l`ensemble du volume nord-am&#233;ricain, y compris par le biais des entreprises
directes qu`elle poss&#232;de actuellement. L`acquisition par la Coca-Cola Company du
patrimoine actif et passif de CCE en Am&#233;rique du Nord, inclut la r&#233;tribution des
34 % de la participation au capital social de CCE d&#233;tenus actuellement par la
Coca-Cola Company et estim&#233;e &#224; 3,4 milliards de dollars, sur la base de la &#171;
trailing average &#187; &#224; 30 jours d&#233;termin&#233;e le 24 f&#233;vrier 2010. En outre, la
r&#233;tribution inclut la prise en charge de la dette de CCE s`&#233;levant &#224; 8,88
milliards de dollars ainsi que de l`ensemble du patrimoine actif et passif
nord-am&#233;ricain - y compris l`obligation au titre des prestations constitu&#233;es de
CCE pour l`Am&#233;rique du Nord qui repr&#233;sentait 580 millions de dollars aux 31
d&#233;cembre 2009, ainsi que certains autres co&#251;ts et b&#233;n&#233;fices ponctuels. 

Dans le cadre d`un accord concomitant, la Coca-Cola Company et CCE ont donn&#233;
leur accord de principe pour que CCE rach&#232;te les activit&#233;s d`embouteillage de la
Coca-Cola Company en Norv&#232;ge et en Su&#232;de, pour la somme de 822 millions de
dollars, sous r&#233;serve de la signature des accords d&#233;finitifs. Elles ont
&#233;galement convenu que CCE aura le droit d`acqu&#233;rir la prise de participation de
83 % de la Coca-Cola Company dans ses op&#233;rations d`embouteillage en Allemagne,
et ce 18 &#224; 36 mois apr&#232;s la cl&#244;ture, pour des raisons de valeur marchande
&#233;quitable. 

Par le biais d`une scission-&#233;change, une nouvelle entit&#233;, qui gardera le nom de
Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., sera cr&#233;&#233;e ; elle englobera l`ensemble des activit&#233;s
europ&#233;ennes de CCE. Les actionnaires publics de CCE auront la possibilit&#233;
d`&#233;changer chaque action CCE existante contre une action dans la nouvelle
entit&#233;, et seront propri&#233;taires de 100 % de la nouvelle entit&#233;. 

CCE proposera &#224; ses actionnaires, &#224; l`exclusion de la Coca-Cola Company, un
paiement en esp&#232;ces sp&#233;cial en une fois de 10$ par action. Eu &#233;gard aux
transactions, CCE pr&#233;voit de collecter un financement par emprunt initial
repr&#233;sentant jusqu`&#224; trois fois le RAFFIAP, pour payer aux actionnaires 10$ en
esp&#232;ces par action au moment de la cl&#244;ture, pour acqu&#233;rir les embouteilleurs
norv&#233;gien et su&#233;dois et pour financer le programme de rachat d`actions pr&#233;vu.
Une fois la transaction termin&#233;e, CCE a pr&#233;vu d`adopter un programme pour
racheter jusqu`&#224; environ un milliard de dollars en actions, puis d`adopter une
politique consistant &#224; payer un dividende annuel pr&#233;vu de 0,50$ par action, &#224; la
discr&#233;tion du conseil d`administration de CCE et de la prise en charge par
celui-ci de divers facteurs. 

La Coca-Cola Company et CCE pr&#233;voit une cl&#244;ture des transactions pour le
quatri&#232;me trimestre de l`ann&#233;e 2010. 

&#192; propos de CCR-USA et de CCRC

Au moment de la cl&#244;ture, la Coca-Cola Company rebaptisera les &#233;l&#233;ments de vente
et les &#233;l&#233;ments op&#233;rationnels de ses activit&#233;s nord-am&#233;ricaines Coca-Cola
Refreshments USA, Inc. (&#171; CCR-USA &#187;) et Coca-Cola Refreshments Canada, Ltd. (&#171;
CCRC &#187;), lesquelles seront des filiales &#224; part enti&#232;res de la Coca-Cola Company.
Suite &#224; la cl&#244;ture, la Coca-Cola Company regroupera les activit&#233;s de
Foodservice, de la Minute Maid Company, d`organisation de la cha&#238;ne
d`approvisionnement (y compris les op&#233;rations ayant trait aux produits finis),
ainsi que nos op&#233;rations d`embouteillage &#224; Philadelphie avec les activit&#233;s
nord-am&#233;ricaines de CCE pour former CCR-USA et CCRC. Aux &#201;tats-Unis, 

CCR-USA sera organis&#233;e &#224; la mani&#232;re d`une entit&#233; op&#233;rationnelle unifi&#233;e, se
distinguant par sa capacit&#233; d`englober les op&#233;rations de cha&#238;ne
d`approvisionnement, de logistique, de vente et de service &#224; la client&#232;le. Au
Canada, CCRC sera une organisation unique consacr&#233; &#224; la production, au
marketing, &#224; la vente et &#224; la distribution. L`op&#233;ration nord-am&#233;ricaine restante
de la Coca-Cola Company continuera d`&#234;tre responsable du marketing de la marque
et du soutien aux franchises. Des informations concernant les plans de
structure, de direction et d`int&#233;gration seront bient&#244;t fournis. 

Une fois termin&#233;es, les transactions devraient g&#233;n&#233;rer des synergies
op&#233;rationnelles d`environ 350 millions de dollars sur quatre ans pour 

la Coca-Cola Company et on pr&#233;voit une augmentation des b&#233;n&#233;fices par action sur
une base enti&#232;rement dilu&#233;ed`ici 2012. En outre, en Am&#233;rique du Nord, cela
devrait g&#233;n&#233;rer des synergies de syst&#232;me qui avec le temps entra&#238;neront une
hausse du taux de croissance et des flux de tr&#233;sorerie sur une base pro forma.
Au pro forma pour cette acquisition, les activit&#233;s nord am&#233;ricaines, comprenant
CCR-USA et CCRC, auraient g&#233;n&#233;r&#233; environ 19,2 milliards de dollars de recettes
et un RAFFIAP de 3,6 milliards de dollars en 2009. 

Perspectives de la Coca-Cola Company pour 2010

En raison de ces accords, la Coca-Cola Company n`a effectu&#233; aucun rachat
d`actions en cours de l`exercice fiscal actuel, et elle continuera de se tenir
en dehors du march&#233; jusqu`&#224; la cl&#244;ture de cette transaction. Cependant, la
soci&#233;t&#233; continue de vouloir racheter 1,5 milliard en 2010. 

&#192; propos de la nouvelle CCE

CCE sera le partenaire strat&#233;gique d`embouteillage de la Coca-Cola Company en
Europe occidentale, et deviendra le troisi&#232;me plus important embouteilleur
ind&#233;pendant du monde. Pour refl&#233;ter la position de CCE comme partenaire
strat&#233;gique d`embouteillage de la Coca-Cola Company en Europe occidentale, les
soci&#233;t&#233;s passeront un accord d`embouteillage de 10+10 ans ainsi qu`un accord de
cinq ans sur l`&#233;tablissement des prix. Au pro forma, avec les contributions de
la Norv&#232;ge et de la Su&#232;de, CCE aurait g&#233;n&#233;r&#233; en 2009 environ 7,3 milliards de
dollars de recettes, 850 millions de dollars de b&#233;n&#233;fice d`exploitation et un
RAFFIAP de 1,2 milliard de dollars. 

&#192; la cl&#244;ture, avant le rachat des actions pr&#233;vu, CCE pr&#233;voit que sa dette nette
s`&#233;l&#232;vera &#224; environ 2 milliards de dollars. Imm&#233;diatement apr&#232;s la cl&#244;ture et
avant le rachat des actions, CCE devrait avoir environ 350 &#224; 360 millions
d`actions en circulation sur une base pleinement dilu&#233;e, ce qui est &#224; peu pr&#232;s
comparable au nombre total d`actions &#233;mises en souscription publique par CCE &#224;
l`heure actuelle. 

Peu apr&#232;s la cl&#244;ture, on pr&#233;voit que le conseil de CCE annoncera un programme
planifi&#233; de rachat des actions pour environ un milliard de dollars et un
dividende annuel initial de 0,50$ par action. Le paiement des dividendes en
esp&#232;ces et les rachats de stock par CCE seront &#224; la discr&#233;tion du Conseil
d`administration de CCE, en conformit&#233; avec la loi applicable et apr&#232;s avoir
pris en compte divers facteurs, y compris, sans s`y limiter, la situation
financi&#232;re de CCE, ses r&#233;sultats d`exploitation, ses besoins en esp&#232;ces actuels
et anticip&#233;s et ses plans de croissance. Par cons&#233;quent, il ne peut pas &#234;tre
certain que CCE paiera des dividendes &#224; ses actionnaires ou proc&#233;dera &#224; des
rachats d`actions, et aucune assurance ne pourra &#234;tre donn&#233;e quant au montant
des dividendes ou des rachats d`actions, si le Conseil d`administration de CCE
estime qu`il doit en &#234;tre ainsi. 

CCE gardera la raison sociale de Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. et son si&#232;ge
continuera &#224; &#234;tre bas&#233; &#224; Atlanta. Les actions de CCE continueront &#224; &#234;tre
&#233;chang&#233;es &#224; la bourse de New York sous le t&#233;l&#233;scripteur de CCE. John Brock, PDG,
Bill Douglas, directeur des finances, Hubert Patricot, pr&#233;sident du groupe
europ&#233;en, ainsi que les autres membres de la direction de CCE continueront &#224;
g&#233;rer la soci&#233;t&#233;. En outre, les directeurs ind&#233;pendants en place actuellement
continueront &#224; faire partie conseil de CCE. 

Perspectives de CCE pour l`ann&#233;e 2010

En raison de ces accords, CCE n`a effectu&#233; aucun rachat d`actions en cours de
l`exercice fiscal actuel, et elle continuera de se tenir en dehors du march&#233;

suppl&#233;mentaires sur les perspectives de l`exercice fiscal 2010 lors de son bilan
de premier trimestre, pr&#233;vu prochainement.

La direction a d&#233;cid&#233; de fournir des informations financi&#232;res au pro forma pour les affaires de la soci&#233;t&#233; en Am&#233;rique du Nord, refl&#233;tant

beschr&#228;nkte CCE-Aktie und USD 10 je Aktie in bar eintauschen

Die Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) und Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (NYSE: CCE)
k&#252;ndigen an, dass sie eine Vereinbarung eingegangen sind, die das
Coca-Cola-System in Nordamerika strategisch f&#246;rdern und den Langzeitwert f&#252;r
alle Aktion&#228;re vorantreiben wird. Zus&#228;tzlich haben sich die Parteien
grunds&#228;tzlich auf die Ausweitung des Europagesch&#228;fts von CCE geeinigt. 

&#8222;Unsere Vision 2020 setzt entscheidende und rechtzeitige Ma&#223;nahmen zur
fortlaufenden Verbesserung und Entwicklung unseres globalen Franchisesystems
voraus, um unsere Kunden und Verbraucher auf der ganzen Welt so gut wie m&#246;glich
zu bedienen. Im Einklang mit dieser Vision, unserer gemeinsamen Gewinnstrategie,
handeln wir heute als ein aufeinander abgestimmtes System", sagte der
Vorsitzende und Chief Executive Officer der Coca-Cola Company, Muhtar Kent. &#8222;Wir
&#252;bernehmen nicht CCE, sondern nur das Nordamerika-Gesch&#228;ft. CCE bleibt auch
weiterhin einer unserer wichtigsten Abf&#252;llpartner mit herausragendem Management
und finanziellen sowie operativen F&#228;higkeiten. Wir glauben fest und
unersch&#252;tterlich an unser einzigartiges und florierendes globales Abf&#252;llsystem.
Unsere neue Nordamerika-Struktur wird eine noch nie dagewesene Kombination an
Gesch&#228;ften erschaffen, die uns zur gr&#246;&#223;ten Gewinngemeinschaft im Bereich der
alkoholfreien, trinkfertigen Getr&#228;nke machen wird. Diese Transaktion bietet
sowohl den Aktion&#228;ren der Coca-Cola Company als auch jenen von CCE einen
unwiderstehlichen Nutzen und schafft wesentliche und nachhaltige Vorteile f&#252;r
die Interessengruppen beider Unternehmen." 

Kent fuhr fort: &#8222;Unsere Nordamerika-Gesch&#228;ftsstruktur hat sich seit der Gr&#252;ndung
von CCE 1986 kaum ver&#228;ndert, w&#228;hrend sich der Markt und die Industrie drastisch
weiterentwickelt haben. Durch diese Transaktion wandeln wir passives Kapital in
aktives Kapital um, wodurch wir die direkte Kontrolle &#252;ber unsere Investitionen
in Nordamerika erhalten, um das Wachstum zu beschleunigen und die
Langzeitrentabilit&#228;t anzutreiben. Wir werden eng mit unseren Abf&#252;llpartnern
zusammenarbeiten, um ein hochentwickeltes Franchisesystem f&#252;r die einzigartigen
Bed&#252;rfnisse des Nordamerika-Marktes zu schaffen. Zus&#228;tzlich werden wir die
Bereiche Herstellung, Wertsch&#246;pfungskette und Logistik neu gestalten, um im
Laufe der Zeit Kosten zu sparen. Vor allem die Schaffung eines einheitlichen
Betriebssystems wird uns in eine strategisch bessere Position f&#252;r die
Vermarktung und den Vertrieb der beliebtesten alkoholfreien Getr&#228;nkemarken in
Nordamerika bringen. Gleichzeitig st&#228;rken wir in Europa unser Franchisesystem
weiter, um eine breitere, zusammenh&#228;ngende geografische Abdeckung zu erreichen
und unsere F&#252;hrungsposition in den Bereichen Vermarktung und Vertrieb zu
optimieren." 

Der Vorsitzende und Chief Executive Officer von CCE, John Brock, sagte: &#8222;Diese
Ver&#228;nderung schafft durch den Verkauf des Nordamerika-Gesch&#228;fts zum Zeitwert
einen deutlichen kurzfristigen Nutzen f&#252;r die Aktion&#228;re und bringt den
Anteilseignern von CCE durch Baraussch&#252;ttungen und geplante Aktienr&#252;ckk&#228;ufe mehr
als USD 4 Milliarden in bar ein. Gleichzeitig erm&#246;glicht dies unseren
Anteilseignern, Anteilskapital an einem Verkaufs- und Vertriebsunternehmen mit
verbessertem Wachstumsprofil zu halten. In Zukunft werden CCE-Anteilseigner auch
von der Ausweitung unseres Europagesch&#228;ftes und unserer verbesserten
finanziellen Flexibilit&#228;t profitieren." 

Brock f&#252;gte hinzu: &#8222;CCE bleibt der vorherrschende westeurop&#228;ische Abf&#252;ller und
ein strategisch wichtiger Partner der Coca-Cola Company. Unser Europagesch&#228;ft
bedient einen attraktiven Markt mit wachsendem Volumen und einem vom steigenden
Pro-Kopf-Verbrauch angetriebenen Profit. Daher wird CCE ein verbessertes Profil
mit erh&#246;hten Erl&#246;sen, Margen und Wachstumserwartungen f&#252;r die Ertr&#228;ge je Aktie
erreichen. Zusammen mit der Coca-Cola Company werden wir auch weiterhin die
Effizienz unserer Gesch&#228;fte in unserer ausgeweiteten Pr&#228;senz in Europa
verbessern. Diese Aktionen st&#228;rken unsere F&#228;higkeit, effizient und nachhaltig in
Europa zu konkurrieren, und stellen den Beginn einer aufregenden Zeit mit
langfristigem Wachstum f&#252;r das Gesch&#228;ft und die Aktion&#228;re von CCE dar." 

Kent sagte zum Abschluss: &#8222;Dies ist wahrhaftig ein historischer Moment f&#252;r das
Coca-Cola-System. Als weltweit f&#252;hrendes Getr&#228;nkeunternehmen freuen wir uns sehr
auf die vielen M&#246;glichkeiten, die vor uns liegen, und ich kann ohne Zweifel
sagen, dass es kein besseres Gewerbe gibt. Es wird erwartet, dass die fast USD
650 Milliarden erwirtschaftende globale Industrie der alkoholfreien,
trinkfertigen Getr&#228;nke im Laufe der n&#228;chsten Jahre schneller w&#228;chst als das
weltweite BIP, und wir befinden uns in der bestm&#246;glichen Ausgangslage, um aus
dieser unglaublichen Gelegenheit in Nordamerika und Europa Kapital zu schlagen.
Diese gemeinsamen Aktionen st&#228;rken unser Vertrauen in unsere Vision 2020 noch
weiter, durch die wir unsere Systemertr&#228;ge mehr als verdoppeln und die Einheiten
auf &#252;ber 3 Milliarden pro Tag verdoppeln wollen. Da unser System so ausgeglichen
ist wie noch nie, ist das Timing perfekt, und wir sind der &#220;berzeugung, dass
diese Aktionen eine neue Zeit der Gewinne f&#252;r unser Coca-Cola-System einl&#228;uten
werden." 

Einzelheiten zu den Transaktionen

In einer vorwiegend bargeldlosen Transaktion wird die Coca-Cola Company das
gesamte Nordamerika-Gesch&#228;ft von CCE &#252;bernehmen, das aus etwa 75 Prozent des
US-amerikanischen und fast 100 Prozent des kanadischen Abf&#252;llervolumens besteht.
Bei Abschluss des Gesch&#228;fts wird die Coca-Cola Company die direkte Kontrolle
&#252;ber ca. 90 Prozent des gesamten Nordamerika-Volumens haben, einschlie&#223;lich
ihrer derzeitigen direkten Gesch&#228;fte. Die &#220;bernahme der Verm&#246;genswerte und
Verbindlichkeiten des Nordamerika-Gesch&#228;ftes von CCE durch die Coca-Cola Company
beinhaltet den Gegenwert der 34 Prozent, welche die Coca-Cola Company derzeit an
CCE h&#228;lt, der auf der Grundlage eines tats&#228;chlichen Drei&#223;ig-Tage-Durchschnitts
zum 24. Februar 2010 auf USD 3,4 Milliarden gesch&#228;tzt wird. Zus&#228;tzlich umfasst
der Gegenwert die &#220;bernahme der USD 8,88 Milliarden Schulden von CCE und aller
nordamerikanischen Verm&#246;genswerte und Verbindlichkeiten - einschlie&#223;lich der
Gehaltssteigerungen von CCE f&#252;r Nordamerika in H&#246;he von USD 580 Millionen
(Stand: 31. Dezember 2009) und bestimmte andere einmalige Kosten und Bez&#252;ge. 

In einer Parallelvereinbarung haben sich die Coca-Cola Company und CCE
grunds&#228;tzlich darauf geeinigt, dass CCE, vorbehaltlich der Unterzeichnung des
endg&#252;ltigen Vertrages, die Abf&#252;llbetriebe der Coca-Cola Company in Norwegen und
Schweden f&#252;r USD 822 Millionen kauft und das Recht hat, die 83 Prozent Anteile
der Coca-Cola Company an seinen deutschen Abf&#252;llbetrieben 18 bis 36 Monate nach
Abschluss zum Zeitwert zu &#252;bernehmen. 

Durch eine Absplitterung wird ein neues Unternehmen geschaffen, das den Namen
Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. beh&#228;lt und die Europagesch&#228;fte von CCE umfasst. Die
Aktion&#228;re von CCE k&#246;nnen jede existierende CCE-Aktie f&#252;r eine Aktie des neuen
Unternehmens eintauschen und halten so 100 Prozent dieses neuen Unternehmens. 

CCE wird seinen Anteilseignern, die Coca-Cola Company ausgeschlossen, eine
besondere einmalige Baraussch&#252;ttung von USD 10 pro Aktie anbieten. In Verbindung
mit den Transaktionen erwartet CCE eine Erh&#246;hung der anf&#228;nglichen
Fremdfinanzierung von bis zu 3,0x EBITDA, um den Anteilseignern bei Abschluss
USD 10 pro Aktie in bar zu zahlen, die norwegischen und schwedischen
Abf&#252;llbetriebe zu &#252;bernehmen und das erwartete Aktienr&#252;ckkaufprogramm zu
finanzieren. Es wird erwartet, dass CCE nach Abschluss der Transaktion ein
Programm zum R&#252;ckkauf von Aktien im Wert von bis zu ca.USD 1 Milliarde und eine
Richtlinie zur Zahlung einer erwarteten j&#228;hrlichen Dividende von USD 0,50 pro
Aktie einf&#252;hren wird, nach Ermessen des CCE-Aufsichtsrates und unter
Ber&#252;cksichtigung verschiedener Faktoren. 

Die Coca-Cola Company und CCE erwarten, dass die Transaktionen im vierten
Quartal 2010 abgeschlossen werden. 

&#220;ber CCR-USA und CCRC

Bei Abschluss wird die Coca-Cola Company die Verkaufs- und Betriebsbereiche der
Nordamerika-Gesch&#228;fte in Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. (&#8222;CCR-USA"), und
Coca-Cola Refreshments Canada, Ltd. (&#8222;CCRC"), umbenennen, die hundertprozentige
T&#246;chter der Coca-Cola Company sein werden. Nach Abschluss wird die Coca-Cola
Company das Lebensmittelgesch&#228;ft, die Minute Maid Company, die
Versorgungskettenorganisation einschlie&#223;lich des Endproduktbereichs und die
unternehmenseigenen Abf&#252;llbetriebe in Philadelphia mit dem Nordamerika-Gesch&#228;ft
von CCE zusammenschlie&#223;en und so CCR-USA und CCRC gr&#252;nden. In den USA wird
CCR-USA als einheitliche Wirtschaftseinheit mit individuellen Ressourcen f&#252;r die
Wertsch&#246;pfungskette, die Logistik, den Vertrieb und den Kundenservice
organisiert werden. CCRC in Kanada wird eine Organisation ausschlie&#223;lich f&#252;r die
Herstellung, die Vermarktung, den Verkauf und die Verteilung sein. Die
restlichen nordamerikanischen Betriebe der Coca-Cola Company werden auch
weiterhin f&#252;r die Vermarktung der Marke und die Franchiseunterst&#252;tzung
verantwortlich sein. Details &#252;ber die Struktur-, F&#252;hrungs- und Integrationspl&#228;ne
werden noch ver&#246;ffentlicht. 

Es wird erwartet, dass die Transaktionen, sobald sie abgeschlossen sind, f&#252;r die
Coca-Cola Company operative Synergien von etwa USD 350 Millionen &#252;ber vier Jahre
erzeugen und ab 2012 voll verw&#228;ssert dem Ertrag je Aktie zugeschrieben werden
k&#246;nnen.Dies wird dar&#252;ber hinaus in Nordamerika Systemsynergien erzeugen, die im
Laufe der Zeit die Wachstumsrate und den Cashflow auf einer Pro-forma-Basis
erh&#246;hen. Das Nordamerika-Gesch&#228;ft, einschlie&#223;lich CCR-USA und CCRC, h&#228;tte 2009
pro forma f&#252;r diese &#220;bernahme Ertr&#228;ge in H&#246;he von etwa USD 19,2 Milliarden und
EBITDA von USD 3,6 Milliarden erzeugt. 

Die Prognosen der Coca-Cola Company f&#252;r 2010 

Aufgrund dieser Vereinbarung hat die Coca-Cola Company im laufenden
Gesch&#228;ftsjahr keine Aktienr&#252;ckk&#228;ufe vorgenommen und wird dies auch bis zum
Abschluss dieser Transaktionen unterlassen. Das Unternehmen bleibt jedoch dazu
entschlossen, im Jahr 2010 Aktien im Wert von USD 1,5 Milliarden zur&#252;ckzukaufen.


&#220;ber das neue CCE

CCE wird der strategische Abf&#252;llpartner der Coca-Cola Company in Westeuropa und
der drittgr&#246;&#223;te unabh&#228;ngige Abf&#252;ller weltweit sein. Das Unternehmen wird einen
10+10-Jahres-Vertrag &#252;ber die Abf&#252;llung und einen 5-Jahres-Vertrag &#252;ber die
Preisermittlung pro Ereignis eingehen, welche die Position von CCE als
strategischer Abf&#252;llpartner der Coca-Cola Company in Westeuropa widerspiegeln.
Einschlie&#223;lich der Beitr&#228;ge aus Norwegen und Schweden h&#228;tte CCE 2009 pro forma
etwa USD 7,3 Milliarden an Ertr&#228;gen, USD 850 Millionen an Betriebseinnahmen und
EBITDA in H&#246;he von USD 1,2 Milliarden erzeugt. 

CCE geht davon aus, dass das Unternehmen bei Abschluss und vor den geplanten
Aktienr&#252;ckk&#228;ufen eine Nettoschuld von ca. USD 2 Milliarden haben wird. Es wird
erwartet, dass CCE direkt nach Abschluss und vor den Aktienr&#252;ckk&#228;ufen etwa
350-360 Millionen ausgegebene, voll verw&#228;sserte Aktien hat, vergleichbar im
Wesentlichen mit den CCE-Aktien, die sich derzeit in &#246;ffentlicher Hand befinden.


Es wird erwartet, dass der CCE-Aufsichtsrat kurz nach Abschluss ein geplantes
Aktienr&#252;ckkaufprogramm in H&#246;he von ca. USD 1 Milliarde und eine anf&#228;ngliche
j&#228;hrliche Dividende von USD 0,50 pro Aktie ank&#252;ndigen wird. Die Auszahlung von
Dividenden in bar und Aktienr&#252;ckk&#228;ufe durch CCE liegen, in &#220;bereinstimmung mit
dem geltenden Recht, im Ermessen des CCE-Aufsichtsrates, der dar&#252;ber unter
Ber&#252;cksichtigung verschiedener Faktoren, wie beispielsweise der finanziellen
Situation von CCE, der Betriebsergebnisse, des derzeitigen und erwarteten
Bargeldbedarfs und der Wachstumspl&#228;ne, entscheidet. Daher kann nicht garantiert
werden, dass CCE Dividenden an seine Anteilseigner auszahlen oder Aktien
zur&#252;ckkaufen wird, und auch der Umfang solcher Dividenden oder Aktienr&#252;ckk&#228;ufe,
falls sich der CCE-Aufsichtsrat dazu entscheidet, kann nicht garantiert werden. 

CCE wird den Firmennamen Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. beibehalten, weiterhin
seinen Firmensitz in Atlanta haben und auch weiter an der NYSE-B&#246;rse unter dem
B&#246;rsenk&#252;rzel CCE gehandelt werden. Vorstandsvorsitzender und Chief Executive
Officer John Brock, Chief Financial Officer Bill Douglas, Hubert Patricot,
Pr&#228;sident der European Group, und andere Mitglieder des CCE-Managements werden
auch weiterhin das Unternehmen leiten. Dar&#252;ber hinaus wird der CCE-Aufsichtsrat
weiterhin aus den derzeitigen unabh&#228;ngigen Direktoren bestehen. 

Die Prognosen von CCE f&#252;r 2010 

Aufgrund dieser Vereinbarungen hat CCE im laufenden Gesch&#228;ftsjahr noch keine
Aktienr&#252;ckk&#228;ufe vorgenommen und plant dies auch erst nach Abschluss der
Transaktionen. CCE hat vor, in seiner anstehenden Telefonkonferenz zum ersten
Quartal zus&#228;tzliche Informationen &#252;ber die Aussichten f&#252;r das Gesch&#228;ftsjahr 2010
zu ver&#246;ffentlichen. 

Zus&#228;tzliche Informationen

Transaktionen genehmigt, die der Zustimmung durch die &#246;ffentlichen Aktion&#228;re von
CCE und den &#252;blichen beh&#246;rdlichen Zustimmungen unterliegen.

 Das Unternehmen meldet seine finanziellen Ergebnisse gem&#228;&#223; den allgemein anerkannten Rechnungslegungsgrunds&#228;tzen der Vereinigten Staaten (GAAP). Die Unternehmensleitung glaubt jedoch, dass gewisse nicht GAAP-konforme finanzielle Ma&#223;nahmen, die bei der Leitung des Unternehmens verwendet werden, den Nutzern dieser finanziellen Informationen zus&#228;tzliche, bedeutsame Vergleiche liefern k&#246;nnen. Die Unternehmensleitung stellt finanzielle Pro-forma-Informationen f&#252;r das Nordamerika-Gesch&#228;ft des Unternehmens zur 
 Verf&#252;gung, welche die &#220;bernahme des Nordamerika-Gesch&#228;fts der Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE), einschlie&#223;lich der CCE Corporate, widerspiegeln. In unten stehender Tabelle finden Sie die finanziellen Pro-forma-Informationen f&#252;r das zum 31. Dezember 2009 abgelaufene Jahr. Nicht GAAP-konforme finanzielle Ma&#223;nahmen sollten als Erg&#228;nzung und nicht als Alternative zu den gemeldeten, gem&#228;&#223; GAAP vorbereiteten Ergebnissen des Unternehmens gesehen werden.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has several other botnets in its crosshairs, and believes it can use the same legal tactic against them that it deployed last week to strike at the Waledac botnet's command-and-control centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the company also admitted that it had not yet severed all communications between the controllers of Waledac and the thousands of compromised Windows computers used by hackers to pitch bogus security software and send a small amount of spam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This shows it can be done," said Richard Boscovich, senior attorney with Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit. "Each botnet is different, of course, but this is another arrow in the quiver. This is not the last [effort].... We have other operations on the drawing board."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last Wednesday, Microsoft announced that it had been granted a court order that yanked nearly 300 sites from the Internet. Those sites, Microsoft said, were a key link between hackers and the PCs that make up the Waledac botnet. The legal tactic, which garnered accolades from many security professionals as a precedent-setting move, resulted in what Microsoft called "a major botnet takedown" of Waledac, a fact that some researchers disputed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same method can and will be applied to other botnets, Boscovich said. He declined to say which zombie PC army is next on Microsoft's hit list. "Of course this is scalable," he said when asked whether the legal action against Waledac would work against other botnets, or was a one-off. "This is another tool we can now use, another mechanism that is available."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, when Microsoft officials sat down in early January to decide which botnet to target, they started with a list of six, then narrowed it to three, from which they selected Waledac. The remaining five unnamed botnets remain on Microsoft's list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We wanted to challenge ourselves technically," said Boscovich when asked why Waledac was chosen. "From the technical standpoint, it had a certain reputation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waledac does have a reputation. The malware that infects victimized PCs was created by, and the botnet is maintained by, hackers who previously flooded the Internet with the Storm bot from early 2007 through mid-2008. Waledac's makers "definitely know the ins and outs," Joe Stewart, director of malware analysis at SecureWorks and a noted botnet researcher, said last Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boscovich admitted that Waledac wasn't the world's biggest botnet, but said several things recommended it for the debut of Microsoft's legal approach to bot smashing. Among them: The identified command-and-control domains were all registered with one domain registrar, VeriSign, which made it easier to coordinate the site shutdowns; and Microsoft had been in contact with several independent researchers who had dug deep into the malware's code and the botnet's behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as Microsoft said it would again swing the legal sword, it also admitted it had not completely cut ties between the infected PCs and the hackers who control them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They were severely impacted [by the legal action], and we expect the severity of the impact to increase over the next several days," said T.J. Campana, a senior program manager who works for Boscovich in the company's Digital Crimes Unit. When asked whether communications between the Waledac hackers and the botnet's PCs had been comprehensively severed, Campana answered, "By and large, the answer is no."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Microsoft claimed it had grabbed control of more than 60,000 bots in the Waledac collection after the court order shuttered the 277 targeted domains. Several security researchers, however, questioned whether the tactic would cripple Waledac , or even disrupt its activities, since hackers have multiple mechanisms for passing commands to machines infected with Waledac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a fall-back, Waledac bots can communicate to their controllers "indefinitely" using IP (Internet Protocol) addresses that are hard-coded into the bot Trojan, SecureWorks' Stewart said last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Campana acknowledged those alternate command-and-control links within Waledac, and said Microsoft is attacking those as well. He declined to provide details of what Microsoft was doing, or when -- or even if -- the Waledac bots would be unreachable by their makers. "In addition to the legal action against the domains, we have taken other technical measures," said Campana. "At this point, we're still working that angle and actively adapting our measures."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several message security and spam filtering companies and organizations, including Google 's Postini and the U.K.-based SpamHaus, also disputed Microsoft's claim last week that Waledac was a "major distributor of spam" and that crippling it would reduce spam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symantec's MessageLabs also weighed in on the impact issue, and like other vendors, downplayed Waledac's significance. "There's been no real noticeable effect of the takedown," Matt Sergeant, a senior anti-spam technologist with MessageLabs, said in an e-mail. "It's one of the smallest botnets out there, and the court order appears to have had very little effect on its output."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft countered, saying it's too early to gauge its anti-Waledac moves. "We're still looking at the impact this has had," said Campana, referring specifically to the monitoring Microsoft's doing of the volume of spam addressed to Windows Live Hotmail accounts. "It's somewhat premature to say 'yay or nay' yet." The next one or two weeks will tell the tale, Campana agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Boscovich would not promise that Microsoft would make Hotmail spam data public. "We'll look at that [decision] fairly soon," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It isn't the first time that Microsoft has said it has crippled a botnet built by this group of hackers. In April 2008, the company took credit for crushing the Storm botnet -- Waledac's predecessor -- saying that the malware search-and-destroy tool it distributes to Windows users every month disinfected so many bots that the hackers threw in the towel .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with the Waledac take-down, researchers at the time disputed Microsoft's claim that it had beaten Storm into submission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Campana urged Windows users to run the Microsoft-made Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) to scrub Waledac from infected systems, and up-to-date anti-virus software to keep it off still-clean machines. "This is definitely a preventable issue," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.
