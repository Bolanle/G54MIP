&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Goldman Sachs hedge fund that launched in January with over $6 billion under management lost close to $1 billion by September, according to the Financial Times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fund, known as Goldman Sachs Investment Partners, has told investors it lost $989 million by September, the newspaper said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the fund's losses stemmed from investments in commodities, basic materials, metals, mining, energy and agriculture, the FT said. Losses from investments in convertible bonds -- debt instruments that can convert into equity -- also contributed to poor returns, the newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokesmen could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average hedge fund has lost roughly 19 percent so far this year, according to data from Hedge Fund Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

president &amp; CEO of J.P. King Auction Company. "In addition to its
wonderful amenities, this French Quarter Estate is only a short stroll
from Jackson Square."

   The home was originally built in 1817, a two-story French Quarter
estate full of history and richness. In the mid-1900's, it served as a
Gallery Circle Theatre and since has been renovated with modern and
luxurious amenities. The focal point of the 3 + suites, 4.5 bathroom
estate is centered on the spectacular private courtyard with pool that
is perfect for entertaining guests or escaping the energy of the city
for quiet relaxation. The courtyard's garden area contains a sprinkler
system and automatic fertilizer.

"It's truly un-describable. It has a personality all of its own, where
each room has its own theme."

   The estate boasts hand painted murals throughout, two kitchens,
beautiful copper ceilings, cypress flooring, exposed brick, granite
countertops, spiral staircase, theatre room, antique bar area and a
unique and open layout. The French Quarter Mansion has impeccable
architecture throughout the property, preserving the traditional
appearance and the nostalgic feel that the area is known for. The
estate offers complete privacy from the street with a two-car garage
and private parking in the courtyard.

   New Orleans is known as the birthplace of jazz, a vibrant city
full of diverse culture, deep historical traditions, quaint
neighborhoods and fantastic cuisine. The estate is near some of the
major attractions in New Orleans including Cafe du Monde, French
Market, Bourbon Street, Aquarium of the Americas and the Moon Walk
along the Mississippi River. This central location is ideal for
experiencing annual Mardi Gras celebrations, performing arts, museums,
professional sporting events and the pulsating nightlife.

&lt;p&gt;  (Repeats to additional subscribers)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. government could
explicitly back a limited amount of Fannie Mae FNM.P and
Freddie Mac FRE.P unsecured debt to bolster confidence in the
housing finance companies, JPMorgan Chase  Co. analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Waning support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt has
pushed their borrowing costs higher, making it harder for them
to stabilize the housing market as the biggest buyers of home
loans. At issue is a new federal program that guarantees some
bank debt, which to some is a sign the U.S. government is less
prepared to back the two "agencies", the analysts said in the
Oct. 31 report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe there is a possibility that the government
could institute a guarantee of agency debt (up to 3 years in
maturity, for instance) which would help reassure investors,"
the analysts, led by Matthew Jozoff, said in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Borrowing costs are key for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as
the financial crisis increases consumers' reliance on the
"government-sponsored enterprises" for credit. The Treasury and
a federal regulator in September bolstered support of the
companies by placing them in a conservatorship, and pledging
capital injections if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan noted that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke
last week discussed the possibility of greater government
backing of the companies, which regulators have said carry an
"effective" guarantee due to the Treasury's capital backstop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An explicit guarantee of agency debt would require
Congressional approval, however, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yield spread premiums on Freddie Mac five-year notes
increased about 3 basis points on Monday to 138.5 basis points,
according to TradeWeb. The spread had hit a record 160 basis
points early last week, before Bernanke's comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Al Yoon, Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities analysts recommended 26 small- and mid-cap stocks, mainly from healthcare and technology sectors, as these stocks are expected to outperform the broader market amid a weakening global economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brokerage views the "SMiD 26," which has names like Gen-Probe (GPRO.O), Myriad Genetics Inc (MYGN.O) and Cabot Microelectronics Corp (CCMP.O), as core investments over the next 12 to 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stocks included in the list have stable financial characteristics, price momentum better than their peers and a market capitalization of $7 billion or less, the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list also features farm-equipment maker Agco Corp (AG.N), which had recently posted better-than-expected third-quarter results. Equity strategist Thomas Lee expects the company to post a profit in the fourth quarter and 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only bank to make it to Lee's list is PrivateBancorp Inc (PVTB.O), which recently reported a narrower-than-expected third-quarter loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The successful execution of PVTB's strategic growth plan has dramatically improved its risk profile, with residential development loans falling to only 6 percent of total loans vs. 14 percent one year ago, also with the balance sheet doubling in size," Lee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee also believes the bank remains one of the few positioned on offense to take advantage of weaker competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 26 stocks, all rated "overweight," are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AGCO Corp (AG.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alberto-Culver Co ACV.N&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alkermes Inc (ALKS.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BJ's Wholesale Club Inc BJ.N&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cabot Microelectronics Corp (CCMP.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cephalon Inc CEPH.O&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dean Foods Co (DF.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equifax Inc (EFX.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gen-Probe Inc (GPRO.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global Payments Inc (GPN.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDEXX Laboratories Inc (IDXX.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McAfee Inc MFE.N&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MFA Mortgage Investments (MFA.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minerals Technologies Inc (MTX.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MKS Instruments Inc (MKSI.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myriad Genetics Inc (MYGN.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Instruments Corp (NATI.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NeuStar Inc (NSR.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omnicare Inc (OCR.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PrivateBancorp Inc (PVTB.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Half International Inc (RHI.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strayer Education Inc (STRA.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volcano Corp (VOLC.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waste Connections Inc (WCN.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wind River Systems Inc WIND.O&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WMS Industries Inc (WMS.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Aftab Ahmed in Bangalore; Editing by Himani Sarkar, Amitha Rajan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) will likely post a fourth-quarter loss, its first ever as a public company, due to the "stressed" equity environment over the past two months, which will also weigh on Morgan Stanley's (MS.N) quarterly results, Merrill Lynch analyst Guy Moszkowski said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moszkowski, however, said that Morgan Stanley should be in a relatively better position than Goldman because of its business mix -- limited private equity and very little proprietary equity trading at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We still think GS remains in many ways at the forefront of the capital markets industry, but if it can't consistently produce a premium return on equity (ROE), it's not going to be able to continue to have the premium valuation multiple that it has enjoyed," he wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is particularly exposed to global equity market corrections due to its large corporate private-equity portfolio, equity proprietary trading business and exposure to Chinese equities through its stake in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (601398.SS) (1398.HK), Moszkowski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the global markets have corrected around 30 percent in last few weeks, likely driving more than a $2 billion mark in these positions, the analyst noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyst now expects Goldman to post a fourth-quarter loss of 49 cents per share, compared with his prior profit view of $2.98 per share. He also lowered his price target on the stock to $100 from $159 to reflect the fourth-quarter loss estimate and uncertainty on 2009 ROE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With this 4Q loss, GS would have underperformed MS for 2 straight quarters in terms of ROE, and our forecast for2009 is for ROE of around 10 percent," Moszkowski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cut Morgan Stanley's fourth-quarter earnings estimate to 36 cents a share from 72 cents, mainly reflecting the expectation of another significant leveraged finance mark of $1.4 billion as spreads widened significantly in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moszkowski continues to rate Goldman a "neutral," and Morgan Stanley a "buy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman were up more than 2 percent at $94.61 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange, while those of Morgan Stanley were up about 5 percent at $18.34.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Neha Singh in Bangalore; Editing by Himani Sarkar)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  COPENHAGEN, DENMARK, Nov 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Maersk Line, a division of the A.P. Moller-Maersk Group, and IBM (NYSE:
IBM) today announced a new agreement for IBM to provide IT services from
India and Denmark.

    Maersk Line is one of the leading liner shipping companies in the world,
serving customers all over the globe with a fleet of more than 470
container vessels and nearly 2 million containers.

    This new agreement covers infrastructure platform services implementing
new servers, consolidating and updating of existing server platforms and
upgrading of middleware software to new releases. The contract with IBM is
another significant step for Maersk Line in standardizing processes and
reducing operating costs by increased use of global provisioning of
services and of global centers of competence.

    The agreement extends the five year agreement signed May 2007 for IBM to
manage Maersk's IT infrastructure and services. The agreement supports a
flexible and resilient IT platform with the aim of achieving significant
cost savings for Maersk by leveraging IBM's global economies of scale.

    "It is a key part of Maersk's IT strategy to make increasing use of IBM's

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 3 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) will
likely post a fourth-quarter loss, its first ever as a public
company, due to the "stressed" equity environment over the past
two months, which will also weigh on Morgan Stanley's (MS.N)
quarterly results, Merrill Lynch analyst Guy Moszkowski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moszkowski, however, said that Morgan Stanley should be in
a relatively better position than Goldman because of its
business mix -- limited private equity and very little
proprietary equity trading at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We still think GS remains in many ways at the forefront of
the capital markets industry, but if it can't consistently
produce apremium return on equity (ROE), it's not going to be
able to continue to have the premium valuationmultiple that it
has enjoyed," he wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman is particularly exposed to global equity market
corrections due to its largecorporate private-equity portfolio,
equity proprietary trading business and exposure to Chinese
equities through its stake in Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China Ltd (601398.SS) (1398.HK), Moszkowski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the global
markets have corrected around 30 percent in last few weeks,
likely driving more than a $2 billion mark in these positions,
the analyst noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst now expects Goldman to post a fourth-quarter
loss of 49 cents per share, compared with his prior profit view
of $2.98 per share. He also lowered his price target on the
stock to $100 from $159 to reflect the fourth-quarter loss
estimate and uncertainty on 2009 ROE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With this 4Q loss, GS would haveunderperformed MS for 2
straight quarters in terms of ROE, and our forecast for2009 is
for ROE of around 10 percent," Moszkowski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He cut Morgan Stanley's fourth-quarter earnings estimate to
36 cents a share from 72 cents, mainly reflecting the
expectation of another significant leveraged finance mark of
$1.4 billion as spreads widened significantly in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moszkowski continues to rate Goldman a "neutral," and
Morgan Stanley a "buy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Goldman were up more than 2 percent at $94.61 in
morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange, while those of
Morgan Stanley were up about 5 percent at $18.34.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 3 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities analysts
recommended 26 small- and mid-cap stocks, mainly from
healthcare and technology sectors, as these stocks are expected
to outperform the broader market amid a weakening global
economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage views the "SMiD 26", which has names like
Gen-Probe (GPRO.O), Myriad Genetics Inc (MYGN.O) and Cabot
Microelectronics Corp (CCMP.O), as core investments over the
next 12 to 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stocks included in the list have stable financial
characteristics, price momentum better than their peers and a
market capitalization of $7 billion or less, the brokerage
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The list also features farm-equipment maker Agco Corp
(AG.N), which had recently posted better-than-expected
third-quarter results. Equity strategist Thomas Lee expects the
company to post a profit in the fourth quarter and 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only bank to make it to Lee's list is PrivateBancorp
Inc (PVTB.O), which recently reported a narrower-than-expected
third-quarter loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The successful execution of PVTB's strategic growth plan
has dramatically improved its risk profile, with residential
development loans falling to only 6 percent of total loans vs.
14 percent one year ago, also with the balance sheet doubling
in size," Lee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lee also believes the bank remains one of the few
positioned on offense to take advantage of weaker competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 26 stocks, all rated "overweight," are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AGCO Corp (AG.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alberto-Culver Co ACV.N&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alkermes Inc (ALKS.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BJ's Wholesale Club Inc BJ.N&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cabot Microelectronics Corp (CCMP.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cephalon Inc CEPH.O&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dean Foods Co (DF.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Equifax Inc (EFX.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gen-Probe Inc (GPRO.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global Payments Inc (GPN.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IDEXX Laboratories Inc (IDXX.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McAfee Inc MFE.N&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MFA Mortgage Investments (MFA.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Minerals Technologies Inc (MTX.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MKS Instruments Inc (MKSI.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Myriad Genetics Inc (MYGN.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; National Instruments Corp (NATI.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NeuStar Inc (NSR.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Omnicare Inc (OCR.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PrivateBancorp Inc (PVTB.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Half International Inc (RHI.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Strayer Education Inc (STRA.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Volcano Corp (VOLC.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Waste Connections Inc (WCN.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wind River Systems Inc WIND.O&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WMS Industries Inc (WMS.N)

&lt;p&gt;  LITTLETON, MA, Nov 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Marathon Technologies, the only provider of fault-tolerant, high
availability software for physical and virtual servers, today announced a
series of best practices for protecting servers running Microsoft(R)
Exchange, the industry's leading platform for e-mail, calendaring and
unified messaging, in physical and virtual environments. Businesses of
all sizes leverage Microsoft Exchange as a core component to their
business processes and communication strategies, making it imperative
that it remain up and running. Marathon's five steps to simpler Exchange
high availability are outlined below to help companies ensure that their
Exchange platforms remain robust, reliable and continuously available.
This will also be the focal point of a live webinar on November 11th
hosted by Citrix and Marathon.

    Step # 1 - Protect Against Server Failures with Quality Hardware and
Component Redundancy

    Server core components include power supplies, fans, memory, CPUs and main
logic boards. Purchasing robust, name brand servers, performing
recommended preventative maintenance, and monitoring server errors for
signs of future problems, can all help reduce the chances of Exchange
downtime due to catastrophic server failure.

    Downtime caused by server component failures can be significantly reduced
by adding redundancy at the component level. Examples are: redundant power
and cooling, ECC memory, with the ability to correct single-bit memory
errors, and combining Ethernet cards with RAID.

    Step # 2 - Get Rid of Storage Failures with Storage Device Redundancy and
RAID

    Storage protection relies on device redundancy combined with RAID storage
algorithms to protect data access and data integrity from hardware
failures. There are distinct issues for both local disk storage and for
shared, network storage. For local storage, it is quite easy to add extra
disks configured with RAID protection. A second disk controller is also
required if you want to protect against controller failures.

    Access to shared storage relies on either a fibre channel or Ethernet
storage network. To assure uninterrupted access to shared storage, these
networks must be designed to eliminate all single points of failure. This
requires redundancy of network paths, network switches, and network
connections to each storage array.

    Step # 3 - Prevent Network Failures with Redundant Network Paths, Switches
and Routers

    The network infrastructure itself must be fault-tolerant, consisting of
redundant network paths, switches, routers and other network elements.
Server connections can also be duplicated to eliminate failovers caused by
the failure of a single server or network component. Take care to ensure
that the physical network hardware does not share common components. For
example, dual-ported network cards share common hardware logic, and a
single card failure can disable both ports. Full redundancy requires
either two separate adapters or the combination of a built-in network
port along with a separate network adapter.

    Step # 4 - Forget Site Failures with Data Replication to another Site

    Site failures can range from an air conditioning failure or a leaking roof
that affects a single building, a power failure that affects a limited
local area, or a major hurricane that affects a large geographic area.
Site disruptions can last anywhere from a few hours to days or even weeks.

    There are two methods for dealing with site disasters. One method is to
tightly couple redundant servers across high speed/low latency links, to
provide zero data-loss and zero downtime. The other method is to loosely
couple redundant servers over medium speed/higher latency/greater distance
lines, to provide a disaster recovery (DR) capability where a remote
server can be restarted with a copy of the application database, which
only misses the last few updates. In the latter case, asynchronous data
replication is used to keep a backup copy of the data.

    Data replication is combined with error detection and failover tools to
help get a disaster recovery site up and running in minutes or hours,
rather than days.

    Step # 5 - Consider Virtualizing Exchange for Better High Availability

    The latest server virtualization technologies, while not required for
protecting Exchange, do offer some unique benefits that can make Exchange
protection both easier and more effective. Virtualization makes it very
easy to set up evaluation test and development environments without the
need for additional, dedicated hardware. Virtualization also allows
resources to be adjusted dynamically to accommodate growth or peak loads.

    For more on how the latest virtualization technologies makes it easier for
IT to keep users continuously connected to Microsoft Exchange, register
online for the webinar, Virtualizing Exchange - The Cold, Hard Numbers on
Why Citrix XenServer + everRun VM is the Best Platform, hosted by Marathon

&lt;p&gt;Nov 3 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded onshore
contract drilling services providers Patterson-UTI Energy Inc
(PTEN.O) and Union Drilling Inc UDRL.O to "underweight" from
"neutral," saying it saw earning risks for drilling companies
with more commoditized fleets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We see PTEN and UDRL as value traps that will likely be
range-bound with a downward bias over the next six to nine
months," analyst Kevin Pollard said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It seems fairly obvious that lower commodity prices and
brutal capital market/economic conditions will result in
sharply lower drilling activity in 2009, the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pollard expects rig counts to decline by about 21 percent
by mid-2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Patterson-UTI closed at $13.27 Friday on Nasdaq,
while those of Union Drilling closed at $5.48.

&lt;p&gt;Chase Paymentech Completes Move to Single-Owned, Payments-Agnostic
                      Payment Processing Business
DALLAS--(Business Wire)--
Chase Paymentech, a leader in merchant acquiring and payment
processing, today announced the completion of its transition from a
joint venture with First Data Corp to a wholly-owned unit of JPMorgan
Chase. The assets of the joint venture owned by JPMorgan Chase have
been integrated into the bank as a part of its card services division
and will continue to operate under the name Chase Paymentech.

   "We are enthusiastic about what the future holds for Chase
Paymentech now that we're wholly owned by JPMorgan Chase," said Mike
Duffy, president of Chase Paymentech. "The payment industry is very
dynamic and is undergoing a significant evolution at the moment. Our
new position within JPMorgan Chase gives us a global reach and
resources unmatched in our industry. This means we can continue to
deliver to our customers the high-quality service they have come to
expect, while expanding the available range of global payment and data
solutions."

   As part of its new ownership, Chase Paymentech retains its
state-of-the-art payment processing platform and operations, the
majority of the joint venture's employees and 51% of the client base,
which includes customers representing approximately half of all global
e-commerce and Internet transactions.

   "We are committed to being the leader in the global payments
industry," Duffy said. "Merchants are looking beyond the services
offered by most payment processors. They want a merchant acquirer that
provides expanded services, such as cash flow management, alternative
payments and advanced analytics. We fully expect to be at the
forefront of the industry."

&lt;p&gt;  SUGAR LAND, TX, Nov 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Researched by Industrial Info Resources (Sugar Land, Texas) -- On October
31, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) (San Ramon, California) announced
earnings for third quarter 2008. As is becoming a standard story for
petroleum-production companies, 3Q08 brought significantly higher
earnings compared to last year. Chevron reported a net income of $7.89
billion for the quarter, more than doubling 3Q07's net income of $3.72
billion. Oil-equivalent production was actually down from last year by
150,000 barrels per day. Higher prices of oil and natural gas helped
bring strong income and offset the estimated $400 million of expenses
caused by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Industrial Info is currently
monitoring more than $19.5 billion of Chevron's projects scheduled to kick
off between now and the end of 2009 in the U.S., Canada, and Australia.

&lt;p&gt;Apisphere for Outlook Allows Users to Automatically Send and
 Receive Real-Time Alerts to Mobile Devices Based on Physical Location
BERKELEY, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Apisphere Inc. (www.apisphere.com), a leading provider of
location-awareness services for mobile business applications and
devices, today announced the availability of Apisphere for Outlook, a
location aware plug-in for Microsoft's Outlook(R) messaging and
collaboration client. Apisphere for Outlook enables users to send and
receive automatic messages on their mobile devices or GPS-enabled
laptops based on their Outlook calendar and location.

   Using real-time location-aware information, Apisphere for Outlook
will change the way people use their calendars and how they
communicate with business associates, friends and family. When a
meeting is scheduled in Outlook, the plug-in creates a "sphere" around
the meeting location and the calendar entry. This sphere activates
several features including mapping, real-time traffic updates and
geo-triggered voice and text messages for reminders on the go.

   "People are relying on mobile devices more and more for both
business and personal needs, and require applications that make
completing daily tasks easier and more efficient," said Craig Harper,
CEO of Apisphere."Adding applications like Apisphere for Outlook to
our mobile marketplace provides users with a full suite of tools and
applications that will help them bring true location-aware
functionality to their mobile devices."

   Each sphere created through Apisphere for Outlook enables mobile
devices to know where a user is located and provide customized
information in real-time. The plug-in automatically generates mapping
information to provide driving directions to an Outlook calendar
appointment and will notify the user through email, SMS or phone, when
they need to leave to arrive on time. Apisphere for Outlook can then
provide ongoing location-aware mapping and navigation, using real-time
data such as traffic updates and road closure information to identify
the optimal route.

   Additionally, geo-triggered voice and text messages can be created
to provide users with reminders or notifications. Messages can be
created in Microsoft Outlook and set to automatically trigger when the
user reaches a specific location or enters the pre-defined sphere. For
example, email messages can be automatically sent every time a user
enters and leaves a meeting to accurately track time for more precise
timesheet records. It can also provide pre-set reminders upon leaving
the sphere such as dropping the car off at the rental agency or
picking up groceries before heading home.

   "Having a personal assistant to keep track of your schedule is no
longer the most efficient way to manage busy calendars, especially
when you are away from your desk," said Harper. "Apisphere for Outlook
automates time management so today's busy professional can focus on
completing important tasks rather than spending valuable time on
scheduling and managing them."

   The Apisphere for Outlook plug-in can also be integrated with
Salesforce CRM to deliver customer information when a salesperson
nears a client's location.

   Outlook Plug-in Availability

   The Apisphere Outlook plug-in is immediately available. To become
a beta user, please visit: http://beta.apisphere.com.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)

 Nov 3 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities slashed its price
target on European independent refiners by an average of 17
percent, saying weakness in global oil demand would hurt
margins over the next 12 months.

 Global oil demand is set to slow significantly due to
demand weakness in countries under the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the brokerage
said, citing a report by the International Energy Agency.

 Non-OECD demand is still expected to grow, though not
enough to offset the slowdown in the OECD.

 The brokerage said it continued to be more positive on
diesel margins than gasoline, given the sluggish demand outlook
for gasoline in developed countries, and the still-tight
supply/demand balance for diesel.

 JP Morgan downgraded Neste Oil (NES1V.HE) to "neutral" from
"overweight" and ERG (ERG.MI) to "underweight" from "neutral"

 The brokerage said it sees risks to Neste's earnings from
high gasoline exposure.

 On ERG, JP Morgan said it continues to have doubts on the
company's ability to operate its refining and power assets
after the recent fire at its IGCC power plant, which could have
a material impact on earnings next year.

 The following are the price target changes -

&lt;p&gt;Emulex Delivers PRO-Enabled Management Pack Tailored for Microsoft System Center
Virtual Machine Manager 2008

BARCELONA, Spain, Nov. 3, 2008 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Microsoft Tech-Ed EMEA IT
Professionals -- Emulex Corporation (NYSE:ELX) today announced the availability
of its Performance and Resource Optimization (PRO)-enabled management pack that
extends PRO with storage related events and alerts customers to changes in I/O
rates flowing through the adapter. Emulex, a Microsoft launch partner, is
delivering a PRO pack supporting Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager
2008, affirming its leadership in virtualization management. Emulex's management
pack for PRO provides Virtual Machine Manager with the I/O connectivity
information needed to improve the placement and migration of virtual machines
based on storage requirements and available resources.

"Emulex is a leader in I/O connectivity for virtualization environments and is
committed to working with Microsoft to deliver products to the market that offer
cutting edge management features for virtualized server environments," said
Scott McIntyre, vice president of product marketing, Emulex. "As server
virtualization continues to drive SAN attach rates, Emulex's adapters provide
end users with a comprehensive feature set that ensures server virtualization
environments are optimized for SAN connectivity and storage-aware."

PRO, coupled with Emulex's LightPulse(r) adapters and management pack for PRO,
enables administrators to monitor and control the allocation of virtualized
servers connected to a storage area network (SAN). Emulex PRO-enabled management
pack monitors incoming and outgoing I/O rates across Emulex LightPulse adapters
and generates a notification when pre-defined thresholds are reached, allowing
customers to take appropriate actions within Virtual Machine Manager, such as
moving the virtual machine to a different physical server. With this solution in
place, customers can dynamically manage the performance of their virtualized
infrastructure SAN connectivity.

"A comprehensive management solution, such as that provided by the System Center
offerings, is critical as companies implement a virtualized infrastructure.
System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2008 enables customers to configure and
deploy new virtual machines and centrally manage them, whether running on
Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V or VMware ESX Server," said Dai Vu, Director of
Integrated Virtualization Marketing, Microsoft Corporation. "Emulex is an early
adopter of System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2008 and its incorporation of
the PRO feature enhances data center application performance, helping our
customers meet the resource demands of server virtualization and Windows
Hyper-V."

This week at the Microsoft Tech-Ed EMEA IT Professionals Conference, Emulex will
be showcasing the capabilities of the new management pack for PRO working with
Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2008 in its pod #5, in the
System Center Alliance Pavilion. Additionally, at the conference, Emulex will be
delivering a presentation titled, 'Advanced SAN Connectivity for Microsoft
Server Virtualization Environments,' on Tuesday, November 4, 2008, in Solutions
Theater #1.

Emulex was the first Fibre Channel HBA vendor to announce industry-leading
Virtual HBA technology support for Microsoft Virtual Server, Hyper-V and Virtual
Machine Manager. More recently, Emulex announced HBA support for Microsoft
Windows Server 2008 and SQL Server 2008 environments, as well as a new
record-level Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC) benchmark using
its LPe12000 8Gb/s HBAs with Microsoft SQL Server, Windows Server 2008 and the

&lt;p&gt;TAIPEI (Reuters) - JPMorgan  Chase Co's (JPM.N) asset management arm expects to be profitable in the fourth quarter, despite worldwide turbulence from the global financial crisis, the unit's chief executive said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management stopped new hiring at the beginning of this year amid the world's worst financial crisis in decades, but could consider hiring more people next year if the global situation does not get worse, Chief Executive Jes Staley told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have been affected by the financial crisis," Staley said. "Markets were dramatically off in Q4, but we'll be fine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asset management companies in Taiwan have been hit by the global financial crisis with the total fund size shrinking by 30 to 40 percent so far this year, according to industry estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, some foreign players are banking on Taiwan's high savings rate and affluent individuals to grow their business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Dutch financial giant ING (ING.AS) said it planned to retain its Taiwan fund business, even after selling its local insurance unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staley's unit, which manages $1.2 trillion in assets, had seen some fund inflows even as global stock markets tumbled on fears of a prolonged global recession and amid a wave of bank failures and government-led bailouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We actually had close to $170 billion of net inflows into the asset management business for the first 10 months of the year, a lot higher than last year, as a lot of people were moving cash to JPMorgan," said Staley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management previously reported net income of about $350 million and a margin of 30 percent in the third quarter, down from about $500 million in the same period of the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. firm now has half of its total assets outside of the United States, and has increased its investments in Asian countries over the last few years, particularly in South Korea and India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But China, Taiwan and Hong Kong would remain the company's core overseas markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The core of our international portfolios continues to be Greater China, where Taiwan plays an important part," said Staley, whose company competes in the global asset management sector with UBS (UBSN.VX), Fidelity and BlackRock (BLK.N) among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Gina Chang; Editing by David Cowell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co is betting that toys inspired by hit franchises like "Hannah Montana" and "High School Musical" or linked to the Internet will drive cash-strapped parents to its brands during the crucial holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney is going to market this year with a crop of holiday toys based on its popular brands at a wide range of prices and with an emphasis on toys that offer online and offline play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Toys that ... are part toy, part new technology, part interactive hookup -- those are the things I think that are going to be desirable," Andy Mooney, chairman of Disney's Consumer Products division, told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite gloomy holiday sales predictions, Mooney is "pretty optimistic about the holiday season," believing the toy-buying public will gravitate toward brands they associate with value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Consumer Products runs a $30 billion global licensing business as well as 334 retail stores, and has partnerships with mass-channel toy retailers worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toy analyst Anita Frazier said consumers "will be looking for more value -- not necessarily a lower price but something that can deliver a big 'wow' factor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents are more likely to work off a child's "wish list" and to make fewer impulse purchases this season, making early-season marketing more important than ever, Frazier said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Disney has sold "huge" volumes of its singing Hannah Montana holiday collectible doll, and singing "High School Musical" dolls with karaoke microphones are doing well, said Len Mazzocco, Disney Consumer Products' creative director for toys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A line of musical instruments ($79.99) and the Disney Vocal Star Trainer ($99.99) also draw on the popularity with "tweens" -- children age 9 to 12 -- of its music-themed Disney Channel franchises, High School Musical, Camp Rock and Hannah Montana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'OFF THE CHARTS'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early sales show that parents "are finding a way to go out for ... the single big-ticket item," said Mazzocco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the second and third purchase, they are searching for that price point they are comfortable with."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among Disney's hottest sellers so far is a new line of toys based on its Club Penguin virtual world. The toys start at $5.99 and include a code to unlock special features on the Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The sales are off the charts. It's the biggest launch of a new toy line we've seen so far," said Chris Heatherly, vice president of technology and innovation at Disney Consumer Products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another hit falls on the opposite end of the price spectrum: a $249.99 robot based on the "WALL-E" movie character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've sold every one of these things we could make," Heatherly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has gone big this season for toys that connect kids to its growing Internet and video game businesses, hoping that their parents will view them as a good long-term value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Disney UltiMotion games, selling for $79.99, preschoolers use toys, such as hammers and wands, to move characters around in video games based on its Disney Fairies, Sleeping Beauty and Disney Channel franchises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Fairies Clickables, ranging from $5.99 to $29.99, are wearable jewelry with computer chip sensors that interface with the Pixie Hollow virtual world, allowing little girls to trade online gifts for their fairy avatars. The hybrids are Disney's first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frazier said Web-connected toys, such as the Webkinz line, have generated $520 million in sales at retail during the year ended August 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These have certainly been very hot," Frazier said of the category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Susan Kelly)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Reuters) - Twelve months after validating a lengthy overhaul of his swing with a one-shot victory at the Disney Classic, Canadian Stephen Ames is excited about his title defense at Lake Buena Vista, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's going to be fun," Ames, 44, told reporters at the Walt Disney World Resort on Tuesday during preparation for the final event on the 2008 PGA Tour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any time you step up on the first tee and you're announced as the defending champion, it's heart-warming because of the fact you know you won this event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(You know) that you've gone in the right direction in your career and you've made the best that you can or done the best that you can in something that you made as your profession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Can you imagine how Tiger (Woods) feels winning 65, 67 events? That's unbelievable, phenomenal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ames, who spent much of last year working hard to shape a shallower swing to hit the ball higher and further, was delighted to end his 2007 campaign with a third PGA Tour title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of the things that we worked on all year kind of added on to that week," said the Trinidad native, who has registered seven top-10s in 23 Tour starts this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were heading in the right direction and some of the shots I was hitting or trying to hit were coming out, and it was just a matter of learning to play with the changes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SWING COMFORT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked to assess his swing 12 months later, Ames replied: "Position-wise and power-wise, I think it's gotten to the stage where it feels extremely comfortable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buoyed by top-six finishes in two of his last three PGA Tour starts, Ames goes into this week as one of the favorites, along with Americans Boo Weekley and Scott Verplank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also competing part is 2004 champion Ryan Palmer, who clinched his second PGA Tour title at the rain-delayed Ginn sur Mer Classic on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Victory apart, the biggest incentive for many of the players in the Tour's season finale is to secure playing privileges for 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leading 125 in the final money list automatically earn full exemption for next year and American Jeff Overton holds the 125th spot going into this week with earnings of $840,809.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hot on his heels are British rookie Martin Laird, with $803,072, and American Charles Warren, with $800,694.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm just going to go out there and play one shot at a time, try to finish each round," said Overton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's all I can really do. The chips will fall where they may. You can't control what everybody else does."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $4.6 million event, which starts on Thursday, is being played over the par-72 Palm and Magnolia courses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles; Editing by Greg Stutchbury)&lt;/p&gt;

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
The Board of Directors of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) today
announced changes to its Corporate Governance Guidelines to enhance
the role of presiding director.

   "This demonstrates the board's ongoing commitment to independence
and the highest standards of corporate governance," said Rex W.

   "The board recognizes that corporate governance is of broad
interest and has received input from a wide array of shareholders

non-employee directors from among their members and would generally be
expected to serve a minimum term of two years.

   Non-employee directors selected Samuel J. Palmisano, chairman,
president and chief executive officer of IBM Corporation, to be
presiding director, effective immediately.

   Previously, the chair of the Board Affairs Committee and the chair
of the Compensation Committee presided at non-employee director
executive sessions on an alternating basis, depending on the subject
matter under discussion.

   The presiding director has the authority to call and chair
executive sessions of the non-employee directors, and will chair all
board meetings in the absence of the chairman. The presiding director
will review board meeting topics, agendas and schedules with the
chairman prior to distribution to the board, which consists of one
employee and 10 non-employees.

   Exxon Mobil Corporation's corporate governance practices are
consistent with an overwhelming majority of S 500 companies,
according to the Spencer Stewart 2007 Board Index. The Index reports
that 94 percent of S 500 boards have a lead or presiding director
and 84 percent of S 500 boards have chairs who are either a current
chief executive (65 percent) or a former chief executive or senior
executive (19 percent).

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - MasterCard Inc (MA.N) and Visa Inc
(V.N) shares soared on optimism that efforts to cut costs will
offset pressure on revenue as sinking economies cause consumers
and businesses to default more and spend less on credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The gains came a day after MasterCard, the second-largest
card network, posted third-quarter operating profit, excluding
a litigation charge, of $322 million, or $2.47 per share, above
the $2.22 per share analysts expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue rose a larger-than-expected 24 percent, and the
Purchase, New York-based company said operating expenses should
remain unchanged in 2009, below what some analysts expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; San Francisco-based Visa, the largest card network, on Oct.
29 posted results that also topped analysts' forecasts, and
said annual revenue growth may be at the lower end of its prior
target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Card networks are not directly exposed to rising defaults
because they do not issue cards, unlike issuers such as
American Express Co (AXP.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N),
Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N) and
JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But transaction and dollar volume may decline as card
holder curb spending, cutting into the companies' fees from
processing transactions. MasterCard said it expects revenue in
2009 to grow at a pace below its long-term target of 12 percent
to 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The key to MasterCard's business model, we believe, is its
ability to maintain strong earnings growth throughout cycles,
given an ability to maintain healthy revenue growth while
taking advantage of considerable expense leverage," wrote
Barclays Capital analyst Bruce Harting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We also note," he added, "that the significant spend
volume growth slowdown seen in October, weakening consumer
confidence, what's likely to be a slow holiday season, and
other weaker consumer spending variables to come, may limit
near-term upside potential for shares."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Several analysts, including Harting, lowered their earnings
forecasts, share price targets or both for MasterCard, citing
the spending slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are in an economic crisis like I don't think we have
seen in our lifetime," MasterCard Chief Financial Officer
Martina Hund-Mejean said in a Monday interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, American Express said it will cut 7,000 jobs to
help save $1.8 billion in 2009. Bank of America last month
reported the first quarterly loss in its credit card unit since
it bought card issuer MBNA Corp for $34.6 billion in January
2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In afternoon trading, MasterCard shares were up $20.18, or
14 percent, at $164.07. Visa shares were up $5.63, or 10.7
percent, at $58.12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MasterCard shares peaked at $320.30 on May 30, while Visa
shares peaked at $89.83 on May 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Juan Lagorio; editing by John

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 4 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' (GS.N) commodity
trading unit, J. Aron, has agreed to pay $89.8 million to close
out several contracts with bankrupt energy trader SemGroup LP
[SEMGP.UL], according to court documents filed by SemGroup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The trades are related to swaps, options and contracts for
purchases of crude oil and propane that were affected when
SemGroup filed for bankruptcy in July, according to the
documents, filed late on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SemGroup is seeking approval of the settlement from the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware. It said in the documents
that the settlement is a "reasonable determination" of the
amount J. Aron owed SemGroup in the trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is no material dispute between the parties as to the
amount owed," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman Sachs representative was not immediately
available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A court hearing on the settlement is proposed for Nov. 24,
the documents showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SemGroup filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on July
22, citing $3.2 billion in losses on energy futures and
derivatives trades.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) is betting that toys inspired by hit franchises like "Hannah Montana" and "High School Musical" or linked to the Internet will drive cash-strapped parents to its brands during the crucial holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney is going to market this year with a crop of holiday toys based on its popular brands at a wide range of prices and with an emphasis on toys that offer online and offline play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Toys that ... are part toy, part new technology, part interactive hookup -- those are the things I think that are going to be desirable," Andy Mooney, chairman of Disney's Consumer Products division, told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite gloomy holiday sales predictions, Mooney is "pretty optimistic about the holiday season," believing the toy-buying public will gravitate toward brands they associate with value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Consumer Products runs a $30 billion global licensing business as well as 334 retail stores, and has partnerships with mass-channel toy retailers worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toy analyst Anita Frazier said consumers "will be looking for more value -- not necessarily a lower price but something that can deliver a big 'wow' factor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents are more likely to work off a child's "wish list" and to make fewer impulse purchases this season, making early-season marketing more important than ever, Frazier said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Disney has sold "huge" volumes of its singing Hannah Montana holiday collectible doll, and singing "High School Musical" dolls with karaoke microphones are doing well, said Len Mazzocco, Disney Consumer Products' creative director for toys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A line of musical instruments ($79.99) and the Disney Vocal Star Trainer ($99.99) also draw on the popularity with "tweens" -- children age 9 to 12 -- of its music-themed Disney Channel franchises, High School Musical, Camp Rock and Hannah Montana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'OFF THE CHARTS'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early sales show that parents "are finding a way to go out for ... the single big-ticket item," said Mazzocco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the second and third purchase, they are searching for that price point they are comfortable with."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among Disney's hottest sellers so far is a new line of toys based on its Club Penguin virtual world. The toys start at $5.99 and include a code to unlock special features on the Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The sales are off the charts. It's the biggest launch of a new toy line we've seen so far," said Chris Heatherly, vice president of technology and innovation at Disney Consumer Products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another hit falls on the opposite end of the price spectrum: a $249.99 robot based on the "WALL-E" movie character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've sold every one of these things we could make," Heatherly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has gone big this season for toys that connect kids to its growing Internet and video game businesses, hoping that their parents will view them as a good long-term value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Disney UltiMotion games, selling for $79.99, preschoolers use toys, such as hammers and wands, to move characters around in video games based on its Disney Fairies, Sleeping Beauty and Disney Channel franchises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Fairies Clickables, ranging from $5.99 to $29.99, are wearable jewelry with computer chip sensors that interface with the Pixie Hollow virtual world, allowing little girls to trade online gifts for their fairy avatars.

&lt;p&gt;Company also Announces TelAlert(R) 6e Enterprise IT Notification
                    Solution is 'IBM Tivoli Ready'
BARCELONA, Spain--(Business Wire)--
MIR3 Inc.(TM), the leading provider of Intelligent Notification
(IN(R)) systems, announced today at the 2008 Microsoft TechEd/IT Forum

management platform--and the best-managed platform--in the industry.

   "Today's Enterprise IT managers are mobile and are constantly
juggling meetings, travel schedules, and other daily tasks out of the
office. They also need to address IT events that adversely affect
their mission-critical systems on the go," said Frank Mahdavi, chief
strategy officer for MIR3. "When critical systems encounter problems
it is imperative that key personnel are notified of the issue--at any
time, day or night. Fully integrated with the Microsoft SCOM and based
on rules configured in the SCOM server, MIR3's TelAlert 6e reaches out
to the enterprise workforce in the shortest amount of time to ensure
proper action is taken to mitigate problems quickly."

   In addition to MIR3's acceptance into the Microsoft System Center
Alliance, the company has also made significant strides with IBM and

"IBM Tivoli ready," with Tivoli Enterprise Console and Tivoli Netview
software.

enterprise, and uses intelligent device scheduling, escalation and
distribution rules to reach individuals best-equipped to resolve
enterprise IT problems.

offerings integrated with Microsoft SCOM, will be conducted at station

&lt;p&gt;White Paper Highlighting Best Practices in Desktop and Server
                       Management Now Available
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
KACE, the leading systems management appliance company, today
announced the availability of an updated white paper resulting from
new research that reveals its KBOX Systems Management Appliances offer
significantly greater value than competitive technologies. Prepared by
leading IT analyst firm Enterprise Management Associates (EMA), the
paper, titled, "Best Practices in Lifecycle Management: Comparing
KACE, Altiris, LANDesk, and Microsoft SCCM," pits the four vendors
against each other in key lifecycle management tasks and uses a cost
comparison to determine overall solution value. "With such a strong
value proposition, EMA recommends any mid-sized business evaluating
solutions for lifecycle management should include KBOX appliances in
their product evaluations," the study states.

   Lifecycle management involves a number of key disciplines aimed at
achieving efficiency, productivity, and cost reduction within IT and
across the company. In an update to research conducted in early 2007,
the EMA study analyzes a number of key features over multiple
lifecycle management disciplines, including asset and inventory
management, bare metal installation, and software distribution and
reporting. EMA researchers concluded KACE's technology provides
equivalent - and in some cases superior - capabilities over that of
its competitors, but at half the cost.

   Details of the study are as follows:

   What:

   Availability of updated research and white paper, titled "Best
Practices in Lifecycle Management: Comparing KACE, Altiris, LANDesk,
and Microsoft SCCM," prepared by leading IT analyst firm EMA.

   Why:

   The purpose of the study is to explain best practices in lifecycle
management, as it relates to desktops and servers, and compares KACE
with Altiris, LANDesk, and Microsoft SCCM to determine best overall
value specifically for mid-sized businesses.

&lt;p&gt;TAIPEI (Reuters) - JPMorgan  Chase Co's (JPM.N) asset management arm expects to be profitable in the fourth quarter, despite worldwide turbulence from the global financial crisis, the unit's chief executive said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management, whose headcount is down 44 percent this year amid the world's worst financial crises in decades, could also consider hiring more people next year if the global situation does not get worse, Chief Executive Jes Staley told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have been affected by the financial crisis. But when the markets come back, we have been active in Asia and emerging markets, we are going to be active for our clients and active for the markets," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We actually had close to $170 billion of net inflows into the asset management business for the first 10 months of the year, a lot higher than last year, as a lot of people were moving cash to JPMorgan," said Staley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His unit, which manages $1.2 trillion in assets, has cut its headcount to about 900 from around 1,600 at the beginning of the year, as global stock markets tumbled on fears of a prolonged global recession and amid a wave of bank failures and government-led bailouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management previously reported net income of about $350 million and a margin of 30 percent in the third quarter, down from about $500 million in the same period of the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. firm now has half of its total assets outside of the United States, and has increased its investments in Asian countries over the last few years, particularly in South Korea and India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But China, Taiwan and Hong Kong would remain the company's core overseas markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The core of our international portfolios continues to be Greater China, where Taiwan plays an important part," said Staley, whose company competes in the global asset management sector with UBS (UBSN.VX), Fidelity and BlackRock (BLK.N) among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Gina Chang; Editing by Doug Young and Ken Wills)&lt;/p&gt;

    AdminStudio will be the first product to support a true conversion into
the App-V format without the use of the native Microsoft Sequencer tool.
Combining this capability with advanced support for the current
industry-standard MSI format will offer enterprise IT organizations the
flexibility they need to address current and future projects. The
thousands of current AdminStudio customers will be able to fully support
current application packages, and adopt virtualization at their own pace,
using familiar tools and processes.

    "The debut of Microsoft App-V signals the acceleration of enterprise-wide
adoption of application virtualization," said Steve Schmidt, vice
president of product management for Acresso. "As more companies turn to
virtualized environments, AdminStudio becomes more important to
enterprises who are working with traditional application deployments, OS
migrations or new application virtualization projects. As enterprises
continue to adopt and deploy application virtualization, Acresso will
continue to work with Microsoft to create industry-leading time and
effort saving processes for busy IT organizations."

&lt;p&gt;Visa to Improve Payment Experience for Commuters in Los Angeles and Paris; Working with Transit Operators to Enable Visa Payment at the Fare Gate

   No More Fumbling for Cash; Transit Operators in the World's Most
Populous Areas and Visa Are Collaborating to Take the Hassle out of
Payment for Mass Transit Commuters
PARIS &amp; SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) today announced it is working with the Los
Angeles transit authority to allow train, subway and bus riders to
speed through turnstiles and past fare boxes with a simple wave of
their Visa payWave-enabled contactless card. In parallel, Visa
Europe(1) has announced it is collaborating with the Regie Autonome
des Transports Parisiens (RATP), the major transit operator
responsible for public transportation in Paris and its surroundings,
to demonstrate that Visa payWave acceptance at a Paris metro fare gate
is technically feasible.

   Both initiatives are using Visa payWave technology, based on a
tiny chip embedded in a payment card that communicates securely with
contactless card readers over a very short distance. This means that
riders can eliminate the time-consuming step of paying for a ticket at
a separate machine or searching for cash - the transaction is
completed on Visa's global processing network, VisaNet. Visa payWave
technology adds an extra layer of security to the transaction by
attaching a unique code to each transaction, reducing the chance of
fraud.

   "Extending secure, convenient and reliable Visa payments to
subways, trains and buses is a great example of how Visa innovations
like Visa payWave can dramatically improve the experience for millions
of commuters," said Tim Attinger, head of product innovation and
development at Visa Inc. "By working with our transit partners in Los
Angeles, New York and New Jersey, we hope to free busy transit riders
from the burden of fumbling for change or searching for paper tickets.
At the same time, transit operators can potentially reduce cash
handling costs and ticket distribution, letting them focus on their
core business of getting people where they need to go."

   Los Angeles pilot

   In Los Angeles, Visa is working with the LA Metro system to offer
special Visa payWave cards that also incorporate the transit system's
"TAP" fare application. These dual-use, prepaid Visa cards will let
riders pay their fares and purchase fare products using their Visa
account, while also allowing cardholders to make purchases anywhere
Visa debit is accepted.

   Two types of cards will be available through the pilot:

   --  Ride, pay and reload cards - sold through automated
        ReadySTATION kiosks within the LA Metro system, these cards
        will be active and ready to use immediately for both transit
        fares and Visa purchases everywhere Visa debit is accepted.
        Riders will be able to add up to $500 in value at the kiosks.

   --  Ride, pay, reload and ATM cash access cards - these are
        personalized cards with a maximum value limit of $10,000 which
        are ordered online or over the phone. Beyond a larger value
        limit the personalized cards have the added feature of a
        Personal Identification Number (PIN) for obtaining cash at
        ATMs. It will also function as a standard Visa prepaid card
        for purchases outside the transit system. In addition,
        cardholders will be eligible for free direct deposit of their
        paychecks directly to the Visa prepaid card account, providing
        added convenience and security over payment alternatives like
        checks and cash, for those riders without traditional banking
        relationships.

   "Combining TAP and Visa payWave on a single contactless card is a
great idea and delivers convenience and speed at bus fare boxes and
rail station validators for LA transit riders," said Roger Snoble,
Chief Executive Officer, at the Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority. "It also provides commuters with an easy way
to reload and manage their LA transit accounts, while providing them
with a Visa prepaid card that is accepted at any Visa debit acceptance
location or ATM."

   Paris Proof-of-Concept Pilot

   Visa Europe is collaborating with RATP to evaluate the concept of
Visa payWave acceptance directly at the fare gate. As part of this
ongoing activity, the Visa exhibit at the annual CARTES conference,
taking place in Paris this week, will feature an RATP gate set up to
accept Visa payWave cards. The gate demonstrates that it is
technically feasible for the existing Paris Metro gates to accept Visa
payWave cards while continuing to accept Navigo, the local closed-loop
card in use today. The system also demonstrated how Visa payWave cards
can fulfill the special business and ticketing requirements of the
Paris Metro. Visa's next step in this initiative is to expand the
trial toward enabling Visa card acceptance at Paris metro fare gates.

   "This is an important milestone," said Sandra Alzetta, Senior Vice
President Head of Innovation at Visa Europe. "The Paris Metro system
is one of the most technically sophisticated transit environments in
the world and we have demonstrated that Visa payWave can indeed
integrate with the existing gate system. Our solution proves that Visa
payWave cards can provide additional features required by RATP such as
the ability for an inspector to determine if a cardholder has paid for
their journey and for the gates to track a cardholder's journey
through the system to ensure they are charged the optimal fare."

   Visa's Transit Strategy

   Every day millions of people around the world use public transit -
commuting to work, going to shop, or visiting friends and family. For
transit riders, speed and convenience are major factors, including
when it comes to paying their fares. And for transit system operators,
collecting fares and managing the payment and accounting systems can
be costly and challenging.

   The Los Angeles and Paris metro pilots are the latest transit
programs that put Visa at the forefront of merging electronic payments
technology with the fare collection needs of transit agencies around
the world.

   Visa's global transit strategy supports a range of solutions that
can be tailored to the needs of local transit systems and increase the
integration between transit and Visa payment. The solutions range from
using Visa products to pay for existing transit fare media, to
dual-use cards combining the advantages of Visa payWave with
proprietary transit applications, to a completely integrated solution
where Visa payWave-enabled cards and devices are accepted as the fare
media at the gate, reducing the operator's need to issue proprietary
media.

   Visa Transit Around the World

   In addition to the US and French pilot programs, Visa's transit
strategy has been at work around the world, supporting both commercial
and pilot programs, making travel easier for riders and fare
collections more efficient for operators in Europe and Asia.

   Visa Inc. Transit Pilots in Asia

   Korea: Almost a quarter of all Visa cards in Korea, from 18
issuers, now support various domestic transit applications. These Visa
cardholders can use the same card to ride transit they use to pay in
the shops. In a world first and in partnership with T-Money provider
KSCC (Korea Smart Card Company), card issuer Shinhan Bank and Korea
Telecom Freetel (KTF), Visa has made it possible for commuters to use
their Visa account to top up their T-Money balances automatically on
the phone's SIM card when it falls below a certain level. By
conducting the entire transaction automatically over the mobile
network, commuters are freed from the inconvenience of waiting in line
at transit kiosks or other agents to top up their transit account.

   Kuala Lumpur: Domestic Visa contactless cards are accepted at the
fare gate to board the express train from Kuala Lumpur International
Airport (KLIA) to the central bus station. Riders don't need to stop
to buy a ticket, nor do they require a special transit enabled Visa
card, they just use the contactless card provided by their issuers and
they ride hassle-free.

   Hong Kong and India: Visa, working with Citibank, has recently
been chosen as the exclusive payment partner to support the local
transit applications on local cards for key transit programs in Hong
Kong and Delhi.

   Visa Europe Transit Programs

   Turkey: Visa Europe and DenizBank in Turkey introduced Visa
payWave acceptance at Istanbul ferry gates in partnership with IDO
(Istanbul's Fast Ferries Co. Inc). Now, any Visa payWave cardholder
from Turkey or abroad can simply wave their standard Visa payWave card
over the gate reader and pay for their journey, just like any other
Visa payWave transaction. DenizBank also launched a special co-branded
IDO Sea Miles card that rewards ferry travelers with miles for their
journeys that can be redeemed for free ferry travel.

   UK: In the UK, a multifunction Barclaycard Visa credit card
features Visa payWave for payment and a contactless Oyster smartcard
application enabling cardholders to use the same card to make low
value purchases and to travel throughout London on the public
transport network. Visa Europe is also actively collaborating with
Transport for London to define how Visa payWave cards might be
accepted directly at the fare gate in the London transport network.
Visa's stand at the annual Cartes 2008 features a demonstration
simulating the London Underground network showing how TfL's business
and ticketing rules could be implemented using Visa payWave cards.

   Through these efforts, transit agencies can streamline their
transit operations, as well as potentially decrease their investment
in custom built fare systems, cash handling costs and fare card life
cycle costs. The use of Visa payWave cards as fare payment media, may
also lead to a decrease in the number of customer service issues and
costs related to traditional fare cards issued by transit agencies.

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bancorp Tests Visa's Smallest Payment Device Enabled with Visa payWave - Visa Micro Tag

SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) today announced a
pilot program designed to test consumer preferences for an alternative
electronic payment device, the Visa Micro Tag, the smallest Visa
payWave-enabled device currently available. The U.S. Bank Visa Micro
Tag easily attaches to a key ring and allows Micro Tag holders to
simply wave and pay.

   U.S. Bank plans to distribute more than 4,000 prepaid Visa Micro
Tags to employees in November 2008 to collect feedback on design,
functionality and ease-of-use of the devices. Employees across the
country will receive the U.S. Bank Visa Micro Tag which is tied to a
prepaid U.S. Bank Visa gift account. The U.S. Bank Visa Micro Tag can
be used to make purchases anywhere Visa payWave is accepted.

   The Visa Micro Tag was first introduced in 2007 and can be used
with credit, debit or prepaid accounts. Micro Tags are enabled by Visa
payWave technology, based on a tiny chip embedded in the device that
enables consumers to pay by simply waving the U.S. Bank Visa Micro Tag
in front of a contactless payment terminal without the need to
physically swipe or insert the device. Designed to be small and
durable, the U.S. Bank Visa Micro Tag makes paying for purchases
faster and more convenient.

   "Consumers today want access to their financial accounts quickly
and securely," said Pat Coll, executive vice president of U.S. Bank
Retail Payment Solutions. "New payment devices, such as the Visa Micro
Tag, allow consumers to conveniently use electronic forms of payment
for small ticket purchases, such as concessions at a sporting event, a
soda at a vending machine, or a cup of coffee, while also providing an
added layer of security."

   U.S. Bank Visa Micro Tags display the Visa and U.S. Bank brands
and the contactless indicator. A Visa account number is not required
to be embossed or printed on the device. This provides an additional
layer of security for consumers who choose to carry their U.S. Bank
Visa Micro Tag in visible ways, such as on a keychain.

   Visa Micro Tags can be manufactured and personalized easily in a
process similar to that of standard cards. This helps issuers control
costs while more readily providing an exciting new payment choice to
consumers. The Visa Micro Tag also can be manufactured in a variety of
shapes and sizes from flat to three-dimensional delivering innovative
payment product design options. The U.S. Bank Visa Micro Tags were
manufactured by Giesecke &amp; Devrient (G) using the MicroPass(R) chip
from INSIDE Contactless. The Visa Micro Tag is not available in
Europe.

   "One of the advantages of Visa payWave technology is that it
offers consumers payment choices that deliver the same security, speed
and convenience they have come to expect from Visa," said Tim
Attinger, Head of Global Product Innovation at Visa Inc. "We're
excited about the opportunity to partner with U.S. Bank to test the
Visa Micro Tag and bring consumers payment options that fit their
lifestyles."

   About Visa payWave

   Since its introduction in 2005, Visa's contactless technology has
grown rapidly in popularity. Customers with Visa payWave cards in the
U.S. enjoy the convenience of not having to sign for payments under
$25, a feature that also benefits merchant locations where speed is
important and where cash has been the traditional means of payment.
The technology is already in use at thousands of convenience stores,
sporting venues, gas stations and fast food restaurants around the
world.

   Visa has high security standards and risk management processes in
place to protect Visa transactions, and Visa payWave-enabled payments
are no exception. Visa is currently migrating to a new specification
for Visa payWave transactions, based on the global standard for chip
card technology that ensures all Visa payWave enabled cards and
devices can be used around the world.

   Visa's new contactless specification is based on EMV technology,
enabling transactions in both offline and online processing mode. In
addition, the global specification is compatible with existing Visa
payWave programs launched worldwide, and provides enhanced security of
contactless transactions, while providing functionality and
flexibility for issuers in diverse geographic areas. The specification
also includes requirements for the speed of communication between card
and terminal.

   Cardholders with Visa payWave-enabled products receive all the
same security protections the industry has come to expect from Visa,
including (1)zero liability for fraudulent charges and Visa's multiple
layers of security technology. Cardholders making purchases with Visa
payWave-enabled products enjoy additional layers of security because
the payment device never leaves the customer's hand, can only be read
at extremely close proximity to a reader, and generates a dynamic
cryptogram that uniquely identifies each Visa payWave transaction with
the global Visa payment network. Visa Micro Tag

   (1) Visa's Zero Liability policy covers U.S.-issued cards only and
does not apply to ATM transactions, PIN transactions not processed by
Visa, or certain commercial card transactions. Cardholder must notify
issuer promptly of any unauthorized use. Consult issuer for additional
details or visit www.visa.com/security.

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Reuters) - Fifteen days after having an emergency appendectomy, American Jeff Overton is under pressure to secure his PGA Tour card for next year at this week's Disney Classic in Lake Buena Vista, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leading 125 players in the final money list automatically earn full exemption for 2009 and Overton holds the 125th spot going into the season finale with earnings of $840,809.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hot on his heels are British rookie Martin Laird, with $803,072, and American Charles Warren, with $800,694.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm just going to go out there and play one shot at a time, try to finish each round," Overton told reporters in the build-up to Thursday's opening round at the Walt Disney World Resort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's all I can really do. The chips will fall where they may. You can't control what everybody else does. I'm going out there and giving it my all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked how he had coped with the stress going into this week, the 25-year-old replied: "This is a golf tournament where I had good success last year. I think I'd made $10,000 more last year going into this event and I finished sixth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a great golf course for me. If I can keep it in play with my length, I should have a good advantage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overton, who finished four strokes behind last year's winner Stephen Ames of Canada, was delighted to be competing again in the final PGA Tour event of the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had planned to play in the Arizona Open two weeks ago but withdrew on the Tuesday after nine holes of practice and had his appendix removed that night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, he returned to Tour action last week, tying for 18th at the Ginn sur Mer Classic in Palm Coast, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was great to get back in there," he said. "Last week was tough, especially the first two days coming back from surgery, but come Sunday it felt a lot better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked to describe the pain he experienced during last week's event, Overton replied: "It was kind of like you'd just got done doing 500 sit-ups or something."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles; Editing by Ed Osmond)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
notified roughly 3,200 employees this week that they have been
laid off, part of previously reported plans to slash 10 percent
of the firm's global work force amid slumping markets, people
familiar with the situation said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two weeks ago, Reuters reported Goldman planned to cut 10
percent of its staff, or almost 3,300 jobs, reflecting the weak
economy and a cut back in proprietary trading. The cuts are an
about-face for a company that as recently as September insisted
its headcount would rise this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The latest cuts reduce headcount to the lowest since 2006
and hit every businesses and region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The investment bank has managed to avoid the kind of losses
from mortgages and corporate loans that have hobbled rivals,
yet Goldman still has suffered from the steep decline in merger
and underwriting activity, as well as plunging prices for
stocks and other investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has quietly and slowly cut jobs all year. The bank
laid off hundreds of MA support staff and junior bankers in
June due to slowing markets, following a round of leveraged
lending and mortgage securities cuts in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Early this year, Goldman cut 1,500 people, or 5 percent of
its staff, following 2007 performance reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman converted last month to a bank holding company
supervised by the Federal Reserve and then raised $10 billion
from Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N). These moves, together
with a pending $10 billion investment by Treasury, will create
a more stable but less profitable company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill Lynch analyst Guy Moszkowski last week predicted
Goldman will report a fourth-quarter loss, its first since
going public in 1999, as plunging markets slam private equity,
proprietary trading and on its stake in Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer, Inc announced today that it is terminating the phase 3
development program for its investigational compound (CP-945,598) for
weight management. CP-945,598 is a selective antagonist of the
cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor. Based on all currently available
information and an ongoing review of the phase 3 program by an
independent Data Monitoring Committee, Pfizer believes that the
CP-945,598 compound has the potential to be a safe and effective
treatment for weight management. However, the Company has decided to
discontinue the development program based on changing regulatory
perspectives on the risk/benefit profile of the CB1 class and likely
new regulatory requirements for approval.

   "While confident in the safety of the compound, we believe that
this is the appropriate decision based on all available information
regarding this class of agents, as well as recent discussions with
regulatory authorities," said Martin Mackay, president, Pfizer Global
Research and Development. "As part of our ongoing portfolio
prioritization, we will refocus research and development resources on
high priority therapeutic areas that address an unmet medical need and
have a high probability for success."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) notified roughly 3,200 employees this week that they have been laid off, part of previously reported plans to slash 10 percent of the firm's global work force amid slumping markets, people familiar with the situation said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, Reuters reported Goldman planned to cut 10 percent of its staff, or almost 3,300 jobs, reflecting the weak economy and a cut back in proprietary trading. The cuts are an about-face for a company that as recently as September insisted its headcount would rise this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest cuts reduce headcount to the lowest since 2006 and hit every businesses and region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investment bank has managed to avoid the kind of losses from mortgages and corporate loans that have hobbled rivals, yet Goldman still has suffered from the steep decline in merger and underwriting activity, as well as plunging prices for stocks and other investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has quietly and slowly cut jobs all year. The bank laid off hundreds of MA support staff and junior bankers in June due to slowing markets, following a round of leveraged lending and mortgage securities cuts in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early this year, Goldman cut 1,500 people, or 5 percent of its staff, following 2007 performance reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman converted last month to a bank holding company supervised by the Federal Reserve and then raised $10 billion from Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N). These moves, together with a pending $10 billion investment by Treasury, will create a more stable but less profitable company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merrill Lynch analyst Guy Moszkowski last week predicted Goldman will report a fourth-quarter loss, its first since going public in 1999, as plunging markets slam private equity, proprietary trading and on its stake in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Chase  Co aims to join the top ranks in the commodities and energy business and is not pulling back from expansion plans despite the uncertain global economic outlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are striving to be a top-tier commodity franchise globally," said Blythe Masters, head of the U.S. bank's global commodities business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've benefited from a flight to quality and are seeing market share gains," she told Reuters in an interview this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm's strong capital base means it can pursue growth when the credit crunch has forced some rivals to cut back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has added about 50 people this year, giving it more than 450 staff in commodities globally, which includes oil, gas and power, base metals, precious metals, agriculturals, softs, carbon and coal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masters said the firm was pressing ahead with a move into trading physical crude oil and refined products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We entered the physical oil business as planned two months ago and we continue to invest and work on that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said hiring would continue in 2009, but it was too early to say how many people would be taken on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has also been integrating the commodities business of Bear Stearns, which J.P. Morgan acquired earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A whole raft of investment banks moved into commodities during the six-year price boom, but the credit crisis has forced some to drop out of the race, including Lehman Brothers and Swiss bank UBS..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The longstanding players are Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, while Barclays Capital has built a sizeable business over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STRONG INVESTMENT CASE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commodity prices have tumbled from record peaks in the past few months because demand has started to fall as the credit crisis has spilled over into the real economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil, for example, is down more than 50 percent from a record peak above $147 a barrel in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Masters said the credit crisis had created demand from clients for risk management and finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The credit crunch and the difficulties now in accessing capital markets means there is a tremendous need on the part of clients in the commodities space who need to manage price risk or access the capital markets to acquire or restructure assets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investment case for commodities is also still strong, despite the big price falls in oil, copper and even gold, which is a traditional safe haven in turbulent times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The idea that commodities as an asset class is finished is just fundamentally flawed," Masters said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The minute our global economy begins to recover, all of the issues in 2008 around supply and demand in commodities are going to re-emerge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She warned that the current lack of access to capital and retrenchment in investment decisions would risk another period of underinvestment in the commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commodity prices next year will reflect the weak economic climate, but beyond that the same supply issues that drove prices upwards could resurface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masters said the sector needed billions, even trillions of dollars of infrastructure investment over the next few years to keep up with demand from emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investors will need to be very involved over the next decade."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Anthony Barker)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 05 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) is providing consulting services to help Bronx-based
restaurant company 4Food integrate corporate social responsibility values
and practices into its business strategy.

    4Food will open its first restaurant at the site of the historic Concourse
Plaza Hotel near the new Yankee Stadium next year, offering fast, healthy,
reasonably priced versions of foods people like, such as burgers, nuggets,
fries, salads, and teas, with as much as 60 percent of the food items and
ingredients sourced from local farms and producers.

    The restaurant will be designed to encourage people to congregate and
socialize, and 4Food's in-store technology and extensive menu of
ingredients will allow customers to customize their orders based on their
tastes and nutritional needs, even naming and storing their creations so
they can request them again and others can order them. 4Food also will
focus on job skills development and employment for local residents and
neighborhood nutrition outreach.

    Under the agreement signed in September, IBM will help 4Food link CSR to
the company's business strategy, ranging across issues like environmental
practices in its restaurants and through its suppliers, labor policies,
community involvement, and nutrition. IBM also will help the restaurant
chain determine how to use its CSR activities and initiatives to attract
and retain customers.

    "The combination of good nutrition, good social conduct, neighborhood
economic development, and creating local awareness of the connection
between a balanced food consumption and wellness is good not only for
society but also for our business," said Adam Kidron, managing partner of
4Food. "Consumers today want not just value but also values in their
dining choices -- our guests want to know that we adhere to the highest
standards for the quality, safety and nutrition in the food we offer, our
employment practices, the environment, and the way we contribute to the
economic progress and health of the community."

    Through this engagement, IBM is helping 4Food:


--  Identify factors to make the business efficient and successful;
--  Identify ways CSR can contribute to business efficiency and success;
--  Incorporate CSR into a successful business strategy;
--  Understand the value of CSR initiatives;
--  Attract and retain talent;
--  Increase awareness of the company's CSR activities.
    

    
"4Food joins a growing number of businesses that understand that
building social responsibility into their strategies is becoming a
business necessity," said Eric Riddleberger, global leader for IBM's
business strategy consulting practice. "Customers are increasingly
deciding who to give their business to not just on the quality and price
of what's being offered, but on the overall societal impact of a
business."

    Business leaders acknowledge the advantages that come from proactively
addressing corporate social responsibility issues. An IBM global CSR
survey of more than 250 C-suite executives showed that 68 percent of them
already are focusing on CSR activities to create new revenue streams and
54 percent believe CSR gives them a competitive advantage. Additionally,
IBM's biennial global survey of more than 1,100 CEOs showed that the
majority of them plan to increase their investments in CSR by 25 percent
over the next three years.

    In addition, independent research verifies that CSR is important to
consumers. According to UK consumer research firm Fraser Consultancy, a
quarter of all consumers say they would switch brands for a given product
or service if provided with a more ethical alternative. Alloy Media and
Marketing reports that 37 percent of people age 18 to 30 prefer to use
brands that are socially conscious, with more than three-quarters of that
group citing fair labor practices and two-thirds listing environmental
factors as chief concerns.

    To assist clients in incorporating CSR into their business strategies, IBM
Global Business services has developed a set of consulting offerings,
including its CSR Assessment and Benchmarking Utility, the Carbon Tradeoff
Modeler, IBM Green Sigma(TM), and Environmental Product Lifecycle
Management.

&lt;p&gt;  JAKARTA, INDONESIA, Nov 05 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Excelcomindo Pratama (Excelcomindo), Indonesia's third largest
telecommunications provider, has chosen IBM (NYSE: IBM) Service
Management solution to proactively detect and resolve their network
problems. These solutions will enable Excelcomindo to meet the service
quality needs of customers efficiently as they transform and integrate
business and Information Technology processes to support their overall
growth plans.

    Excelcomindo has the goal of becoming the preferred information and
communication technology provider throughout Indonesia, with the
capability to meet customers' communications needs anytime, anywhere
while delivering consistent outstanding service quality.

    To achieve this goal, Excelcomindo required an integrated and
comprehensive network fault and performance management system that would
empower their staff to proactively detect network problems and understand
the real time performance of its multi-vendor network infrastructure,
including legacy and next-generation elements.

    IBM's Service Management solution will allow Excelcomindo to predict
important trends such as cell utilization and performance. This in turn
will help Excelcomindo improve their service quality, network planning and
reduce operating costs. Additionally, this will enable the company to gain
a wider view of their assets and applications to improve operational
efficiency and security.

    "The utilization of IBM service management is relevant to Excelcomindo's
project implementation as the correlation can be easily monitored," said
Wira Wiguna, General Manager, NOC Operations &amp; Maintenance, PT
Excelcomindo Pratama, Tbk. "For example, if a fault occurs that affects
the service and the availability of the network, corrective actions can
be carried out immediately."

    Having done a comprehensive review at the end of 2007, Excelcomindo
decided to choose IBM over HP to support its network management
initiative. The company chose the Netcool/OMNIbus and Netcool Performance
Manager for wireless solutions as this application can efficiently manage
multi-vendor network technologies without having to re-engineer its
management system. The improved business benefit gave IBM the edge over
its competitor's solutions.

    "We are very proud to be the chosen information technology partner for a
growing telco leader like Excelcomindo despite the challenge from
competition," said Kustiawan Kusumo, Country Manager, IBM Software Group.
"IBM is deeply committed to helping growing businesses like Excelcomindo
realize and take advantage of the benefits of such network performance
solutions. IBM's deep industry experience, gained from working with many
of the leading telecommunication companies globally and end-to-end
solutions, makes us a partner of choice for telcos. We look forward to
continuing this collaboration with Excelcomindo to fuel their drive
towards industry leadership in Indonesia," Kustiawan added.

    For this project, IBM teamed with its Business Partners, Fastwire and
Niaga Prima Paramita, to implement the fault and performance management
system based on IBM Tivoli Netcool software. IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus
detects and filters faults, and automates the isolation and resolution of
problems to help staff quickly isolate, analyze and resolve network
problems for improved service quality.

    "Excelcomindo utilizes the IBM Netcool data and software solutions to
identify the needs of its increasing number of BTS towers from 8,936 to
12,290. With the help of these solutions, this telco company owned by the
TM Group from Malaysia can provide network coverage to 90 percent of
Indonesia's population," said Wiguna. "The system framework, costing USD
$1.5 million, begins with the event collection process, which compiles all
events happening in the Element Manager System. This is followed by the
consolidation and analysis process which results in a user friendly format
detailing the key performance and measured quality."

    About PT Excelcomindo Pratama Tbk.

    PT Excelcomindo Pratama Tbk. is one of the largest mobile operators in
Indonesia. Excelcomindo has built more than 12,290 Base Transceiver
Station (BTS) towers across Indonesia and serves 18.2 million customers.

initiative. The company chose the Netcool/OMNIbus and Netcool Performance
Manager for wireless solutions as this application can efficiently manage
multi-vendor network technologies without having to re-engineer its
management system. The improved business benefit gave IBM the edge over
its competitor's solutions.

    "We are very proud to be the chosen information technology partner for a
growing telco leader like Excelcomindo despite the challenge from
competition," said Kustiawan Kusumo, Country Manager, IBM Software Group.
"IBM is deeply committed to helping growing businesses like Excelcomindo
realize and take advantage of the benefits of such network performance
solutions. IBM's deep industry experience, gained from working with many
of the leading telecommunication companies globally and end-to-end
solutions, makes us a partner of choice for telcos. We look forward to
continuing this collaboration with Excelcomindo to fuel their drive
towards industry leadership in Indonesia," Kustiawan added.

    For this project, IBM teamed with its Business Partners, Fastwire and
Niaga Prima Paramita, to implement the fault and performance management
system based on IBM Tivoli Netcool software. IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus
detects and filters faults, and automates the isolation and resolution of
problems to help staff quickly isolate, analyze and resolve network
problems for improved service quality.

    "Excelcomindo utilizes the IBM Netcool data and software solutions to
identify the needs of its increasing number of BTS towers from 8,936 to
12,290. With the help of these solutions, this telco company owned by the
TM Group from Malaysia can provide network coverage to 90 percent of
Indonesia's population," said Wiguna. "The system framework, costing USD
$1.5 million, begins with the event collection process, which compiles all
events happening in the Element Manager System. This is followed by the
consolidation and analysis process which results in a user friendly format
detailing the key performance and measured quality."

    About PT Excelcomindo Pratama Tbk.

    PT Excelcomindo Pratama Tbk. is one of the largest mobile operators in
Indonesia. Excelcomindo has built more than 12,290 Base Transceiver
Station (BTS) towers across Indonesia and serves 18.2 million customers.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY and DEVON, PA, Nov 05 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Prudential Fox &amp; Roach Realtors, the leading regional
home services company in the Northeast, today announced that the realty
company replaced HP and Sun technology with IBM servers and storage to
support the sales efforts of over 3,000 real estate agents and securely
protect the data of thousands of clients. Using IBM blade server
technology, the realty company lowered power and cooling costs by nearly
$60,000 annually.

    Privately-held Prudential Fox &amp; Roach is the third largest real estate,
mortgage and title insurance company in the nation and the top realtor in
the Northeast region. The realtor views technology as an important means
of attracting and retaining talented agents, who require fast, dynamic
tools to update property listings or relay contracts to the office.
Leading-edge technology enables Prudential Fox &amp; Roach's agents to
complete sales and provide insurance and mortgages to their clients in a
cost-effective and efficient manner.

    The realty company replaced 93 HP Proliant servers with an IBM BladeCenter
solution running VMware virtualization technology to provide a secure
disaster recovery solution that will allow for easier data recovery if
needed. Coupling the energy efficient design of IBM BladeCenter with
virtualization technology also allowed Prudential Fox &amp; Roach to reduce
its power and cooling costs by $60,000 a year -- a significant savings
for the mid-sized realty company.

    "The migration to IBM BladeCenter and System Storage will allow us to
scale as we continue to grow," said William Friemann, vice president of
Operations, Security and Compliance at Prudential Fox &amp; Roach. "Our
storage and processing requirements continue to evolve and we needed a
solution that would evolve with us as we face new business challenges,
which IBM delivered. We can also invest the money we save on power bills
back in to the business to fuel growth."

    The company is running four BladeCenter H chassis in its central
datacenter as well as one BladeCenter S chassis in a separate location to
support all of Prudential Fox &amp; Roach's remote real estate offices.
Prudential Fox &amp; Roach selected BladeCenter S for its ability to run
outside the datacenter on standard 110 volt power, eliminating the need
for an expensive power upgrade.

    Prudential Fox &amp; Roach also replaced Sun storage equipment with IBM System
Storage to securely and centrally manage company assets and client data.
IBM Global Technology Services helped the company successfully migrate to
its new IBM technology.

    About Prudential Fox &amp; Roach Realtors

    Prudential Fox &amp; Roach Realtors is the #1 Realtor in the region and the #1
single-market Realtor in the nation. This market dominance and resources
gives Prudential Fox &amp; Roach an unmatched ability to perform for clients.

    One of the nation's oldest providers of real estate services, Prudential
Fox &amp; Roach Realtors has since 1886 been permanently woven into the fabric
of the communities it serves. Whether clients are buying, selling, renting
or relocating, Prudential Fox &amp; Roach makes available a team of passionate

&lt;p&gt;  BEIJING, Nov 05 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
At the OpenOffice.org (OO) Conference, IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced a
long-term commitment to the OpenDocument Format (ODF) by unveiling a
roadmap for the expansion of the free Lotus  Symphony office application
suite to MacIntosh, Ubuntu Linux, OpenOffice 3.0 and Microsoft Office
customers.

    In his keynote speech, Michael Karasick, Director of IBM Lotus China
Development Labs, outlined the evolution of Symphony, which first appeared
as a public beta on September 18, 2007. The newest version is now
available in beta for the first time for the Apple MacIntosh operating
system (Mac OS X), and Symphony for Canonical's Ubuntu 8.0.4 Linux is
also available. These new platforms reflect growing demand for Symphony,
which has already been downloaded more than three million times worldwide
in 28 languages.

    Karasick also pointed forward to the Symphony roadmap for 2009, when
future generations of Symphony will be developed entirely on the ODF 1.2
and OpenOffice 3.0 software code base, bringing it in line with the
newest OO technology. This advance will also enable seamless
interoperability with Microsoft Office 2007 file formats and support
Visual Basic macros next year. IBM plans to deliver more than 60 new
features to Symphony in 2009, building it into a versatile tool for work
while pledging to keep it free on the Web for all. By synchronizing
Symphony's user interface with the underlying OpenOffice 3.0 code base,
IBM expects the upcoming wave of planned contributions to make a
significant impact to the OpenOffice developer community and its users
throughout 2009 and beyond.

    Mac OS X support is among the top requests made by the members of the
Symphony community. The IBM Symphony development team worked to ensure
that Symphony not only works on Mac OS X but is tuned to take advantage of
the Aqua GUI theme, with the originality and simplicity Mac customers have
enjoyed. Initially available in English, Symphony for Mac OS X will get
global language support as it progresses out of beta to general
availability.

    Another top request, support for Symphony on Ubuntu 8.0.4 Linux, has
quickly moved to general availability. Symphony 1.1 provides a debian
package optimized for Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron). Ubuntu is a community
developed operating system for laptops, desktops and servers noted for its
ease of use, array of application support and focus on being ready-to-use.

    "Support for Mac and Ubuntu are good examples of IBM's long-term
commitment to critical standards like the Open Document format," said
Karasick. "As we rebase Symphony on Open Office 3.0, we are very excited
about providing next-generation document creation and collaboration
capabilities for the millions of potential users out there. IBM also sees
the potential for the global developer community to use Symphony
extensibility in concert with that of ODF 1.2, so that documents can be
more deeply integrated into business applications and processes."

    IBM Lotus Symphony is based on OpenOffice code, with IBM enhancements that
allow new capabilities through Eclipse plug-ins and incorporate some of
the OpenOffice 3.0 code. Plug-ins extend the power of the individual to
accomplish more varied tasks with Symphony than they could otherwise
accomplish with alternatives like Microsoft Office. For example, Internet
searches launched from within a document could save time while drawing
precise data into the right context, increasing accuracy and impact. A 
Symphony plug-in for IBM's Yahoo Omnifind Personal Edition search tool
can help accomplish just that. Another example is the Symphony
accessibility plug-in, which enables the visually impaired to easily work
with word processing, slide or spreadsheet files. The accessibility
plug-in uses an audio screen reader to inform the individual of the
content and status as changes are made. For a full list of currently
available Symphony plug-ins at no charge, visit
(http://symphony.lotus.com/software/lotus/symphony/plugin.nsf/home).

    The underlying use of Eclipse through Lotus Expeditor allows developers to
use open tools to customize the Symphony user interface so individuals can
change their view of, and access to, desktop utilities such as file menus
and toolbars for greater personal efficiency. Symphony 1.2 also contains
data pilot tables, also known as pivot tables, which lets people quickly
and easily sort large spreadsheets in more meaningful ways, making the
spreadsheet data far more applicable and accessible to business
activities.

    All types of users can benefit from Lotus Symphony -- spanning the
spectrum of business, government and philanthropic organizations across
the globe. A valuable business tool as well as a way to reduce costs,
Symphony is being used by:

    Alok Industries, a publicly traded textile and apparel fabric
manufacturer in Mumbai, India.  The Anglican Church of Australia, based
in Sydney, which is openly phasing out Office in favor of Symphony for an
estimated US$150,000 in annual savings. Client organizations that benefit
from Church community services will also use Symphony, including schools,
youth groups and aged care facilities.  Calvary Baptist Academy, a
private school located in Shreveport, LA, which is using Symphony as part
of a small-medium business solution led by Lotus Foundations and
delivered by IBM business partner, Altis Computer Systems.  DotRiver, a
French computer services firm focusing on virtualization and storage
technology.  The Hester Group, a Jacksonville, Florida-based branding and
marketing group specializing in public awareness service announcements
for diverse demographics. Symphony is part of a small-medium business
solution with the Lotus Foundations software appliance, delivered by IBM
business partner OnSite Technology, Inc.  Grupo Schahin, one of Brazil's
largest, multi-industry conglomerates in banking, energy, aerospace,
telecommunications and other sectors.  Pearson, an international media
company with world-leading businesses in education, business information
and consumer publishing based in the United Kingdom and New York. 
Premier Auto Electric Ltd (PAE), a nationwide distributor of automotive
parts in India.  Sinochem Corporation, a Beijing, China-based,
state-owned petrochemical company helping to align the transformation of
agriculture, energy and chemicals with the development of China's
economy.  Smartline, an award-winning financial services firm in New
South Wales, Australia.  Suntel, a national telecommunications leader in
Sri Lanka, which installed Symphony in place of Office.  Winsol, a
Belgium-based manufacturer of PVC and aluminum doors and other housing
products. 

    "After one day of using Lotus Symphony, some of my users asked if they
could uninstall their Microsoft Office software," said Katia Sanfins, CIO
of Schahin Engineering, Grupo Schahin.

    At least 80 percent of traditional and non-traditional office workers are
considered "task users," who create and edit documents, spreadsheets and
presentations. People in customer service and most roles in other
corporate support functions fit this use pattern. These categories
constitute the majority of Sympony users. Another category that is
migrating to Symphony consists of "medium power users" -- those with more
robust needs for documents, spreadsheets and presentations. These users
-- such as sales departments working with clients -- requires stronger
interoperability to enable collaboration with Microsoft Office users.

    "Lotus Symphony is an exciting offering which can save our business real
dollars, up to $600 per seat. Standardising our platform Office
productivity suite will allow us to streamline development by maintaining
a single codebase and reduce IT support issues," said Ganesh
Radhakrishnan, IT Manager, Smartline Mortgage Services. "I have been
using it to load in a huge complex spreadsheet and everything works
perfectly."

    "Our initial evaluation and pilot of Lotus Symphony has gone very well. We
see a lot of potential in leveraging Lotus Symphony, especially in support
of our Mac OSx users, and look forward to participating in this beta,"
said Michael Colucci, VP of Architecture, Engineering and Support,
Pearson.

    "I have used the Symphony software and have found it to be as good as or
better than Microsoft Word," said Kathy Rutledge, Calbary Baptist Academy.
"After using MS Word for eighteen years, I was hesitant to even try
another word processing program. But after giving Symphony a chance, I
found it very user-friendly. I would recommend Symphony to anyone looking
for a user-friendly software that includes word processing, slide
presentation, and spreadsheet capabilities."

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, stock movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 5 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded Microchip
Technology Inc (MCHP.O) to "sell" from "neutral," citing a
slowdown in the chipmaker's core growth and the impact from
rising competition in the microcontroller (MCU) market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company were trading down about 10 percent at
$22.78 before the bell. They closed at $25.28 Tuesday on
Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While changes in the MCU market occur at a slow pace, our
field work suggests an inflection in the competitive
environment that we expect to become more evident in
Microchip's growth in the next 12-18 months," the brokerage
said in a note to clients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microchip is facing increased competition from larger
companies like STMicroelectronics (STM.N), Texas Instruments
Inc TXN.N and Freescale Semiconductor, which may also lead to
pricing and gross margin pressure, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage cut its six-month price target to $21 from
$26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs said it would swap out of Microchip into
Analog Devices Inc ADI.N, which it expects will maintain its
leading position in data converters, and that Analog has a
strong presence in amplifiers market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage maintained its "buy" rating on Analog Devices
but cut its price target on the stock by $2 to $32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analog shares closed at $22.20 Tuesday on the New York
Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;IBM, Sun Microsystems Launch ODF Toolkit Union to Grow Adoption, Community and Software Innovation

BEIJING--(Business Wire)--
IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Sun Microsystems, Inc. (NASDAQ:JAVA) today
announced the launch of the OpenDocument Format (ODF) Toolkit Union, a
new open-source software community project organized to make document
software more innovative, versatile and useful for business.

   The ODF Toolkit will use an initial software code contribution
from Sun to provide developers with an easy-to-use Application
Programming Interface (API) for reading, writing and manipulating ODF
documents while accelerating additional application development. One
part of the initial code contribution is an ODF Validator, a tool that
validates OpenDocument files and checks certain conformance criteria.
Capitalizing on the open, elegant nature of ODF, the Toolkit targets
developers who want to create new applications and solutions ranging
from content management, business workflows and activities to
Web-based document solutions.

   The ODF Toolkit will break down barriers between people and their
data by providing support for a wide range of new applications. The
ODF Toolkit Union will complement other industry efforts such as the
ODF standardization work done at the Organization for the Advancement
of Structured Information Standards (OASIS). These initiatives
collectively are eliminating the economical and technical barriers to
creativity, use and overall utility of documents.

   One example could involve the ability to process invoice and
shipping data in ODF formatted purchasing documents. Coupled with
ordering and shipping applications, real-time stock and inventory
information could always be available and kept current by multiple
applications mining the same structured XML-based ODF information
generated.

   "The future of accessing and distributing software is here today,"
said Michael Bemmer, senior director, Collaboration Engineering, Sun.
"It is no longer an acceptable business practice to have silos of
office document data stored in proprietary formats. The industry has
moved forward and is replacing the silos with business content, such
as on-premise business applications, software solutions offered over
the Internet and applications supported by mobile devices that are
critical in Service Oriented Architectures."

   "We envision each document literally taking on a life of its own,
conveying the actionable insight and business value intended by its
creators, rather than the static ledger we have been forced to accept
- until now," said Bob Picciano, general manager, IBM Lotus Software.

   Developers using the ODF Toolkit will be able to easily produce
new applications that:

   -- automatically create reports in response to database queries

   -- index or scan documents to support search services

   -- scan documents to support anti-virus services

   -- scan documents for regulatory compliance, legal or forensic
purposes

   -- convert from one editable format to another

   -- render documents via other modalities such as audio, video as
in unified communications

   -- import data from an office document into a non-office
application; for example, import spreadsheet data into a statistical
analysis application for business intelligence use.

   -- render and import documents for mobile device display and
editing constraints

   Many traditional and leading online office applications offer ODF
as the default file format. These include Sun's StarOffice,
OpenOffice.org, IBM's Lotus Symphony, Redflag Chinese 2000's
RedOffice, KOffice, GoogleDocs, Zoho and others.

   The ODF Toolkit open source software project is established at
http://odftoolkit.org. The founding members Sun and IBM invite and
welcome other contributors to join the ODF Toolkit Union.

   ODF is an open standard supported by a committee of many vendors
and independent contributors at the OASIS standards development
organization. Since it is not controlled by a single vendor, ODF
prevents vendor lock-in by enabling documents to be accessible from
multiple applications, rather than by a single vendor's application.
The OpenDocument Format standard is an XML-based specification
describing the contents and formatting of documents, spreadsheets and
presentations. It has been developed and managed by the OASIS
standards organization and is available as an international standard,
ISO/IEC 26300.

&lt;p&gt; * Q3 sales volume up 4 pct to 610 mln unit cases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Keeps 2008 profit, sales targets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Says continues to look for cost-cutting opportunities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Add details, valuation, managing director's quote)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Angeliki Koutantou&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ATHENS, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Hellenic HLBr.AT stuck
to its 2008 targets after posting a flat third-quarter profit at
the high end of market expectations, and said it would continue
containing costs in a bid to boost profits in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola Hellenic (CCH), the world's second largest Coke
(KO.N) bottler, on Wednesday reported unchanged year-on-year net
profit of 213 million euros ($276.2 million) versus an average
of 206.5 million euros forecast by analysts recently polled by
Reuters. Forecasts ranged from 181 million to 213 million euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The global soft drinks business has been badly hit by higher
input costs and the world economic crisis, which has resulted in
consumers cutting back on spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, CCH cut its 2008 profit and volume targets for
the second time this year, blaming the economic downturn and
unfavourable weather in key markets such as Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CCH bottles Coke-branded products in 28 countries across
Europe and in Nigeria, with more than half of its revenues
coming from its developing and emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bottler said cost containment and price increases in the
third quarter helped mitigate lower consumer spending and kept
its targets for flat earnings per share and 4 percent volume
growth for the full year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The weak market conditions continue to impact our results,"
Managing Director Doros Constantinou said in a phone interview
with Reuters. "Our business model continues to be strong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the bottler was looking to further reduce fixed
costs and administrative expenses to boost profitability next
year. CCH saved about 25 million euros on costs in the third
quarter and plans to do the same in the last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AS EXPECTED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Athens-based analyst said there was still uncertainty
over 2009 profits: "Results came largely as expected but
visibility on 2009 profitability remains low."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At 0952 GMT, shares in CCH, 23 percent owned by Coca-Cola,
were up 2.25 percent compared to a 1.5 percent fall on the
Athens bourse's general index .ATG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CCH said sales volumes rose 4 percent to 610 million unit
cases after a 4.5 percent decline in its largest market Russia
and an unfavourable product mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Constantinou said the economic downturn had hurt lucrative
direct-to-consumer sales, which account for about 43 percent of
the group's volume, and the fast-growing water business,
particularly in established markets, in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Volume in established markets was flat while developing and
emerging markets grew 9 percent and 6 percent respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales revenues rose 9 percent to 2.075 billion euros with
Ukraine, Nigeria and Bulgaria leading emerging markets
performance with a double-digit percentage volume growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CCH, said it was planning to raise capital from the debt
market soon to finance its 270 million euro acquisition of
Italian bottler Socib and refinance a 350 million euro bond,
which expires in March. The bottler had cash of 388 million
euros at the end of September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CCH stock trades at 9 times estimated 2008 earnings,
compared with a multiple of 7.8 for Coca Cola Enterprises
(CCE.N), the world's largest bottler of Coke drinks, according
to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has fallen 60 percent since the start of the year
compared to a 57 percent loss for the Athens bourse's general
index .ATG.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO Nov 5 (Reuters) - Japanese pension funds plan to
increase their investments in alternative assets while reducing
domestic equities in their portfolios, to diversify after the
subprime shock, JP Morgan Asset Management said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pension funds also plan to increase allocations of domestic
bonds to hedge against the risk of falling share prices, a survey
by the Japanese asset management arm of third-biggest U.S. bank
JP Morgan (JPM.N) showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Pension funds are more concerned about the risk of a drop in
share prices rather than the risk of a rise in interest rates,"
Hidenori Suzuki, a vice president of JP Morgan Asset Management
Japan, told reporters in a briefing on the survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Pension funds are now at a turning point and they are
looking to diversify especially as the market environment has
changed after the subprime problems," Suzuki said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The survey showed that 69.7 percent of the 72 respondents
indicated that they will cut equity allocations mainly in
domestic shares, while 51.5 percent were planning to shift into
alternative assets such as hedge funds and private equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nearly half of the respondents held assets of more than 100
billion yen ($1 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The survey was conducted between June and early October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pension funds' allocation plans for foreign equities were
nearly balanced, with 33.3 percent of the respondents saying they
will cut their allocations, while 27.3 percent said they will
increase them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The survey showed Japanese pension funds' investments in
alternative assets were concentrated in absolute return products,
such as funds of funds. The participation rate in absolute return
products was 79 percent in Japan, sharply higher than 59 percent
in the United States and 42 percent in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Private equity and real estate related instruments have not
been commonly accepted in Japan, while they are more common in
the United States and Europe, the survey showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cash-rich Japanese pensions, however, are showing interest in
allocating into alternative asset instruments linked to real
estate, private equity, infrastructure and commodities, the
survey showed.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks sold off on Thursday in the worst two-day slide since October 1987 with disappointing corporate outlooks and bleak sales from major retailers fueling fears of a deepening economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underscoring concerns about anemic consumer spending heading into the holiday season, retail chains posted the worst monthly sales data in more than three decades as consumers, beleaguered by the financial crisis, slashed spending in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Target (TGT.N) and other discounters reported larger-than-expected drops in same-store sales, sending Target down 6 percent. An SP index of retailers .RLX sank 5.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This downward spiral of negative feedback is spreading to the economy as a whole and to the consumer, and that's not a positive sign for stocks," said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at Morgan Asset Management in Birmingham, Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those are things that there's really no quick fix for and we're seeing that discounted in the market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cautious investors looked ahead to Friday's jobs payroll data, which is expected to further underscore the weakening economy after weekly jobless claims fell but still showed serious labor market strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broader market, measured by the SP 500, experienced its worst two-day slide since October 1987. Despite a strong rally on Election Day earlier in the week, the market has not been able to make much headway as it tries to come back from a disastrous October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 is up 6.59 percent from its October 27 close, which was its lowest close since March 2003. But the SP, the Dow industrials and the Nasdaq are still at multi-year lows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI tumbled 443.48 points, or 4.85 percent, to 8,695.79. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index .SPX dove 47.89 points, or 5.03 percent, to 904.88. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC shed 72.94 points, or 4.34 percent, to 1,608.70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broad Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 .DWCF slid 468.11 points, or 4.9 percent, representing a paper loss of about $600 billion, to close at 9,079.72. In the last two days, the DJ Wilshire 5000 index has fallen nearly 10 percent, amounting to a paper loss of about $1.2 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DISNEY AND QUALCOMM DROP AFTER BELL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the bell, shares of Dow component Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) fell 9 percent to $20.75 after the entertainment company reported quarterly profit that missed expectations. In regular trading, Disney closed at $22.81, down 5.9 percent on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) also fell in after-hours trading after the supplier of cell phone chips and technology licenses gave a weaker-than-expected outlook. Qualcomm was down 3.8 percent at $31.80. In regular Nasdaq trading, Qualcomm had dropped 6 percent to end at $33.05.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CISCO AND CHEVRON SLIDE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the regular session, Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) lost 2.6 percent to close at $16.94 on Nasdaq after it said following Wednesday's closing bell that revenue could fall as much as 10 percent in the current quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron (CVX.N) was the biggest drag on the Dow, sliding 6.4 percent to $70.11 on the New York Stock Exchange as the price of oil slid on concerns that demand will suffer during a recession. U.S. front-month oil futures dropped $4.53 to settle at $60.77 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-listed stock of News Corp NWSa.N dove 15.6 percent to $8.26 on the NYSE after the Australian media conglomerate cut its full-year forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of General Motors (GM.N) slid 13.7 percent to $4.80 as U.S. auto executives were set to meet with a top lawmaker to seek urgent aid to weather the global slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford (F.N) was down 5.3 percent at $1.98.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese rival Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T)(TM.N) more than halved its profit forecasts as the financial crisis batters demand for its cars. Toyota's U.S.-listed stock skidded 16.5 percent to $67.09 on the NYSE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discount retail chain Target shed 6 percent to $35.47. Among other retailers that posted a decline in same-store sales, mid-priced department store operator J.C. Penney (JCP.N) fell 1.5 percent to $21.90, and luxury retailer Saks Inc SKS.N lost 5.3 percent to $5.16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trading was moderate on the New York Stock Exchange, with about 1.53 billion shares changing hands, below last year's estimated daily average of roughly 1.90 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 2.39 billion shares traded, above last year's daily average of 2.17 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones on the New York Stock Exchange by a ratio of about 5 to 1, while on the Nasdaq, about 11 stocks fell for every three that rose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although disappointed not to make the most of ideal scoring conditions in Thursday's opening round, the American was delighted to be back on the PGA Tour after a three-year gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I feel great," Compton, 28, told reporters after firing a two-under-par 70 on the Walt Disney World Resort's Palm course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I made a lot of birdies and bogeys. The front nine I just didn't really have it and I knew I needed to get something going on the back because the scores are pretty low."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compton, who received a sponsor's invitation to compete in the final Tour event of the season, covered the back nine in three-under 33 to end the day seven strokes off the lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm kind of disappointed with the way I scored today but I'm still in it," he said. "I think I have just as good of a chance to play well as everybody else."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in Tour action for the first time since the 2005 Doral Championship near his home in Miami, Compton was diagnosed with an enlarged heart as a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the age of 12, he had his first transplant before going on to become a top junior golfer, competing as an amateur in the 2001 Walker Cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had a second transplant in May this year and then conjured a final-round comeback with a sparkling 68 in the first stage of PGA Tour qualifying last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compton produced one of just three sub-par rounds in gusting winds to earn a place in the second stage of qualifying later this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's unbelievable and playing a PGA Tour event this soon after the transplant, I'm kind of riding a wave right now," he said. "But that's how life is. You get opportunities and you try to make the most of them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles; Editing by Ed Osmond)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The global economic downturn hit Walt Disney Co's quarterly results harder and faster than Wall Street expected, with the company on Thursday reporting a sharp decline in hotel bookings and softness in advertising revenue at its networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney's shares slid 9 percent in extended trade but recovered a bit after executives announced plans to discount stays at Walt Disney World to stimulate bookings in the first half of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Consumer confidence is the lowest we've seen in over three decades, and even the best product out there is feeling the effect," Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger told analysts on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's dour view came hours after U.S. retail chains posted their worst October sales results in more than 30 years as consumers cut spending sharply in the face of a financial crisis that has derailed the U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the call, Iger said senior executives were looking at ways to cut costs companywide. "Significant savings will be delivered," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news came as the No. 2 U.S. entertainment company reported a 13 percent decline in quarterly net income due in part to a bad debt charge. Revenue, however, topped Wall Street analysts' estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We kind of expected a rapid deceleration, but this is even worse than even we or investors were expecting ... in its severity and in how fast this is affecting them," Pali Capital analyst Rich Greenfield said of the theme parks results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney reported net earnings of $760 million, or 40 cents per share, down from net earnings of $877 million, or 44 cents per share in last year's fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding items, Disney posted earnings of 43 per share. On that basis, analysts had been expecting earnings of 49 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue rose 6 percent to $9.45 billion from $8.93 billion a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected revenue of $9.33 billion for the quarter, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A TOUGHER MARKETPLACE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney said the advertising climate had softened the performance of its cable and broadcast networks in the fourth quarter, and that its U.S. theme parks and resorts suffered under higher labor and fuel costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executives said attendance at Disney's U.S. theme parks is down 1 percent so far in the current quarter and that bookings for the first two quarters of fiscal 2009 are down "a little under 10 percent" from last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are seeing a marketplace that is clearly tougher than it was in fiscal year 2008 and our ability to predict is very limited," Iger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added, however, that consumers may be taking "a wait and see approach" to booking vacations next year. Typically, Disney said, consumers plan vacations 10 to 12 weeks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caris  Co analyst David Miller saw a positive note in the fact that bookings in the current quarter were down just 1 percent versus last year's record attendance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People thought attendance would be down much harder," Miller said. "I think the stock price is reflecting Armageddon at the parks. Of course the parks are going to slow, but is that deserving of $20 a share?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Disney fell 4.7 percent to $21.73 after closing down 5.9 percent at $22.81 on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has seen its share price fall nearly 25 percent since its fiscal fourth quarter ended September 27, as the Dow Jones Industrial average declined about 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's theme parks showed a 7 percent increase in revenue during the most recent quarter, helped by higher guest spending. But operating profit at the unit fell 4 percent due to higher labor costs at Walt Disney World and increased fuel costs at the Disney Cruise Line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media networks showed 4 percent revenue growth but flat operating profit in the quarter due to lower advertising revenue at its broadcast unit and on higher costs for TV pilots and coverage of the U.S. presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pricing for spot advertising was running low double-digit percentages ahead of last year's first quarter, Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said.

performance of its cable and broadcast networks in the fourth
quarter, and that its U.S. theme parks and resorts suffered
under higher labor and fuel costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Executives said attendance at Disney's U.S. theme parks is
down 1 percent so far in the current quarter and that bookings
for the first two quarters of fiscal 2009 are down "a little
under 10 percent" from last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are seeing a marketplace that is clearly tougher than

report, saw its revenue rise 41 percent and profits jump 14
percent, driven by licensing revenue from popular brands such
as "Hannah Montana" and "High School Musical."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iger said the company believes it will see a decline in
consumer spending at retailers that may hit "possibly during
the holiday season but almost certainly during calendar 2009."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Studio entertainment revenue and operating profit fell due
to weaker movie titles and higher marketing expenses for
fourth-quarter releases including "Beverly Hills Chihuahua."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Several titles performed well in the current quarter
including "Beverly Hills Chihuahua" and "High School Musical 3"
and DVD releases for "Tinker Bell" and "Sleeping Beauty".

 (Updates with Walt Disney and Qualcomm after the bell)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Leah Schnurr&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Nov 6 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks sold off on
Thursday in the worst two-day slide since October 1987  with
disappointing corporate outlooks and bleak sales from major
retailers fueling fears of a deepening economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Underscoring concerns about anemic consumer spending
heading into the holiday season, retail chains posted the
worst monthly sales data in more than three decades as
consumers, beleaguered by the financial crisis, slashed
spending in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Target (TGT.N) and other discounters reported
larger-than-expected drops in same-store sales, sending Target
down 6 percent. An SP index of retailers .RLX sank 5.4
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This downward spiral of negative feedback is spreading to
the economy as a whole and to the consumer, and that's not a
positive sign for stocks," said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice
president at Morgan Asset Management in Birmingham, Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Those are things that there's really no quick fix for and
we're seeing that discounted in the market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cautious investors looked ahead to Friday's jobs payroll
data, which is expected to further underscore the weakening
economy after weekly jobless claims fell but still showed
serious labor market strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The broader market, measured by the SP 500, experienced
its worst two-day slide since October 1987. Despite a strong
rally on Election Day earlier in the week, the market has not
been able to make much headway as it tries to come back from a
disastrous October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SP 500 is up 6.59 percent from its Oct. 27 close,
which was its lowest close since March 2003. But the SP, the
Dow industrials and the Nasdaq are still at multi-year lows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI tumbled 443.48
points, or 4.85 percent, to 8,695.79. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX dove 47.89 points, or 5.03 percent, to
904.88. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC shed 72.94 points,
or 4.34 percent, to 1,608.70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The broad Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 .DWCF slid 468.11
points, or 4.9 percent, representing a paper loss of about
$600 billion, to close at 9,079.72. In the last two days, the
DJ Wilshire 5000 index has fallen nearly 10 percent, amounting
to a paper loss of about $1.2 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DISNEY AND QUALCOMM DROP AFTER BELL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the bell, shares of Dow component Walt Disney Co
(DIS.N) fell 9 percent to $20.75 after the entertainment
company reported quarterly profit that missed expectations.
[ID:nN06329949]. In regular trading, Disney closed at $22.81,
down 5.9 percent on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) also fell in after-hours trading
after the supplier of cell phone chips and technology licenses
gave a weaker-than-expected outlook. Qualcomm was down 3.8
percent at $31.80. [ID:nN06410866]. In regular Nasdaq trading,
Qualcomm had dropped 6 percent to end at $33.05.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CISCO AND CHEVRON SLIDE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During the regular session, Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) lost
2.6 percent to close at $16.94 on Nasdaq after it said
following Wednesday's closing bell that revenue could fall as
much as 10 percent in the current quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron (CVX.N) was the biggest drag on the Dow, sliding
6.4 percent to $70.11 on the New York Stock Exchange as the
price of oil slid on concerns that demand will suffer during a
recession. U.S. front-month oil futures CLc1 dropped $4.53
to settle at $60.77 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S.-listed stock of News Corp NWSa.N dove 15.6
percent to $8.26 on the NYSE after the Australian media
conglomerate cut its full-year forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of General Motors (GM.N) slid 13.7 percent to $4.80
as U.S. auto executives were set to meet with a top lawmaker
to seek urgent aid to weather the global slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ford (F.N) was down 5.3 percent at $1.98.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Japanese rival Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T)(TM.N) more than
halved its profit forecasts as the financial crisis batters
demand for its cars. Toyota's U.S.-listed stock skidded 16.5
percent to $67.09 on the NYSE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Discount retail chain Target shed 6 percent to $35.47.
Among other retailers that posted a decline in same-store
sales, mid-priced department store operator J.C. Penney
(JCP.N) fell 1.5 percent to $21.90, and luxury retailer Saks
Inc SKS.N lost 5.3 percent to $5.16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trading was moderate on the New York Stock Exchange, with
about 1.53 billion shares changing hands, below last year's
estimated daily average of roughly 1.90 billion, while on
Nasdaq, about 2.39 billion shares traded, above last year's
daily average of 2.17 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones on the New
York Stock Exchange by a ratio of about 5 to 1, while on the
Nasdaq, about 11 stocks fell for every three that rose.

BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) today reported earnings for the
fiscal year and fourth quarter ended September 27, 2008. Diluted
earnings per share (EPS) for the year was $2.28, compared to $2.25 in
the prior year. EPS for both the current and prior year included the
impact of certain items discussed below. Excluding these items, EPS
for the current year increased 18% to $2.27 compared to $1.92 in the
prior year.

   EPS for the prior year included gains on the sales of our
interests in E! Entertainment and Us Weekly, favorable adjustments
related to prior-year income tax matters, income from the discontinued
operations of the ABC Radio business, and an equity-based compensation
plan modification charge. Collectively, these items resulted in a net
benefit of $0.33. EPS for the current year included an accounting gain
related to the acquisition of the Disney Stores in North America, a
gain on the sale of movies.com, the favorable resolution of certain
prior-year income tax matters, and a fourth quarter bad debt charge
for a receivable from Lehman Brothers. Collectively, these items
resulted in a net benefit of $0.01 per share.

   For the quarter, EPS was $0.40 compared to $0.44 in the prior-year
quarter. Excluding the bad debt charge in the current-year quarter and
the favorable resolution of tax matters in the prior-year quarter, EPS
for the quarter was $0.43 compared to $0.42 for the prior-year
quarter.

   "I'm pleased by Disney's strong performance in fiscal year 2008,
especially in light of the challenging economic environment," said
Robert A. Iger, president and CEO. "This is clearly a difficult and
unpredictable time and while our businesses aren't immune, the
strength of our assets, brands, and management team positions us well
for the long term."

   Cable Networks

   Operating income at Cable Networks increased $523 million to $4.1
billion for the year driven by increases at ESPN, higher income at our
cable equity investments, and increases at ABC Family and the domestic
Disney Channels, partially offset by a favorable settlement of a claim
with a distributor in the prior year at the international Disney
Channels. The growth at ESPN was driven by higher affiliate and
advertising revenue, partially offset by higher programming,
administrative and marketing costs. The increase in affiliate revenue
was due to contractual rate increases and subscriber growth. Increased
advertising revenues reflected improved rates and ratings. Growth at
our cable equity investments was primarily due to higher affiliate and
advertising revenue at Lifetime and a gain on the sale of a European
cable channel. The growth at ABC Family was primarily due to the
absence of Major League Baseball programming costs, higher affiliate
revenue reflecting contractual rate increases, and higher advertising
revenue reflecting higher average ratings and rates. The increase at
the domestic Disney Channel was primarily due to higher affiliate
revenue reflecting subscriber growth and contractual rate increases
and strong DVD sales of High School Musical 2.

   For the quarter, operating income at Cable Networks increased $116
million to $1.2 billion primarily due to growth at ESPN, higher income
at our cable equity investments, and increases at the domestic Disney
Channel and at ABC Family Channel, partially offset by the favorable
settlement of a claim with a distributor in the prior-year quarter.
The growth at ESPN was driven by higher affiliate revenue, partially
offset by lower advertising revenue. Higher affiliate revenue was due
to contractual rate increases, subscriber growth and increased
recognition of previously deferred revenues related to annual
programming commitments. During the quarter, ESPN recognized $396
million of previously deferred revenue compared to $359 million in the
prior-year quarter. Growth at our cable equity investments was
primarily due to a gain on the sale of a European cable channel and
higher affiliate and advertising revenue at Lifetime. The growth at
the domestic Disney Channel was primarily due to higher affiliate
revenue driven by subscriber growth and contractual rate increases,
while the increase at ABC Family Channel was due to higher affiliate
revenue driven by contractual rate increases and higher advertising
revenue due to higher average ratings and rates.

   Broadcasting

   Operating income at Broadcasting decreased $43 million to $655
million for the year primarily due to lower advertising revenue at the
owned television stations, partially offset by an improvement at the
Internet Group. At the Internet Group, decreased costs for the
Disney-branded mobile phone service, which was shut down during the
first quarter of the current year, were partially offset by higher
costs related to international mobile and on-line operations and our
Disney.com website. Results at the ABC Television Network were
comparable to the prior year as the impact of lower ratings was offset
by higher advertising rates and digital media revenues. In television
distribution, higher syndication and international sales revenue was
offset by higher production cost amortization.

   For the quarter, the operating loss at Broadcasting increased $117
million to a loss of $150 million, driven by a decrease at the ABC
Television Network and lower advertising revenues at the owned
television stations, partially offset by an improvement at the
Internet Group. The decrease at the ABC Television Network reflected
lower advertising revenues, higher pilot expenses and increased news
production costs related to presidential election coverage. Lower
advertising revenues were due to lower ratings and sold inventory
partially offset by higher rates. Increased pilot costs reflected a
delay of pick-up decisions to the fourth quarter of the current year
versus the third quarter when most of the pick-up decisions were made
in the prior year. The delay was primarily due to the impact of the
Writers Guild of America work stoppage. The improvement at the
Internet Group reflected the absence of costs related to the
Disney-branded mobile phone service partially offset by higher costs
related to international mobile and on-line operations and our
Disney.com website.

   Parks and Resorts

   Parks and Resorts revenues for the year increased 8% to $11.5
billion and segment operating income increased 11% to $1.9 billion.
For the quarter, revenues increased 7% to $3.0 billion and segment
operating income decreased 4% to $412 million. Operating income growth
for the year was driven by increases at Disneyland Resort Paris and
Walt Disney World Resort. For the quarter, lower operating income was
driven by a decrease in domestic operations, partially offset by an
increase at Disneyland Resort Paris.

   Domestic Operations

   For the year, operating income growth at Walt Disney World Resort
was primarily due to increased guest spending and theme park
attendance, partially offset by higher operating costs. Increased
guest spending was due to higher average ticket prices, increased food
and beverage spending and higher average daily hotel room rates.
Higher operating costs were due to labor cost inflation, new guest
offerings and volume-related costs.

   For the quarter, decreased results in the domestic operations
reflected higher costs, which included labor and other cost inflation
at Walt Disney World Resort and higher fuel and drydock maintenance
costs at Disney Cruise Line, partially offset by higher guest spending
at Walt Disney World Resort.

   International Operations

   Operating income growth at Disneyland Resort Paris for the year
was primarily due to increased guest spending, higher theme park
attendance and the favorable impact of currency translation, partially
offset by higher operating costs. Increased guest spending was due to
higher average daily hotel room rates and higher average ticket
prices. Higher operating costs were driven by labor cost inflation and
volume-related expenses.

   For the quarter, operating income growth at Disneyland Resort
Paris reflected higher guest spending and the favorable impact of
currency translation, partially offset by lower attendance and
occupied room nights and labor cost inflation.

   Studio Entertainment

   Studio Entertainment revenues for the year decreased 2% to $7.3
billion and segment operating income decreased 9% to $1.1 billion. For
the quarter, revenues decreased 5% to $1.5 billion and segment
operating income decreased $70 million to $98 million.

   Lower operating income for the year was primarily due to a
decrease in domestic home entertainment reflecting the performance of
current-year titles including Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End
and Ratatouille, compared to Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's
Chest and Cars in the prior year.

   For the quarter, lower operating income was driven by a decrease
in domestic theatrical distribution reflecting weaker performing
titles in the current quarter and higher marketing expenses for
releases after the end of the quarter, including Beverly Hills
Chihuahua.

   Consumer Products

   Consumer Products revenues for the year increased 26% to $2.9
billion, and segment operating income increased 14% to $718 million.
For the quarter, revenues increased 41% to $812 million, and segment
operating income increased 14% to $176 million. Operating income
growth for the year and quarter was primarily due to an increase at
Merchandise Licensing, partially offset by a decrease at the Disney
Stores.

   The increase at Merchandise Licensing for both the year and
quarter was primarily due to higher earned royalties across multiple
product categories, led by Hannah Montana and High School Musical
merchandise.

   At the Disney Stores, the increase in revenues for both the year
and the quarter due to the acquisition of the Disney Stores in North
America during the third quarter was more than offset by related
operating costs and the absence of licensing revenue from the former
licensee.

   The decrease in interest expense for the year was driven by lower
effective interest rates, partially offset by higher average debt
balances. For the quarter, the decrease in interest expense was
primarily due to lower effective interest rates and lower average debt
balances.

   The increase in interest and investment income for the year was
primarily due to a gain on the sale of an investment. The decrease in
interest and investment income for the quarter was primarily due to

*T

   The decrease in the effective income tax rate for the year was
primarily due to increased benefits from Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
Section 199 related to qualified domestic production activities. The
increase in the effective income tax rate for the quarter reflected
favorable resolutions of prior-year income tax matters in the
prior-year quarter, partially offset by higher IRC Section 199
benefits.

   Minority Interests

   Minority interest expense increased from $177 million to $302
million for the year and from $100 million to $137 million for the
quarter. Minority interest expense for the year reflected the impact
of improved results at Disneyland Resort Paris, ESPN and Hong Kong
Disneyland. The increase in minority interest expense for the quarter
was due to the impact of increased profits at ESPN and Disneyland
Resort Paris. The minority interest is determined on income after
royalties, financing costs and income taxes.

   (1) Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the
discussion of non-GAAP financial measures that follows below.

   The Company generated $3.9 billion in free cash flow during fiscal
2008 compared to $3.8 billion in the prior year, reflecting an
increase of $48 million in cash provided by operations and an increase
of $12 million in capital expenditures.

   Cash provided by continuing operations increased primarily due to
higher operating performance at Media Networks, Parks &amp; Resorts and
Consumer Products, and lower pension contributions, partially offset
by increased film and television spending, and higher net investments
in accounts receivable and Disney Vacation Club properties.

   (1) Net borrowings is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the
discussion of non-GAAP financial measures that follows below.

   The total borrowings shown above include $3,706 million and $3,583
million attributable to Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland as of
September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, respectively. Cash and cash
equivalents attributable to Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland
totaled $693 million and $604 million as of September 27, 2008 and
September 29, 2007, respectively.

   Non-GAAP Financial Measures

   This earnings release presents earnings per share excluding
certain items, net borrowings, free cash flow, and aggregate segment
operating income, all of which are important financial measures for
the Company but are not financial measures defined by GAAP.

   These measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant
GAAP financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures
of earnings per share, borrowings, cash flow or net income as
determined in accordance with GAAP. Earnings per share excluding
certain items, net borrowings, free cash flow, and aggregate segment
operating income as we have calculated them may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

   Earnings per share excluding certain items - The Company uses
earnings per share excluding certain items to evaluate the performance
of the Company's operations exclusive of certain items that impact the
comparability of results from period to period, including significant
dispositions and acquisitions. During the current year, these items
included gains related to the acquisition of the Disney Stores in
North America and the sale of movies.com, the favorable resolution of
certain prior-year income tax matters and a bad debt charge for a
receivable from Lehman Brothers. In the prior year, these items
included gains on sales of equity investments in E! Entertainment and
Us Weekly, favorable resolutions of certain prior-year income tax
matters, the income or loss from the discontinued ABC Radio business
and a charge related to modification of equity-based compensation
plans in connection with the ABC Radio transaction. The Company
believes that information about earnings per share exclusive of these
impacts is useful to investors, particularly where the impact of the
excluded items is significant in relation to reported earnings,
because the measure allows for comparability between periods of the
operating performance of the Company's business and allows investors
to evaluate separately the impact of decisions regarding the sale and
acquisition of interests in businesses from the impact of the
operations of the business.

share excluding certain items for the current and prior year:

receivable from Lehman Brothers ($91 million pre-tax) in the fourth
quarter. Other income for the prior year consists of gains on the sale
of equity investments in E! Entertainment Television ($780 million
pre-tax) and Us Weekly ($272 million pre-tax) and an equity-based
compensation plan modification charge.

   (2) Diluted EPS excluding certain items may not equal the sum of
the column due to rounding

   Net borrowings - The Company believes that information about net
borrowings provides investors with a useful perspective on our
financial condition. Net borrowings reflect the subtraction of cash
and cash equivalents from total borrowings. Since we earn interest
income on our cash balances that offsets a portion of the interest
expense we pay on our borrowings, net borrowings can be used as a
measure to gauge net interest expense. In addition, a portion of our
cash and cash equivalents is available to repay outstanding
indebtedness when the indebtedness matures or when other circumstances
arise. However, we may not immediately apply cash and cash equivalents
to the reduction of debt, nor do we expect that we would use all of
our available cash and cash equivalents to repay debt in the ordinary
course of business.

   Free cash flow - The Company uses free cash flow (cash provided by
continuing operations less investments in parks, resorts and other
property), among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its
operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than
capital expenditures. Management believes that information about free
cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash
available to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments
and pay dividends or repurchase shares.

   Aggregate segment operating income - The Company evaluates the
performance of its operating segments based on segment operating
income, and management uses aggregate segment operating income as a
measure of the performance of operating businesses separate from
non-operating factors. The Company believes that information about
aggregate segment operating income assists investors by allowing them
to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company's
portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that
affect net income, thus providing separate insight into both
operations and the other factors that affect reported results. A
reconciliation of segment operating income to net income is as follows

   (1) The calculation of diluted earnings per share assumes the
conversion of the Company's convertible senior notes issued in April
2003, which were redeemed during the third quarter of fiscal 2008, and
adds back interest expense (net of tax) of $12 million for the year
ended September 27, 2008 and $21 million and $5 million for the year
and quarter ended September 29, 2007, respectively.

   (2) Earnings per share may not equal the sum of the column due to
rounding.

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Reuters) - Scott Verplank regained his putting touch to charge into a share of the early lead in the opening round of the Disney Classic at Lake Buena Vista, Florida on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long regarded as one of the best putters on the PGA Tour, Verplank fired a flawless eight-under-par 64 on the Magnolia course, one of two venues hosting the final event of the 2008 season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texan birdied his last three holes in bright sunshine to finish level with compatriot Kevin Streelman, who also played on the Magnolia layout at the Walt Disney World Resort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich Beem and fellow American Robert Garrigus opened with 65s while former world number two Davis Love III carded a 66 on the neighboring Palm course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verplank, bidding for his sixth PGA Tour title, was delighted to produce his best putting round since the Northern Trust Open in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've been out here 22 years and this has been by far the worst putting year I've ever had," the 44-year-old told reporters after signing off with a 10-footer at the par-four ninth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today was the first day since the LA Open that I actually felt like I putted good. I have putted so poorly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've been working hard on that and today I got the feel. I hit a lot of great putts and made the ones I was supposed to, which has not been the case most of this year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Streelman, who is among the contenders for the 2008 PGA Tour rookie of the year award, piled up nine birdies and one bogey to join Verplank at the top of the leaderboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This year I have made a lot of cuts and to be in that top 84, 85 on the money list is something I am proud of," said the Illinois native, who lies 88th in the money list with earnings of $1,198,605.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll see what happens. There are three big days ahead of me and if I can sneak out a win, maybe I can open some people's eyes.

&lt;p&gt;  TOKYO, Nov 06 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced an agreement with the Japan Industrial
Waste Technology Center to upgrade its "JWNET" electronic manifest system
for industrial waste. The electronic manifest system is a digital system
that can manage the entire flow of online information exchanges on
industrial waste to final processing between dischargers, collectors and
transferors, and disposal contractors. The upgraded system will be
launched in May 2010 and should provide a reliable and flexible
infrastructure to correspond with the increasing number of registrations
and transactions. The agreement was signed in October 2008.

    The Japan Industrial Waste Technology Center manages waste processing
related to industrial development, maintenance and overall improvement of
the environment. It is the only organization defined by the Japanese
government as an administrator of the electronic manifest system based on
the nation's "Waste Management and Public Cleansing Law." The Japan
Industrial Waste Technology Center has recently seen an increase in the
number of users, data, and transactions of the system, generating more
data to be managed and stored every year. At the same time, there is a
growing need for industrial waste process transparency. To address these
issues and provide steady operation, the Japan Industrial Waste
Technology Center required a substantial re-development of its waste
processing system.

    The Japan Industrial Waste Technology Center decided to team with IBM in
Japan after assessing IBM's broad experiences and skills. IBM will utilize
industry knowledge gained from previous experiences in developing and
operating environmental systems.

&lt;p&gt;1E WakeUp(TM) and Nomad Enterprise Software Used by Microsoft for Added Windows Management Abilities

BARCELONA, Spain--(Business Wire)--
1E, a leading provider of Windows management software and
services, today announced at the TechEd EMEA 2008 conference that
Microsoft has signed an agreement to license 1E WakeUp 5.5 and Nomad
Enterprise across more than 200,000 desktop PCs used within Microsoft.

   1E Nomad reduces the number of servers required for branch offices
and low bandwidth locations as well as providing advanced internet
management capabilities for the desktop and mobile client estate. PC
availability and reliability is also critical to employees as
unmanaged PCs are an expensive problem. It therefore pays to ensure
management clients remain operational and 1E WakeUp solves this
challenge. WakeUp's Computer Health functionality periodically runs
tests and applies fixes designed to improve availability, reliability
and performance as tests can be tailored to match desktop build and
applications. 1E WakeUp groups problem machines and if configured to
do so, automatically starts a repair.

   Sumir Karayi, CEO of 1E remarked, "1E and Microsoft have been
working together for over a decade to deliver solutions to our mutual
customers that reduce the cost of managing Windows environments. We
are delighted to continue building our strong partnership with
Microsoft and throughout this project have worked collaboratively
together, to further improve Computer Health functionality provided
through our 1E WakeUp 5.5 solution. The addition of Nomad Enterprise
will enable Microsoft to reduce the number of servers across their
organization and better manage their clients over the internet in a
highly cost effective manner."

   "The System Center suite delivers centralized systems management
capabilities for the enterprise which are further extended by partners
such as 1E, whom we have worked closely with over the years on the
development of solutions," said Brad Anderson, general manager,
Management and Services Division at Microsoft Corp. "After internally
testing the 1E software across 60,000 of our own corporate computers,
we licensed it for our own deployment to extend our desktop management
capabilities within our infrastructure."

   About 1E

   1E is a global Windows Management software and services company.
Our expertise in providing leading-edge automation solutions, which
reduce complexity, management costs and power consumption, has earned
us the trust and confidence of over 10 million users across 1,050

&lt;p&gt; *Contract worth up to $491 million over 5 years&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; *IBM beat out Accenture, CSC in bidding process
 (Adds details on bid, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSTON Nov 6 (Reuters) - IBM, the world's biggest
technology services company, won a $491 million contract to
help modernize systems that process U.S. immigration
applications, the company said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) beat out
rivals Accenture Ltd (ACN.N) and Computer Sciences Corp (CSC.N)
for the five-year contract from the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security's immigration agency after a bidding process that
lasted more than year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The assignment calls for IBM to help modernize a backlogged
system that the immigration agency uses to process 6 million to
8 million applications a year for benefits including work
visas, residence applications and citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, IBM signed a contract worth up to $800 million
to help manage computer systems for Amgen Inc (AMGN.O), the
world's No. 1 biotechnology company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Such services contracts are helping IBM weather the
economic crisis better than many other technology companies,
partly because the revenue is spread over multiple years,
meaning that it is more dependable than sales of hardware or
new software licenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In its most recent quarter, ended Sept. 30, revenue at
IBM's services division, its biggest, climbed 8 percent to
$14.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hewlett-Packard Co's (HPQ.N) EDS unit, Unisys Corp (UIS.N)
and Sapient Corp (SAPE.O) are among several subcontractors that
will assist in performing the work on the immigration agency
contract, IBM said.

&lt;p&gt;  WASHINGTON, DC, Nov 06 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that it has been awarded a technology and
services contract by the Department of Homeland Security for the United
States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) agency. Under terms
of the agreement, IBM will work with USCIS to move the agency to a new
centralized and consolidated electronic environment that will enable
faster, more efficient and accurate immigration benefits determination
and processing.

    The contract is part of an on-going multidimensional USCIS effort to
transform its business processes and will serve as a key piece to enable
the Agency to speed benefits determination, combat identity fraud, and
reduce processing time backlogs. Awarded in November 2008, the initial
contract value is $14.5 million with options up to $491.1 million over
five years.

    The USCIS receives approximately 6 million - 8 million applications
annually for immigration benefits, such as employment visas, legal
permanent residence and citizenship. The determination process is
currently carried out through a paper intensive system that has suffered
from backlogs as the number of applications have increased, and security
requirements have been strengthened. IBM will support USCIS' efforts to
modernize the agency's processing procedures using advanced information
technologies, and introduce new capabilities such as the use of
person-centric customer accounts.

    "IBM is pleased to support the USCIS mission. We believe this project will
serve as an important model for other agencies seeking to transform the
delivery of important government services," said Charles L. Prow, Managing
Partner, IBM Global Business Services, Government. "Through this ambitious
initiative USCIS will employ new tools to support benefits adjudication,
and ultimately, improve their customers' experience navigating the
immigration process."

    USCIS, part of the Department of Homeland Security, implements U.S.
immigration policy through the processing and adjudication of immigrant
and non-immigrant benefits. USCIS consists of approximately 16,000
employees and contractor personnel located in more than 250 offices
worldwide.

    To deliver the contract, IBM has assembled a team of partners that
includes Blackstone Technology Group, Deloitte Consulting, EDS, Evolver,
The Legacy Network, Sandler and Travis Trade Advisory Services (STTAS),
Sapient Corporation, SI International, Unisys, and Visionary Integration
Professionals, among others.

&lt;p&gt;  COPENHAGEN, DENMARK, Nov 06 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Cheminova, the largest Danish manufacturer of fine chemicals mainly for
the plant production industry, and IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced an

processes enabled by one centralized business information system provided

initially encompass 1,000 users. The services will be provided by a
global IBM team and the program will enable Cheminova to shorten the
time-to-market of new products and act faster and more effectively in the
global marketplace.

    "Following our decision to embark on a Global Transformation program, our
search for partners has been based on their ability to understand our
business, act both locally and globally, and support our best practice-led
approach. IBM has shown strong local and global consulting competency,
combined with good references in the chemical industry -- and very
importantly a global template for best practices," says Henning K.
Christensen, Vice President IT, Cheminova.

    "At IBM we are dedicated to supporting companies with their transformation
projects. This implementation will be 'Cheminova unique' helping them move

&lt;p&gt;SEOUL (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said the U.S. economic downturn was likely to last at least 12 months, further hurting the global economy, South Korea's Yonhap News reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking on Thursday at a lecture to Korea Development Bank staff, Dimon was quoted as saying global financial market conditions would somewhat stabilize in three to four months time, thanks to bold stimulus measures taken by central banks and governments worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But markets would not recover to their level before the financial crisis for the time being, Yonhap quoted the head of the biggest U.S. bank as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon also predicted the investment banking industry would see sophisticated derivatives trading and principal investment using borrowings shrinking significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growth could continue in the areas of advising mergers and acquisitions, credit markets and risk hedging, Dimon said, according to Yonhap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Rhee So-eui; Editing by David Cowell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 06 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that METRO Group will be using IBM
software as a platform for capturing and managing data on inventory,
expiration dates, and other information on meat sold at its real,- Future
Store. The software will also be used to help METRO Group suppliers track
items associated with special product promotions. In addition to IBM
software, these initiatives rely on consulting expertise from IBM Global
Business Services.

    METRO Group is also using IBM's Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
technology and the EPCIS standard for supply chain tracking
enterprise-wide.

    "Smart Freezers" for Fresh Meat

    At METRO Group's real,- Future Store in Toenisvorst, Germany, the company
teamed with IBM for a new quality assurance system in the store's "Master
Butchery" department. IBM's InfoSphere Traceablity Server software serves
as a repository for all information about the meat -- its expiration date,
Electronic Product Code, type, and of course, its provenance, so that meat
can be traced in the event of any recalls. A second IBM software product
-- WebSphere Premises Server -- captures the RFID data from each meat
package.

    The IBM software automates the process of identifying items nearing their
expiration dates and alerts staff when the store is low on a particular
meat item. In the past, these tasks have been performed manually by
employees, who visually scanned shelves for items about to expire, and
surveyed the freezer frequently to determine which meats needed to be
restocked. Using IBM's RFID technology, METRO Group can improve customer
satisfaction and boost sales by ensuring that its freezer is stocked with
the meats shoppers are looking for.

    Getting Hot Items on the Shelves

    METRO Group is also working with IBM to allow suppliers using the EPCIS
standard to track items destined for the company's real,- stores across
Germany. METRO Group's goal is to provide suppliers with visibility into
the whereabouts of items targeted for special promotions such as
advertising campaigns or tie-ins to sporting events or movies.

    The tracking process begins with the supplier, which tags items prior to
shipping. The supplier can then track items through shipping, arrival at
METRO Group distribution centers, and delivery -- right to the shelves of
individual real,- stores. The supplier can determine whether an item that
is part of a special promotion is on the shelves of the right store at the
right time, and they can take corrective actions if items are not where
they should be.

    On METRO Group's side, all information concerning each supplier's promoted
products -- EPC code, order number, and other key information -- can be
stored using the InfoSphere Traceability Server. As METRO Group's
suppliers begin using EPCIS-standard software themselves, both METRO Group
and its suppliers will be able to securely share information on tagged
items. This will provide suppliers with a clear view of where their
products are after they are shipped. For consumers, this means that the
products they want are more likely to be available on the shelves of a
real,- store.

    According to ABI research, RFID systems revenue for the retail industry
will grow 19.6 percent between now and 2013; from $228.4 million in 2008
to $558.2 million in 2013.* Michael Liard, research director for RFID &amp;
contactless at ABI Research, said: "The use of RFID in retail remains an
exciting segment of the market. By using RFID, retailers everywhere have
the opportunity to rethink their supply chain and in-store approaches.
With the help of RFID technology retailers can use real-time information
and improved data visibility and accuracy to transform their supply
chains into adaptive business networks as well as to enhance the in-store
consumer experience."

    Retailers around the world are increasingly focused on finding new ways to
provide a high level of service to customers while continuing to drive
cost and inefficiency out of their supply chains. METRO Group is widely
known for its innovative use of RFID technologies to improve customers'
total shopping experience. To continue this effort, the retailer is
tapping IBM's retail industry expertise and industry leading RFID
software to meet its needs for two critical initiatives.

    METRO Group has selected IBM's Electronic Product Code Information
Services (EPCIS) software, InfoSphere Traceablity Server, to track items
as they move through its supply chain. The software is fully compliant
with GS1 EPCglobal's EPCIS standard for sharing RFID information among
trading partners. By using software that meets those standards, METRO
Group is creating a system it can use to share information on product
movements with any trading partner that also uses an EPCIS-compliant
solution. In addition, METRO Group is enhancing its ability to track
items, such as meats, within its stores.

    Commenting on his company's expanded relationship with IBM, Gerd Wolfram,
managing director, MGI METRO Group Information Technology GmbH, said: "IBM
is a strategic partner in our quest to use RFID technology to give
consumers the best possible shopping experience. As a leader in the
creation of the EPC Information Services standard, IBM has the technology
and expertise needed to make our latest RFID projects a success for our
customers and suppliers."

    "METRO Group continues to be a pioneer in using RFID technologies to
create a better experience for both customers and suppliers," said Martin
Wildberger, vice president, RFID solutions, IBM. "With these projects,
METRO Group is offering consumers a better shopping experience while
providing greater supply chain visibility to suppliers."

&lt;p&gt;Vendor Selected after Microsoft Recommendation, Customer Successes
GREENVILLE, S.C.--(Business Wire)--
Customer Effective Inc., a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner and
value-added reseller of Microsoft Dynamics CRM, announced that Beekley
Corporation, a leading medical products company dedicated to creating
innovative solutions that improve communication in diagnostic
settings, has selected the company to provide CRM software
implementation and consultant services to improve its sales process.

   Ray Thomas, director of Finance and Technology for Beekley, cites
its existing Microsoft platform as a key factor in selecting Microsoft
Dynamic CRM through Customer Effective.

   "Our previous system required an enormous amount of time migrating
data from our existing system," said Thomas. "Our sales and marketing
team worked around the clock to get the system up and running, and we
quickly decided this was not a solution to best meet our internal and
customer care needs. After watching a CRM demonstration at Microsoft
Convergence, we knew Microsoft Dynamics CRM was the best match for us.
Microsoft recommended Customer Effective, and after listening to
several customer success stories, we were confident in our selection."

   With Microsoft CRM, Beekley now tracks prospects, assigns calls
and manages email-marketing campaigns through a single system. An
entire sales cycle can be easily tracked, enabling sales
representatives to easily and quickly obtain information on a prospect
or customer. Reports are generated to analyze and identify strengths
and weaknesses in the sales strategy. Additionally, new opportunities
can be identified through CRM.

   Based on Customer Effective's User First Design Formula(TM), a
phased implementation approach with success metrics defined for each
phase, the project was simple and ensured a smooth CRM delivery.
According to Martha Flannery, director of sales and marketing for
Beekley, "The way CRM was rolled out in a test environment enabled us
to make any required changes to the system prior to full
implementation. Customer Effective kept their composure and remained
professional no matter how frazzled we became. The brilliance of how
everything was handled by Customer Effective made a huge difference.
We felt we were their only client."

   "Customer Effective's goal is to not only provide a great CRM
system, but to ensure the system is implemented smoothly and
seamlessly," said Scott Millwood, CEO of Customer Effective. "For any
project that requires migrating a large amount of data into a single
system, experience and strong support are critical. As experienced CRM
consultants, we help clients like Beekley assess their needs and
design the system that best addresses their unique workflows and
business processes."

   About Customer Effective

   Customer Effective, with headquarters in Greenville, S.C., is a
leading innovator in customer interaction solutions based on Microsoft
Dynamics Customer Relationship Management (CRM). The company is a
Microsoft Gold Certified Partner, CRM Consultant and Solution
Implementer having completed hundreds of Microsoft CRM implementations
and development projects in financial services, manufacturing,
technology, professional services and more. Recipient of several CRM
and Microsoft awards, Customer Effective recently received the 2008
Microsoft Dynamics Inner Circle distinction, and was also named to the
2008 Inc. 500 list. For more information, visit

&lt;p&gt;The New Acquisition Expands NES' Leadership in the 1031 Exchange
                                Market
SAN JOSE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Furthering its leadership position, Nationwide Exchange Services
(NES), a Qualified Intermediary providing a comprehensive suite of IRC
Section 1031 Tax-Deferred Exchange products for individual exchangers
and corporations, announced today that it has closed the purchase of
J.P. Morgan Property Exchange Inc. (JPEX) from J.P. Morgan to acquire
the firm's 1031 like-kind exchange services division. JPEX is one of
the country's leading providers of 1031 Like-Kind Exchange qualified
intermediary services. NES &amp; JPEX will operate as Nationwide Exchange
Services (NES).

   JPEX 1031 operations and personnel will unite with those of
Nationwide Exchange Services to provide 1031 exchange expertise to
Fortune 500 and middle market companies across a diverse group of
industries including transportation, equipment finance and commercial
real estate. The combined operations will continue to deliver the
superior customer service they are recognized for and leverage NES'
industry-leading technology platform that increases transaction
transparency and security for all exchange clientele.

   "We are thrilled to combine two exceptional organizations with
best-of-class operations and exceptional personnel into one industry
powerhouse," said Michael Halloran, CEO of NES. "In such uncertain
economic times where the impact within the 1031 market segment has
been substantial, it should be comforting to have one company that can
deliver the commitment, expertise, service, security and transparency
that exchangers desperately need."

   NES is recognized in the industry as a leading provider of 1031
services in commercial market sectors and as the exclusive Qualified
Intermediary for more US banks than any other firm. The company
maintains its leading reputation for IRC Section 1031 expertise
through its team of subject matter experts led by Kelly Alton,
formerly of the Office of Chief Counsel at the IRS National Office and
Deloitte Tax LLP, Washington National Tax Group, and principal author
of Reverse Exchange Revenue Procedure 2000-37. NES is also known for
the company's emphasis on transparency and compliance as the
industry's only Qualified Intermediary to submit itself to an annual
independent audit of its business practices and procedures under SAS70
type II accounting standards. These provisions focus on financial
security procedures and validate NES' compliance with federal
regulations such as the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Gramm-Leach-Bliley
Privacy Act, USA Patriot Act, Sarbanes-Oxley Rule 404 (SOX 404), and
guidelines set forth by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
(OCC).

   "Given the uncertainty in the 1031 sector, it makes sense for us
to combine two industry leaders into one even more significant
provider in the market," said Pat McCloskey Senior Vice President of
Sales, formerly with J.P. Morgan Property Exchange. "The benefits to
our exchange clientele include more product solutions to better meet
their needs and an amazing diversity of custodial banks through NES'
established relationships with multiple major financial institutions.
This gives clients the maximum options for where their assets can be
held. JPEX clientele will now have the greatest number of options to
meet their exchange requirements while maintaining continuity in
customer service, expertise, and personnel that they have come to
depend on."

   For questions regarding the merger please visit the website at
www.nationwide1031.com or contact the dedicated customer hotline at
1.866.703.1031, where a 1031 account manager or exchange officer will
be available to answer any questions.

   NES was advised by Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., as the
financial advisor, and Hopkins &amp; Carley, as the legal counsel.

   About Nationwide Exchange Services

   Nationwide Exchange Services (www.nationwide1031.com) is a leading
Qualified Intermediary for 1031 tax-deferred exchanges. Since 1990,

   What should investors keep in mind going forward?

   The stock market will turn well before the economy turns, usually
about six months before the economy actually starts to improve. I
think it will take much longer than six months to get this economy
turned around. The hole that we have dug is simply too deep.

   However, historically the best possible time to invest in the
stock market is when the economy is mired deep in despair. Serious
economic difficulties produce great investment opportunities. There
were few time in history that were better to put your money to work
than in early 1933 or late 1974, or the summer of 1982.

   We are not there yet, but probably within a few months of one of
the best investment periods in the lifetime of anyone reading this.
Keep some of you powder dry, but don't be entirely in cash. Use the
market volatility to restructure your portfolio. Use weak days to add
to your holdings of stable health care and consumer non-durable names.

   What recommendations would you make for us today?

   Some examples of names we like would be Kimberly Clark (NYSE:
KMB), Unilever (NYSE: UL) and Del Monte (NYSE: DLM) among the
non-durables, and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ)
in health care.

   Use rallies to get out of financials, retailers and consumer
durables; if you have to play those names, use the senior debt instead
of the common stock. Short-term energy faces a bit of a tough slog
since economic weakness is weighing on demand. But low energy prices
are likely to slow the development of alternative energy and curtail
the exploration efforts needed to offset the natural decline in oil
production from existing fields.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney XD, the network that will launch in February following the rebranding of Toon Disney, is developing a live-action pilot about a rock band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project, titled "I'm With the Band," centers on a tween boy who gets hired as the lead guitarist for a Spinal Tap-type band that was popular in the '80s and is looking to make a comeback. It was created by Michael Kaplan ("Frasier") and Ron Rappaport (MTV's "Next").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney said in August that it will rebrand its U.S.-based Toon Disney TV and online platforms as Disney XD, featuring a mix of live-action and animated programing targeted primarily to boys 6-14. Inaugural programing will include the live-action series "Aaron Stone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer, Inc announced today that it is terminating the phase 3 development
program for its investigational compound (CP-945,598) for weight management.
CP-945,598 is a selective antagonist of the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor.
Based on all currently available information and an ongoing review of the phase
3 program by an independent Data Monitoring Committee, Pfizer believes that the
CP-945,598 compound has the potential to be a safe and effective treatment for
weight management. However, the Company has decided to discontinue the
development program based on changing regulatory perspectives on the
risk/benefit profile of the CB1 class and likely new regulatory requirements for
approval.

"While confident in the safety of the compound, we believe that this is the
appropriate decision based on all available information regarding this class of
agents, as well as recent discussions with regulatory authorities," said Martin
Mackay, president, Pfizer Global Research and Development. "As part of our
ongoing portfolio prioritization, we will refocus research and development
resources on high priority therapeutic areas that address an unmet medical need
and have a high probability for success."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
notified roughly 3,200 employees this week that they have been
laid off, part of previously reported plans to slash 10 percent
of the firm's global work force amid slumping markets, people
familiar with the situation said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two weeks ago, Reuters reported Goldman planned to cut 10
percent of its staff, or almost 3,300 jobs, reflecting the weak
economy and a cut back in proprietary trading. The cuts are an
about-face for a company that as recently as September insisted
its headcount would rise this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The latest cuts reduce headcount to the lowest since 2006
and hit every businesses and region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The investment bank has managed to avoid the kind of losses
from mortgages and corporate loans that have hobbled rivals,
yet Goldman still has suffered from the steep decline in merger
and underwriting activity, as well as plunging prices for
stocks and other investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has quietly and slowly cut jobs all year. The bank
laid off hundreds of MA support staff and junior bankers in
June due to slowing markets, following a round of leveraged
lending and mortgage securities cuts in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Early this year, Goldman cut 1,500 people, or 5 percent of
its staff, following 2007 performance reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman converted last month to a bank holding company
supervised by the Federal Reserve and then raised $10 billion
from Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N). These moves, together
with a pending $10 billion investment by Treasury, will create
a more stable but less profitable company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill Lynch analyst Guy Moszkowski last week predicted
Goldman will report a fourth-quarter loss, its first since
going public in 1999, as plunging markets slam private equity,
proprietary trading and on its stake in Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Reuters) - Scott Verplank covered the back nine in a sizzling six under par to charge three strokes clear in the second round of the Disney Classic at Lake Buena Vista, Florida on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the most of ideal scoring conditions, the American holed a 60-foot eagle putt at the par-five 14th and followed up with three consecutive birdies from the 15th before bogeying the last for an eight-under 64.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That left him at 16-under 128, three ahead of compatriots Steve Marino (66) and overnight leader Troy Matteson (68) at the Walt Disney World Resort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans Robert Gamez (67), Tag Ridings (66) and Robert Garrigus (67) were a further stroke adrift at 12 under in the final event of the 2008 PGA Tour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verplank began the day one off the pace and mixed three birdies with a bogey to reach the turn in two-under 34 on the Palm course, one of two venues hosting the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He caught fire on the back nine, further birdies at the 10th and 11th lifting him to 12 under before he picked up another five shots in four holes from the 14th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although he bogeyed the last after driving into a fairway bunker, Verplank was ideally placed going into the weekend in pursuit of his sixth PGA Tour title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've done everything pretty good for two days, so I'm going to try to continue to do the same stuff that I've been doing," the 44-year-old Texan told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMFORT ZONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm just hitting good putts now. I've gotten back into a little comfort zone and I've had success around here before reading the greens and putting (on) them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verplank has made 13 consecutive cuts at the Disney Resort, equalling the tournament record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The scores are always good here, especially when you get the weather like it was today," he added. "It couldn't be any better than it was today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matteson, whose only Tour victory came at the 2006 Las Vegas Open, also stumbled on his final hole, the par-four ninth on the Magnolia layout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's always disappointing to finish on a bogey but, after you shoot nine under, it's tough to come back out and try to repeat the performance," said Matteson, who shot a career-low 63 on the Palm course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Out here you'll still see eights and sevens and a lot of sixes on the board but I'm pretty happy with today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canadian Stephen Ames, who won last year's title by a shot, was eight strokes off the lead after carding a second 68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cut fell at five-under 139 with former U.S. PGA champion Steve Elkington of Australia and Swedes Fredrik Jacobson and Jesper Parnevik among those missing out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles; Editing by Ken Ferris and Greg Stutchbury)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) said on
Friday it expects consumer loan defaults to increase in the
current quarter and expects to set aside more money to cover
bad loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Consumer debt including credit card and auto loans are
widely seen as the next area to hurt financial institutions
already reeling from subprime mortgage losses and global
financial market weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan more than $395 billion in consumer loans, with the
largest chunk in home equity loans. Mortgages, credit cards and
auto loans are also in the portfolio, according to a filing
with regulators on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank warned about its consumer loan exposure last
quarter as well, but there is new evidence of weakness among
U.S. borrowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Retail chains this week posted the worst monthly sales data
in more than three decades as consumers slashed spending. A
government report last week said consumer spending dropped at
an annualized 3.1 percent rate in the third quarter, the
biggest pullback since 1980.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan has always had a large consumer banking business
and in September, with its acquisition of Seattle-based thrift
Washington Mutual, it increased its consumer portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given the potential stress on the consumer from rising
unemployment, the continued downward pressure on housing prices
and the elevated national inventory of unsold homes, management
remains extremely cautious," the bank said in the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It warned that home equity loans and more risky mortgages
made since 2006 make up a large chunk of its portfolio, and
defaults are rising as home prices continue to fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan expects charge-offs of bad loans in its home
lending portfolio to increase in the current quarter and into
2009, the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank last week said it is temporarily halting
foreclosures and offering to renegotiate about $70 billion in
mortgages for homeowners struggling to pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OUTPERFORMING RIVALS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank's mortgage portfolio has performed better than
that of some of its rivals because JPMorgan did not make as
many of the more risky types of loans that caused massive
writedowns at other banks such as Wachovia Corp WB.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan has $18.2 billion of risky mortgages known as
subprime, including $4.7 billion of subprime loans acquired
when it bought Washington Mutual in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank expects more credit card borrowers to fail to pay
balances, meaning it will have to write off more balances as
unpaid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, the bank said it expects an after-tax gain of
$600 million in the fourth quarter from the dissolution of
Chase Paymentech Solutions, a joint venture with payments
processor First Data Corp FDC.BA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's shares were down $1.28 at $36.98 in afternoon
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Elinor Comlay; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe,

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States is sinking into a recession deeper than previously forecast, with the jobless rate rising to 8.5 percent by the end of 2009, Goldman Sachs said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan Hatzius, senior economist at the bank, cited a recent "accumulation of evidence that U.S. domestic demand and production continue to fall sharply" as the economy founders under the persistent strain of the most severe credit crisis in many decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. employers cut payrolls by 240,000 in October and the national jobless rate shot up to 6.5 percent from 6.1 percent in September, a government report showed on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today's labor market report confirms the message that had already been suggested in the September data, namely that these developments have prompted business firms to accelerate the process of cutting payrolls to keep pace with falling demand and output," Hatzius wrote in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman sees unemployment likely to continue rising in 2010 as the economy struggles with an excess supply of houses under credit conditions that will be looser than now, but still restrictive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has marked down its near-term forecasts for the economy, expecting gross domestic product to shrink an annualized 3.5 percent in the fourth quarter, deeper than the previously forecast 2 percent contraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first quarter 2009, the bank expects 2.0 percent annualized contraction, weaker than the previously forecast 1.0 percent shrinkage, Hatzius wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To combat the sliding economy, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates further. Goldman anticipates 50 basis points of rate cuts by year end, which would reduce the U.S. fed funds target rate to 0.5 percent from the current 1.0 percent. The current level is already the lowest since 2004, when it was at a four-decade trough for short-term interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by John Parry; Editing by Dan Grebler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARIS Nov 7 (Reuters) - Investment funds run by Goldman
Sachs (GS.N) now own more than 5 percent of French car parts
maker Valeo (VLOF.PA) with a combined stake of 5.96 percent, the
AMF French financial markets regulator said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Valeo shares were 0.67 percent easier on Friday after a
52.59 percent decline this so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AMF said the 5 percent level was broken on Oct. 6 but it was

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp Chief Executive Steve Ballmer dismissed speculation the software giant might still be interested in buying Yahoo Inc, sending shares of the Internet company down 14 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We made an offer, we made another offer ...

&lt;p&gt;Nov 7 (Reuters) - Fox-Pitt Kelton forecast a fourth-quarter
loss for Citigroup (C.N), while cutting its earnings estimates
for JP Morgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), citing dilution related to
the U.S. Treasury's capital purchase program, a volatile equity
market and credit concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage now expects Citigroup to post a loss of 8
cents a share in the fourth quarter, from its prior estimate of
break-even for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan's fourth-quarter profit estimate was cut to 65
cents a share from 90 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The weakness in the equity markets is likely to impact the
asset levels in both the companies' wealth management
portfolios, Trone said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trone kept his "in line" rating on Citigroup, but cut his
price target on the stock to By $5 to $20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We continue to believe that JPM will be a major market
share beneficiary although weak equity markets and a tougher
consumer credit environment will weigh on near-term results,"
said the analyst who kept his "outperform" rating on JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Shares of Citigroup closed at $11.52 Thursday on the New

&lt;p&gt;LogRhythm and PowerTech Present Free Webinar on IBM System i Log Management for Financial Institutions

   Experts to Discuss Technical Challenges and Present Use Cases on
    Integrating Security Data into Log and Event Management Systems
--(Business Wire)--
LogRhythm and PowerTech:

   WHO: John Earl, Chief Technical Officer and Vice President,
PowerTech Group. Mr. Earl has over 25 years experience with IBM
midrange systems and security. He is a security subject matter expert

&amp; Young, and Counterpane Internet Security.

   WHAT: Many organizations, especially financial institutions, rely
on the IBM System i (AS/400) to run their core business applications.
Although System i generates comprehensive logs and security data, the
sheer volume and cryptic structure of this information makes it very
difficult to use and report on. This webinar will explain how to
integrate and make these logs useful for security and compliance
management within an enterprise Security Information Event Management
(SEIM) platform.

   Discussing real-world financial institution use cases, this
webinar will demonstrate how integrating System i logs with a SIEM
system enables organizations to:

   --  Comply with regulations (i.e., GLBA, SOX, PCI, etc.)

   --  Secure networks, systems, and data

   --  Increase the efficiency and effectiveness of IT audit and
        security operations

   WHERE: Webinar delivered to your desktop.

   WHEN: This one hour webinar will be presented twice on November

&lt;p&gt; (Adds background) By Austin Ekeinde PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Gunmen in speedboats attacked the Nigerian military at an oil flow station operated by U.S. energy firm Chevron (CVX.N) late on Thursday but the facility was not affected, the military said on Friday. Last night, some men in speedboats attacked our men at Robert-Kiri flow station. In the shoot-out there were fatalities. We lost one man, a naval personnel, said Lieutenant Colonel Sagir Musa, a military spokesman in the Niger Delta. The attack did not affect the Chevron facility, he added. He said it was not clear who was responsible. Chevron was not immediately available for comment. Musa said several attackers had been killed in the shoot-out, which took place near the border between Rivers and Bayelsa states in the Niger Delta. A private security source working in the oil industry said several navy officials died. Militants who say they are fighting for a fairer share of the wealth generated in the Niger Delta, home to Africa's biggest oil and gas industry, have bombed pipelines and oil platforms in recent years to push their demands. But the line between militancy and criminality is blurred. Networks of armed gangs have taken advantage of the breakdown in law and order to steal industrial quantities of crude oil -- known locally as bunkering -- part of an illegal international trade worth millions of dollars a day. The unrest has cut oil output from the world's eighth biggest exporter by around a fifth. Nigeria is pumping just under 2 million barrels per day (bpd), well below its capacity of 3 million bpd, largely because of the insecurity. Gunmen in speedboats trying to secure safe passage for crude oil thieves killed a civilian during a gun battle with the Nigerian security forces in Bayelsa in the western Niger Delta late on Wednesday, the military said on Thursday. The attack was a rare spill-over of violence which has been concentrated in Rivers state in recent months.   (Writing by Nick Tattersall; Editing by Randy Fabi)

&lt;p&gt;URCH Publishing: GlaxoSmithKline Will Overtake Pfizer to Become World's Largest Pharmaceutical Company by 2012

   J and Merck Forecast for Stagnant Growth, Notes URCH Publishing
LONDON--(Business Wire)--
There will be major changes in the global pharmaceutical market
and key changes in the top ten company list by 2012, says a new report
from URCH Publishing, a leading provider of pharmaceutical industry
business information.

   The report, Pharmaceutical Market Trends, 2008 - 2012 - Key market
forecasts and growth opportunities, which is published today,
forecasts that Pfizer will fall from first to third place in the
coveted list. The list in 2012 will be headed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)
followed by Roche. Pfizer was the leading company in 2007 with a
market share of 6.2%. GSK was in second position with a 5.4% market
share and Roche held a share of 4.3%.

   The top ten companies, ranked by pharmaceutical sales, generated
total sales of $284 billion in 2007. "Total pharmaceutical sales from
these companies accounted for more than 40% of the total market," said
Steve Seget the report's author. "However, only two of the top ten
pharmaceutical corporations in 2007 are forecast to grow at a rate
above the overall pharmaceutical market over the next five years;
Roche with a CAGR of 6.2% and Novartis with a CAGR of 6.1%," he added.

   The report also concludes that Johnson &amp; Johnson and Merck will
suffer stagnant growth in the four year period.

   The global pharmaceutical market is forecast to grow to $929
billion in 2012, an equivalent CAGR of 5.5% over the next four years.
The 142 page study says future sales growth will remain limited by
high prescription drug co-pays for insured consumers, the growing
availability of generic drugs and a lack of new blockbuster drugs to
replace the leading products scheduled to lose patent protection.

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI Nov 7 (Reuters) - China's economy is expected to
stabilise in the second half of 2009, potentially boosting the
country's stock markets, Wall Street investment bank Goldman
Sachs (GS.N) forecast on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Shanghai-Shenzhen 300 Index .CSI300, which tracks
China's 300 biggest listed companies, may rise 11 percent to
1,980 points next year, China strategist Deng Tishun told
reporters in Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hong Kong's China Enterprise Index .HSCE of top locally
listed mainland companies may jump 53.4 percent to 8,900 points,
Deng said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Shanghai-Shenzen 300 Index ended on Friday at 1,677.827,
and the China Enterprise Index stood at 6,794.59.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China's stock market has fallen about 70 percent from a year
ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although profits at China's listed companies are likely to
fall 17 percent in general in 2009 compared with this year, the
stock market will benefit from attractive share valuations,
improved liquidity and government stimulus plans, Deng said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the first half of 2009, consumer-related companies,
Internet firms and telecommunication stocks are worth buying,
while banking, insurance, real estate, raw materials and
transportation stocks are likely to outperform the market in the
second half, Deng said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deng also said that a healthy economy, rather than
market-boosting policies, would give real support to the stock
market.

   Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst Blog:

   Coca-Cola Hellenic a Buy

   Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company (NYSE: CCH) enjoys an
attractive geographic mix with 66% of revenues being derived from
developing or emerging markets. In addition, the company's product mix
is less dependent on CSDs (carbonated soft drinks) than other
bottlers.

   Since the company conducts business and reports financial results
in Euros, much of the stock's performance is inversely correlated with
US dollar's exchange rate with the Euro. However, as management has a
sound business strategy and proven execution skills, the recent
earnings decline is providing a valuation-based buying opportunity.

   Regeneron a Growth Biotech Play

   Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: REGN) is a
biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development and marketing of
therapeutic medicines for the treatment of serious medical conditions.
Its lead candidates are VEGF-Trap for the treatment of cancers, eye
diseases, and IL-1 Trap for CAPS and gout.

   The company recently received the FDA approval of Arcalyst for
CAPS (Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes: auto-inflammatory
diseases which share a number of common symptoms). It also has a
number of pre-clinical drug candidates for other disorders.

   Denbury Rescs a Lower-Target Buy

   Plano, Texas-based Denbury Resources Inc. (NYSE: DNR) is a growing
exploration and production (E) company engaged in the acquisition,
development, operation, and exploration of oil and natural gas
properties in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. It is the largest oil and
gas producer in Mississippi, and also has properties in Louisiana,
Alabama and the Barnett Shale area of Texas.

   Denbury's third-quarter results were significantly above the
year-earlier level due to production gains and higher realized prices
for crude and natural gas. Production rose 12%, after adjusting for
the sale of Louisiana natural-gas properties, while average realized
crude oil and natural gas prices increased 53% and 10% year-over-year,
respectively. These gains were partly offset by a 30% increase in unit

   Kinross Gold Gets Weighed Down

   Headquartered in Ontario, Canada, Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:
KGC) currently ranks among the top 10 gold mining companies in the
world, with a targeted production of 2 million ounces of gold
annually.

   In the third quarter, Kinross announced net earnings per diluted
share were $0.10 compared to $0.07 in the same period last year.
Revenue was up 83% year-over-year to $503.7 million. Gold production
was 551,510 equivalent ounces versus 375,546 equivalent ounces last
year. The year-over-year decrease in production was primarily due to
the asset swap transaction with Goldcorp as well as the impact of
lower grades mined at Fort Knox, Round Mountain, and La Coipa.

   Trimeris Hurt by Competition

treatment of viral diseases based on its fusion inhibition technology
that blocks viral entry into host cells. Sales of its lead drug Fuzeon

from Selzentry and Isentress.

   The collaboration amendment with Roche and several management
changes further cast a shadow on the company's future. We maintain our
Sell rating on Trimeris with a $2 price target.

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Reuters) - Scott Verplank bogeyed the final hole to surrender the outright lead to playing partner Steve Marino in Saturday's third round of the Disney Classic at Lake Buena Vista, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three ahead of the chasing pack overnight, American Verplank struck his tee shot at the last into a muddy divot before pulling his approach into a greenside bunker and missing a 12-footer for par.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His bogey five gave him a three-under 69 and a 19-under total of 197 on another day of ideal scoring at the Walt Disney World Resort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marino, seeking his first PGA Tour title in his second season on the circuit, maintained his bogey-free run this week by shooting a six-birdie 66 on the Magnolia layout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like compatriot Verplank, he ended up in a bunker with his approach at the last but managed to get up and down to save par for a share of the 54-hole lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tour veteran Davis Love III fired the best round of the day with a sparkling 64 to lie joint third at 17 under with fellow American Scott Sterling (66).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am driving the ball great, I am hitting good iron shots and I am putting well," Marino told reporters. "Hopefully I can keep that up but I don't know if I can go 72 holes without making a bogey. That's a tall order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've kind of been struggling a little bit scoring lately but this week I have been capitalising on my good shots and making a few more putts than usual."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UPBEAT MOOD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite feeling out-of-sorts and signing off with a bogey, Verplank was in upbeat mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm happy that I'm sitting here and it's nice to be playing well," the five-times PGA Tour winner said after a round featuring four birdies and one bogey. "I'm excited about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've got some sort of congestion which has made me feel a little dizzy and I'm not at full strength but maybe that's the secret so far. I'm hoping that I'll get a good night's sleep and feel a little stronger tomorrow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verplank, who covered the back nine in a blistering six under par on Friday to surge three ahead of the field, had his advantage trimmed to one after Marino birdied the first and second holes in bright sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the tournament leader picked up his first shot of the round at the par-three third and stayed two ahead when he and Marino recorded matching birdies at the par-five eighth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the 500-yard ninth, Verplank struck a superb hybrid wood approach to 14 feet and calmly rolled in the putt to regain his three-shot cushion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although he picked up another shot at the 11th where he hit his second shot to four feet, Marino trimmed the deficit with birdies at the 10th, 13th and 14th before benefiting from Verplank's stumble at the last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canadian Stephen Ames, winner of last year's title, returned a 69 to end the day eight strokes off the lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles; Editing by Clare Fallon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BANGKOK (Reuters) - Former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, facing a two-year jail sentence at home for breaking a conflict of interest law, has been barred from Britain where he was living in exile, a Thai official said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British officials have refused to comment on the decision to revoke visas for Thaksin and his wife, the latest twist in Thailand's long-running political saga since the billionaire telecoms tycoon was removed in a 2006 coup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Foreign Ministry has checked the reports with British authorities and they have confirmed that the visas were revoked," ministry spokesman Thani Thong Phakdi told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not know the reason for the move, and the British embassy in Bangkok declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thai newspapers earlier cited what they said was an advisory issued by Britain's border agency on Friday to airlines cancelling the visas held by Thaksin and Potjaman Shinawatra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Airlines are advised not to carry these passengers to the U.K.," the email message said, according to the Nation newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thaksin, who spent most of his time in exile in London after he was ousted, drawing headlines when he bought and later sold the Manchester City soccer club, was in China, a close aide said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He is in Beijing on business," the aide told Reuters, without giving more details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thaksin was sentenced to two years in jail last month for breaking a conflict of interest law by getting involved in a government agency's sale of a piece of prime Bangkok land to his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potjaman was cleared of any wrongdoing in the land case, but in July was sentenced to three years in jail for tax evasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thai prosecutors have issued numerous arrest warrants and urged London to extradite Thaksin, who won two landslide election victories but was ousted amid accusations of corruption and abuses of power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thaksin, who fled to London with Potjaman in August, has said the case against him was politically motivated by his opponents and the jail term was meant to keep him out of the country's political arena for at least 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nobody can bring me home except Their Majesties' graciousness or the will of the people," Thaksin said earlier this month in a 10-minute telephone call from Hong Kong to thousands of supporters at a rally in Bangkok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campaign against Thaksin is largely driven by the People's Alliance for Democracy -- an unelected group comprising royalists, academics and businessmen -- while he continues to enjoy support in the countryside. The PAD has occupied the official compound of the prime minister's offices since August, demanding the current government stocked with Thaksin loyalists step aside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thailand's political crisis dates back to 2005 when the PAD launched its first street campaign against Thaksin, whom PAD accused of cronyism and abuse of power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has meandered through a coup to elections and back to protests and shows no signs of resolution, to the dismay of investors worried about a lack of functioning government with a global economic recession looming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BANGKOK (Reuters) - Britain has revoked visas for former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his wife who had fled to London in August to avoid corruption charges, a Thai official said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move raises the question of whether and where Thaksin could find a new base outside Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Foreign Ministry has checked the reports with British authorities and they have confirmed that the visas were revoked," ministry spokesman Thani Thong Phakdi told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not know the reason for the visa withdrawal, and the British embassy in Bangkok has declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thai newspapers earlier cited what they said was an advisory issued by Britain's border agency to international airlines cancelling the visas held by Thaksin and Potjaman Shinawatra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Airlines are advised not to carry these passengers to the U.K.," the email message said, according to the Nation newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thaksin, who spent most of his time in exile in London after he was ousted in a bloodless 2006 coup, was traveling in China, a close aide said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He is in Beijing on business," the aide told Reuters, without giving more details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The billionaire former telecoms tycoon was sentenced to two years in jail last month for breaking a conflict of interest law by getting involved in a government agency's sale of a piece of prime land in Bangkok to his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potjaman was cleared of any wrongdoing in the land case, but in July she was sentenced to three years in jail for tax evasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thai prosecutors have been urging London to extradite Thaksin, who won two landslide election victories, but was ousted in a 2006 coup on accusations of corruption and abuses of power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In interviews with Reuters last month, Thaksin said he was not seeking and would not seek political asylum in Britain as reported by some British media, as he was eligible to visit Britain any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campaign against Thaksin is largely driven by the People's Alliance for Democracy -- an unelected group comprising royalists, academics and businessmen -- while he continues to enjoy support in the countryside.

&lt;p&gt;BANGKOK (Reuters) - Britain has revoked visas for former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his wife after their convictions in Thailand on corruption charges, newspapers reported on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reports cited an advisory by the border agency cancelling the visas held by Thaksin and Potjaman, who skipped bail in August and fled to London claiming they could not get fair trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the Home Office in London said they would not comment on individual cases. The British embassy in Bangkok also declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thaksin, ousted in a bloodless 2006 coup, was believed to be traveling in China this week when the visas were revoked, the Nation newspaper reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thaksin was sentenced to two years in jail last month for breaking a conflict of interest law by getting involved in a government agency's sale of a piece of prime land in Bangkok to his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potjaman was cleared of any wrongdoing in the land case, but in July she was sentenced to three years in jail for tax evasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thai prosecutors are urging London to extradite Thaksin, who won two landslide election victories, but was ousted in a 2006 coup on accusations of corruption and abuses of power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In interviews with Reuters last month, Thaksin said he was not seeking and would not seek political asylum in Britain as reported by some media, as he was eligible to visit Britain any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campaign against Thaksin is largely driven by the People's Alliance for Democracy -- an unelected group comprising royalists, academics and businessmen -- while he continues to enjoy support in the countryside.

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Reuters) - Davis Love III ended a PGA Tour title drought of more than two years with a thrilling one-shot victory at the Disney Classic in Lake Buena Vista, Florida on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two off the pace going into the final round at the Walt Disney World Resort, Love held off a stunning late charge by rookie Tommy Gainey by firing a sparkling eight-under-par 64.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love, whose last Tour triumph came at the 2006 Greensboro Classic, piled up five birdies in seven holes from the 10th to forge two strokes clear of the chasing pack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite missing the fairway on 17 and 18, the former world number two twice saved par, calmly getting up and down from a greenside bunker at the last for a 25-under tally of 263.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gainey, who has made only six cuts in 24 Tour starts, had to settle for second in the final event of the year after covering the back nine in a blistering six under for a matching 64.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love, whose world ranking plummeted after a mediocre 2007 campaign ended prematurely with an ankle injury, was delighted to clinch his 20th Tour victory and a lifetime exemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thirteen months after ankle surgery, I've been grinding trying to get a win," he told reporters with a broad smile after earning a check for $828,000. "I can't believe it happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everybody, like me, expects me to play better and certainly I've had a couple of bad breaks but still, even after getting hurt, I should have played better all year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I hit three bad drives today, two of them on the last holes, but I'm excited to get it in," said Love, whose world ranking had plummeted to 159th going into this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had some good breaks, made some good up-and-downs but I played very, very well. It means an awful lot to put it all together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EARLY CONTROL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love took early control in the final round on the sun-drenched Magnolia course, three birdies in the first five holes putting him one stroke clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However his playing partner Steve Marino drew level by knocking in a 10-footer to birdie the seventh and the pair reached the turn tied for the lead at 20 under.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love and Marino each birdied the 10th and 11th before Love benefited from a two-shot swing at the par-four 13th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marino bogeyed the 384-yard hole after hitting his approach into the front greenside bunker and failing to reach the putting surface with his third shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love's drive ended up to the left of the green from where he struck a delicate chip to 15 inches for a tap-in birdie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-hitting Love sank a curling 25-footer to birdie the 14th and picked up another shot at the 16th, where he holed out from 20 feet, to move two ahead of the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fast-finishing Gainey, playing in the group ahead, signed off with a flourish after striking a superb approach to four feet on the final hole before watching Love seal victory with a closing par.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just tried to do the best I could," said Gainey, ranked a lowly 228th in the Tour money list at the start of this week with earnings of $65,405.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I couldn't control anybody's game but mine.

&lt;p&gt;Two off the pace going into the final round at the Walt Disney World Resort, Love held off a stunning late charge by rookie Tommy Gainey by firing a sparkling eight-under-par 64.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love, whose last Tour triumph came at the 2006 Greensboro Classic, piled up five birdies in seven holes from the 10th to forge two strokes clear of the chasing pack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite missing the fairway off the tee on 17 and 18, he twice saved par, getting up and down from a greenside bunker at the last for a 25-under tally of 263.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gainey, who has made only six cuts in 24 Tour starts this season, had to settle for second place after covering the back nine in a blistering six under for a matching 64.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love, whose world ranking plummeted after a mediocre 2007 campaign ended prematurely with an ankle injury, was delighted to clinch his 20th Tour victory and a lifetime exemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thirteen months after ankle surgery, I've been grinding trying to get a win," he said with a broad smile in a greenside interview. "I can't believe it happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I hit three bad drives today, two of them on the last holes, but I'm excited to get it in. It's been a lot of fun."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EARLY CONTROL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love took early control in the final round, three birdies in the first five holes on the sun-drenched Magnolia course putting him one stroke clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However his playing partner Steve Marino drew level by knocking in a 10-footer to birdie the seventh and the pair reached the turn tied for the lead at 20 under.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love and Marino each birdied the 10th and 11th before Love benefited from a two-shot swing at the par-four 13th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marino, seeking his maiden PGA Tour title, bogeyed the 384-yard hole after hitting his approach into the front greenside bunker and failing to reach the putting surface with his third shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love's drive ended up to the left of the green from where he struck a superb chip to 15 inches for a tap-in birdie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-hitting Love sank a curling 25-footer to birdie the 14th and picked up another shot at the 16th, where he holed out from 20 feet, to move two ahead of the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did well to save par at the 17th where he pulled his tee shot into the left rough, chipped out on to the fairway and struck his wedge approach to seven feet before sinking the putt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gainey, playing in the group ahead, signed off with a flourish after striking a superb approach to four feet on the final hole before watching Love coolly seal victory with a closing par.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles; editing by Miles Evans)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO Nov 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) has
cut about 10 percent of its investment bankers in Tokyo,
including one of Japan's top women bankers, as part of global
efforts to cut its workforce, people familiar with the matter
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has laid off more than 10 bankers from its mergers
and capital markets teams, including Naomi Matsuoka who led
Goldman's equity capital markets team, four people told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Matsuoka is known for her role in sales of shares by the
Japanese government, including stakes in Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone Corp (9432.T) between 1998 and 2000 and East Japan
Railway Co (9020.T) in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman handled many of Japan's big privatisation deals,
helping to boost its ranking on banking league tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman ranks this year as No.4 investment bank in handling
Japanese share sales, up from 12th position at the same time last
year, data compiled by Thomson Reuters showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Matsuoka is one of the four managing directors who have left
the bank in the latest move, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in Tokyo declined to comment.

High Definition Enterprise(TM) and a Gold-Certified Microsoft(TM) ISV

Microsoft(TM) to enable companies to rapidly deploy RFID solutions.

    During challenging economic cycles companies must continue to increase
their efficiency, cut waste and strive to do business in smarter ways.
The unfortunate reality is the projects and investments that can deliver
material impact on future growth while delivering cost savings today are
often shelved as corporate spending is tightened.

    In recognition of this dilemma, Xterprise is offering a new financing
vehicle from Microsoft Financing (NASDAQ: MSFT) to assist their customers
as they continue to drive to new levels of operational efficiency. The
investment stimulus financing offered through Xterprise is structured to
allow an organization to respond to today's challenging business climate
by acquiring new technology that will enable business innovation, drive
higher asset utilization, and realize substantial operational cost
savings.

    "During economic downturns, innovation is the single most important tool
for transforming the crisis into a business opportunity," said Dean Frew,
founder and CEO of Xterprise. "With our partner Microsoft, we are uniquely
positioned to offer attractive financing packages for our Clarity(TM)
enterprise applications which enable a business to realize the benefits of
our technology without the typical budgetary or cash flow impact of such
an investment."

    Highlights of the new financing offering:


--  No upfront capital expenditures;

--  No payments or interest for 180 days;

--  12 to 48 month terms and competitive rates;

--  Available on all solution components including software, hardware, and
    services.
    

    
Xterprise has developed a suite of solutions branded "Clarity(TM) that
leverage RFID and other sensor technologies to enable process innovation,
drive significant operational cost savings, and facilitate greater
utilization of inventory, assets and personnel.

    The Clarity Solution Suite delivers value to an enterprise with the
following highly scalable applications:


--  Clarity AGR(TM) - Automated Goods Receipts,

    --  streamlining the receiving process and delivering cost savings in
        manufacturing, distribution and retail environments;

--  Clarity ARS(TM) - Advanced Retail System,

    --  delivering item-level inventory management and operations to the
        stores and fulfillment centers of fashion and specialty retailers;

--  Clarity EAM(TM) - Enterprise Asset Management,

    --  providing traceability and management of assets and inventory
        across a wide variety of industries including aerospace,
        automotive, industrial and high technology manufacturers and
        distributors.

--  Clarity ITAM(TM) - IT Asset Management,

    --  reducing the cost of compliance while providing physical security
        of assets in the financial services and telecom industries, as well
        as data center service providers;

--  Clarity RTI(TM) - Reusable Transport Item Management,

    --  increasing utilization and reducing the acquisition costs of
        reusable assets used to transport finished goods, work-in-process,
        and raw materials through a multi-stakeholder supply chain.

last and all business clearly do not have the capacity and resources to
come out as winners. The Clarity(TM) Solutions from Xterprise, with the
financing offered through Microsoft Corporation, allow businesses to
forge ahead while competitors are in retreat.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) plans to help free small- and medium-sized businesses
from the headaches, limitations and costs of current information
technology (IT) maintenance with a new appliance -- called IBM Lotus
Foundations Start -- that offers customers an easy way to collaborate, as
well as the option to reliably run Microsoft Windows on a virtual machine
with VMware technology. The new "plug-and-play" appliance combines
software and hardware and is designed to allow employees to begin working
together within one hour of initially booting up.

    The IBM Lotus Foundations appliance has everything a customer needs to
quickly set up a reliable IT infrastructure. The software uses the IBM
Lotus Notes/Domino collaboration platform to enable employees to create,
share and print Lotus Symphony documents, and work with email and calendar
functions. Its automated design -- self-configuring, self-healing, and
self-managing daily systems operations -- eliminates the need for routine
maintenance and helps to ensure that critical data is protected through an
integrated disk backup technology.

    "For the first time, customers and partners have access to an all-in-one
appliance where both the hardware and software are sourced by a single
vendor," said Kevin Cavanaugh, vice president, IBM Lotus Software. "One
source to deal with makes life a lot easier. The appliance is a complete
system, and it's designed to require zero on-site IT support. All a
customer needs to get started is a power outlet and an Internet
connection."

    The Lotus Foundations appliance will be generally available in December.

    VMware Software Supports Windows

    IBM is also announcing a pilot with VMware, which will provide support to
IBM Lotus Foundations users who run Windows and are licensed to run
Windows-based applications. Lotus Foundations customers will benefit from
running Windows on a virtual machine on IBM Lotus Foundations. Even if the
Windows operating system crashes, the business can still access the core
capabilities of Lotus Foundations without rebooting. Lotus Foundations
operations are designed to continue uninterrupted.

    Business partners also benefit as they no longer need to visit their
customers onsite to diagnose Windows system crashes. Lotus Foundations
users can sign up for the VMware pilot at:
https://www-304.ibm.com/software/earlyprograms/surveys/cust/nomination.wss?id=62
.

    The software technology in IBM Lotus Foundations is built on a 100
megabyte Linux kernel, compact enough to be stored on a solid state chip.
The system starts up at the chip level, so in the unlikely event that
both hard drives fail, IBM Lotus Foundations will still boot up with
network, firewall, virtual private network (VPN), user accounts and other
key services completely operational.

    "The ability to remotely access and administrate my client accounts, even
if their systems go down, is essential," said Rick Kane of Onsite
Technology, Inc., an IBM Lotus Foundations Business Partner. "I don't have
to spend money to travel for a site visit and my customers don't
experience the cost or hassle of significant downtime. And in today's
economic climate, that can be the difference in keeping the lights on."

    This configuration addresses the headaches that small- and medium-sized
businesses have dealt with from traditional IT solutions, such as
Microsoft Small Business Server and the subsequent security patches,
emergency fixes and operating system upgrades. IBM Lotus Foundations
eliminates "patch management" and the lengthy downtime and labor
associated with upgrades. When an update is available, the system
downloads the latest Linux operating system in a matter of minutes. Even
major upgrades require a single click. There is no need for an on-site IT
support visit or planning tools. The process is also completely
reversible.

    "We've always viewed computer systems as a 'necessary evil,'" said Greg
Bruce, chief operating officer of Hester Group. "They're essential for our
business, but there's always something to be fixed or updated. And it
seems that every month, we have to buy or install something new. IBM Lotus
Foundations is different. We get everything in one package and there's no
maintenance. Our local partner plugged it in, and it just works."

    IBM Lotus Foundations simplifies and improves the backup and recovery
process through a single "system restore button" on the new IBM Lotus
Foundations appliance. In the event of a complete system failure, merely
pressing the "system restore" button on the appliance recovers core
functions. At the same time, the system automatically performs back-ups
as often as every 15 minutes, providing continuous data protection. With
replaceable primary and secondary drives, a back-up solution is always at
hand.

    IBM Lotus Foundations provides customers with collaboration technology to
take advantage of the latest social networking tools, while enabling their
business to grow without making additional IT investments. The appliance
can accommodate up to 500 users, so as a business expands to 75, or 300
users, there is no need to upgrade to more expensive and complex products,
which often require the purchase of additional hardware.

    IBM Lotus Foundations also offers a range of software applications to
address business challenges. On November 21, the IBM Smart Business
Developers' Kit will become generally available, enabling independent
software vendors (ISVs) to easily package and sell Lotus Domino
applications to small- and medium-sized businesses. This will open new
markets for the developers and give SMB customers a host of new Domino
applications to better run their businesses.

    Business partners that use the Developers Kit can simply point to an
existing application on a Domino server and the tool will combine the
necessary files into a "single-click" installation package. The
applications can be deployed into environments as separate packages or
preloaded by the business partner, an important feature since many smaller
companies don't have on-site IT support.

    "The toolkit is well thought out and well executed," said Richard Gill,
president and founder of Gill and Piette, an IBM Advanced Business Partner
focusing on SMB Lotus Notes development. "It does exactly what you expect
it to -- it's intuitive and it's easy. With the Kit, IBM is effectively
giving us the ability to reach a new customer set without having to make
any additional time or dollar investments. In today's business climate, a
business partner couldn't ask for more."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 10 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N),
which cut almost 3,300 jobs last week, identified six equity
analysts laid off by the firm, including William Tanona, who
covered companies such as JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM.N) and
Morgan Stanley (MS.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Charles Chon, Deane Dray, Ajay Kejriwal, Lawrence Keusch
and Peter Wahlstrom also were let go by the firm, according to
a note Goldman sent to clients. The companies they covered --
which ranged from General Electric Co. (GE.N) to Tyco
International (TYC.N) -- are being transferred to another
analyst, suspended or dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the companies affected by this change, coverage on
General Electric and Tyco will be transferred to a new analyst,
JPMorgan and Citigroup (C.N) are among the companies that will
be suspended while Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX.N) and Agilent
Technologies (A.N) are among the companies being dropped from
coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman spokesman Ed Canaday declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York-based firm had a record 32,569 employees in
August and the latest cuts reduce headcount by 10 percent and
to the lowest level since 2006. Goldman has managed to avoid
the kind of losses from mortgages and corporate loans that have
hobbled rivals, yet Goldman still has suffered from the steep
decline in merger and underwriting activity, as well as
plunging prices for stocks and other investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, Goldman could post its first ever quarterly loss
as a public company in December, as market turmoil weighs on
revenue for investment banking businesses and forces asset
writedowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley analyst Patrick Pinschmidt forecast a loss
of $1.09 a share for Goldman, the steepest decline projected by
an analyst. UBS analyst Glenn Schorr changed Goldman's estimate
to a loss of 40 cents a share from a gain of $1.40 a share.
Merrill Lynch analyst Guy Moszkowski expects Goldman to post a
fourth-quarter loss of 49 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Monday, Goldman shares hit a new 52-week low, down 11
percent at $69.20. In comparision, Goldman went public in 1999
at $53 a share.

&lt;p&gt;  PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC, Nov 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and MITAS, one of Europe's largest tire manufacturing
companies, today announced an agreement under which IBM will create a new
enterprise integration platform based on Service Oriented Architecture
(SOA) for MITAS.

    The new platform will enable integration of SAP ERP 6.0 system and other
enterprise applications. It will also significantly streamline application
alignment and management, shortening time necessary for change deployment.
Other benefits of the new platform at MITAS include cost savings through
more efficient system administration. The contract was signed in September
2008.

    This agreement follows a successful cooperation between IBM and MITAS
earlier this year when IBM and its subcontractor, Inter-Informatics,
implemented a new electronic information application called the Tire
Information System (TIS) for MITAS. The IBM solution, implemented in the
first half of 2008, is an integral part of the production of MITAS
off-road tire production, supporting the tire development lifecycle,
processing data on utilized materials and generating workflows for
specific machines and activities.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS Nov 10 (Reuters) - U.S. computer services and
software group International Business Machines (IBM.N) won
permission from EU competition authorities on Monday to buy
French software company Ilog ILOG.PA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The European Commission said the transaction would not
significantly impede competition in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Commission found that the merged entity would neither
have the ability nor the incentive to restrict access to Ilog's
products because several competitors supply similar software
products," it said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The merged company would be unlikely to engage in a
strategy of closing off customers by denying competitors of Ilog
access to IBM's demand for their products," it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal, valued at 215 million euros ($277 million),
received clearance from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission on
Aug. 18 and is part of IBM's strategy to make bolt-on
acquisitions of intellectual companies to which it can give
scale.

MELVILLE, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
AppSense, the leading provider of user environment management
solutions for large-scale environments, today announced that its newly
released Environment Manager 8.0 leverages Microsoft server
technologies, providing a readily scalable and highly efficient way to
personalize both virtual and physical desktops across the enterprise.

   "Microsoft is committed to making it easier for customers to
manage their IT infrastructure," said Neil Sanderson, head of
virtualisation at Microsoft UK. "With partners like AppSense onboard,
Microsoft virtualisation technologies are giving customers a cost
effective solution which can help them get the most out of their
existing IT systems."

   "We built Environment Manager 8.0 on key Microsoft technologies,

solution for large infrastructures," said Peter Rawlinson, VP
Marketing for AppSense. "Environment Manager can help IT departments
quickly build out fully personalized Microsoft desktops and migrate

move users from physical to virtual Hyper-V based desktops--all while
reducing the cost and complexity of managing those environments."

desktop environments to be fully - and automatically - personalized,

virtualization, presentation virtualization, streamed applications and
local and provisioned desktops--and easily and transparently migrate
large groups of users from physical to virtual desktops.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) is striving to better position itself for future growth and decide which parts of its many businesses it plans to keep and which it plans to sell off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many other large companies, GE has had a difficult 2008, and its shares have lost more than 40 percent since January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, GE posted earnings of $4.31 billion, or 43 cents per diluted share, down from $5.56 billion, or 54 cents per diluted share, a year earlier. Profit from continuing operations was down 12 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following are some key facts about General Electric:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* GE employs about 327,000 people and operates in more than 100 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The U.S. conglomerate in July restructures from six segments into four. The new segments are GE Technology Infrastructure, GE Energy Infrastructure, NBC Universal and GE Capital. It also retains the GE Consumer and Industrial business -- which makes appliances and light bulbs -- although the company aims to spin that business off to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* In 1890, Thomas Alva Edison, inventor of the light bulb, establishes the Edison General Electric Company, which later merges with a rival to form the General Electric Company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* In 1896, General Electric was one of the 12 companies listed on the newly formed Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI. It is the only original component that's still there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* In 1910, the company creates the first electric cooking range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* In 1930, the first electric clothes washer is brought to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* In 1940, the company's lights allow for the first night game in Major League Baseball, as the Cincinnati Reds defeat the Philadelphia Phillies 2-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* In 1957, the company opens the world's first nuclear power plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* For the 1969 initial moon landing, GE made the silicone rubber in astronaut Neil Armstrong's boots, supplied quality control systems, and created the communication systems to allow pictures to be transmitted to the earth from the moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* In 2004, GE buys Vivendi's (VIV.PA) television and movie assets, becoming the third-largest media conglomerate in the world. In the same year it completes the spinoff of most of its mortgage and life insurance assets into an independent company, Genworth Financial, based in Richmond, Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* GE was the fourth most recognized brand in the world, worth almost $49 billion, in 2007 and topped such brands as Nokia, McDonald's and Citi, according to a study by BusinessWeek magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Katharine Burr Blodgett, the first woman scientist to join GE Research laboratory, invented non-reflecting, invisible glass in 1939.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Jeffrey Immelt is GE's current chairman and chief executive. He was appointed in 2000 to replace Jack Welch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* After retiring from GE, Welch, dubbed "Neutron Jack" -- after the neutron bomb -- for eliminating jobs at the company, wrote "Jack: Straight from the Gut," a book that became an instant bestseller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sources: Company Web site, Reuters stories, BusinessWeek, Hoovers.com)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Assembled by Sweta Singh in Bangalore and Patrick Fitzgibbons in New York; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc will not change its strategy because it changed into a bank holding company, Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said at an investor conference on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares have tumbled in recent weeks amid concern its profit potential would plunge because of stricter Federal Reserve regulation. Yet in his first public comments since becoming a bank in September, Blankfein insisted the firm's strategy or appetite for risk would not change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some of the biggest opportunities this firm has had came from times of stress," he said at a Merrill Lynch investor conference in New York. "We are not forsaking our position as an adviser, financier and investor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, who has led the largest U.S. investment banking firm since 2006, also argued that its profitability, as measured by return on equity, would not be crimped by lower levels of balance sheet leverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Returns are also driven by the profit margins on trades and financing, he said, as well as by activity levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein observed that some of the firm's biggest investment windfalls were made during market slumps, such as principal investment in Asia after the 1998 debt crisis and in energy plants after Enron collapsed in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We won't be stubborn, but we also won't be rash," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Blankfein said a firm that has raised $55 billion for investment funds -- including a $20 billion private equity fund, a $16 billion mezzanine finance fund and a $10.5 billion senior debt fund -- during the past two years plans to invest in new distressed opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can participate right now," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein acknowledged that economic and market conditions remain very challenging. After initial downturns in mortgages and corporate loans, Blankfein said the next source of losses will come from consumer credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, he continued, also has plenty of capital. The day after it became a bank, the Federal Reserve deemed it "well capitalized."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the following two weeks, Goldman raised $21 billion of new capital from Berkshire Hathaway, a public stock offering and from the U.S. Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a bank and attracting stable pools of deposits is attractive, as a source of funding, but Blankfein stressed that capital markets business still must be funded from wholesale sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the most part, consumer deposits can be used to fund consumer banking, a business Goldman is not pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein played down suggestions that it needed to merge with a bigger bank, recently the subject of market speculation, though he did not rule it out. Goldman intends to maintain its "culture," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If that could be retained within the bigger mother ship," Goldman would have to consider it, "but it tends not to happen that way over time," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc will not change its strategy because it changed into a bank holding company, Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said at an investor conference on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares have tumbled in recent weeks amid concern its profit potential would plunge because of stricter Federal Reserve regulation.

"We are not forsaking our position as an adviser, financier and investor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, who has led the largest U.S. investment banking firm since 2006, also argued that its profitability, as measured by return on equity, would not be crimped by lower levels of balance sheet leverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Returns are also driven by the profit margins on trades and financing, he said, as well as by activity levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein observed that some of the firm's biggest investment windfalls were made during market slumps, such as principal investment in Asia after the 1998 debt crisis and in energy plants after Enron collapsed in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We won't be stubborn, but we also won't be rash," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Blankfein said a firm that has raised $55 billion for investment funds -- including a $20 billion private equity fund, a $16 billion mezzanine finance fund and a $10.5 billion senior debt fund -- during the past two years plans to invest in new distressed opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can participate right now," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein acknowledged that economic and market conditions remain very challenging.

&lt;p&gt; By Joseph A. Giannone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
(GS.N) will not change its strategy because it changed into a
bank holding company, Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein
said at an investor conference on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares have tumbled in recent weeks amid concern
its profit potential would plunge because of stricter Federal
Reserve regulation. Yet in his first public comments since
becoming a bank in September, Blankfein insisted the firm's

conference in New York. "We are not forsaking our position as
an adviser, financier and investor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein, who has led the largest U.S. investment banking
firm since 2006, also argued that its profitability, as
measured by return on equity, would not be crimped by lower
levels of balance sheet leverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Returns are also driven by the profit margins on trades and
financing, he said, as well as by activity levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein observed that some of the firm's biggest
investment windfalls were made during market slumps, such as
principal investment in Asia after the 1998 debt crisis and in
energy plants after Enron collapsed in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We won't be stubborn, but we also won't be rash," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Looking ahead, Blankfein said a firm that has raised $55
billion for investment funds -- including a $20 billion private
equity fund, a $16 billion mezzanine finance fund and a $10.5
billion senior debt fund -- during the past two years plans to
invest in new distressed opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We can participate right now," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein acknowledged that economic and market conditions

capitalized."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the following two weeks, Goldman raised $21 billion of
new capital from Berkshire Hathaway, a public stock offering
and from the U.S. Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Being a bank and attracting stable pools of deposits is
attractive, as a source of funding, but Blankfein stressed that
capital markets business still must be funded from wholesale
sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the most part, consumer deposits can be used to fund
consumer banking, a business Goldman is not pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein played down suggestions that it needed to merge

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings downgrades and assigns Rating Outlooks to J.P.
Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp., commercial mortgage
pass-through certificates, series 2004-PNC1, as follows:

   --$6.9 million class K to 'BB-' from 'BB'; Outlook Negative;

   --$4.1 million class L to 'B+' from 'BB-'; Outlook Negative;

   --$5.5 million class M to 'B-' from 'B+'; Outlook Negative;

   --$2.7 million class N to 'CCC/DR1' from 'B';

   --$2.7 million class P to 'C/DR6' from 'B-'.

   In addition, Fitch affirms and assigns Rating Outlooks to the
following classes:

   --$1.6 million class A-1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;

   --$234.6 million class A-1A at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;

   --$128.3 million class A-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;

   --$98 million class A-3 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;

   --$426.2 million class A-4 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;

   --Interest-only class X at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;

   --$28.8 million class B at 'AA'; Outlook Stable;

   --$13.7 million class C at 'AA-'; Outlook Stable;

   --$17.8 million class D at 'A'; Outlook Stable;

   --$11 million class E at 'A-'; Outlook Stable;

   --$16.5 million class F at 'BBB+'; Outlook Stable;

   --$11 million class G at 'BBB'; Outlook Stable;

   --$20.6 million class H at 'BBB-'; Outlook Negative;

   --$2.7 million class J at 'BB+'; Outlook Negative.

   Fitch does not rate the $11.5 million class NR certificates.

   The downgrades and assignment of the Distressed Recovery (DR)
ratings reflect the increased loss expectations on the specially
serviced loans since Fitch's last rating action. Classes H through M
have been assigned Negative Outlooks based on an assumption of
defaults and losses on the Fitch loans of concern. The Rating Outlooks
reflect the likely direction of any rating changes over the next one
to two years.

   As of the October 2008 distribution date, the pool's collateral
balance has decreased 5.3% to $1.04 billion from $1.10 billion at
issuance. Seventeen loans (22.6%) have defeased, including three
(11.7%) of the top ten loans.

   Fitch has identified 11 Loans of Concern (18.0%), which include
the three specially serviced loans (9.3%), as well as other loans with
weak performance. The largest specially serviced loan (5.3%) is
collateralized by a portfolio of six retail centers encompassing a
total of 683,846 square feet (sf) located in four states. The loan
transferred to special servicing in July 2008 due to an impending
default. The borrower, a subsidiary of Centro Properties Group, has
indicated an inability to refinance before the February 2009 maturity
date. The properties are currently listed for sale. Although the
borrower has received offers on five of the six properties that
indicate limited, if any, losses, Fitch expects that the sale process
could be prolonged in light of the restricted lending environment and
losses are possible.

   The second-largest specially serviced loan, (2.4%), is secured by
a 182,322 sf office building in Melville, NY. The principal of the
borrower, which is also a major tenant at the property (American Home
Mortgage, 59% of NRA), filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The borrowing
entity has not filed Chapter 11 and has not been consolidated into the
bankruptcy filing. The borrower has kept the loan payments current and
the tenant continues to operate at the property; however, the borrower
has requested a three-month forbearance. The special servicer is
currently evaluating workout options that would result in no losses to
the trust. However, Fitch assumed losses based on current market
conditions and the uncertainty surrounding the future occupancy of the
bankrupt tenant.

   The-third largest specially serviced loan (1.7%) transferred to
special servicing in October 2007 after the owner/operator, MBS Cos.,
defaulted on debt service. The loan is secured by a 312-unit
multifamily property located in San Antonio, TX. The property is
currently listed for sale and losses are expected.

   The largest loan in the pool, Centro Retail Portfolio (13.0%),
maintains its investment grade shadow rating. The loan is secured by
seven anchored retail properties, 54.1% located in Southern CA, and
45.9 % in Northern, CA. Year-end (YE) 2007 servicer reported debt
service coverage ratio (DSCR) on net operating income (NOI) was 2.89
times (x) and YE 2007 occupancy was 96%, consistent with occupancy at
issuance (95%). The properties are occupied by a diverse tenant base
with minimal exposure to currently bankrupt tenants. Major tenants at
the properties include Wal-Mart, Target, and Marshall's. The loan has
a coupon of 4.85% and matures in 2014. Though collateral performance
has been stable to date, Fitch is concerned about the declining
financial condition of the loan sponsor, Centro Properties Group.
Fitch will continue to monitor the loan.

   None of the non-defeased loans are scheduled to mature in 2008 and
five non-defeased loans (11.9%) are scheduled to mature in 2009,
including the largest specially serviced loan (5.3%). The weighted
average coupon for all of the transaction's non-defeased loans is
5.40% and the range is 4.44% to 8.06%.

   Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings
are available on the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com.
Published ratings, criteria and methodologies are available from this
site, at all times. Fitch's code of conduct, confidentiality,

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that clients from a range of industries
across the globe have chosen IBM mainframes this year to run the world's
highly secure and most sophisticated business transactions. Clients
selected IBM mainframes because of their distinct advantages over
competitive offerings. For example, a single IBM System z10 mainframe is
equal to nearly 1500 x86 servers, uses up to 85% less floor space and up
to 85% less energy.

    The adoption of IBM mainframes, which power the top 50 banks worldwide and
22 of the top 25 US retailers, has enabled IBM's System z to nearly double
its share this decade, according to IDC's high-end server quarterly
tracker. Over the same timeframe, HP and Sun have lost its share.*1
Additionally, installed capacity of new workloads on IBM mainframes grew
significantly in the first half of 2008. For example, Linux "specialty
engines" for the mainframe grew 26% in the first half of this year; Java
specialty engines grew 45%; and database specialty engines grew 133%.*2

    Examples of the wide range of clients that have adopted IBM mainframes
include: Winn-Dixie Stores (United States), Transzap (United States),
Industrial Bank of Korea, Japan Airlines International, Banco De Guayaquil
(Ecuador), Itau Bank (Brazil), Postbank AG (Germany), Finanz Informatik
(Germany); PSBank (Philippines), RHB Banking Group (Malaysia), and Allied
Irish Bank. In emerging markets such as Brazil, Singapore, Thailand and
the Philippines, IBM mainframe revenue grew 21%*3, comparing the first
half of 2008 to the first half of 2007.

    Broad customer adoption of IBM mainframes has led to:


--  Growth of mainframe applications: 600 new or updated applications were
introduced this year, bringing the total to more than 5,000 unique
applications.
--  More than 1,400 Independent Software Vendors are developing
applications for IBM System z mainframes.
--  More than 130 IBM Business Partners and Systems Integrators are
certified to sell IBM System z mainframes.
--  The number of universities worldwide that have worked with IBM to teach
mainframe and large systems skills have surpassed 500 -- up from 24 in
2004.  Over the past four years, more than 50,000 students have
participated in mainframe education.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Fox-Pitt Kelton analyst David Trone forecast a fourth-quarter loss for Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and said he expected the bank's principal investment portfolio to experience an unusually large markdown to reflect the dramatic slide in global equity values.&lt;/p&gt;

At the upper-end of this range is Barclays Capital, which cut its a estimate from a previous profit view of $2.71 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are making this cut now because of the dramatic equity market declines, to which we believe GS is most exposed through its private equity business," Barclays analyst Roger Freeman had said in a note dated November 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOSS EXPECTED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox-Pitt analyst David Trone forecast a fourth-quarter loss of $1.55 per share for Goldman. He earlier expected a profit of $2.59 per share. He also cut his 2009 EPS estimate to $9.08 from $12.15, "reflecting the lingering of the crisis of confidence within global capital markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Trone said he does not expect Goldman to take material writedowns from AIG (AIG.N) exposure. "Goldman management said AIG posted collateral and where there were disputes, Goldman hedged the difference," Trone said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"GS shares are near their all-time low, as they appear to be under pressures similar to troubled peers. However, should mgmt weather the near-term storm, we believe Goldman will fare better than many expect in the long-run," Trone added&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman Sachs fell more than 6 percent to $66.68 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange, before regaining losses to trade at $73.69 on Tuesday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Arup Roychoudhury in Bangalore; Editing by Jarshad Kakkrakandy)&lt;/p&gt;

market declines, to which we believe GS is most exposed through
its private equity business," Barclays analyst Roger Freeman
had said in a note dated Nov. 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOSS EXPECTED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fox-Pitt analyst David Trone forecast a fourth-quarter loss
of $1.55 per share for Goldman. He earlier expected a profit of
$2.59 per share. He also cut his 2009 EPS estimate to $9.08
from $12.15, "reflecting the lingering of the crisis of
confidence within global capital markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Trone said he does not expect Goldman to take
material writedowns from AIG (AIG.N) exposure. "Goldman
management said AIG posted collateral and where there were
disputes, Goldman hedged the difference," Trone said in a note
to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "GS shares are near their all-time low, as they appear to
be under pressures similar to troubled peers. However, should
mgmt weather the near-term storm, we believe Goldman will fare
better than many expect in the long-run," Trone added&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Goldman Sachs fell more than 6 percent to $66.68
in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange, before
regaining  losses to trade at $73.69 on Tuesday afternoon.

&lt;p&gt;STAMFORD, Conn.--(Business Wire)--
O'Shaughnessy Asset Management (OSAM) today announced that it
bought back a ten percent equity stake from a subsidiary of J.P.
Morgan (NYSE: JPM), a position that J.P. Morgan acquired through its
purchase of Bear Stearns earlier this year. Bear Stearns originally
acquired the ten percent ownership interest in OSAM as a part of the
deal that allowed Jim O'Shaughnessy and 13 of his colleagues to leave
Bear Stearns Asset Management in July, 2007 to start their own firm.
While J.P. Morgan will no longer be an equity stakeholder in OSAM,
they continue to be a key client of the firm. OSAM continues to be a
manager for the clients of J.P. Morgan through their Bear Stearns
Private Client Division.

   "We wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to acquire our own
equity back because we have a strong belief in the prospects for the
growth of our firm. The business landscape has changed since our
original deal with Bear Stearns, which opened the door for us to
discuss this with J.P. Morgan. At the same time, J.P. Morgan felt that
selling the equity stake was the right strategic decision. We feel
this is the best outcome for both firms," said Jim O'Shaughnessy,
Chairman and CEO, O'Shaughnessy Asset Management. "It is also
important to note that our relationship with J.P. Morgan remains very
strong, and we continue to maintain a clear commitment to servicing
their clients."

   With this transaction, approximately 89 percent of OSAM is owned
by employees and their immediate family members. The Royal Bank of
Canada (RBC), for which OSAM also serves as a sub-adviser to its
family of mutual funds, owns approximately 11 percent of OSAM through
an acquisition earlier this year. OSAM formally began independent
operations last year and currently has over $7 billion in total assets
under management. The transition of the firm's assets from Bear
Stearns to OSAM held through financial intermediaries was completed in
January 2008. Institutional accounts completed their transition at the
end of March 2008.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, updates share movement and adds background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 11 (Reuters) - Shares of all major U.S. life insurers
fell sharply in afternoon trade, after Goldman Sachs analyst
Chris Neczypor assumed coverage of the sector with a bearish
view, saying the segment will see asset deterioration in the
next 12 to 18 months and needs to raise more capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hartford Financial Services Group Inc (HIG.N) was down more
than 26 percent at $10.72, while other major life insurers were
down at least 9 percent on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neczypor said weak equity markets will decrease fee income,
dislocated credit markets will hurt spread business and
heightened scrutiny by rating agencies and regulators may
result in increased capital requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neczypor assumed the coverage of major U.S. life insurers
with a "cautious" view from Tom Cholnoky, who had a "neutral"
view on the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He recommended selling the shares of Hartford Financial
Services Group Inc (HIG.N), Lincoln National Corp (LNC.N),
Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N) and Principal Financial Group
Inc (PFG.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Principal Financial appears most at risk from continued
asset deterioration, as it has the highest leverage to
problematic asset classes, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With more institutional funding contracts due in the next
two years and a slowing of incoming business from which to roll
the funds, we believe capital raises are imminent," Neczypor
said about the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst rated MetLife Inc (MET.N) "neutral" on a
relative basis, "given the less pressing near-term need to
raise capital."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Insurers are feeling the pinch as falling stock markets and
freezing credit markets cause a decline in the value of their
investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this month, however, Hartford Financial had said
its property and casualty insurance units were well
capitalized, while late last month both Prudential and
Principal had said they have sufficient capital and will not
need to raise more to maintain key credit ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neczypor said in the longer term, the sector's landscape
will be dramatically different, as the industry's problems may
force some of the smaller institutions to exit the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Those who survive will be able to consolidate
distribution, invest in appropriate capital markets
infrastructure and eventually lead the industry in capturing
the opportunities associated with the baby-boomer retirement,"
he said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - General Motors Corp's (GM.N) extremely distressed debt is an attractive investment as the automaker has several options to improve its liquidity and survive the economic downturn, according to credit analysts at JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GM's bonds have tumbled as the company burns through cash and struggles to turn around its business amid a weakening economy and dire sales figures. Its shares have plummeted to the lowest level since 1946.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The automaker posted a $4.2 billion loss for the third quarter on Friday and said it would cut white-collar jobs and slash next year's capital spending budget by $2.5 billion to try to cope with a sharp sales slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In spite of this bad news, JPMorgan analysts rate GM's bonds a "buy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe GM has several sources of liquidity it can access to bridge the company to 2010 when it realizes considerable cost cuts," analysts Eric Selle and Atiba Edwards said in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include an overfunded pension plan, possible asset sales, capital market transactions, equity injections, cost cutting and government loans, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM's benchmark 8.375 percent bond due 2033 has dropped to 25.75 cents on the dollar, from 36.5 cents at the end of October, according to MarketAxess. The bonds had traded at more than 80 cents on the dollar at the beginning of the year and currently yield 32.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The automaker's credit default swaps are also trading at extremely distressed prices, costing 68.5 percent the sum insured as an upfront cost, plus 5 percent in annual premiums for five years, according to Markit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means it costs $6.85 million to insure $10 million in debt for five years, plus $500,000 annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We view the upside (driven by stabilization of U.S. sales volumes and liquidity enhancement measures) on the bonds as much higher and more likely than the downside of a potential bankruptcy," JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"GM's recent product successes (award-winning styling, performance and quality) and its considerable international profitability give us confidence they can become profitable in North America selling cars," they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysts added that they have factored in economic weakness for the next 2-1/2 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to GM's bonds, selling protection on the debt using credit default swaps is also attractive, as is buying its term loan, JPMorgan said. They added, however that the company's short-term survival will require the help of the government and/or its suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts at independent research firm KDP Advisors, meanwhile, said they expect GM will benefit from additional government loans and that it is likely to avoid bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have a "hold" recommendation on its bonds, however, due to the risk that the company may restructure its debt, or push them further down in the capital structure, which will be harmful to bondholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Detroit automakers have, in essence, been pursuing an out-of-court restructuring over the past three years.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - For most of the past century, Goldman Sachs was top of the heap among Wall Street's investment banking firms, but its prospects as a heavily regulated bank are not so bright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After months of fretting about capital and liquidity levels at banks, the market has turned its focus from Goldman's survival prospects to its earnings potential. Investors clearly do not like what they see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The days of getting 35 percent (returns) on equity are over -- much of that was achieved with leverage," Mendon Capital President and Chief Investment Officer Anton Schutz told Reuters on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brokers and banks, he said, must change their ways. "There is no doubt their balance sheets are seen as weaker. They're trying to get leverage ratios down," Schutz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors may get some answers when Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein speaks at a Merrill Lynch investor conference after the closing bell on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc shares on Monday fell to their lowest levels since 2003 as a growing chorus of analysts forecast plunging markets will produce a fourth-quarter loss -- the firm's first quarterly loss since it went public in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock has plunged 71 percent since reaching a record high last October and is down nearly two-thirds since the end of July. It stood at $72.04 in Tuesday morning trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors are questioning the firm's ability to retain its famed Midas touch, where an elite army of traders and bankers generated the industry's biggest profits year after year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question now is where Goldman will seek new sources of revenue and which businesses it will abandon as it goes through the transition from broker to bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know what Goldman and Morgan Stanley will look like after they re-size," Oppenheimer  Co banking analyst Meredith Whitney said. "I'm agnostic on those names right now. There is a lot they have to go through."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BLANKFEIN SPEAKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In previous year presentations, Blankfein laid out a blueprint for a firm boldly betting its own capital across markets and companies, taking on more risk than its peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also made no apologies for Goldman's combination of advisory businesses with investment activities. Twelve months ago, he emphasized expansion into fast-growing markets like China and building a private wealth management business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since announcing its conversion to a bank and plans to seek a New York state banking charter two months ago, Goldman has been typically mum about its intentions for deposit-gathering and how it would reorganize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months ago, investors made it clear they had little confidence in companies that relied on volatile capital markets for funds needed to run their businesses. Gathering deposits from individuals is now the preferred model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks are expected to maintain higher levels of capital and cash and take on less risk. That has forced Goldman and Morgan to reconsider how to participate in credit intensive businesses such as prime brokerage, deal financing and commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman addressed some of those concerns by selling $5 billion of preferred stock to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, $6 billion of stock in a public offering, and $10 billion of preferred stock to the U.S. Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week Goldman fired more than 3,200 employees, or 10 percent of its workforce, the latest in a series of layoffs. And like its peers, it is shedding assets and paying down debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That has not stemmed a drumbeat of rumors about the bank's next moves. In recent weeks traders have speculated Goldman will pursue a management buyout or combine with a big bank, perhaps Citigroup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the behest of government officials, Blankfein called Citi CEO Vikram Pandit to discuss a potential deal, people familiar with the matter said. Pandit dismissed the idea and the call ended within a minute, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the foreseeable future, debt and mortgage markets remain in disarray. Merger and underwriting activity has slowed to a crawl. Plunging markets are eroding money management fees and generating portfolio losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Fox-Pitt Kelton's David Trone became the latest analyst to forecast a fourth-quarter loss at Goldman. He expects the firm to absorb a $2.7 billion drop in principal investments and a record $2 billion of credit writedowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  SAO PAULO, BRAZIL, Nov 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that TAM Airlines (BOVESPA: TAMM4) (NYSE:
TAM) has signed a contract with IBM for the management of its service
desk. The solution includes installation, help desk and field support of
TAM's information technology (IT) infrastructure.

    The project's goal is to help solve challenges associated with the
check-in system, software used by employees to sell airline tickets and
reserve seats on flights, and server reliability.

    IBM has mobilized a team of 90 onsite professionals to support many of
TAM's departments and back office. IBM's Hortolandia Service Center,
located in Sao Paulo, will also have a team dedicated to help desk
services for TAM's IT users.

    The agreement, signed in August 2008, is the second large contract between
TAM and IBM. The first one, dating from 2007, involved application
development services.

    About TAM:

    TAM (www.tam.com.br) has been leading the domestic market since July 2003
and has ended this September with 52.8% market share. The company flies to
42 destinations in Brazil. With the commercial agreements signed with
regional companies that total goes up to 79 different destinations in
national territory. TAM's market participation among Brazilian airline
companies operating international lines was 82.1% in September. Its
overseas operations include direct flights to 16 destinations in the

the USA, South America and Europe. Pioneer in the launch of a Fidelity
Program for airline companies in Brazil, TAM today has more than five
million members and has distributed more than 5.9 million tickets in
exchange for cashed in points.

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Forms Alliance With E+Co -- Supporting Clean Energy Through Carbon Finance

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
E+Co announced today that The Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE: GS) has
agreed to purchase the majority of its carbon offset portfolio.
Through the multi-year alliance, Goldman Sachs will help promote
E+Co's goal of providing investment capital and support services to
small, clean energy business ventures in developing countries.

   Small-scale clean energy projects, while supporting important
social and environmental benefits, can struggle to attract sufficient
funding to assure success. The financial backing and business
development services provided by E+Co assists small businesses in
Africa, Asia and Latin America to supply clean and affordable energy
to those regions, efforts that simultaneously increase employment
opportunities and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

   E+Co also assists clean energy businesses with the aggregation,
validation, verification and creation of high quality GHG offsets
including those that will be sold to Goldman Sachs. The carbon
financing related to the off-take of the GHG reductions provides the
enterprises with additional capital that supports, sustains and helps
grow the clean energy ventures.

   "Our alliance with Goldman Sachs is a testament to the importance
and potential of the global carbon markets," said E+Co Carbon Finance
Manager Erik Wurster. "This represents the growing demand for high
quality carbon assets that promote sustainable development and poverty
reduction in some of the world's poorest nations."

   "We are excited to work with E+Co and support the advancement of
clean energy and the important social and environmental benefits
associated with these efforts," said Gerrit Nicholas, head of the
North American Environmental Commodities Sales Team at Goldman Sachs.
"The development of cleaner, more secure energy sources is an
international issue that we can help to address through purchasing
E+Co's offsets and participating in the global carbon market."

   E+Co's projects are located in 28 developing countries and meet
various carbon standards including the Gold Standard and the Clean
Development Mechanism. While all projects focus on clean energy, they
vary widely in type. "We have installed solar panels in Guatemala and
are working in Africa to distribute efficient cook stoves. The stove
projects not only reduce carbon emissions, but also mitigate hazardous
air pollutants, provide employment opportunities, and reduce household
fuel costs. This triple bottom line impact - people, planet and profit
- is fundamental to what we hope to achieve," said Wurster.

   About Goldman Sachs

   The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is a bank holding company and a
leading global investment banking, securities and investment
management firm. Goldman Sachs provides a wide range of services
worldwide to a substantial and diversified client base that includes
corporations, financial institutions, governments and high net worth
individuals. Founded in 1869, the firm is headquartered in New York
and maintains offices in London, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Hong Kong and other
major financial centers around the world.

   About E+Co

   E+Co is a non-profit investment company that provides business
support services and capital to clean energy businesses in Africa,
Asia and Latin America. With almost 15 years of experience and offices
in Bolivia, Brazil, China, Costa Rica, Ghana, the Netherlands, South
Africa, Tanzania, Thailand and the United States, E+Co's innovative
business model provides lasting solutions to climate change and

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds share movement, other details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs cut its price target on
Google Inc (GOOG.O) and trimmed its fourth-quarter revenue
outlook, sending the Web search company's shares down to their
lowest level in three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Paid search is typically a real-time media sale, so
revenue should react rapidly to macro deterioration," said
Goldman, which cut its target price on the stock to $475 from
$520.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage cut its fourth-quarter revenue growth
forecast on Google to 1 percent from 4 percent sequentially,
citing poor macroeconomic and consumer data in October. The
company posted revenue of $5.54 billion in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said its new forecast also reflected negative
commentary on search trends in September and October from Ask
and AOL, who cited declining consumer propensity to click on
paid links and advertiser willingness to bid up paid links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Declining average order values, noted by eBay (EBAY.O) and
Amazon (AMZN.O), could likely reduce theoretical threshold bids
per keyword, the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, Barclays Capital cut its price target on the
stock by $52 to $490.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company were trading down 5 percent at
$301.65 Tuesday on Nasdaq. Earlier, they touched a low of
$300.89.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
With increased government and consumer pressures on companies to provide
higher levels of identity assurance, IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced
technology that helps customers better control identity and access
management in order to build trust and confidence in the critical systems
running their businesses.

    "Government regulations demand that enterprises take full responsibility
for data security, and the linkage between data security and strong
authentication should not be underestimated," said Al Zollar, general
manager, IBM Tivoli Software. "Human identity and authentication systems
are only valuable when they can be trusted. IBM's focus on identity
assurance integrates access management, data security and compliance
capabilities into the critical processes that improve trust and confidence
in business transactions."

    Billions of identities used in business and social networking environments
-- ranging from passwords, employee badges, driver's licenses and stronger
forms of authentication -- are used each day to complete various types of
transactions both on-line and in-person, granting individuals a wide range
of physical and digital access privileges. As the number of identities and
related theft rates increase exponentially, the ability for organizations
and individuals to trust that people, in fact, "are who they say they are"
has become paramount, particularly in the global economy. While passwords
are sufficient in social networking environments, higher levels of
authentication are required in business-level transactions.

    "Strong authentication is an important part of identity assurance,
especially for healthcare," said Michael Day, director of IT for Daughters
of Charity. "We use IBM Tivoli Access Manager for Enterprise Single
Sign-on with our building access badge to ensure we know who is accessing
critical healthcare information. This solution allows us to raise
security while enhancing time to information."

    IBM is the leading provider of security and risk management technologies
and expertise. IBM's dedicated research, software, hardware, services and
global business partner network helps clients around the world secure
their business operations and deploy comprehensive risk management
programs. Today IBM is announcing solutions with independent software
vendors to address strong authentication. The offerings expand upon and
complement IBM's trusted identity initiative and its Tivoli Security,
Risk and Compliance Management Portfolio.

    IBM has worked with business partners Arcot, Gemalto, and L-1 Identity
Solutions on integrated solutions that demonstrate IBM's ability to
support strong, multi-factor authentication -- the process of verifying
the identity of a person or entity.

    Arcot A-OK On-Demand integrated with IBM Tivoli Access Manager for
e-business protects and verifies identities using a combination of
risk-based and strong authentication so that only authorized users gain
access to their confidential, proprietary, or regulated data. The
integration makes strong authentication significantly easier to implement
without changing a user's sign-on behavior and protects users from
phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks without installing new hardware or
software. For more information on the Arcot A-OK On-Demand for IBM Tivoli
Access Manager for e-business, visit:
http://www.arcot.com/products/a-ok/ibm.

    Gemalto has worked with IBM's trusted identity initiative to integrate
strong authentication capabilities, best practices and use cases for
protecting and securing personal identities and assets. The Gemalto
Protiva Strong Authentication Solution features a broad range of personal
security devices that use smart card technology for One-Time Password
(OTP) and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate authentication and
are available in card and USB token form factors. The integrated strong
authentication solution with identity and access management helps protect
identities and enterprise information systems against phishing attacks,
key logging, shoulder surfing and stolen passwords.

    L-1 Identity Solutions multi-biometric technologies (including any
combination of finger, face, palm and iris recognition) are integrated
into IBM systems to meet any customer's requirement for protecting and
securing identities and assets. L-1's secure credentialing solutions
integrate personalization and enhanced security features into a wide
variety of credentials. Access control readers from L-1 utilize
state-of-the-art finger and face recognition technologies, including 3D
face, for more secure access to building and facilities. L-1 mobile
devices provide highly accurate and fast identifications by capturing a
person's unique biometric and using it to enroll and verify their
identity.

    "The need for identity assurance is increasingly important, especially
when an individual's personal information is involved," said Kamal
Bherwani, Health &amp; Human Services CIO and Executive Director, City of New
York. "The balance between data security and ease of access to relevant
information can be better achieved with strong authentication integrated
into the fabric of IT applications. New cloud-based technologies have
also made it easier to enable enterprise middleware applications with
strong authentication credentials provisioned from the cloud, creating a
more feasible model for deploying online client based transactions."

    IBM's Trusted Identity Centers of Excellence in Dallas, San Jose,
Bangalore and LaGaude, France, extend IBM's identity management
capabilities, focusing on improving trust and confidence in human
identity systems. The centers offer services leaders, architects, and
developer expertise in the processes and technologies that deliver a
trusted identity lifecycle.

    At the Gartner Identity and Access Management Summit November 10-12, IBM
will be presenting its strategy for authentication and human identity
systems and point to existing products, partner integrations, and
breakthrough advances being made at its Trusted Identity Centers of
Excellence.

-- ranging from passwords, employee badges, driver's licenses and stronger
forms of authentication -- are used each day to complete various types of
transactions both on-line and in-person, granting individuals a wide range
of physical and digital access privileges. As the number of identities and
related theft rates increase exponentially, the ability for organizations
and individuals to trust that people, in fact, "are who they say they are"
has become paramount, particularly in the global economy. While passwords
are sufficient in social networking environments, higher levels of
authentication are required in business-level transactions.

    "Strong authentication is an important part of identity assurance,
especially for healthcare," said Michael Day, director of IT for Daughters
of Charity. "We use IBM Tivoli Access Manager for Enterprise Single
Sign-on with our building access badge to ensure we know who is accessing
critical healthcare information. This solution allows us to raise
security while enhancing time to information."

    IBM is the leading provider of security and risk management technologies
and expertise. IBM's dedicated research, software, hardware, services and
global business partner network helps clients around the world secure
their business operations and deploy comprehensive risk management
programs. Today IBM is announcing solutions with independent software
vendors to address strong authentication. The offerings expand upon and
complement IBM's trusted identity initiative and its Tivoli Security,
Risk and Compliance Management Portfolio.

    IBM has worked with business partners Arcot, Gemalto, and L-1 Identity
Solutions on integrated solutions that demonstrate IBM's ability to
support strong, multi-factor authentication -- the process of verifying
the identity of a person or entity.

    Arcot A-OK On-Demand integrated with IBM Tivoli Access Manager for
e-business protects and verifies identities using a combination of
risk-based and strong authentication so that only authorized users gain
access to their confidential, proprietary, or regulated data. The
integration makes strong authentication significantly easier to implement
without changing a user's sign-on behavior and protects users from
phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks without installing new hardware or
software. For more information on the Arcot A-OK On-Demand for IBM Tivoli
Access Manager for e-business, visit:
http://www.arcot.com/products/a-ok/ibm.

    Gemalto has worked with IBM's trusted identity initiative to integrate
strong authentication capabilities, best practices and use cases for
protecting and securing personal identities and assets. The Gemalto
Protiva Strong Authentication Solution features a broad range of personal
security devices that use smart card technology for One-Time Password
(OTP) and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate authentication and
are available in card and USB token form factors. The integrated strong
authentication solution with identity and access management helps protect
identities and enterprise information systems against phishing attacks,
key logging, shoulder surfing and stolen passwords.

    L-1 Identity Solutions multi-biometric technologies (including any
combination of finger, face, palm and iris recognition) are integrated
into IBM systems to meet any customer's requirement for protecting and
securing identities and assets. L-1's secure credentialing solutions
integrate personalization and enhanced security features into a wide
variety of credentials. Access control readers from L-1 utilize
state-of-the-art finger and face recognition technologies, including 3D
face, for more secure access to building and facilities. L-1 mobile
devices provide highly accurate and fast identifications by capturing a
person's unique biometric and using it to enroll and verify their
identity.

    "The need for identity assurance is increasingly important, especially
when an individual's personal information is involved," said Kamal
Bherwani, Health &amp; Human Services CIO and Executive Director, City of New
York. "The balance between data security and ease of access to relevant
information can be better achieved with strong authentication integrated
into the fabric of IT applications. New cloud-based technologies have
also made it easier to enable enterprise middleware applications with
strong authentication credentials provisioned from the cloud, creating a
more feasible model for deploying online client based transactions."

    IBM's Trusted Identity Centers of Excellence in Dallas, San Jose,
Bangalore and LaGaude, France, extend IBM's identity management
capabilities, focusing on improving trust and confidence in human
identity systems. The centers offer services leaders, architects, and
developer expertise in the processes and technologies that deliver a
trusted identity lifecycle.

    At the Gartner Identity and Access Management Summit November 10-12, IBM
will be presenting its strategy for authentication and human identity
systems and point to existing products, partner integrations, and
breakthrough advances being made at its Trusted Identity Centers of
Excellence.

&lt;p&gt;Solidcore Announces First Integrity Monitoring and PCI Compliance Solution for IBM 4690 Retail POS Environments

   Provides New Level of Control and Security for Large Install-Base
of Critical Retail Systems
CUPERTINO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Solidcore(R) Systems, Inc., the leader in securing retail and
point-of-service systems, today announced its Integrity Monitoring
Solution for IBM 4690 point of sale (POS) environments. The solution
is the first of its kind to monitor and alert on changes to IBM 4690
POS Controllers, which provide both the application and operating
system images to the client terminals in many of today's retail
environments. IBM 4690 systems represent a large install-base of
retail POS systems and Solidcore's capabilities for monitoring the
integrity of these systems will help retailers using these systems to
quickly verify Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance.

   According to Greg Buzek, president of the IHL Group, "IBM 4690 POS
terminal sales drove $1.02 billion in hardware, software, and
maintenance in 2007, and there is a significant installed base within
the category of superstores/warehouses and mass merchants that rely on
this operating system with 64% of the installed base." While IBM 4690
technology has proven itself over time, meeting the intent of PCI
compliance across these platforms has been difficult to accomplish.
Solidcore's Integrity Monitoring for IBM 4690 provides the visibility,
monitoring and audit reporting capabilities that retailers need to
fulfill the PCI compliance mandates for alerting personnel to
unauthorized modifications of critical system or content files.

   "The importance of file integrity monitoring cannot be overlooked
when it comes to PCI compliance," said Branden Williams, PCI practice
director for VeriSign. "File integrity monitoring is a critical aspect
of understanding the changes within payment systems and should be
deployed as a best-practice regardless of the version of POS systems
or terminals or terminals in use."

   Solidcore provides the 4690 Integrity Monitoring solution with two
distinct components. The first is the capability to assess a "gold"
image of the POS Controller with field deployed images and report on
any differences in executables. This feature allows for the creation
of executive-level compliance reports that ease the audit process. The
second component takes the initial baseline assessment and provides
configurable alerting on changes to executables and files. This
feature provides information on what is changing and can be a positive
means for verifying that authorized changes, such as updated data
files for coupon engines and pricing, are properly distributed to the
POS Controllers. The retailer or a qualified security assessor (QSA)
can provide the assessment and determine what level of granularity to
focus on for monitoring authorized and unauthorized changes.

   "Providing this immediate assurance that PCI compliance is being
met across IBM 4690 environments is essential, and we are pleased to
be the first to deliver this solution to retailers," said Anne
Bonaparte, president and CEO of Solidcore. "Minimizing exposure to
risk during the operational management of these critical retail POS
Controllers is a significant reason why our largest customers are
standardizing on Solidcore retail solutions in their stores."

   These new capabilities are part of Solidcore's POS Check and
Control solution, which provides a single interface for integrity
monitoring across IBM 4690, Windows or Linux based POS environments.
This simplifies the path to PCI compliance for retailers with
heterogeneous environments.

   About Solidcore

   Solidcore is a leader in retail system security, change audit and
configuration control. Organizations worldwide trust Solidcore to
detect and prevent unwanted change for improving IT compliance,
security and availability. Solidcore easily automates PCI controls and

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of Goldman Sachs (GS.N) fell nearly 4 percent to $68.50 before the bell on Tuesday after Fox-Pitt joined a growing list of brokerages forecasting a fourth-quarter loss for the U.S. bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Fox-Pitt Kelton analyst David Trone forecast a fourth-quarter loss at Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and said he expected the bank's principal investment portfolio to experience an unusually large markdown to reflect the dramatic slide in global equity values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past one week, analysts across the board, from brokerages like Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan Securities and Barclays Capital have said they expect Goldman Sachs to post a fourth-quarter loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox-Pitt's Trone forecast a fourth-quarter loss of $1.55 per share for Goldman. He earlier expected a profit of $2.59 per share. He also cut his 2009 EPS estimate to $9.08 from $12.15, "reflecting the lingering of the crisis of confidence within global capital markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trone said he expects the principal investment portfolio to be marked down by $2.7 billion and credit-asset gross write-downs of about $2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do not expect Goldman to take material writedowns for AIG (AIG.N), as management said AIG posted collateral and where there were disputes, Goldman hedged the difference," Trone said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should the company weather the near-term storm, it may fare better than what many expect in the long-run, the analyst added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman Sachs fell 2.4 percent to $69.44 before the bell Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Arup Roychoudhury in Bangalore; Editing by Jarshad Kakkrakandy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 11 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities cut its rating on
U.S. meat producer Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N) to "underweight"
from "overweight," citing an increased risk from covenants and
lower chicken imports from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When we launched coverage, we cited the possibility of
Russia limiting its U.S chicken imports. Russia announced on
Friday that it indeed is seeking to cut quotas, and by a larger
amount than originally proposed," analyst Ken Goldman said in a

2009, slashed his price target on the stock to $4 from $10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said Tyson Foods will trip a covenant unless it
negotiates a credit agreement with its lenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "No amendments are guaranteed in today's jittery credit
market, no matter how strong management's relationships are
with lenders," said the analyst, who raised concerns over the
company getting an amendment so soon, as it had received one in
September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Until Tyson Foods erases most of its covenant risk, we do
not see the shares bidding up much higher, not with investors
in "avoid all credit risk" mode," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst said he sees TreeHouse Foods Inc (THS.N),
McCormick  Co Inc (MKC.N), Del Monte Foods Co DLM.N or Hain
Celestial Group Inc (HAIN.O) as better investments compared
with Tyson Foods.

&lt;p&gt;Alfresco's Open Source Barometer Reveals that Enterprises Are Using a Mixed Microsoft, Java and AJAX Environment

   Over 50% of Windows respondents use Java Architecture for Content
                              Management
LONDON--(Business Wire)--
Alfresco Software, Inc. today announced the results of the third
global survey of trends in the use of open source software in the
enterprise. The Alfresco Open Source Barometer survey is the largest
open source enterprise infrastructure/stack survey. The report covers
data provided by over 25,000 of Alfresco's 74,000 community members
during the period of April to September 2008.

   The goal of this survey is to research how open source is used
within the enterprise, as well as examine the growing impact of
Enterprise 2.0 technologies and competitive systems such as Microsoft
SharePoint. The survey shows how respondents evaluating Alfresco's
open source Enterprise Content Management (ECM) software are using
Windows, but rejecting .NET/Web parts and Silverlight, instead looking
for an ECM solution based on a Java architecture and AJAX, with
integrated Web 2.0 tools.

   Key findings from the Alfresco Open Source Barometer survey
include:

   Microsoft Stack Adoption

   --  92% do not use or intend to use Silverlight;

   --  86% do not use or intend to use .NET/Web Parts;

   --  64% evaluate on Windows;

   --  53% use or intend to use a Java architecture; and,

   --  52% use or intend to use AJAX.

   Open Source ECM and Enterprise 2.0

   In an open source ECM environment:

   --  66% want a browser experience to access content which reflects
        a Web 2.0 experience;

   --  The majority of users have no strong preference in their
        choice of blog or wiki. Logically the integrated blog or wiki
        will be used for ECM activities;

   --  The majority of users have no strong preference for Business
        Process Management (BPM) or Business Intelligence (BI); and,

   --  Where a preference is expressed, the open source market leader
        is chosen - for example: WordPress, MediaWiki or JBoss, and
        Business Objects for BI.

   Open Source Infrastructure

   The results for infrastructure usage are consistent with the
previous Open Source Barometer surveys:

   --  Red Hat and Ubuntu continue to lead in operating system usage;

   --  User preference for evaluating on Windows and deploying on
        Linux is maintained; and,

   --  In the category of Application Server, Tomcat continues to
        dominate at 67% and JBoss is in second place with 15%.

   "One of the survey's goals was to examine the impact of SharePoint
on the open source ECM market," said Dr Ian Howells, CMO, Alfresco
Software. "This survey drilled down further, examining specifically
the Windows sub-set. The majority of open source users evaluate on
Windows but 86% do not use .NET/Web Parts and 95% do not use
Silverlight. The survey found that over 50% of respondents use a Java
architecture and AJAX. One conclusion is Windows respondents are
looking for an open source alternative to SharePoint and want a Java
architecture. This further demonstrates how organizations are
increasingly using a mixed open source and proprietary environment."

   Alfresco's Open Source Barometer asks respondents (who are either
joining the Alfresco community or evaluating Alfresco software) their
technology preferences in order to capture the latest information
about how companies are evaluating and deploying open source and
proprietary software stacks together in the enterprise. In addition to
asking users about their preferences in operating systems, application
servers and portals, the most recent survey includes new data on
social collaboration tools such as wikis, blogs, as well as business
process management, business intelligence, architecture and rich
internet applications.

   Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog:

   Williams Readjusted, Stays a Buy

   Williams Companies' (NYSE: WMB) recent quarterly results, while
below our estimates, were above the year-earlier levels. The
year-over-year increase resulted from strong performance in the E
segment, partially offset by lower NGL sales volumes in the midstream
segment.

   In the wake of the lower energy prices and a slower economy,
Williams reduced its 2008 and 2009 capital spending and profit
forecasts. However, we continue to believe that the company is well
positioned to cope with the current downturn given the attractive
growth opportunities in its low-risk E business and continued
strength in NGL margins.

   MannKind Has Further to Fall

   MannKind Corporation's (Nasdaq: MNKD) lead drug, Technosphere
Insulin (TI), is an inhaled insulin product and is in phase III trials
for the treatment of diabetes. The inhaled insulin market has
witnessed a major upheaval in recent times with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE),
Lilly (NYSE: LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) withdrawing their
late-stage candidates, citing lack of market prospect for this class
of drugs.

   Occurrence of lung cancer in diabetic patients treated with
Exubera and the FDA panel's stricter recommendations for the approval
of diabetes drugs have further cast a shadow over the future of TI.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) has cut about 10 percent of its investment bankers in Tokyo, including one of Japan's top women bankers, as part of global efforts to cut its workforce, people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), which
acted for the state of California in selling bonds, has urged
some of its big clients to place investment bets against some of
those bonds this year, the Los Angeles Times reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The paper said that Goldman declined to discuss the details
of its trading strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally told the paper that the
firm was no longer giving the trading advice to clients. He
declined to elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The newspaper said the company did not inform the office of
California Treasurer Bill Lockyer that it was proposing a way
for investment clients to profit from California's economic
downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It could exaggerate people's worries about our credit," the
paper quoted Paul Rosenstiel, head of the public finance
division of the treasurer's office, as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The investment bank's actions are not illegal, the paper
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman is an important underwriter of California municipal
securities and over the last five years has earned about $25
million in underwriting fees from California issues, the paper
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs could not be immediately reached for comment
by Reuters.

&lt;p&gt;Deepwater Facility Expected to Produce 70,000 Barrels of Oil
                          Equivalent Per Day
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today announced that it has started
crude oil production from its Blind Faith Field in the deepwater Gulf
of Mexico. First oil from Blind Faith was achieved on Nov. 11, 2008.
Daily production is expected to ramp up to approximately 65,000
barrels of crude oil and 55 million cubic feet of natural gas over the
next three months.

   Blind Faith utilizes a deep-draft semisubmersible hull located
about 160 miles (250 kilometers) southeast of New Orleans, La., on
Mississippi Canyon block 650. Chevron's deepest offshore production
facility, Blind Faith is located in 6,500 feet (1,981 meters) of
water, and with subsea systems located in 7,000 feet (2,134 meters) of
water in Mississippi Canyon blocks 695 and 696.

   "Blind Faith is one of several major near-term upstream projects
that will allow us to grow our reserves and production," said George
Kirkland, executive vice president, Global Upstream and Gas, Chevron.
"It is another demonstration of how Chevron is leading the industry in
the selection and execution of major capital projects."

   Gary Luquette, president, Chevron North America Exploration and
Production, said, "First oil from Blind Faith is another milestone in
Chevron's efforts to tap the vast deepwater energy resources in the
Gulf of Mexico. Chevron is the largest leaseholder in the Gulf of
Mexico, where we have a robust program of exploration and production
activities, especially in the deep water."

   Steve Thurston, vice president, Deepwater Exploration and
Projects, Chevron North America Exploration and Production, added,
"The Blind Faith team delivered a world-class project that will bring
on new supplies to help the nation meet its energy needs."

   The Blind Faith discovery well was drilled in June 2001 and
encountered more than 200 feet (61 meters) of net pay in Miocene sands
at depths of 20,900 feet (6,370 meters) to 24,300 feet (7,407 meters).
A successful appraisal well was drilled in 2004. The field has an
estimated gross resource potential exceeding 100 million barrels of
oil-equivalent. Chevron holds a 75 percent working interest in Blind
Faith and is the operator, and Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
(NYSE:APC) holds the remaining 25 percent working interest.

   Chevron Corporation is one of the world's leading integrated
energy companies, with subsidiaries that conduct business across the
globe. The company's success is driven by the ingenuity and commitment
of approximately 59,000 employees who operate across the energy
spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and transports crude oil and
natural gas; refines, markets and distributes transportation fuels and
other energy products; manufactures and sells petrochemical products;
generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides energy
efficiency solutions; and develops and commercializes the energy
resources of the future, including biofuels and other renewables.

&lt;p&gt;Author Sandy Carter, Top Marketer from IBM, Uses 50+ Case Studies
             to Help Marketers Innovate With Social Media
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The New Language of Marketing 2.0: How to Use ANGELS to Energize
Your Market (www.ibmpressbooks.com/angels), authored by Sandy Carter,
delivers to marketers a new framework, and specific social media
tools, for engaging with customers in today's connected world. Carter
says today's marketers, communications specialists, entrepreneurs and
Web strategists must listen to, cultivate, and participate in the
continuous dialogue among customers who now learn as much from each
other as from any vendor.

   Addressing the important issue of how marketers can participate in
the surging popularity of social media, Carter points to more than 50
real-world examples that illustrate how they can work within the Web
2.0 landscape to better engage with and support their customers. She
shares her own award-winning work as IBM's vice president, SOA &amp;
WebSphere Marketing, Strategy, and Channels, and includes case studies
from companies that are driving real results with these new strategies
such as Google, Forrester Research, The Coca-Cola Company, and
Harley-Davidson.

   Carter defines the new social media "vessels" that should be top
of mind for most marketers and by the last chapter, readers will have
in hand a complete Marketing 2.0 "Starter Kit" to map to their own
business objectives. Throughout the book, she keeps readers focused on
where Marketing 2.0 fits into the traditional marketing mix, and how
to generate real return on these new investments. The Starter Kit
includes: Blogging; Facebook; Online communities; Podcasting; Really
Simple Syndication (RSS); Serious Gaming; Twitter; Videocasting; Viral
Marketing; Virtual worlds; Widgets; Wikis... and more.

   The book is organized into the essential components of the ANGELS
framework, which is a course of action for marketers to integrate both
Web 2.0 technologies with proven marketing principles. ANGELS stands
for: "A", for "Analyze Here, There, and Everywhere"; "N", for "Nail
the Strategy"; "G" for "Go-to-Market"; "E" for "Energize the Ecosystem
and Market"; "L" for "Leads and Revenue"; and "S", for "Scream Through
Technology".

   The book is thoroughly illustrated with example screenshots and
diagrams, with corresponding online examples for readers to
experience, such as:

   Serious Gaming: IBM designed and launched a 3D game to bridge the
gap in understanding between business leaders and IT teams within an
organization; Check out the game trailer here:

   Twitter: A free social networking and microblogging site that
enables users to post their latest updates (all within 140
characters), Twitter is used by various IBM software groups to reach
and foster a real-time community of brand evangelists and key
influencers, such as: http://twitter.com/smartsoa

   The 3D Internet/Virtual Modeling: In this example, The Sears
Virtual Model Demonstration helps customers visualize themselves in
various apparel in a 3D virtual dressing room; see a demo here:

   Widgets: This IBM software web widget is a dynamic,
mini-application that resides on the desktop and consolidates all the
product's resources and information, including a streaming info feed
with the latest news and continuously updated links. To demo the
widget, link here: http://tinyurl.com/5rbcgs

   Bonus Online Content: Exclusive online chapters and interactive
examples. Coinciding with the book's publication, Carter was
interviewed by MarketingProfs (http://www.marketingprofs.com/)
President Roy Young in a two-part series discussing the current state
of marketing and where it's headed. To view all online content, please

   "My goal is to help readers embrace the vast opportunity brought
on by this technology-driven revolution," Carter said. "We all feel
challenged to stay afloat with the tremendous innovation in
communication, yet those marketers who are hyper-attentive to their
customers will likely discover a new world that is ultimately more
accessible and productive."

&lt;p&gt;  MILPITAS, CA, Nov 12 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Kovair Software, Inc. today announced the release of integration between
Kovair Global Lifecycle Solution and ClearCase Software Configuration
Management System from IBM Rational. The integration uses a ClearCase
adapter developed using Kovair's SOA based Integration Bus Technology --
the Omnibus.

    "The integration with ClearCase, one of the leading Software Configuration
Management Systems, helps the users use two market leading software tools
in their respective categories within a single framework," said Kovair
CTO, Sky Basu. "By virtue of integrating ClearCase using Omnibus, it also
becomes integrated with other existing and future tools in the Kovair
Omnibus Ecosystem without explicitly making point-to-point integration
with those tools."

    The Omnibus Technology helps in establishing event-based integration
between Kovair Global Lifecycle, and IBM/Rational ClearCase. The objective
is to overcome the hurdles in Configuration Management activities, where
Project Managers, Developers, and Testers often grapple with the 'right
version' of the source code Files for a Release.

    "This integration is the most recent addition to our continuing expansion
of best of breed tools integrations with the Kovair Global Lifecycle
Solution for ALM and IT Management," commented Bipin Shah, CEO &amp; Chairman
of Kovair Software.

    The integration has several advantages including helping Developers and
Project Managers trace the exact code that has been written to implement a
specific Requirement, Service Request or a Bug fix. In addition, this
Integration implements code review and verification process in the Kovair
Global Lifecycle framework.

    The integration is available now as an add-on Adapter to Kovair's flagship
product, the Kovair Global Lifecycle.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The head of oil giant Chevron Corp (CVX.N) on Wednesday called on President-elect Barack Obama to create a national energy policy that promotes efficiency, opens up new areas for oil production and sets a clear policy on carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds background, updates share movement) Nov 12 (Reuters) -
Veteran banking analyst Richard Bove cut his price target on
Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) stock by $10 to $70 and said
the company could push its losses into the December stub
quarter as it changes reporting dates. Shares of the company
fell almost 7 percent to $69.61 in morning trade Wednesday on
the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The company could well shock observers by producing a tiny
profit in the fourth quarter as it changes reporting dates from
a November fiscal year to a December year, now that it is a
bank holding company, said the Ladenburg Thalmann analyst, who
has a "sell" rating on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The stub quarter in this case will be the month of
December. Goldman could pile the losses in to this month which
may well disappear when analysts view the company a few years
from now," he wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs became a bank holding company regulated by
the U.S. Federal Reserve in September, along with Morgan
Stanley (MS.N), after Lehman Brothers LEHMQ.PK failed,
Merrill Lynch MER.N agreed to be bought and the financial
markets went into turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The change, effectively killing off the investment banking
model that had dominated Wall Street for more than 20 years,
enabled Goldman and Morgan Stanley to take deposits, gain
easier access to financing and gave them more flexibility to
buy retail banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ANALYSTS SEE LOSS IN Q4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the past two weeks, analysts at Morgan Stanley, Merrill
Lynch, J.P. Morgan Securities, UBS, Fox-Pitt Kelton, Sandler
O'Neill Partners and Barclays Capital have all said they expect
Goldman to post a fourth-quarter loss, which would be its first
ever as a public company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analysts' expectations for a loss range from $2.50 per
share to 40 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Sept. 16, Goldman Sachs posted a 70 percent drop in
quarterly profit, its biggest earnings decline since going
public in 1999, as the worst market slump in decades led to
weaker-than-expected revenue.

&lt;p&gt;New Analysis Suggests That Improvements in Kidney Function in Patients Treated with Lipitor Strongly Correlate with a Reduced Risk of Major Cardiovascular Events

  First Time a Statin's Kidney Benefits Linked to Reduced Cardiovascular Events
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Improvements in kidney function in patients treated with Lipitor(R)
(atorvastatin calcium) were shown to strongly correlate with a reduced risk of
major cardiovascular events in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular
disease, according to a post hoc sub-analysis of the five-year Treating to New
Targets (TNT) study presented today at the Annual Scientific Sessions of the
American Heart Association.

"This is the first time for any statin that an association between improvements
in kidney function and a reduction in cardiovascular events has been shown,"
said Dr. James Shepherd, clinical academic consultant, department of
pathological biochemistry, University of Glasgow Medical School, and lead
investigator of the analysis. "This is important for patients, since studies
have shown that people with high cholesterol have a more rapid decrease in
kidney function over time and that chronic kidney disease is more frequent in
patients with cardiovascular disease."

In this new post hoc analysis, kidney function was assessed using estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), as recommended by the National Kidney
Foundation. Increases in eGFR indicate improved kidney function.

Lipitor has previously been shown to provide dose-dependent increases in eGFR in
heart disease patients. Findings from this new analysis showed that in patients
with heart disease treated with Lipitor, for each 1 mL/min/1.73 m2 increase in
eGFR there was a 2.7 percent relative reduction in risk of major cardiovascular
events. Similar risk reductions per 1 mL/min/1.73 m2 increase in eGFR were
observed for secondary endpoints such as major coronary events, nonfatal heart
attack and fatal or nonfatal stroke.

"This analysis is exciting because it suggests a potential additional benefit of
Lipitor -- improving kidney function while reducing cardiovascular events," said
Dr. Rochelle Chaiken, vice president of Pfizer's cardiovascular and metabolic
medical division.

Throughout the TNT study, both doses of Lipitor (10 and 80 mg) were generally
well-tolerated.

About the TNT Study

The TNT study was an investigator-led trial coordinated by an independent
steering committee and funded by Pfizer. The study enrolled 10,001 men and women
with coronary heart disease aged 35 years to 75 years in 14 countries and
followed them for an average of five years. Primary study results were published
in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2005.

The primary endpoint of the original TNT study was the occurrence of a first
major cardiovascular event, defined as death from heart disease, non-fatal heart
attacks, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or fatal or non-fatal strokes.

Lipitor 80 mg is not a starting dose. Lipitor is not approved in all countries
to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with existing heart
disease.

Important U.S. Prescribing Information

Lipitor is a prescription medication. It is used in patients with multiple risk
factors for heart disease such as family history, high blood pressure, age, low
HDL ("good" cholesterol) or smoking to reduce the risk of a heart attack and
stroke, certain kinds of heart surgery and chest pain. Lipitor is also used in
patients with type 2 diabetes and at least one other risk factor for heart
disease such as high blood pressure, smoking or complications of diabetes,
including eye disease and protein in urine, to reduce the risk of heart attack
and stroke.

Lipitor is used in patients with existing coronary heart disease to reduce the
risk of heart attack, stroke, certain kinds of heart surgery, hospitalization
for heart failure, and chest pain.

When diet and exercise alone are not enough, Lipitor is used along with a
low-fat diet and exercise to lower cholesterol.

Lipitor is not for everyone. It is not for those with liver problems. And it is
not for women who are nursing, pregnant or may become pregnant.

Patients taking Lipitor should tell their doctors if they feel any new muscle
pain or weakness. This could be a sign of rare but serious muscle side effects.
Patients should tell their doctors about all medications they take. This may
help avoid serious drug interactions. Doctors should do blood tests to check
liver function before and during treatment and may adjust the dose. The most
common side effects are gas, constipation, stomach pain and heartburn. They tend
to be mild and often go away.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is moving closer to an agreement with Verizon Wireless to become the default search provider on the wireless carrier's cell phones, the Wall Street Journal said, citing people familiar with the discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the terms being considered, Microsoft would share with Verizon revenue from ads shown in response to cell phone Web searches, with guaranteed payments to the carrier of about $550 million to $650 million over five years, roughly twice what Google Inc offered, the people told the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, Microsoft is negotiating a deal to put its Windows Mobile software in more Verizon devices although it isn't clear if Microsoft is offering to pay Verizon to use Windows Mobile or would allow Verizon to use the software for free, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combined value of the two deals could top $1 billion, the people told the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verizon Wireless, a joint venture between Verizon Communications Inc and Vodafone Group Plc, is tilting toward Microsoft because the software giant is offering significantly better financial incentives, the paper said citing the people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Verizon is still in discussions with Google and the situation is fluid with both companies, the people told the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials from Microsoft, Google and Verizon were not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ajay Kamalakaran in Bangalore; Editing by Kazunori Takada)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C2C Email Management Strength Now Available for Microsoft
                            SharePoint Data
SPRINGFIELD, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
C2C, a leading provider of data, file and email management
solutions, today announced that it has extended the benefits of its
Archive One for SharePoint. The latest version provides a connector
that runs in parallel with the other recently announced connectors of
Notes/Domino and Microsoft Windows File Systems.

   Archive One for SharePoint offers customers the benefits of
removing and archiving SharePoint data to reduce cost, improve
performance, optimize capacity usage, and improve backup windows on
primary storage devices. The new Archive One edition can be installed
as another application connector alongside email and file archiving
solutions provided by C2C. The data can all be stored in a single
repository, or be separated by recognition of the data type, or
organizing data by logical departmental units (such as finance or
human resources) each with its own repository regardless of the type
of data.

   The latest version of Archive One for SharePoint incorporates
enhanced information retention management features to enable customers
to apply consistent data management across their organization. It can
be used to put items on hold, apply tags (notes) to them, and cross
reference many litigation issues, which, in today's litigious age,
enables legal or compliance officers to manage the vast amount of data
held in conjunction with cases.

   "This release fully demonstrates the innovation, flexibility and
strength behind our design of Archive One, since it incorporates
multiple application platforms in a single architectural solution,"
said Dave Hunt, CEO at C2C. "Effective records management requires
that the same consistent level of policy enforcement and retention
management be applied to email messages, documents, and collaboration
data so that it remains accessible and auditable throughout the
lifetime of the data."

   Archive One for SharePoint provides flexible automated data
management, building on C2C's foundation of data searching and
intelligent actions to carry out mass actions across different types
of data to assist in compliance, legal discovery and storage capacity
management. Administrators do not need to archive data before applying
a command, such as copy, move, delete, classify, compress, archive, or
un-archive and Archive One is capable of data processing speeds of one
million messages per hour.

   "Our research suggests that companies 'think' they are archiving
SharePoint data with traditional backup applications, and that just
will not cut it with today's records management, electronic discovery,
compliance and storage management challenges," commented Brian
Babineau, Senior Analyst with Enterprise Strategy Group. "C2C can be
counted on to leverage their expertise, and the highly extensible
architecture of the Archive One product suite, to help address these
issues for SharePoint environments. More importantly, C2C delivers
archiving and management across all enterprise data types including
files, e-mails and now SharePoint allows companies to build a system
of record that can be used for compliance and discovery purposes and
helps control storage costs. These benefits will be welcomed in
today's difficult economic climate."

   About C2C

   C2C offers unsurpassed automated data management solutions, which
reduce risk, optimize performance and minimize compliance issues for
over three million users at more than 2,000 organizations worldwide.
Based on its in-depth understanding of message management, C2C

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Teams Up with Verizon to Bring Mobile Magic to U.S. Parks

   Companies Align to Bring Unprecedented New Experiences to Guests
  at Disneyland Resort, Walt Disney World Resort...and Right on Their
                        Verizon Wireless Phones
BURBANK, Calif. &amp; BASKING RIDGE, N.J.--(Business Wire)--
Marking a first in both the travel and mobile industries, Walt
Disney Parks and Resorts and Verizon are teaming up for a multi-year
relationship designed to enhance the guest experience - before, during
and after guests arrive at Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland
Resort. This alignment allows guests to have a personal tour guide
right in their wireless phones along with reliable new services at the
parks. Early next year guests will also use Verizon Wireless'
technology when experiencing Disney's Kim Possible World Showcase
Adventure, an ultra-interactive attraction coming to Epcot in Walt
Disney World Resort.

   "With more than 90 percent of families bringing a mobile phone
into our Parks, our objective was to enhance the magical Disney
experience through innovative wireless technology," said Jay Rasulo,
Chairman, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. "Imagine receiving up to the
minute tips on special Park activities with just the touch of a button
or receiving a call from Buzz Lightyear welcoming you to the Magic
Kingdom."

   Beginning next year, guests will be able to access an array of
features on their Verizon Wireless phones while at the Walt Disney
World or Disneyland Resort to help them make the most of their Disney
experiences. Planned services include an exclusive mobile application
that will give guests with Verizon Wireless service the ability to
easily locate shows, restaurants and the Disney characters anywhere
inside the Parks; get real-time attraction availability information;
access mobile games; receive messages from characters and more.
Verizon Wireless is also continuing to invest in its wireless network
from coast to coast, and the relationship with Disney means the
wireless users will benefit from further enhancements to the Verizon
Wireless network in the Parks.

   John Harrobin, senior vice president of digital media and
marketing for Verizon, said, "All of our efforts focus on one goal:
making the Disney experience even better for our customers. There are
few life experiences that are more memorable than visiting a Disney
Park, and now guests with Verizon Wireless service will unlock even
more magic from their visit - by navigating the Parks easier and
faster with instant access to key information such as 'Where's Mickey
now?' and other special features - even when they travel home and
share their experiences with family and friends."

   In addition, guests visiting Epcot in Walt Disney World Resort in
early 2009 will be among the first to experience Disney's Kim Possible
World Showcase Adventure. An ultra-interactive attraction, Kim
Possible World Showcase Adventure invites guests of all ages to team
up with members of Team Possible to save the world from various
comical villains and their mad inventions. Armed with an official
Verizon Wireless "Kimmunicator," guests will use these handheld
devices to help maneuver through the mission. The interactive wireless
theme park game was inspired by Disney Channel's Emmy(R) Award-winning
animated series, "Kim Possible."

   While Verizon Wireless customers will have exclusive access to an
array of enhanced features, Disney and Verizon are also working to
ensure that some mobile information such as dining locations, show
times and locations will be available to all Parks visitors,
regardless of their wireless company.

   Additional details will be available next year as the companies
expect to add a suite of services and functionalities to help guests
at Disney Parks have the most magical experience. For more information
about Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, visit www.disney.com. For more
information about Verizon, visit www.verizon.com.

   Disney Parks and Resorts - Taking Guests to New Frontiers

   The agreement between Disney and Verizon is another step in a
series of new initiatives that highlight the latest technologies from
Disney Parks and Resorts with a continued focus on improving guest
experience and providing immersive entertainment. Disney Parks and
Resorts continue to exemplify how technologies can be used to
build new connections and redefine how guests plan and enjoy their
vacations. From the time guests begin planning their vacation using
Walt Disney World Resort in 3D on Google Earth or tuning into Disney
Travel on Demand, the experience is designed to make their lives
easier. Guests can take their vacation experience to a new level with
Kim Possible World Showcase Adventure, an interactive wireless theme
park game for families, and by personalizing and sharing their Disney
experiences when they return home, using DisneyLink, a desktop
application.

   About Walt Disney Parks and Resorts

comes to life. This segment of The Walt Disney Company encompasses 11

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY and HUNTSVILLE, AL, Nov 12 (MARKET WIRE) --

IBM (NYSE: IBM) and International Broadband Electric Communications, Inc.
(IBEC) today announced the signing of a $9.6 million agreement to have
IBM install Broadband over Power Line (BPL) networks at electric
cooperatives throughout the eastern US. IBEC will focus on providing
broadband services to underserved residents in rural America.

    Currently, there are over 900 electric cooperatives in the United States
providing 45% of the total electric grid and covering 75% of the land mass
in the U.S. BPL leverages an existing asset, the power lines, to quickly
and inexpensively deploy broadband access. IBM, the first major systems
integrator to enter this market, will provide overall project management,
oversight, and training of the line crews who will be installing the BPL
equipment. IBEC, the leader in bringing broadband to rural America, will
provide the BPL technology and equipment and serve as the Internet Service
Provider (ISP) to these rural residents.

    "Americans in rural areas of the country trail their urban and suburban
counterparts in broadband availability," noted Scott Lee, CEO of IBEC, in
making this announcement. "This capability will play a critical role in
rural health, education, and economic development, while closing the
digital divide that exists between well served and underserved America."

    "This partnership leverages the deep communications and project management
expertise of IBM with the market presence and position of IBEC in the
rural electric cooperatives to accelerate the deployment of broadband
services in these underserved areas," said Raymond Blair, Director of
Advanced Networks at IBM. "High-speed Internet service is revolutionizing
the way we do business, and access to this resource will generate great
opportunities for rural America."

    Bill Moroney, President &amp; CEO of the Utilities Telecom Council (UTC),
noted, "This announcement represents a major step forward in bringing
broadband services to the residents of rural America. This is a key
development in the growth and availability of high-speed Broadband over
Power Line Internet services and widespread availability of critical
SmartGrid applications in the United States, and I applaud IBEC and IBM
for their accomplishments in this area." The UTC is an international
organization representing the critical infrastructure communications needs
of investor-owned (IOU), municipal, and cooperative (Co-op) electric, gas,
and water utilities worldwide.

    While focusing initially on bringing broadband Internet services to rural
America, this new service will also enhance the ability of electric
utilities to monitor, manage, and control the reliability of their
electric grid and further optimize the capabilities of IBEC as well as
rural electric utilities in broadening the offerings available to
consumers. The deal is the first of its kind to deploy BPL technology in
the electric cooperatives.

    About IBEC

    IBEC, Inc. is a full-service provider of Broadband over Power Line
Internet access solutions and services, electric utility SmartGrid
management and control solutions, and powerline-based security systems.

&lt;p&gt;LogRhythm and PowerTech Present Free Webinar on IBM System i Log Management for Financial Institutions

   Experts to Discuss Technical Challenges and Present Use Cases on
    Integrating Security Data into Log and Event Management Systems
--(Business Wire)--
LogRhythm and PowerTech:

   WHO: John Earl, Chief Technical Officer and Vice President,
PowerTech Group. Mr. Earl has over 25 years experience with IBM
midrange systems and security. He is a security subject matter expert
for the IBM System i user group COMMON.

   Chris Petersen, founder and CTO, LogRhythm. Mr. Petersen is a
security, compliance, and risk management expert. He has held senior
consulting and management positions with PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Ernst
&amp; Young, and Counterpane Internet Security.

   WHAT: Many organizations, especially financial institutions, rely
on the IBM System i (AS/400) to run their core business applications.
Although System i generates comprehensive logs and security data, the
sheer volume and cryptic structure of this information makes it very
difficult to use and report on. This webinar will explain how to
integrate and make these logs useful for security and compliance
management within an enterprise Security Information Event Management
(SEIM) platform.

   Discussing real-world financial institution use cases, this
webinar will demonstrate how integrating System i logs with a SIEM
system enables organizations to:

   --  Comply with regulations (i.e., GLBA, SOX, PCI, etc.)

   --  Secure networks, systems, and data

   --  Increase the efficiency and effectiveness of IT audit and
        security operations

   WHERE: Webinar delivered to your desktop.

   WHEN: This one hour webinar will be presented twice on November
12, 2008, at 10:30 AM Eastern Time and 1:30 PM Eastern Time.

&lt;p&gt;Nov 12 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is moving closer
to an agreement with Verizon Wireless to become the default
search provider on the wireless carrier's cellphones, the Wall
Street Journal said, citing people familiar with the
discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Under the terms being considered, Microsoft would share
with Verizon revenue from ads shown in response to cellphone
Web searches, with guaranteed payments to the carrier of about
$550 million to $650 million over five years, roughly twice
what Google Inc (GOOG.O) offered, the people told the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, Microsoft is negotiating a deal to put its
Windows Mobile software in more Verizon devices although it
isn't clear if Microsoft is offering to pay Verizon to use
Windows Mobile or would allow Verizon to use the software for
free, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The combined value of the two deals could top $1 billion,
the people told the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Verizon Wireless, a joint venture between Verizon
Communications Inc (VZ.N) and Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L), is
tilting toward Microsoft because the software giant is offering
significantly better financial incentives, the paper said
citing the people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Verizon is still in discussions with Google and the
situation is fluid with both companies, the people told the
paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Officials from Microsoft, Google and Verizon were not
immediately available for comment.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has downgraded the following classes of J.P. Morgan
Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp., series 2006-FL2 and has
assigned Rating Outlooks as follows:

   --$24.4 million class J to 'BBB-' from 'BBB'; Outlook Negative;

   --$22 million class K to 'BB+' from 'BBB-'; Outlook Negative;

   --$29.3 million class L to 'BB' from 'BBB-' and removed from
Rating Watch Negative; Outlook Negative.

   In addition, Fitch has affirmed and assigned Rating Outlooks to
the following classes:

   --$306.2 million class A-1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;

   --$298.2 million class A-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;

   --Interest-only class X-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;

   --$33 million class B at 'AA+'; Outlook Stable;

   --$28.1 million class C at 'AA'; Outlook Stable;

   --$19.5 million class D at 'AA-'; Outlook Stable;

   --$22 million class E at 'A+'; Outlook Stable;

   --$22 million class F at 'A'; Outlook Stable;

   --$19.5 million class G at 'A-'; Outlook Stable;

   --$24.4 million class H at 'BBB+'; Outlook Stable;

   --$7.4 million class LV-1 at 'BB+'; Outlook Stable;

   --$2.6 million class LV-2 at 'BB'; Outlook Stable.

   Interest-only class X-1 has paid in full.

   The downgrades are primarily due to the failure of the Marina
Village loan (13.4%) to stabilize, which has been exhibited by a
decline in Fitch-stressed net cash flow of approximately 46% since
issuance. The Negative Outlook assignments indicate the likely
direction of any rating changes over the next one to two years.
Negative Outlooks reflect loans that are behind on their stabilization
plans, including cases in which deteriorating economic conditions may
make execution of the original business plans less feasible. Class L
had previously been placed on Rating Watch Negative due to the
anticipated maturity default of the SOMA Portfolio loan (1.9%). The
loan repaid in full subsequent to the October remittance date.

   The Marina Village loan originally consisted of 34 low- to
mid-rise office properties located within a master-planned development
in Alameda, CA. Since issuance, two of the 34 properties have been
released, the more recent of which was approximately 97% occupied.
Year-end 2007 reported occupancy stood at 76%, compared to the 79.6%
of the space leased at issuance. Recent servicer-provided rent rolls
indicate that occupancy has continued to decline. A portion of the
$23.5 million B-2 note future funding facility remains available for
leasing costs and capital expenditures. However, the Alameda submarket
remains challenging, with an average vacancy rate of approximately
30%. Fitch expects that leasing conditions for suburban office space
in the submarket will continue to deteriorate, and that meeting the
85% leasing target anticipated at issuance will prove exceedingly
challenging. Re-evaluation of the net cash flow based on mid-year rent
rolls yields a Fitch-stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) on
the A note trust balance of 0.80 times (x), compared to 1.39x at
issuance. The loan is in its first of three extension options, with
its first extended maturity date on Feb. 9, 2009.

   Another Fitch Loan of Concern is the 1111 Marcus Avenue loan
(9.3%). The collateral is a suburban office property in New Hyde Park,
NY. Occupancy at the property has increased slightly since issuance,
to 84.1% as of Dec. 31, 2007 from 80%. However, actual
servicer-reported expenses for 2007 were higher than anticipated at
issuance, resulting in a current Fitch stressed DSCR of 1.06x on the
trust balance, compared to 1.40x at issuance. Fitch will continue to
monitor property operating statements to determine if the higher than
expected level of expenses will recur. If cash flow does not improve,
future rating actions are possible.

   The remaining loans are stabilizing as expected and have
experienced no additional paydown since the last review. As of the
October 2008 remittance date, the transaction's principal balance has
decreased by 42.8% to $858.7 million, from $1.5 billion at issuance.
Following the repayment of the SOMA Portfolio loan, nine of the
original 16 loans will remain. With the exception of the Marina
Village loan, all of the senior interests of the first mortgage loans
in the trust maintain investment-grade shadow ratings.

   The RREEF Silicon Valley Office Portfolio (16.8%) is the largest
loan in the transaction. It is secured by a portfolio of 119 office
and industrial properties located throughout four submarkets of
Silicon Valley, CA. Occupancy across the portfolio has increased
slightly since issuance, to 77% as of Dec. 31, 2007 from 71.4%. The
loan had a Fitch stressed DSCR of 1.46x on the trust balance A-3 note,
compared to 1.30x at issuance. The loan matured on Nov. 9, 2008 and
exercised the first of its three one-year extension options.

   The second largest loan is secured by 697,151 square feet (sf) of
in-line and leased fee space corresponding to the Lehigh Valley Mall
(16.3%), a regional mall located in Whitehall, PA, which at issuance
comprised 1,049,504 sf of total space. In October 2007, a lifestyle
center opened at the property, which consists of approximately 120,000
sf of additional space. The loan has experienced stable performance
since issuance. The loan is within the second of three one-year
extension options, and has an extended maturity date of Aug. 9, 2009.

   The Doubletree Metropolitan collateralizes the third largest loan.
Located in Midtown Manhattan, the property is a 755-room full-service
hotel built in 1961 and renovated in 2005. Performance has improved
since issuance, with year-end 2007 occupancy rising to 95.3% from
94.4% at issuance, and the Fitch stressed DSCR on the whole loan
increasing to 2.56x from 2.17x at issuance. The loan is within its
first of three one-year extension options, with an extended maturity
date of May 9, 2009.

   All but one of the loans (9.3%) have matured to date. However,
every loan within the pool has one or more one-year extension options
remaining.

   The transaction has a modified pro rata pay structure whereby 80%
of principal is paid to classes A-1 and A-2, and the remaining 20% is
paid to the other classes pro rata. The transaction switches to
sequential pay in the event of default or when the transaction has
been reduced by 80% from issuance.

are available on the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings affirms J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage

certificates as follows:

   Fitch does not rate the $21.7 million class NR.

   The rating affirmations reflect the transaction's stable
performance and minimal paydown since issuance. Rating Outlooks
reflect the likely direction of any rating changes over the next one
to two years, and the Negative Outlooks are due to increased Fitch
loans of concern (9.3%). As of the October 2008 distribution date, the
pool has paid down 4.2% to $1.45 billion from $1.51 billion at
issuance. There are 4.4% non-defeased loans maturing in 2009 and 4.3%
in 2010, and the weighted-average coupons are 4.92% and 5.24%,
respectively.

   Three loans (1.8%) are currently in special servicing and losses
are expected. The largest specially serviced loan (1.5%) is secured by
a multifamily property located in San Antonio, TX and is currently 90
days delinquent. The borrower MBS Co. filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in
December 2007. The property suffered from significant deferred
maintenance issues. A plan of reorganization has been filed that
contemplates the sale of the property subject to an assumption of the
loan. The special servicer has worked with the receiver/property
manager to address the deferred maintenance issues which are now
completed. The property currently is approximately 90% leased.

   The second specially serviced loan (0.3%) is secured by a
multifamily property located in Fort Worth, TX and is currently real
estate owned (REO). This is also an MBS Co. loan. The special servicer
obtained title to property in April 2008. The property suffered from
extensive deferred maintenance. The special servicer continues to
address the deferred maintenance issues. The property is currently 35%
occupied.

   The other specially serviced loan (0.1%) is secured by a retail
property located in Reeds, AL and is currently 60 days delinquent. The
grocery anchor at the center vacated in the summer of 2008. The
property is currently 21% occupied. The borrower continues his efforts
to lease or sell the property.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - At least two analysts on Thursday projected that JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) would suffer write-downs in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion for the fourth quarter and cut their profit outlook for the bank. Analysts at Citigroup and Fox-Pitt Kelton said they cut fourth-quarter estimates to reflect the recent company outlook of higher-than-expected loan loss reserve additions, likely writedowns as well as private equity losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said losses across the bank's mortgage and credit card portfolios were rising. Dimon also said JPMorgan will add to reserves in the fourth quarter due to rising losses in its subprime mortgage and home-equity loan portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The way things are going in the economy, we are now assuming the large reserve-build phase will continue through the first half of 2009," Fox-Pitt's David Trone said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He raised his 2009 reserve build forecast to $4.5 billion from $1.7 billion for the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which bought Seattle-based thrift Washington Mutual's banking units in September, is highly exposed to consumer credit, and both Trone and Citigroup's Keith Horowitz voiced concerns about the bank's heavy exposure to all areas of consumer credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The near to intermediate-term outlook remains challenged in light of higher credit costs in credit card and in the retail bank, as well as our belief that we are entering a period of sustained lower revenues from JPMorgan's capital markets business," Horowitz warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horowitz cut his earnings estimates for JPMorgan by $0.38 a share to $0.10 for the fourth quarter, and lowered 2009 outlook to $2.55 a share from $2.70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also cut his price target on the stock to $40 from $45, but still rates the stock "hold."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox-Pitt's Trone cut his earnings outlook for the fourth quarter to $0.25 a share from $0.65, and for 2009 to $2.90 a share from $3.35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trone, however, maintained his "outperform" rating on the stock, and said he views JPMorgan as an outperformer for "...those that want/need to have exposure in financials" because of the bank's strong capital buffer as well as its fire-sale acquisitions of Bear Stearns and WaMu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trone has a price target of $56 on the stock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of JPMorgan were up more than 1 percent at $34.96 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tenzin Pema in Bangalore; Editing by Jarshad Kakkrakandy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Chemical's Vistamaxx Specialty Elastomers and Resins Achieve FDA and EU-Directive Compliance

HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Chemical's Vistamaxx(TM) specialty elastomers and
resins targeted at flexible and rigid food packaging applications have
received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
under the Food Contact Notification process. These grades, used in
compounding and films, are also compliant with the compositional
requirements of the EU-Directive 2002/72/EC for use in contact with
food.

   Based on ExxonMobil Chemical's proprietary Exxpol(TM) metallocene
technology, Vistamaxx specialty elastomers and resins offer a unique
combination of sealability, adhesion, elasticity, flexibility, clarity
and toughness. They also exhibit excellent compatibility with both
polyethylene and polypropylene and are used as blend partners.

   Food packaging applications can benefit from Vistamaxx resins'
outstanding film sealing performance stemming from broad
compatibility, very low seal initiation temperature and high hot-tack.
Typical applications for Vistamaxx specialty elastomers include food
containers, kitchen tools and utensils, and toys. As Vistamaxx
polymers improve flexibility and impact resistance without affecting
tensile strength, they can help prevent cracking in these types of
applications.

   "ExxonMobil Chemical has responded to the needs of customers who
are either looking to add flexibility and strength to their food
contact products or improve food packaging seals. Compliance to FDA
regulations and the European Plastics Directive are important steps
forward, opening up new global market opportunities," said William
Ramsey, Vistamaxx global market development manager, ExxonMobil
Chemical.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings downgrades and assigns Outlooks to J.P. Morgan Chase
Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp., pass-through certificates,
series 2007-FL1 as follows:

   --$38.4 million class J to 'BBB-' from 'BBB'; Outlook Negative;

   --$34.5 million class K to 'BB+' from 'BBB-'; Outlook Negative;

   --$38.4 million class L to 'BB-'from 'BBB-'; Outlook Negative;

   --$11.9 million class RS-1 to 'BB-'from 'BB+'; Outlook Negative;

   --$12.8 million class RS-2 to 'B+' from 'BB'; Outlook Negative;

   --$15.6 million class RS-3 to 'B' from 'BB-'; Outlook Negative;

   --$11.1 million class RS-4 to 'B-'from 'B+'; Outlook Negative;

   --$15.4 million class RS-5 to 'B-'from 'B'; Outlook Negative;

   In addition, Fitch affirms and assigns Rating Outlooks to the
following classes:

   --$873.6 million class A-1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;

   --$243.1 million class A-2 at 'AAA' Outlook Stable;

   --Interest-only class X-1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;

   --Interest-only class X-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;

   --$53.7 million class B at 'AA+'; Outlook Stable;

   --$38.4 million class C at 'AA'; Outlook Stable;

   --$36.4 million class D at 'AA-' Outlook Stable;

   --$44.1 million class E at 'A+', Outlook Negative;

   --$30.7 million class F at 'A'; Outlook Negative;

   --$30.7 million class G at 'A-; Outlook Negative;

   --$42.2 million class H at 'BBB+'; Outlook Negative;

   --$13.2 million class RS-6 at 'B-'; Outlook Negative;

   --$7.6 million class RS-7 at 'B-'; Outlook Negative.

   The downgrades reflect the deteriorating performance of the
Resorts International Portfolios well as four loans collateralized by
hotels. The downgrades to rake classes RS-1 through RS-5 are due to
the performance of the Resorts International Portfolio. The downgrades
to classes J, K and L are due to the performance of the Resorts
International Portfolio as well as the performance of four other hotel
loans.

   Classes E through L, and Rake classes RS1-RS7, have been assigned
Negative Outlooks based upon anticipated future decline in sector
performance, the deteriorating economic environment and the overall
exposure to the hotel sector (63% of the senior trust component). The
Rating Outlooks reflect the likely direction of rating changes over
the next one to two years.

   Fitch has identified five loans of concern, including Resorts
International Portfolio, PHOV Portfolio, Marriott Waikiki, Sofitel
Chicago and Sofitel Minneapolis (38.4% of the senior trust balance).
These loans are in sectors more dependant upon discretionary consumer
spending, and whose performance is below expectations at issuance or
severely lagging their competitive set. These five loans no longer
maintain their investment-grade shadow ratings. The downgrades address
the decline in performance and the expectation that issuance net cash
flow (NCF) will not be attained.

   The second- largest loan is secured by the Marriott Waikiki
(12.9%), a full-service hotel located along Kalakaua Avenue, across
from Waikiki Beach in Honolulu, HI. The property began a $28 million
renovation in January 2008 that is expected to be completed by the end
of 2008. The sponsor, Whitehall, has provided a renovation guaranty.
As of September 2008, the trailing 12-month occupancy, average daily
rate (ADR) and revenue per available room (RevPAR) were 79.5%, $191
and $152, respectively. The loan matures on May 9, 2009, and has three
one-year extension options. The ratings and Outlook reflect the
potential for further decline in performance given the expected
stresses to the property sector and location.

   The third -largest loan is secured by the PHOV Portfolio (11.4%),
a portfolio of 11 full-service hotels located Florida, Louisiana,
South Carolina, Illinois and New Jersey. Four of the hotels were
affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma in 2006-2007, with the hotels
coming back on line in late 2006 and mid-2007. The portfolio's June
30, 2008 operating statement reflects a negative debt-service coverage
ratio (DSCR) of 0.46 times (x). As of June 2008, the occupancy, ADR
and RevPAR were approximately 61.4%, $115 and $71, respectively, and
have further declined from the last Fitch rating action. The ratings
and Outlook reflect that expectations at issuance are not realistic
given the expected stresses to the sector and current economic
outlook.

   Resorts International, the fourth-largest loan, consists of a
$120.2 million senior trust component and $87.7 million in subordinate
rake (RS) classes. The loan is secured by one casino/hotel property
located in Atlantic City, NJ and two casino/hotel properties located
in Tunica, MS. The total debt on the portfolio, including the trust
portion, totals $506.3 million. In September 2007, the Resorts East
Chicago property was released from the portfolio, paying down the
senior trust component by approximately 47%. The loan recently was
extended and matures on Nov. 9, 2009, with two one-year extension
options remaining.

   As of Jan. 30, 2008, the Resorts International portfolio's
servicer reported annualized NCF declined approximately 36% from
year-end 2007 reported servicer NCF, driven by the negative
performance of the AC Hilton. The decrease in cash flow is attributed
to multiple factors: increased competition, a smoking ban introduced
throughout the entire Atlantic City gaming market, and the overall
negative performance of the gaming industry due to general
macro-economic conditions throughout the U.S. For the first six months
ended June 30, 2008, the Atlantic City gaming market recorded a 17.1%
decrease in gross operating profit from the same period in 2007. In
October 2008, the Atlantic City City Council voted to extend the
current smoking ban until October of 2009, continuing to allow smoking
on 25% of the gaming square footage.

   The affirmations are due to expected performance and continued
stabilization of the remaining loans since issuance. As of the October
2008 remittance report, the transaction has paid down by approximately
12.3% (including the subordinate rake classes). All of the original 22
loans remain in the trust. In addition to the Resorts International
loan, the PHOV Portfolio (11.3%) has exercised a partial release, and
as a result has paid down by 17.6%. There are no specially serviced
loans, and all loans are current. Fitch reviewed the most recent
servicer provided operating statement analysis reports for all of the
loans. Seventeen of the senior pooled notes that remain in the
transaction maintain investment grade shadow ratings.

   The transaction consists of loans collateralized by hotel
properties (72.1%), retail (19.6%), office (5.6%) multifamily (1.6%)
and industrial/warehouse (1.1%).

   The largest loan is secured by the Walden Galleria (15.4% of the
senior trust components), a mall located in Buffalo, NY. The property
completed the addition of the 300,000 square foot (sf) ThEATery in the
fall of 2007, adding national retailers such as Barnes &amp; Noble, Urban
Outfitters and the Cheesecake Factory. As of Oct. 1, 2008, the mall
was approximately 91% occupied. The sponsor is Pyramid. The loan
matures on May 9, 2009 and has three one-year extension options.

&lt;p&gt;DETROIT (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs suspended its rating on General Motors Corp on Thursday and said the automaker needs at least $22 billion in federal aid to survive a deepening industry downturn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bush administration said the government could quickly disburse $25 billion loans already approved by Congress, but responded coolly to an aid plan being shaped by Democrats, which includes using part of the $700 billion financial rescue package to provide additional liquidity for the struggling auto industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs forecast the No. 1 U.S. automaker will end 2008 with $12.5 billion in cash, within the $11 billion to $14 billion minimum range GM has said it needs to operate, requiring GM to look toward the government for aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM's shares, which hit a 65-year low this week, slipped 16 cents or 5.2 percent to $2.92, as the market awaited details on whether the U.S. government would push forward with a rescue plan for the auto industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said a new program to support the auto industry is most likely, though the timing was uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also on Thursday, JPMorgan cut its GM rating to "neutral" from "overweight" and said the automaker needs "something immediately" to make it through the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which also slashed its target price for GM stock to $1.84 from $3.08, said a government bailout could easily reach $30 billion unless GM reforms its vast liability structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The warnings are the latest in a series of gloomy forecasts from Wall Street banks in the wake of GM's deeper-than-expected third-quarter loss and cash burn announced on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have warned that any government assistance, which they believe is a must for GM to survive through early 2009, would come at a significant cost to existing shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. lawmakers have said in recent days they might support efforts to aid the struggling industry over and above $25 billion of low-interest loans previously approved to support capital investment to meet new fuel economy mandates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers will hold a hearing next week to consider a bill to provide another $25 billion in federal loans to U.S. auto manufacturers, possibly using part of the $700 billion financial market rescue law enacted last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the White House said on Thursday it was not the intent of Congress to use the financial rescue package to help ailing U.S. automakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez told Reuters in an interview that opening the financial bailout fund to one industry is "not a good idea."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM, Ford Motor Co and Chrysler are all burning through cash amid a global credit crunch that has accelerated the decline in U.S. auto sales and placed severe limits on corporate and consumer borrowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM ended September with $16.2 billion in cash, down from $21 billion at the end of the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Standard  Poor's lowered credit ratings on two North American auto parts suppliers and placed the ratings on 14 other suppliers on negative watch, citing their exposure to the three U.S. automakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The credit watch listings reflect the increasingly beleaguered state of the Michigan-based automakers and the multiple scenarios -- almost all of them negative -- that could play out over the next few weeks or months," SP said in a report released on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency lowered credit ratings on Dana Holding Corp to B+ from BB- and Magna International Inc to A- from A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Maureen Bavdek and Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comment, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 13 (Reuters) - The inability to earn at par with
dividend levels, and regulatory pressure will force more U.S.
mid-sized banks to further slash their dividend, J.P. Morgan
Securities analyst Steven Alexopoulos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. lawmakers had urged Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson
on Wednesday to clarify that the government bailout funds
should not be used to acquire healthy banks or pay out
dividends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks should not maintain a level of cash dividends
inconsistent with the firm's capital position that could weaken
the firm's financial health, or that could impair its ability
to meet the needs of credit-worthy borrowers, regulators said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Alexopoulos said Marshall  Ilsley Corp MI.N, TCF
Financial Corp (TCB.N), BBT Corp (BBT.N), Synovus Financial
Corp (SNV.N) and MT Bank Corp (MTB.N) are most likely to be
forced by regulators to cut their dividend, although each of
them have said they do not need to take such a step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst sees least risk of a dividend cut at City
National Bank (CYN.N), PrivateBancorp Inc (PVTB.O), People's
United Financial Inc (PBCT.O) and Zions Bancorp (ZION.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. banks like Colonial BancGroup Inc CNB.N, Columbia
Bancorp CBBO.O and Cascade Financial Corp CASB.O have been
slashing or suspending their dividend in the past months amid a
difficult credit market and declining capital levels, as
shareholder equity continues to fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So far the Treasury Department has injected $115 billion
into the eight largest banks, such as Goldman Sachs (GS.N), in
a bid to mend broken credit markets and restore health to the
financial system. The government has earmarked a total of $250
billion for banks, including money for smaller, regional ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The $60 billion remaining under the U.S. government's
Troubled Assets Relief program (TARP) is likely to be used in
capital infusion, although asset purchases as originally
planned cannot be ruled out, analyst Alexopoulos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Bush administration on Wednesday largely abandoned its
plan to buy up toxic mortgage assets and said it will focus its
$700 billion financial bailout fund on making direct
investments in financial institutions and shoring up consumer
credit markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Treasury Department initially promoted the
financial rescue package approved by Congress last month as a
vehicle to buy illiquid mortgage assets from banks and other
institutions to spur fresh lending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A weak economic environment through the year-end will put
pressure on valuations of the banks, Alexopoulos said. "The
economy is in a recession with the question now, in our view,
being how deep and for how long."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People's United and PrivateBancorp are well-positioned to
gain from a negative impact on their competitors amid an
economic slowdown, the analyst said.

&lt;p&gt;Backhaul Challenges for US Mobile Operators Throughout Network, New Visant Strategies Study Finds

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Wireless carriers in the United States are now facing burgeoning
backhaul needs that extend beyond base stations and into
middle-of-the-network elements, a new Visant Strategies study finds.

   "As carriers deploy HSPA, WIMAX and EV-DO Rev A and B technologies
they are increasing the capacity of backhaul to these base stations by
two to three times," said study author Andy Fuertes. "Base stations
employing 18 Mbps or more of backhaul capacity will grow from 10% in
2008 to over 50% in 2014. LTE, expected in 2012, could push the needed
backhaul capacity beyond 50 Mbps further down the road."

   Such backhaul capacity is growing beyond traditional leased line
backhaul solutions, according to, "US Mobil Backhaul: Continued
Expansion 2009 and the Needs of the Middle Network." Wireless
technology will be used by 40% of base stations for backhaul in 2014,
doubling from 2008, the study finds, while traditional microwave
technology can address individual base stations and most towers
through 2014.

   "Aggregation of base station traffic to middle-of-the-network
elements such as the base station controller (BSC) or the radio
network controller (RNC), depending on the technology, is creating
backhaul traffic beginning to exceed the limits of traditional
backhaul technology," said study co-author Larry Swasey.

   Many future connections between base stations and the BSC/RNC will
require fiber, the study states, although it is often unavailable in
the needed area or too costly for carriers. "Carriers are now looking
at high frequency millimeter wave technology in the 80 GHz band and
other solutions," Swasey added.

   Backhaul capacity increases will push backhaul costs up seven
percent annually through 2014, the report states.

   In the report backhaul links through 2014 by capacity, delivery
platform and technology, Ethernet vs. TDM/mixed, are given. Base
station deployments by 2/2.5G, 3G and 3.5/4G, mobile and 3.5/4G
subscribers, data and voice ARPU, capital expenditures, operating
expenses and backhaul expenses are provided through 2014. Towers in
service are quantified and segmented by total backhaul capacity per
tower through 2014 as are deployed MSCs, BSC and RNCs.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analysts' comments, updates share price move)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 13 (Reuters) - At least two analysts on Thursday
projected that JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) would suffer
write-downs in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion for
the fourth quarter and cut their profit outlook for the bank.
Analysts at Citigroup and Fox-Pitt Kelton said they cut
fourth-quarter estimates to reflect the recent company outlook
of higher-than-expected loan loss reserve additions, likely
writedowns as well as private equity losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said
losses across the bank's mortgage and credit card portfolios
were rising. Dimon also said JPMorgan will add to reserves in
the fourth quarter due to rising losses in its subprime
mortgage and home-equity loan portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The way things are going in the economy, we are now
assuming the large reserve-build phase will continue through
the first half of 2009," Fox-Pitt's David Trone said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He raised his 2009 reserve build forecast to $4.5 billion
from $1.7 billion for the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, which bought Seattle-based thrift Washington
Mutual's banking units in September, is highly exposed to
consumer credit, and both Trone and Citigroup's Keith Horowitz
voiced concerns about the bank's heavy exposure to all areas of
consumer credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The near to intermediate-term outlook remains challenged
in light of higher credit costs in credit card and in the
retail bank, as well as our belief that we are entering a
period of sustained lower revenues from JPMorgan's capital
markets business," Horowitz warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Horowitz cut his earnings estimates for JPMorgan by $0.38 a
share to $0.10 for the fourth quarter, and lowered 2009 outlook
to $2.55 a share from $2.70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also cut his price target on the stock to $40 from $45,
but still rates the stock "hold."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fox-Pitt's Trone cut his earnings outlook for the fourth
quarter to $0.25 a share from $0.65, and for 2009 to $2.90 a
share from $3.35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trone, however, maintained his "outperform" rating on the
stock, and said he views JPMorgan as an outperformer for

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 13 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Entrepreneurs aren't standing still, even during uncertain economic
times. To help them tap the global marketplace, grow, and harness new,
intelligent technologies to their competitive advantage, IBM (NYSE: IBM)
today announced a variety of resources for entrepreneurs. The
announcement is timed with IBM's sponsorship of Global Entrepreneurship
Week -- an initiative taking place in 75 countries from November 17th
through the 23rd -- designed to inspire, connect, inform, mentor and
engage entrepreneurs.

    Today, IBM, in collaboration with the World Bank's International Finance
Corporation, launched new resources and a Spanish language version of a
web-based Small Business Toolkit tailored to women and Black, Hispanic,
Native American and Asian owned businesses in the United States. Already
available in 30 different sites and 16 languages, the toolkit provides
entrepreneurs with the kind of professional human resource, legal,
marketing, and finance-related information templates normally available
to much larger companies. The Small Business Toolkit now includes daily
expert advice by Jim Blasingame, a new women's business-focused blog
hosted by Deb Osgood, a new partnership with MicroMentor for personal
mentoring, and a new small business video learning series in partnership
with BUZGate.org.

    IBM is also putting entrepreneurs with the best business plans in touch
with venture capitalists. As part of its Global Entrepreneurship Week
"Digital Challenge," IBM is challenging participants to submit ideas for
dynamic business models that will link venues on the 3D Internet to their
real-world counterparts. Five finalists will be selected to present their
business plan to a panel of venture capitalists chaired by IBM's Venture
Capital Group during the Spring of 2009. Please visit
http://unleashingideas.org/unleash/show/1 for more details. IBM's Venture
Capital Group works with venture capitalists around the world to identify
promising startups, giving these companies access to IBM's global
ecosystem.

    "Entrepreneurs play a critical role in today's economy," said Chris Caine,
Vice President for Governmental Programs at IBM. "With the world becoming
increasingly connected there is unprecedented opportunity for
entrepreneurs to now become innovators on a global scale. IBM wants to
see these new entrepreneurs succeed and is working to help them grow. We
are proud to be a part of this unprecedented global event challenging
entrepreneurs to dream big and improve the world."

    "For seven days, millions of young people around the world will be
introduced to entrepreneurship and encouraged to think about how
innovation can take them anywhere, no matter their location on the map,"
said Carl Schramm, president and CEO of the Ewing Marion Kauffman
Foundation, co-founder of Global Entrepreneurship Week. "We are excited
to partner with IBM in this endeavor and hope that our work to connect
and inform aspiring entrepreneurs continues beyond the Week and changes
lives around the globe."

    Ongoing Initiatives

    The initiatives announced today complement ongoing IBM projects that
support entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs around the world also have access to
more than 40 IBM Innovation Centers, with new centers opening all the
time. At these Innovation Centers, IBM provides IT professionals with an
entry-point into IBM's Research network, enables them to work side by side
with IBM sales, marketing and technical experts and engineers, fine-tune
their skills and solutions and ultimately go to market faster and compete
in today's global marketplace.

    Additionally, IBM works with its network of Business Partners around the
world to provide entrepreneurs with the tools they need to deliver
solutions to market faster, decrease sales cycles, win more profitable
business and innovate. Additionally, IBM Business Partners have access to
a full range of services and offerings such as "concierge service" that
helps them find the right resources within IBM, and they are eligible for
member benefits in education, co-marketing and technical support and more.

    IBM also works with a diverse group of suppliers; in 2007, IBM spent more
than $2.3 billion with more than 350 diverse suppliers worldwide, and the
company maintains an active mentoring program for diversity-owned
suppliers to help them go global.

    IBM Global Entrepreneurship Week Activities

    In conjunction with Global Entrepreneurship Week, IBM will facilitate and
broadcast roundtable discussions via the Web. These will provide advice
from experts aimed at helping all entrepreneurs -- including Asian, Black,
Hispanic, Native American and women -- globally succeed.

    IBM will host two "Women Entrepreneurs Leading Innovation Globally"
webcasts on November 19, during which panels of female business leaders
and entrepreneurs will share their insights, experiences and best
practices for starting and growing a global business. Panelists include
among others, Maria Contreras-Sweet, the chairwoman of PROMERICA Bank,
Virginia P'an, CEO, China Pacific Partners LLC and TransCapital Group
LLC, Bola Olabisi, CEO and founder of the Global Women Inventors and

&lt;p&gt;  MANILA, THE PHILIPPINES, Nov 13 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced that Philippine Airlines (PAL), the country's
flagship carrier and Asia's first commercial airline, will upgrade and
consolidate its information infrastructure to an IBM System Storage
solution to support the airline's round-the-clock, global business
environment.

    With a fleet of young and modern aircraft that travels to 31 foreign
cities and 30 domestic points, PAL has become one of the most respected
airlines worldwide today. As PAL launches new routes to both domestic and
international destinations, it realized it needed to upgrade its current
information infrastructure. The increased workloads on PAL's Airline
Control Systems (ALCS) and other business systems required better
performance and superior throughput of the storage systems to run more
efficiently. PAL also required an off-site fallback storage for business
continuity and disaster recovery.

    Under the agreement signed in September, PAL will replace three different
multi-vendor disk systems with an IBM storage solution consisting of the
IBM System Storage Turbo DS8300 and IBM TotalStorage Productivity Center
management software that helps to centralize and automate storage tasks
associated with storage systems.

    "An upgrade of our existing mainframe system will improve the response
time, shorten the processing time for the Airline Control Systems (ALCS)
based systems, and consolidate all present and projected storage
requirements of our mission-critical applications," said Joffrey Foronda,
Manager for Infrastructure and Storage Management, PAL. "Furthermore, we
can build an information infrastructure with which we will be able to
deliver improved service levels, reduce business risks, and manage the
information explosion effectively."

    IBM was chosen over other storage system providers due to the superior
capabilities of the DS8000 Turbo and IBM's record of excellent support and
service. This year, PAL celebrates the 25th anniversary of the Philippine
Airlines Commitment to Excellence to Reservations Systems on IBM's System
z.

    "We are delighted to be chosen as PAL's partner to help address its
increasing business needs," said James Velasquez, Country General Manager,
IBM Philippines. "With the tremendous scalability, broad server support
and flexible virtualization capabilities of the DS8000 Turbo, PAL can
simplify the storage environment which can help manage the airline's
exponential growth and at the same time reduce its operational complexity
and costs."

    IBM will work together with FRITZ &amp; MACZIOL, a global IBM Premier Partner,
in the implementation of this project.

    About Philippine Airlines

    PAL is the first commercial airline in Asia and the oldest of those
currently in operations, with a long and distinguished history spanning
over sixty years. Out of its hubs at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in
Manila and Mactan-Cebu International Airport in Cebu City, Philippine
Airlines serves eighteen destinations in the Philippines and twenty-six
destinations in Southeast Asia, East Asia, Australia, Canada and the
United States. Philippine Airlines is owned by PAL Holdings, which is
responsible for the airline's operations. PAL Holdings is in turn part of
a group of companies owned by business tycoon Lucio Tan.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 13 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Today IBM (NYSE: IBM) is introducing a new version of InfoSphere
Traceability Server*, software that lets organizations use data from
sensors such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags and bar codes
to gather and share intelligence on items as they move through the supply
chain. It is the only software on the market to combine the power of
business intelligence with information sharing software that meets GS1
EPCglobal's Electronic Product Code Information Sharing (EPCIS) standard.

    InfoSphere Traceability Server is used across multiple industries to solve
a variety of challenges. In the pharmaceutical industry, manufacturers and
distributors use it to comply with emerging drug pedigree regulations. For
example, contract manufacturer Golden State Medical Supply uses the
software to ensure that it can comply with future regulations in the State
of California for drug pedigrees. Similarly, food producers and
distributors are using the software to enable food traceability as a means
of addressing the need for greater accountability in the food supply
chain. Leading the way is Norway's largest food supplier, Nortura, which
is teaming with IBM to establish a food tracking solution that will help
make Norway's food supply safer establishing a system that can trace the
provenance of meat and poultry products.

    Organizations using InfoSphere Traceability Server can now view sensor
data with the benefit of the insights, visibility and automated
intelligence provided by embedded IBM Cognos 8 BI reporting, analysis,
dashboards, alerts and notification capabilities. For example,
pharmaceutical manufacturers can use the software to monitor sensor data
not just for drug Pedigree compliance, but to assess the effectiveness of
their business processes. Similarly, automobile manufacturers that use
InfoSphere Traceability Server to monitor the location of shipping
containers can now use Cognos analysis capabilities to determine how
effectively the containers are utilized and why they sometimes get lost.
In both cases, the additional insight provided by business intelligence
capabilities could lead to business process optimization and in turn, a
more agile business.

    The InfoSphere Traceability Server is fully compliant with the EPCIS
standard, which allows trading partners to share information captured
using sensor technologies. By using software that meets the EPCIS
standard, organizations can create systems they can use to share
information on product movements with any trading partner that also uses
an EPCIS-compliant solution.

    About IBM

    A pioneer in sensor technology and a leader in IT and business strategy,
IBM offers sensor solutions that unlock new business value and help drive
new insights and innovation. For more information, visit

&lt;p&gt;DataDirect Technologies' Mainframe Integration Platform Helps IBM z10 Business Class Customers Expand the Use of Specialty Engines

     Midsize Mainframe Customers to Benefit from the DataDirect(R)
  Shadow(R) Product's Unique Ability to Exploit Specialty Engines for
          Improved Mainframe SOA Performance and Cost Savings
BEDFORD, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
DataDirect Technologies, the unparalleled leader in data
connectivity and mainframe integration and an operating company of
Progress Software Corporation (NASDAQ: PRGS), today announced its
immediate support for the new System z10 Business Class (z10 BC)
mainframe from IBM.

   With the introduction of z10 BC, midsize companies can now take
advantage of the legendary reliability and security of System z while
capitalizing on the energy efficiency, unsurpassed speed and cost
management features first introduced by the System z10 Enterprise
Class (z10 EC) mainframe. DataDirect Technologies' unique exploitation
of the specialty processors available on z10 EC and now z10 BC
reinforces IBM's strategic efforts to extend the value of the
mainframe to new workloads, attract new users and reduce operating
costs.

   The DataDirect(R) Shadow(R) product is the first and only
mainframe integration middleware capable of diverting process
intensive Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) workloads, event
publishing and data workloads from the mainframe general purpose
processor to the non-restricted, more economic, System z10 Integrated
Information Processor (zIIP). As a result, organizations can run new
and expanded workloads on the mainframe while improving performance
and lowering mainframe Total-Cost-of-Ownership (TCO). SOA continues to
be a major driver for mainframe integration. Web services and SOA
initiatives involving mainframe systems are the fastest growing
segments in terms of revenue and new customer acquisition at
DataDirect Technologies, increasing approximately 50 percent year over
year.

   "Having the System z community of business partners like
DataDirect Technologies provide immediate support for z10 BC clearly
demonstrates that mainframe momentum remains strong," said Karl
Freund, vice president of marketing for System z at IBM. "When you add
up all the industry solutions and software stacks available from IBM
and niche providers like DataDirect Technologies, the mainframe truly
rises as a smart, cool and affordable solution for application
deployments and server consolidation."

   To date, more than 5,000 unique applications are available on the
System z platform. IBM reports more than 1,400 worldwide independent
software vendors (ISVs) that are developing applications for System z.

   "IBM's new z10 business class mainframe has strategic importance
for organizations trying to reduce spending and increase IT
efficiency," said Gregg Willhoit, chief software architect for
DataDirect Technologies. "When these new advanced mainframes are
combined with next-generation middleware like DataDirect Shadow,
customers have the unique ability to improve performance and
dramatically reduce mainframe TCO, particularly in SOA related
projects."

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 13 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded
General Motors Corp (GM.N) to "neutral" from "overweight,"
citing ambiguity of the U.S. government aid structure, and
particularly its potential dilutive impact on equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Himanshu Patel said what is needed was near-term
liquidity relief coupled with a comprehensive re-cut of the
automaker's operational and financial cost burdens. "We
estimate GM needs at least $15 billion to get to 2009-end, and
something immediately to make it past December 2008," Patel
wrote in a note to clients.
 Patel, who doubts whether the federal package currently
discussed is likely to succeed, said the government could also
help directly stimulate auto sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government should not be fooled into believing that GM
-- whose bailout alone could easily reach $30 billion -- simply
needs enough to "get to 2010," the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this month, GM and Ford Motor Co (F.N) reported far
deeper-than-expected quarterly losses and said their rate of
cash burn had accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Patel said the government should provide a near-term loan
to cover one to two quarters of cash burn, but a second sleeve
of additional aid should be contingent on a re-cut of both
financial debt and (United Auto Workers) UAW legacy
liabilities, and after GM draws up a plan to accelerate dealer
network and brand cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asking taxpayers for a second auto bailout could prove very
politically challenging, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "GM shares have obvious downside risks if aid is not
obtained or if in an out-of-court restructuring entirely
cancels the equity," Patel wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GM shares closed at $3.08 Wednesday on the New York Stock
Exchange.

 can purchase the LS22 with a memory booster that gives it 96 percent
faster  memory for improved application performance.

    The IBM BladeCenter LS42 consumes up to 16 percent less power than 
comparable blade offerings. It also provides 20 percent faster memory, so
 it is well suited to run memory-intensive applications like those for 
virtualization and database. In fact, it can handle over five percent more
 virtual machines than competitive blades.

    The IBM System x3455 delivers robust performance for scientific, 
technical, and financial applications with IBM's innovative Xcelerated 
Memory Technology, which eliminates traditional high-performance computing
 application bottlenecks by delivering faster access to data.

    The System x3755 has a flexible design that allows customers to  increase
the size of their system as their databases, virtualization  environments
and collaboration applications grow. The x3755 provides a  three socket
configuration that outperforms many competitive four socket 
configurations.

    With the new 2+2 program, clients can start with two sockets on the
BladeCenter LS42 and System x3755 servers and expand to a four socket
server as their business needs demand. This allows companies to pay only
for the capacity they need now, giving them the flexibility to scale their
server while protecting their investments. The LS42 and x3755 are the only
servers in the industry that start out at the price of a two socket system
and can be upgraded to four sockets as the client requires.

    "IBM continues to deliver the broadest portfolio of blade servers on the
market with today's introduction of BladeCenter servers based on the
newest Quad-Core AMD Opteron processors," said Alex Yost, vice president
of IBM BladeCenter. "The new LS42 allows clients to grow the system along
with their business, affordably scaling from a two-socket system to a
four-socket configuration while delivering industry-leading power use and
performance."

    IBM BladeCenter LS22 and LS42 blade servers are available with solid-state
drives, which are up to four times more reliable than traditional drives
and use up to 87 percent less power -- saving up to 20 watts per blade.

    The new servers are an important element in helping clients develop a new
enterprise data center, which offers dramatic improvements in IT
efficiency and provides for rapid deployment of new IT services to
support future business growth. IBM is helping clients move to new
enterprise data centers by focusing on best practices around
virtualization, green IT, service management and cloud computing.

    "AMD is focused on delivering superior investment protection in the data
center, and we are proud to deliver superior scalability in support of
IBM's new LS22, LS42 and x3755 servers," said Patrick Patla, vice
president and general manager, Server and Workstation division, AMD. "The
enhanced Quad-Core AMD Opteron(TM) processors are designed with AMD's
Same Socket Technology and Common Core Strategy to help our industry
partners and customers minimize the cost and complexity of hardware
transitions, while benefiting from the increased performance and
power-efficiency of AMD's newest server processor."

    Pricing and Availability

    The scalable IBM BladeCenter LS42 will be available with enhanced
Quad-Core AMD Opteron processors later this month starting at $5,165. The
IBM System x3455 and x3755 will be available with enhanced Quad-Core AMD
Opteron processors in early 2009. The 2+2 program is available to LS42
and x3755 customers now.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE Nov 12 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on
Wednesday its next release of Windows Live online services will
integrate e-mail, instant messaging, photos and Web
applications from other companies into a single platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft aims to position Windows Live with its
widely-used e-mail and messaging services as the hub for a
growing number of Internet applications and incorporate new
features similar to those found on popular social networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The strategy puts Microsoft into competition with social
networking sites Facebook and News Corp's NWSa.N MySpace,
which started to open their fast-growing websites to outside
software developers last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new Windows Live service plans to feature a main
profile page that updates users to their friends' activities
within Windows Live and on more than 50 outside Web services
including Yahoo Inc's (YHOO.O) Flickr photo site and
career-oriented social networking site LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a race to see who will work better and faster with
everyone else," said Charlene Li, founder of consulting company
Altimeter Group. "It's the recognition that you can't be an
island of yourself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said Web users are overrun with accounts at
multiple Internet sites, each requiring a password and each
with a different set of friends. Its goal is to simplify the
Web lives of its users who go to Microsoft's Windows Live
e-mail or instant messaging accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's Windows Live strategy is also central to its
plans to wrestle away online advertising revenue from Google
Inc (GOOG.O), which has used its dominant search engine to
expand into e-mail, online word processing and other businesses
that compete directly with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft plans to roll out the new Windows Live services,
which will include a revamped e-mail, calendar and a new photo
application, in the United States over the coming weeks and
then make it available in 54 countries early next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FILL IN THE SEAMS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this third major release of Microsoft's Windows Live
services, Microsoft said it aims to fill in the seams between
its different Web services to create a unified experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brian Hall, general manager of Windows Live, pointed to
Microsoft's Outlook application, which brought together e-mail,
calendar and contacts programs into a single integrated
software suite, as a model for how it wanted to tie together a
loose network of Web services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also noted that the latest Windows Live release is
focused on creating a more polished user experience, which, in
the past, may have been sacrificed in order to get new programs
out quicker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other new services include an online movie maker program, a
"groups" service that allows a group of users to create a joint
calendar, share photos and documents or chat together online.
Microsoft also plans to increase the size of its free storage
service to 25 gigabytes from 20 GB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft boasts more than 460 million Windows Live users
and analysts said the goal for the company is to keep that
audience in front of the company's websites for as long as
possible and to prevent defection to other Web destinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't think Microsoft is going to steal a whole lot of
eyeballs from Facebook or MySpace," said David Card, research
director at Forrester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Facebook has 120 million active users and many of those
rely on its mail and chat applications to communicate with
friends instead of traditional e-mail and messaging services
offered by Microsoft and Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft and Facebook are pursuing the same strategy,
according to analysts, albeit from different sides and areas of
strengths. Last year, Microsoft paid $240 million for a 1.6
percent stake in privately-held Facebook.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Those Beverly Hills Chihuahuas might have run their course, but a Hollywood White Shepherd efficiently marks his territory in "Bolt," an animated adventure about a canine action hero who's inadvertently shipped from his studio to the East Coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it will never be mistaken for Pixar pedigree when it reaches theaters next Friday, this genial production is a notable step up for Walt Disney Animation Studios and the first to fall under the creative guidance of Pixar's John Lasseter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With easy-on-the-ears voice work from John Travolta and Miley Cyrus and easy-on-the-eyes digital 3-D (it's Disney's first animated effort to be conceived and designed from the outset with the format in mind), the film should handily tickle its target audience, especially at the select venues equipped to hand out those 3-D glasses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting the dimensional stage with an extended action sequence that shows off the fresh technology, the story-within-the-story kicks in revealing TV superdog Bolt (Travolta) to be unaware that his villain-chasing studio environment is really all make-believe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he's accidentally shipped to New York, Bolt embarks on a cross-country quest, convinced that his person, Penny (Cyrus), remains in the clutches of evil back on that Hollywood soundstage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although his superpowers would appear to be on the fritz, he receives assistance from his two traveling companions: Mittens ("Curb Your Enthusiasm's" Susie Essman), a world-weary street cat, and Rhino (Mark Walton), a starstruck, plastic ball-encased hamster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serving as the feature debut for both co-directors Chris Williams and Byron Howard, the longtime Disney Animation employees keep things moving along at a pleasant visual clip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It still would have been nice to see the script, credited to Williams and Dan Fogelman ("Cars"), have more of a comedic punch, with fuller character quirks and complexities to go along with the enhanced visual dimension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The generic story line also follows an all-too-traveled path, sharing plot points with Disney's recent "101 Dalmatians" direct-to-DVD sequel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there's a terrific tenderness in Travolta's performance, while Cyrus and company (also including Malcolm McDowell as the diabolical Dr. Calico and James "Inside the Actors Studio" Lipton stretching -- or maybe not -- as a pompous director) are similarly effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And because they had him in the recording studio, anyway, the producers coaxed Travolta into singing an end-credits duet with Cyrus, the sweetly innocuous "I Thought I Lost You."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Changes source, adds analyst comments, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 14 (Reuters) - Friedman Billings Ramsey downgraded
Walter Industries Inc (WLT.N), a producer and exporter of U.S.
metallurgical coal for the global steel industry, and said a
sharp decline in steel demand will pressure metallurgical coal
prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walter Industries, whose stock was downgraded by Friedman
to "market perform" from "outperform," had said in September it
was planning to separate its financing business from the core
natural resources businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also adjusted its fourth-quarter expectations
for metallurgical coal sales to 2.0 to 2.1 million tons
compared with  2.1 to 2.2 million tons of sales due to reduced
advance rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "For 2009, we continue to see weaker steel demand due to a
slowing global economy, but, particularly, in steel-consuming
industries, such as real estate, automobile, and oil and gas
drilling," Friedman analyst Luther Lu wrote in a note to
clients. In late 2009 or early 2010, steel demand will grow due
to announced stimulus packages, but not fast enough to help
this annual contracting cycle, the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lu, who also lowered his price target on the stock to $30
from $53, said he expects the stock to remain flat, at best,
with limited contracting information until next March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From the U.S. to Europe to emerging markets, such as the
BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) countries, steel
capacity utilizations are sharply declining, and most are from
idling blast furnaces, Lu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Tampa, Florida-based Walter closed at $26.90
Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Featuring Original Score by Grammy(R) Nominated Composer John
Powell with Original Songs Performed by John Travolta, Miley Cyrus and
                              Jenny Lewis

            **Soundtrack to Be Released on November 18th**
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Walt Disney Records will release the original soundtrack for Walt
Disney Pictures' animated comedy adventure BOLT on November 18, 2008.
The recording features score written by Grammy(R)-nominated composer
John Powell (Happy Feet, Shrek) and two original songs: "I Thought I
Lost You" performed by the film's stars Miley Cyrus and John Travolta,
and "Barking at the Moon" by Jenny Lewis.

   Composer John Powell has written music for comedies (Hancock,
Pluto Nash, Alfie, Mr 3000) and action films (Mr. and Mrs. Smith,
X-Men: The Last Stand, Face/Off and the Bourne film trilogy). Some of
his most beloved work has been for animated films (Happy Feet, Kung Fu
Panda, Ice Age: The Meltdown). The British born Powell began
originally trained as a violinist. In 1995 he founded a London based
commercial music house before moving to the United States two years
later. He is one of the best known former members of the Remote
Control (formerly Media Ventures) team of composers, where he first
teamed with Harry Gregson-Williams, his collaborator on several scores
(Antz, Chicken Run, Shrek).

   Currently, Miley Cyrus is in production on her third season of her
hit TV series Hannah Montana. The special edition of her #1
album Breakout will also be released November 18. In the spring of
2009, Miley will release a book sharing her inspiring story, spanning
from her Southern roots in Tennessee to the excitement of her
record-setting triumphs in TV, music and film. Her feature film HANNAH
MONTANA: THE MOVIE is scheduled for release on April 10, 2009.

   The golden-voiced singer songwriter front woman, Jenny Lewis
co-founded the highly acclaimed Los Angeles based band Rilo Kiley,
with whom she has released 4 albums. Her first solo album "Rabbit Fur
Coat" was released in 2006, followed by "Acid Tongue" which was
released earlier this year.

   For super-dog BOLT (voice of JOHN TRAVOLTA), every day is filled
with adventure, danger and intrigue--at least until the cameras stop
rolling. When the star of a hit TV show is accidentally shipped from
his Hollywood soundstage to New York City, he begins his biggest
adventure yet--a cross-country journey through the real world to get
back to his owner and co-star, Penny (voice of MILEY CYRUS). Armed
only with the delusions that all his amazing feats and powers are
real, and the help of two unlikely traveling companions--a jaded,
abandoned housecat named Mittens (voice of SUSIE ESSMAN) and a
TV-obsessed hamster named Rhino (voice of MARK WALTON)--Bolt discovers
he doesn't need superpowers to be a hero. Directed by Disney veterans
Chris Williams and Byron Howard, BOLT is a hilarious, fun-filled,
action-packed animated comedy adventure in Disney Digital 3-D.

   BOLT opens in theaters on November 21, 2008. The BOLT Original
Soundtrack will be in stores on November 18, 2008.

&lt;p&gt;  SANTA CLARA, CA, Nov 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
BLADE Network Technologies, Inc. (BLADE), the industry leader in network
virtualization and high-performance solutions for servers and storage,
will showcase its top-of-rack RackSwitch 10 Gigabit Ethernet data center
switch products and its unique approach to Rackonomics at the 20th annual
SC 08, the premier international conference for high performance
computing to be held next week in Austin, Texas.

    Rackonomics is a new set of rules to define rack-level provisioning that
enables data centers managers to design, deploy and replicate one rack --
or multiple racks -- at a time to quickly and cost-effectively scale out
data centers as needed.

    BLADE at SC08, Booth #322

    At SC08, BLADE will announce that its top-of-rack, 10 Gigabit Ethernet
RackSwitch products have been providing superior cooling, low latency and
price/performance advantages for IBM System Cluster 1350 and IBM's new
System x iDataPlex which will be showcased in booth #522.

    Verari will showcase at SC08 in booth #909 its new NB1010 Series
BladeSwitch that was jointly developed by BLADE and Verari Systems.

    Also at SC08, Dan Tuchler, BLADE's vice president of strategy and product
management, will present "10G Ethernet -- Ready for Major Breakthrough in
2009 for HPC Environments" on Wednesday, Nov. 19 at 10:30 a.m., Room
12A/12B. The talk includes competitive benchmarks results from well-known
high performance computing (HPC) applications and trends in interconnect
technologies within the top compute clusters.

    About BLADE's HPC-class RackSwitch

    BLADE's High Performance Computing (HPC)-class RackSwitch 10 and 1:10
Gigabit Ethernet products demonstrate considerably better latency,
throughput, energy efficiency and price/performance compared with
comparable Cisco Catalyst data center switches. According to independent
evaluations performed by The Tolly Group, BLADE's RackSwitch G8100 low
latency switch with 24 - 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports outperforms a Cisco
Catalyst 4900M by:


--  Demonstrating 12.4x less latency
--  Sustaining line-rate throughput for all frame sizes, while the
    Catalyst 4900M achieves only 49.7 percent of the theoretical maximum
--  Consuming 73 percent less energy
--  Exhibiting 6.5x better price/performance
    

    
BLADE's RackSwitch G8000 1/10GbE aggregation switch offers similar
advantages over Cisco's 4948-10GE Switch. The full summaries of the
competitive performance evaluations are available at:
http://www.bladenetwork.net/pages/products_rackswitch.html.

&lt;p&gt;Csrnetwork and AccountAbility: General Electric Ranked No 2 in Global 2008 Accountability Rating

LONDON--(Business Wire)--
General Electric has claimed the number 2 spot in the 2008
Accountability Rating. In its annual assessment of the world's largest
corporations, the G-100, the Accountability Rating shows that General
Electric has demonstrated a significant leap in accountability.

   Compiled by international think-tank AccountAbility and
consultancy Csrnetwork, with support from data provider Asset4, the
Accountability Rating measures how companies build responsible
practices into the way they do business, and their impact on the
economies, societies and environments in which they operate.

   The results show that almost all companies in the G-100 have
broadened their definition of responsibility. Many are not just
recognising and mitigating risks, they are also looking at how they
can evolve existing products and services, or create new ones, to
address major social and environmental challenges.

   Todd Cort of Csrnetwork says, "Companies are not just taking the
carbon agenda more seriously, they are taking a closer look at their
social impacts and recognising the majority of their most substantial
social and environmental risks. The challenge now is to build the
systems that allow them to turn this recognition into business
benefits."

   Key findings

   --  General Electric has clearly communicated its efforts to drive
        responsible practices into all aspects of its operations. Its
        Ecomagination initiative has been remarkably successful,
        resulting in sustainability solutions becoming a major part of
        the company's business model.

   --  78% of companies now disclose targets for their environmental
        performance. Under half say when they plan to achieve these
        targets.

   --  75% of companies report on their carbon emissions; just 43%
        report a decrease.

   --  The 2008 Accountability Rating top ten:
        Vodafone; General Electric; HSBC; France Telecom;
        HBOS; Nokia; EDF; GDF Suez; BP; Royal Dutch/Shell

   "Once again we see the world's largest companies becoming more
accountable," says Alex MacGillivray of AccountAbility. "There are
many small-scale initiatives being started by these companies. The
challenge lies in how companies can scale-up to find real solutions to
societies' major problems like climate change. Those companies getting
it right demonstrate it can be hugely profitable and beneficial for
the wider economy."

   Regional Accountability Ratings are also being produced for
Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Korea, Portugal, Russia and Turkey.

&lt;p&gt;Nov 14 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded
specialty chemical maker H.B. Fuller Co (FUL.N) to "overweight"
from "neutral," saying the company is expected to benefit from
lower raw material costs in 2009 and the shares are inexpensive
at the current price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Oil and Natural gas derivatives are the major raw materials
for the company and crude and gas prices are currently at 50
percent lower from their recent peaks, analyst Jeffrey
Zekauskas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We note that each 1 percent change in raw material costs
represents about 11 cents a share benefit to 2009 EPS," the
analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Such a significant upside from lower input costs should
offset volume contraction, weaker pricing and currency
headwinds, resulting in decent earnings generation next year,
he wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst said the fourth quarter may bring some earnings
disappointment, as he expects a two to three month lag between
lower spot raw material prices and actual lower feedstock costs
for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Negative volumes and currency headwinds are also expected
to be a drag, said Zekauskas, who has a price target of $19 on
the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company closed at $16.57 Thursday on the New
York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The United States wants to increase the number of countries enjoying visa-free entry after opening the door to citizens from six new European Union countries and South Korea, U.S. officials said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Monday, travelers from the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia, as well as South Korea, will be allowed to travel to the United States without a visa provided they fill in a form on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington is continuing talks with EU countries not yet in the visa waiver program -- Poland, Greece, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Malta and Romania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is our objective to admit additional countries before the change of U.S. administration," said Jackie Bednarz, a Department of Homeland Security official at the U.S. Mission to the EU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The visa waiver program includes a further 27 countries, including EU states, Australia, Japan and Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From January 12, citizens from all countries in the program will be required to register online ahead of traveling to the United States by air or sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the so-called Electronic System Travel Authorization is refused, a traveler will need to apply for a visa. Bednarz said a pilot project showed an approval rate of 99.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new U.S. requirement is the latest in an overhaul of U.S. travel regulations since the September 11, 2001, attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the online form, the traveler must give his name and travel information, and state whether he has a communicable disease, is a drug abuser, has already been denied a U.S. visa, or "is seeking entry to engage in criminal or immoral activities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The online registration at www.cbp.gov/esta is similar to the paper form that travelers from visa-free countries now fill in aboard the plane and hand to border control on arrival in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A European Commission official said the EU executive was yet to decide whether it considered that the new system was equivalent to reintroducing a visa for European citizens traveling visa-free to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. official insisted this was not a visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The online form is free but it has not been ruled out that a fee could be applied at some point, the U.S. official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ingrid Melander; Editing by Giles Elgood)&lt;/p&gt;

The new unit will announce several significant scientific
collaborations in the coming weeks that will place Pfizer at the
forefront of an emerging area of science that could one day bring hope
and benefit to millions of patients worldwide.

   Scientists at Pfizer Regenerative Medicine will explore the use of
stem cells to develop future treatments that may prevent disability,
repair failing organs and treat degenerative diseases. The ultimate
goal will be to deliver new medicinal products that can pave the way
for the use of cells as therapeutics.

   "Pfizer Regenerative Medicine represents a great opportunity to
focus world-class research in a field that holds considerable promise
for biomedical science and for the treatment of many debilitating
conditions such as diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders." said Rod
MacKenzie, PhD, head of Worldwide Research at Pfizer.

   Corey Goodman, PhD, President of Pfizer's Biotherapeutics and
Bioinnovation Center, said, "The formation of this new unit represents
another key step forward in Pfizer's commitment to be at the forefront
of new approaches in biotherapeutics and bioinnovation and to expand
our research efforts and expertise into emerging areas of biomedical
science, like regenerative medicine, that have great potential for
human health."

   The unit will be led by Chief Scientific Officer, Ruth McKernan,
PhD, who said "I'm very excited to lead this new research unit. While
there is still a lot to understand about how stem cells can be used
therapeutically, we believe it is one of the most promising areas of
scientific research."

   Pfizer Regenerative Medicine will operate as one of Pfizer's new
small, independent research units to help it foster a biotechnology
culture and environment. A key component to the success of the units
will be collaboration with leading academic, biotech and
pharmaceutical partners around the world. Details of Pfizer's
scientific collaborations will be announced in the coming weeks.

   Pfizer Regenerative Medicine will be co-located in the biotech
hubs of Cambridge, UK and Cambridge, Massachusetts in the United
States. It is expected to expand to employ around 70 researchers.
Scientists will operate in small, flexible teams, with the capability
to make decisions quickly and effectively.

   The Cambridge UK site is based at Granta Park and positions Pfizer
in one of the strongest biotech regions in Europe. This unit will
focus on neural and sensory disorders. The Cambridge, Massachusetts
site is based at Pfizer's Research Technology Centre (RTC) and will
focus on endocrine and cardiac research.

   Pfizer Regenerative Medicine capabilities will be complemented by
Pfizer's vast resources including R scale and experience, a nimble
and growing biotherapeutics organization, a growing network of
alliances and collaborations and a vast array of drug discovery
technologies, including tools and expertise developed during Pfizer's
15 years of stem cell research.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc said on Sunday its Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and six other top officials will not get bonuses for 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers Jon Winkelried and Gary Cohn, Chief Financial Officer David Viniar, and three vice chairmen -- J. Michael Evans, Michael Sherwood and John Weinberg -- asked the board's compensation committee Sunday morning that they not receive a bonus, spokesman Lucas van Praag said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compensation committee met and agreed, Praag said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The executives will only be eligible for a base salary of $600,000 each, the Wall Street Journal reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Blankfein made $68.5 million, Winkelried and Cohn got $67.5 million, and Viniar got $57.5 million. The compensation of the other three was not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said Goldman had taken "an important step in the right direction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Cuomo warned Goldman and eight other banks getting U.S. government money in the first round of capital injections under the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program that using the funds for bonuses might break state law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This gesture by Goldman Sachs is appropriate and prudent and hopefully will help bring Wall Street to its senses," Cuomo said in a statement on Sunday. "We strongly encourage other banks to follow Goldman Sachs' step."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's move comes as the global credit crisis leads to big losses and erodes profit for banks and securities firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks worldwide have fired more than 150,000 people since the crunch began. Goldman recently fired 3,200 employees, or 10 percent of its  global workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman became a bank holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve in September, along with Morgan Stanley, after Lehman Brothers failed, Merrill Lynch agreed to be bought as financial markets went into turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On September 16, Goldman posted a 70 percent drop in quarterly profit, its biggest earnings decline since going public in 1999, as the worst market slump in decades led to weaker-than-expected revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several analysts expect the company to post a fourth-quarter loss, which would be its first ever as a public company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its shares are down 69 percent so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joseph A.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's bonus outlook has worsened in light of the fact Goldman Sachs (GS.N) top executives are foregoing bonuses this year and Citigroup (C.N) is laying off 52,000 workers, New York Gov. David Paterson said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York gets about one-fifth of its tax revenues from the financial industry, but such collections are plunging since Wall Street firms have been forced to write down hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of faulty investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This means that our assumption is probably correct, that the projection for bonuses will be down even from where they are now," Paterson told reporters on a conference call, adding that capital gains tax collections will also be hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiscal monitors have projected bonuses could be slashed by half, to a total of $16 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest chapter in Wall Street history further imperils the Democratic governor's effort to persuade state legislators to slice $2 billion from the current fiscal year's $121 billion budget at an emergency session on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paterson said a refusal so far by the lawmakers to negotiate means they might delay action until December, forcing the state to grapple all at once with a $15 billion deficit spread over 16 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This does not bode well," Paterson said. New York starts its new fiscal years on April 1, and its multiyear deficit now totals $47 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lame duck Republican-led senate on Monday stuck with its demand that the governor submit detailed bills they say they need to assess whether to approve his cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schools and Medicaid, the state-federal health plan for the poor and disabled, would bear 65 percent of the reductions; the state work force would have to forego its 3 percent pay increase next year and pay more for health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos, said in a statement: "I again ask the governor to give us bills that we can discuss in conference later today with an eye toward putting the bills up for a vote by the Senate at the special session tomorrow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Paterson said his staff had already met fifty times with their legislative counterparts to explain the bills, adding he put them out in draft form in the hopes of persuading legislators to put forward their own recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless the state legislature approves the reductions, Paterson said he could only slice a couple of hundred million dollars from the budget on his own. The governor, who only took office in mid-March, has already ordered trimmed spending several times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds byline, details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Joan Gralla&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 17 (Reuters) - Wall Street's bonus outlook
has worsened in light of the fact Goldman Sachs (GS.N) top

financial industry, but such collections are plunging since
Wall Street firms have been forced to write down hundreds of
billions of dollars' worth of faulty investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This means that our assumption is probably correct, that
the projection for bonuses will be down even from where they
are now," Paterson told reporters on a conference call, adding
that capital gains tax collections will also be hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fiscal monitors have projected bonuses could be slashed by
half, to a total of $16 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The latest chapter in Wall Street history further imperils
the Democratic governor's effort to persuade state legislators
to slice $2 billion from the current fiscal year's $121 billion
budget at an emergency session on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paterson said a refusal so far by the lawmakers to
negotiate means they might delay action until December, forcing
the state to grapple all at once with a $15 billion deficit
spread over 16 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This does not bode well," Paterson said. New York starts

they need to assess whether to approve his cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Schools and Medicaid, the state-federal health plan for the
poor and disabled, would bear 65 percent of the reductions; the
state work force would have to forego its 3 percent pay
increase next year and pay more for health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos, said in a statement: "I
again ask the governor to give us bills that we can discuss in
conference later today with an eye toward putting the bills up
for a vote by the Senate at the special session tomorrow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Paterson said his staff had already met fifty times
with their legislative counterparts to explain the bills,
adding he put them out in draft form in the hopes of persuading
legislators to put forward their own recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unless the state legislature approves the reductions,
Paterson said he could only slice a couple of hundred million
dollars from the budget on his own. The governor, who only took
office in mid-March, has already ordered trimmed spending
several times.

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska Nov 17 (Reuters) - The Alaska Department
of Natural Resources has denied ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM.N) a
permit to build  a seasonal ice road to carry equipment to an
oil and gas field the state says it has seized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon wants the nearly 50-mile road to transport a rig for
drilling wells this winter at Point Thomson, a languishing
eastern North Slope field of vast oil and natural gas
reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Alaska says Exxon and its partners no longer own
the Point Thomson leases and the Department of Natural
Resources has formally revoked the leases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The state does not allow any party to drill on its lands
without the state's permission," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The state's efforts to revoke Point Thomson leases started
in 2005 when the Division of Oil and Gas rejected Exxon's 22nd
plan of development for the field. In that plan, Exxon and its
partners declared development must wait for a natural gas
pipeline, a project estimated at the time to cost over $20
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The state subsequently rejected Exxon's 23rd plan of
development for Point Thomson, which called for production of
at least 10,000 barrels of liquids a day by 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon and its partners have challenged the state's
actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dispute over Point Thomson leases is pending in Alaska
Superior Court. State officials have predicted the issue will
be resolved in the courts in about two years, and that there
will be ready buyers once the leases are put back up for
auction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A study the state commissioned this year estimated that
Point Thomson holds 580 million to 950 million barrels of oil
and 490 million to 600 million barrels of natural gas liquids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's partners in what the state calls the "former Point
Thomson unit" are BP (BP.L), Chevron (CVX.N) and ConocoPhillips
(COP.N).  Exxon was the unit's operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Exxon Mobil spokeswoman said Monday the company still
plans to drill this winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have the right to conduct drilling activities under the
terms of the leases which we do not believe have expired,"
spokeswoman Margaret Ross said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Point Thomson working interest owners are proceeding
with the project and the drilling plan while we seek to resolve
the dispute with the State over the Point Thomson Unit. We are
hopeful that we will resolve the differences to our mutual
satisfaction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Point Thomson unit, an amalgamation of leases that at
one time reached over 100,000 acres, was created in 1977. Some
leases date back to the 1960s. But there has been no well
drilled at Point Thomson since 1982.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by David Gregorio)

access to bridge the company to 2010 when it realizes
considerable cost cuts," analysts Eric Selle and Atiba Edwards

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) said on
Sunday its Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and six other top
officials will not get bonuses for 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Blankfein, Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers Jon
Winkelried and Gary Cohn, Chief Financial Officer David Viniar,
and three vice chairmen -- J. Michael Evans, Michael Sherwood
and John Weinberg -- asked the board's compensation committee
Sunday morning that they not receive a bonus, spokesman Lucas
van Praag said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The compensation committee met and agreed, Praag said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The executives will only be eligible for a base salary of
$600,000 each, the Wall Street Journal reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year, Blankfein made $68.5 million, Winkelried and
Cohn got $67.5 million, and Viniar got $57.5 million. The
compensation of the other three was not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said Goldman had
taken "an important step in the right direction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, Cuomo warned Goldman and eight other banks
getting U.S. government money in the first round of capital
injections under the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program
that using the funds for bonuses might break state law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This gesture by Goldman Sachs is appropriate and prudent
and hopefully will help bring Wall Street to its senses," Cuomo
said in a statement on Sunday. "We strongly encourage other
banks to follow Goldman Sachs' step."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's move comes as the global credit crisis leads to
big losses and erodes profit for banks and securities firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks worldwide have fired more than 150,000 people since
the crunch began. Goldman recently fired 3,200 employees, or 10
percent of its its global workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman became a bank holding company regulated by the
Federal Reserve in September, along with Morgan Stanley (MS.N),
after Lehman Brothers LEHMQ.PK failed, Merrill Lynch MER.N
agreed to be bought as financial markets went into turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Sept. 16, Goldman posted a 70 percent drop in quarterly
profit, its biggest earnings decline since going public in
1999, as the worst market slump in decades led to
weaker-than-expected revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Several analysts expect the company to post a
fourth-quarter loss, which would be its first ever as a public
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its shares are down 69 percent so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (For more MA news and our DealZone blog, go to

Bernstein Research's Brad Hintz on Monday joined the ranks of
analysts forecasting a fourth-quarter loss at Goldman Sachs
(GS.N), as they expect the company to be hurt by significant
writedowns amid weak credit market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over the past two weeks, a slew of analysts at brokerages
including Fox-Pitt Kelton and UBS have forecast that Goldman
will post a fourth-quarter loss, which would be its first ever
since going public in 1999. The analysts' expectations for a
loss range between $2.50 per share and 40 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup's Bhatia, who expects fourth-quarter writedowns
of $4.4 billion at Goldman, slashed his price target on the
company's stock to $125 from $150 to reflect lower estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst expects a fourth-quarter loss of $1.60 a share
at the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's investments in Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China Ltd (ICBC) (601398.SS) (1398.HK) and private equity
exposure are expected to take a heavy toll on the former
investment bank as the value of those investments deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bernstein analyst Hintz said Goldman is likely to lose $800
million from its investment in ICBC, due to Chinese bank's
declining equity value on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman may also face reduced fixed income sales and
trading revenues due to the difficult credit market conditions,
Hintz, who expects a fourth-quarter loss of 54 cents a share at
the company, said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; M. STANLEY OUTLOOK BLEAK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley (MS.N) is also expected to be hit hard by
the recent turmoil in financial markets across the globe, with
Citigroup's Bhatia expecting a loss at the company and
Bernstein's Hintz slashing his earnings estimates on the former
investment bank. [nWNAB4344]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup's Bhatia expects a fourth-quarter loss of 5 cents
a share at Morgan, hurt by writedowns of $3.5 billion. Earlier,
he expected a profit of 75 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Bernstein's Hintz expects Morgan Stanley to do better
than Goldman in the current quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Because Morgan Stanley is less reliant on capital
intensive trading revenues than Goldman Sachs, Bernstein
expects Morgan Stanley's results will be stronger than
Goldman's this quarter," Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hintz prefers Morgan Stanley over Goldman Sachs for its
greater revenue diversification, lower reliance on capital
intensive trading revenues and the earnings stability that its
retail brokerage business provides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst has an "outperform" rating on Morgan Stanley,
while he rates Goldman Sachs "market-perform." Citigroup's
Bhatia rates both companies a "buy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of the 21 analysts covering Goldman, eight rate it a "buy"
or the equivalent, while one analyst recommends selling the
stock. The rest rate it "hold." Morgan Stanley is rated "buy"
or its equivalent by nine analysts, while ten analysts
recommend holding the stock, according to Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since the summer of 2007, Wall Street has been hammered by
a sharp pullback in debt markets, which began with mortgage
woes and escalated into a credit crisis slowing economic
activity around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley became bank holding
companies regulated by the U.S. Federal Reserve in September,
after Lehman Brothers LEHMQ.PK failed, Merrill Lynch MER.N
agreed to be bought and the financial markets spun out of
control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The conversion to bank holding companies, designed to
reassure investors, gives Morgan and Goldman full access to
Federal Reserve support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The change, effectively killing off the investment banking
model that had dominated Wall Street for more than 20 years,
enabled Goldman and Morgan Stanley to take deposits, gain
easier access to financing and gave them more flexibility to
buy retail banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares, which have lost more than two-thirds of
their value this year through Friday, lost $4.72 to hit a low
of $62.01 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Morgan Stanley, which has lost more than
three-fourths of its market value this year through Friday,
fell $1.02 to $11.01 Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The broader SP investment banking and brokerage index

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced it has extended its tender offer in the
United States for all outstanding ordinary shares (including shares
represented by American Depositary Shares (ADSs) held by any holder,
wherever located) and warrants of ILOG (NASDAQ: ILOG) (PARIS: ILO) until
12:00 noon, EST, on November 24, 2008. The tender offer in the United
States was originally scheduled to expire at 12:00 noon, EST, on November
17, 2008.

    As of 5:00 p.m., EST, on November 14, 2008, the aggregate number of ADSs
(representing an equal number of ILOG ordinary shares) that have been
tendered into, and not withdrawn from, the tender offer in the United
States, was 1,563,584 or approximately 69.8% of all outstanding ADSs.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Goldman Sachs Electronic Trading (GSET) announced today the release of the latest version of REDIPlus, Goldman Sachs&#8217; proprietary, award-winning execution management system. The release of version 8.1 marks the second major release of 2008, and provides institutional clients with improved system performance and ergonomics, new algorithms, enhanced derivatives trading capabilities, and new ways to access SIGMA X dark liquidity. 

&#8220;With the release of version 8.1 we continue to enhance the REDIPlus product to meet client needs,&#8221; noted Rishi Nangalia, Managing Director and Global Head of Product Development, Goldman Sachs Electronic Trading. &#8220;Particularly in today&#8217;s volatile, high-speed markets, we must continue to improve the features and ease-of-use of the platform.&#8221; 

Ergonomic improvements include customizable &#8220;skins,&#8221; allowing users to alter the look and feel of their workspace, as well as a new labeling system for simpler use of the platform. Spark lines &#8211; an analytics tool that uses dynamic color schemes to indicate price movement in a given security &#8211; allow for more intuitive interpretations of market activity during trading. Additionally, a new window called the Transaction Monitor permits clients to intelligently organize their trade executions. The customizable window features pivot-style grouping based on user-defined signals about an order, and can be fully exported to a spreadsheet in a single-click. 

Users of REDIPlus 8.1 will also be able to take advantage of key enhancements to the algorithmic trading offering. A new US and Canadian equity algorithm, called OptimIS, balances impact cost and price risk while sourcing liquidity from dark pools. Improvements to an existing algorithmic strategy, Dynamic Scaling, allow clients to trade using simpler parameters for easier order entry. 

Derivatives traders will also benefit from REDIPlus version 8.1, which now offers analytics for trading European options. Additionally, Options traders have the ability to enter complex strategies using a single mouse click, clone their orders, and calculate implied Greeks and volatility based off the bid or ask. 

Clients who upgrade to REDIPlus 8.1 will benefit from innovative new ways to take advantage of the liquidity in SIGMA X, Goldman Sachs&#8217; crossing network and the largest US dark liquidity pool (Tabb Group, 2008), averaging 318 million US shares per day. Two new features &#8211; SIGMA X-Cross and Block Signals &#8211; will help facilitate crossing for larger blocks of client orders. SIGMA X-Cross allows for single-stock and portfolio-level point-in-time crossing with constraints. Block Signals provides SIGMA X clients with an intelligent way to communicate and locate block crossing interest by using unique visual, audio, and text alerts within the REDIPlus trading platform. 

The REDIPlus platform allows clients to trade equities, options, futures, foreign exchange and synthetics from a single application. Clients can use REDIPlus to access Goldman Sachs algorithmic strategies in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia. Additionally, clients can use REDIPlus to route orders through the SIGMA smart router and&#160;post orders directly to the SIGMA X crossing network. Clients trading baskets of securities&#160;benefit from integrated portfolio and spread trading functionality and an&#160;embedded&#160;suite of pre-, during, and post-trade analytics. 

Goldman Sachs Execution &amp; Clearing, L.P., through the GSET platform, provides clients with the necessary tools to manage their trades across asset classes and global markets. Clients access our products via FIX or via REDIPlus.

&lt;p&gt;New Cloud-Based Email Continuity Solution Delivers Major Cost Savings, Continuous Protection, and Seamless Exchange Migration
SAN MATEO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Cemaphore Systems, Inc. is continuing to reshape the way people manage and protect their email content with the announcement of MailShadow&#174; for Exchange Online (MailShadowX) that immediately synchronizes email, calendars, contacts, tasks and notes between internal Microsoft Exchange servers and Microsoft&#8217;s Exchange Online Service. This breakthrough offering makes email continuity in the cloud an easy decision for both SMBs and enterprises by providing user-friendly migrations and smooth email co-existence between internal Exchange and Exchange Online environments. MailShadowX follows on the heels of the highly lauded MailShadow for Google Apps&#8482;, which permits synchronization of data between Exchange/Outlook and Google Apps/Gmail. 

With MailShadowX, users benefit from real-time synchronization, continuous protection, instant recovery, and seamless migration from internal to external Exchange. Its transaction-based architecture ensures that critical Exchange data are always available and safely protected. Bi-directional synchronization between Exchange Online and Google Apps is also possible. 

&#8220;Our strategic focus on &#8216;Business Continuity in the Cloud&#8217; continues to resonate strongly across all industry segments,&#8221; said Tyrone Pike, Cemaphore President and CEO. &#8220;We will continue to lead the charge in providing enterprise-level business continuity and disaster recovery for SMBs. Microsoft Online is the natural next step for us and we&#8217;re thrilled to be part of that offering. This is a critical milestone, and we will continue to develop additional cloud-based messaging services.&#8221; 

&#8220;Email is one of the most important communications and record keeping tools in today&#8217;s businesses, yet assuring continuity for it is often too expensive for small and medium companies&#8221;, said Rob Enderle, Principal Analyst for the Enderle Group. &#8220;Cemaphore&#8217;s MailShadow for Exchange Online addresses this significant market need.&#8221; 

&#8220;Today&#8217;s challenging economic climate puts the pressure on all companies to reduce IT costs yet deliver high service quality,&#8221; said Philippe Winthrop, Research Director, Strategy Analytics. &#8220;This is the perfect storm to accelerate the adoption of cloud-based email continuity. The arrival of MailShadow Exchange Online is very timely to capitalize on this major need to do more with less and leverage existing investments in enterprise mobility.&#8221; 

&#8220;Providing a comprehensive email continuity and recovery solution from the cloud is a tremendous benefit for the customers we serve. Businesses of all sizes are under pressure to reduce infrastructure costs while still delivering safe protection and recovery of email data,&#8221; said Alan &#8220;Skip&#8221; Gould, President and CEO of BrightPlanIT, system integrator and Microsoft Gold Certified Partner. &#8220;We are extremely pleased to see Cemaphore take the lead with its strategic introduction of MailShadow for Exchange Online. This new SaaS offering will have significant impact on the email marketplace because it capitalizes on key industry trends and satisfies critical customer needs.&#8221; 

For organizations, the ability to acquire world-class business continuity and disaster recovery protection without the need for expensive infrastructure, co-location facilities, and management of internal mail systems that are currently required to ensure continuous uptime makes today&#8217;s announcement a major event. With this news, SMBs now have access to the same powerful continuity and disaster recovery capabilities that the largest enterprises depend upon. 

&#8220;SMBs don&#8217;t want to worry about the technical details of cloud services,&#8221; said James Baker, research manager, Storage Software for IDC. &#8220;They just want their SaaS solution to work seamlessly, and Cemaphore's MailShadow product does just that; it keeps email continuity transparent and simple."

&lt;p&gt;MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Lion Nathan Ltd LNN.AX, Australia's second-largest brewer, launched a A$7.6 billion ($4.9 billion) bid for soft drinks group Coca-Cola Amatil (CCL.AX) on Monday, the latest move in a wave of industry consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S.-based Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), which owns 30 percent of Coca-Cola Amatil, declined to comment on the offer. Spokesman Dana Bolden said, "It would be inappropriate for the Coca-Cola Co to comment at this time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lion Nathan's cash-and-stock bid, pitched at a 25 percent premium to Coca-Cola Amatil's share price, sent the target's shares up to a record high. But the shares later eased to trade below the offer value as Coca-Cola Amatil said the bid had material weaknesses and looked cheap compared with other recent deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CCL is definitely not too happy with it. So, obviously, there is still a risk that the whole deal doesn't go through," said Theo Maas, a partner at Fortis Investment Partners, which manages A$5 billion, including Lion Nathan shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A takeover of Coca-Cola Amatil would give Lion Nathan a 60 percent share of Australia's A$10.3 billion soft drinks market as well as a canned fruits and vegetables business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lion Nathan, 46 percent-owned by Kirin Brewery Co, said the deal made sense, as there was little cannibalization between the businesses, and it could generate A$100-A$130 million mostly in savings on distribution to pubs, restaurants and caterers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That, coupled with the growth opportunities, makes the deal compelling," said Lion Nathan spokesman James Tait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent months have seen a flood of consolidation among global brewers. Coca-Cola Amatil also has a beer joint venture, Pacific Beverages, with SAB Miller Plc, selling Peroni Nastro Azzurro and Miller Genuine Draft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North American brewer Molson Coors Brewing Co this month emerged as the holder of a 5 percent interest in Lion Nathan's bigger rival, Foster's Group Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Belgium's InBev NV is set to become the world's biggest brewer with a $52 billion takeover of Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lion Nathan's picked a good time to make their offer," said White Funds Management portfolio manager Angus Gluskie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Coca-Cola Amatil would struggle to defend the takeover, given uncertain markets and a slower Australian economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISKS TO DEAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Amatil's shares briefly rocketed to A$12 before easing to close up 13 percent at A$9.31, 9 percent below the implied offer value of A$10.21, based on Lion Nathan's 3 percent share price fall to A$8.65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Amatil said there was no guarantee its board or Coca-Cola Co would back the offer, particularly as it was pitched below valuations on recent drinks deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month France's Group Danone sold its Frucor drinks arm in Australia and New Zealand for 14 times Frucor's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, well above the 10.3 multiple Lion Nathan is offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Lion Nathan said Frucor was not a fair comparison as it was a small company that owned its brands, while Coca-Cola Amatil is essentially a bottler of brands, such as Coke, Sprite and Fanta, owned by its parent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola also makes bottled water, Goulburn Valley juices, IXL jams, and SPC and Ardmona canned fruits and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Amatil is being advised by Macquarie Capital Advisers. Lion Nathan is being advised by Caliburn, and JP Morgan is advising Kirin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lion Nathan's move took the market by surprise, as focus has been on Coca-Cola Amatil's expansion plans and Australian drinks giant Foster's, which is trying to decide what to do with its troubled wine business, the world's second largest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Amatil missed out on buying Frucor and is eyeing Britain's Cadbury Plc's Australian Schweppes business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kirin has already been expanding in Australia as its home beer market shrinks. Last week, it sealed a A$910 million deal to buy milk co-operative Dairy Farmers through National Foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It committed to put up A$3.76 billion to help Lion Nathan fund the bid for Coca-Cola Amatil, buying new shares of Lion Nathan at A$11.50 each, a 32 percent premium to Lion Nathan's last trade. That would give Kirin a 47.5 percent stake in the enlarged group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Lion Nathan's proposal, Coca-Cola Amatil shareholders would receive A$6.15 in cash plus 0.469 Lion shares for each Coca-Cola Amatil share. Based on last Friday's close, the offer valued CC Amatil at A$10.35 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lion Nathan has lined up A$800 million in debt funding to help cover the cash portion of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=A$1.56)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Denny Thomas in Sydney, Taiga Uranaka in Tokyo and Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Jean Yoon and John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - Citigroup's Prashant Bhatia and Bernstein Research's Brad Hintz on Monday joined the ranks of analysts forecasting a fourth-quarter loss at Goldman Sachs (GS.N), as they expect the company to be hurt by significant writedowns amid weak credit market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past two weeks, a slew of analysts at brokerages including Fox-Pitt Kelton and UBS have forecast that Goldman will post a fourth-quarter loss, which would be its first ever since going public in 1999. The analysts' expectations for a loss range between $2.50 per share and 40 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup's Bhatia, who expects fourth-quarter writedowns of $4.4 billion at Goldman, slashed his price target on the company's stock to $125 from $150 to reflect lower estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyst expects a fourth-quarter loss of $1.60 a share at the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's investments in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (ICBC) (601398.SS) (1398.HK) and private equity exposure are expected to take a heavy toll on the former investment bank as the value of those investments deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernstein analyst Hintz said Goldman is likely to lose $800 million from its investment in ICBC, due to Chinese bank's declining equity value on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman may also face reduced fixed income sales and trading revenues due to the difficult credit market conditions, Hintz, who expects a fourth-quarter loss of 54 cents a share at the company, said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;M. STANLEY OUTLOOK BLEAK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS.N) is also expected to be hit hard by the recent turmoil in financial markets across the globe, with Citigroup's Bhatia expecting a loss at the company and Bernstein's Hintz slashing his earnings estimates on the former investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup's Bhatia expects a fourth-quarter loss of 5 cents a share at Morgan, hurt by writedowns of $3.5 billion. Earlier, he expected a profit of 75 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Bernstein's Hintz expects Morgan Stanley to do better than Goldman in the current quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because Morgan Stanley is less reliant on capital intensive trading revenues than Goldman Sachs, Bernstein expects Morgan Stanley's results will be stronger than Goldman's this quarter," Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hintz prefers Morgan Stanley over Goldman Sachs for its greater revenue diversification, lower reliance on capital intensive trading revenues and the earnings stability that its retail brokerage business provides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyst has an "outperform" rating on Morgan Stanley, while he rates Goldman Sachs "market-perform." Citigroup's Bhatia rates both companies a "buy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 21 analysts covering Goldman, eight rate it a "buy" or the equivalent, while one analyst recommends selling the stock. The rest rate it "hold." Morgan Stanley is rated "buy" or its equivalent by nine analysts, while ten analysts recommend holding the stock, according to Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the summer of 2007, Wall Street has been hammered by a sharp pullback in debt markets, which began with mortgage woes and escalated into a credit crisis slowing economic activity around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley became bank holding companies regulated by the U.S. Federal Reserve in September, after Lehman Brothers LEHMQ.PK failed, Merrill Lynch MER.N agreed to be bought and the financial markets spun out of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversion to bank holding companies, designed to reassure investors, gives Morgan and Goldman full access to Federal Reserve support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change, effectively killing off the investment banking model that had dominated Wall Street for more than 20 years, enabled Goldman and Morgan Stanley to take deposits, gain easier access to financing and gave them more flexibility to buy retail banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares, which have lost more than two-thirds of their value this year through Friday, lost $4.72 to hit a low of $62.01 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Morgan Stanley, which has lost more than three-fourths of its market value this year through Friday, fell $1.02 to $11.01 Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broader SP investment banking and brokerage index .GSPINVB, which has lost more almost 75 percent of its value this year, was down more than 5 percent on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Pratish Narayanan)&lt;/p&gt;

(JPM.N) will relocate its European headquarters to London's
Canary Wharf from the City of London, boosting morale for the
company which owns Britain's second-largest business district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Canary Wharf Group (CWG) is competing more than ever with

after weeks of gloom in the financial and property sectors and
on the same day the Confederation of British Industry predicted
there could be nearly 3 million people out of work by 2010. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, which has invested billions of dollars to save
stricken banks Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, has appointed
CWG to develop the building, which could provide up to 1.9
million square feet of space and will enable the bank to
consolidate offices across London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CWG will wait for instruction from JPMorgan before beginning
construction, even though it has already begun infrastructure
works. JPMorgan will forfeit 76 million pounds if it later
chooses not to proceed with construction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is an example of a client working with a developer to
... make sure that the building can match as closely as possible
the needs of the client in what has become a very changeable
environment," Garwood said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan remains under contract to pay around 8.3 million
pounds in annual rent on behalf of Bear Stearns, which agreed to
occupy 206,000 square feet of office space on a 20-year lease in
another building due to complete next summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SILVER LINING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Confirmation of the deal provides a welcome boost for the
Canary Wharf business district after September, when Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK filing for bankruptcy
protection and the Bank of America's purchase of Merrill Lynch,
raised doubts over occupancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The district -- home to Citigroup (C.N), Bank of America
(BAC.N), HSBC (HSBA.L) and Barclays (BARC.L) -- remains almost
fully let partly due to rents being on average 20 percent
cheaper than in the City. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to results published in September CWG's portfolio
was 99.7 percent let as of June 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Market commentators pointed out that Canary Wharf's JPMorgan
win was another loss for Britain's historic financial heartland,
which has lost a slew of key financial sector occupiers to the
Wharf in the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In the long-term, rents in Canary are a bit lower, but the
main issue is deliverability," said Dan Bayley, head of UK
office agency at broker Atisreal. "Once you are over 500,000
square feet in the City, there are far more planning hurdles to
delivering a big building."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Canary Wharf may have lured JPMorgan away from the City but
prising Nomura away from the Square Mile may be a tougher
challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The long-term London City resident has set up operations at
10 Bank Street, Canary Wharf, in the former Lehman Brothers
headquarters after taking over its investment banking division
last month. However a Nomura spokeswoman said it was unclear
whether they would remain in the property on a long-term basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She also told Reuters the bank was unlikely to vacate the
offices it owns in the City of London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Garwood said he hasn't received any formal indication of
Nomura's long-term plans. "They have paid rent up until the end
of the year and as far as we are concerned that will just carry
on," he said.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM)

    IBM's No.1 system uses half the energy of No.2 IBM tops list in aggregate
processing power Top 20 most energy-efficient systems all from IBM

    For a record-setting ninth consecutive time, an IBM (NYSE: IBM) system
took the No.1 spot in the ranking of the world's most powerful
supercomputers. The IBM computer built for the "roadrunner project" at
Los Alamos National Lab -- the first in the world to operate at speeds
faster than one quadrillion calculations per second (petaflop) in June
2008 -- remains the world speed champion.

    The latest bi-annual ranking of the World's TOP500 Supercomputer Sites was
released today during the International Supercomputing Conference in
Austin, Texas. Results show the IBM Los Alamos system, which clocked in at
1.105 petaflops, to be roughly twice as energy-efficient as the No.2
computer, using about half the total electricity (2.5MW) to maintain the
same levels of petascale computing power.

    Indeed, IBM swept the energy-efficiency category -- the TOP20 most
energy-efficient systems are from IBM.

    IBM also had more systems in the TOP50 (21) and the TOP100 (33) than any
other systems maker.

    Over the 15-year history of the list, IBM has held the No.1 spot 11 times,
a feat unmatched by any other systems vendor.

    IBM Systems Set Performance for TOP500

    Since November 1999, IBM systems have been the most powerful on the list,
contributing more overall horsepower than any other systems vendor. The
trend continues in November 2008 -- IBM's 188 systems account for about 38
percent (6.5 petaflops) of the new TOP500's combined compute power of 16.9
petaflops.

    The No.4 fastest computer in the world is an IBM(R) Blue Gene/L system at
the NNSA's Lawrence Livermore National Lab in California, which clocked in
at 478.2 teraflops (trillion calculations per second). Team Blue Gene also
holds the No.5 spot with a 450.3-teraflop performance from the Blue Gene/P
system housed at the Department of Energy's Argonne National Lab in
Chicago.

    IBM also had the fastest machine in Europe -- the No.11 Blue Gene/P at
Juelich Research Center in Germany, running at 180 teraflops. IBM is also
the brand behind the fastest computers in: Canada, United Kingdom, Spain,
Netherlands, Taiwan, South Africa, Israel, Bulgaria and Slovenia.

    IBM supercomputers tackle world's Grand Challenges, from genetic medicine
to the hunt for new energy

    IBM provides a wide variety of systems and software technology to the
supercomputing market, more than any other vendor. The company's
innovative HPC solutions have created a new scientific force for tackling
the world's grand challenges around climate science, the hunt for new
sources of energy, creating new gene-based medicines, and have made
significant contributions to basic scientific inquiry in physics and
biology.

    IBM is also leading the move to design all-new hybrid systems -- such as
the roadrunner project -- that combine different types of processors for
better performance and energy efficiency. IBM is currently building a
360-teraflop hybrid cluster for the University of Toronto, for example, a
deal which will pair one of the world's largest Power6(R) clusters with
IBM's new iDataPlex(R) platform (x86) to create an extremely flexible
4000-node supercomputer capable of running a diverse range of software at
high levels of performance. Starting in 2009, Canadian scientists plan to
use the system to create new methods of medical imaging, among other uses.
Part way through installation, the computer has already debuted at No.53
on the new TOP500.

    "It's an honor to hold the record for the world's most powerful computer,
but what is critical is building supercomputers that help advance the
global economy and society at large," said David Turek, VP of Deep
Computing at IBM. "We pioneered energy-smart supercomputer designs with
Blue Gene in 2000 and build substantially on that heritage each year to
the benefit of science and industry. We apply our lessons learned and the
innovation that comes from these efforts to IBM's commercial systems
business."

    The Era of Blue Gene

    IBM's chart-topping performance since 1999 has been enabled by the
company's innovative Blue Gene system which uses low-power processors to
create ever faster performance for users who have dominated the upper
portions of TOP500 rankings going back to 2004.

    Since 2004, more than 300 racks worth of Blue Gene systems -- 2,182
teraflops of compute power -- have been in near-constant use by nearly 40
of the world's leading research agencies. Blue Gene is changing the way
research is done, elevating the computational component of scientific
inquiry to new importance. The Blue Gene system at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory has itself been responsible for breakthroughs in
physics and materials science, among others that have been lauded on the
covers of six prominent professional journals in the past four years --
twice in Nature.

    About the roadrunner project. Built by IBM for the NNSA and housed at its
Los Alamos National Laboratory, the petaflop-smashing "roadrunner project"
system unveiled in June 2008 gets its world-leading power from a hybrid
blending of 12,960 IBM PowerXCell 8i Cell Broadband Engine(TM) processors
-- derived from chips that power today's most popular videogame consoles
and 6,948 AMD Opteron Dual-Core processors. The Opteron chips perform
basic compute functions, freeing the IBM(R) PowerXCell 8i chips for the
math-intensive calculations that are their specialty. Press release here:
http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/24405.wss

    The "TOP500 Supercomputer Sites" is compiled and published by
supercomputing experts Jack Dongarra from the University of Tennessee;
Erich Strohmaier and Horst Simon of the Department of Energy's
NERSC/Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; and Hans Meuer of the
University of Mannheim (Germany). The entire list can be viewed at
www.top500.org.

    IBM's expertise in building large-scale, energy-smart hardware is also
reflected on the "Green500" list of the world's most energy-efficient
supercomputers. IBM has all of the top 10; 24 of the top 25; and 76 of the
top 100 systems on the current Green500 list. (www.green500.org)

&lt;p&gt;  IRVINE, CA, Nov 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Vision Solutions, a leading high availability and disaster recovery
solutions provider in IBM (NYSE: IBM) Power Systems markets, today
released "The State of Resilience and Optimization on IBM Power Systems,"
a detailed 20-page report regarding disaster recovery expectations,
technologies and the state of systems management. The report is based on
a year-long study that includes survey data from more than 2,000
technical professionals and executives involved with the management of
IBM i and AIX environments and coincides with the 20th anniversary of
IBM's AS/400 introduction, which is today known as IBM Power Systems.

    "When we began compiling survey data, we had a good idea of what the
results might reveal about IBM i and AIX customers' business resiliency
technologies and systems optimization practices," says Edward Vesely,
Vision Solutions' senior vice president of marketing. "What has become the
most encouraging information uncovered in our surveys is the tremendous
market opportunity still existing with high availability and disaster
recovery 20 years later."

    According to Vesely, the report explains how a range of business
resiliency and optimization technologies are benefiting businesses of all
sizes -- from the emerging SMB to the multinational enterprise.

    Several notable findings emerging from the survey include:

    -- It is imperative that technologies and processes currently in place
achieve Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives
(RPOs), even though a large percentage of firms surveyed do not have
appropriate technologies in place to achieve their stated goals.

    -- Data protection and high availability are related but have distinctly
different objectives. In general, companies are adopting solutions to
address both areas, but keeping data and applications continuously
available has not been as consistently addressed as protecting against
catastrophic data loss.

    -- The older focus of disaster recovery (recovering from a fire, flood or
other catastrophes) now yields to a broader understanding of protection
against all causes of business interruption. Technologies for recovering
from and actively avoiding downtime are gaining support.

    -- Data quality, in terms of its currency, accuracy and relevance to
current business, as well as data access efficiency and productivity, is
another top-of-mind issue for executives and operational managers in all
areas of the company. As data stores grow, so do labor and downtime costs.

    "We are privileged that IBM i users remain so loyal to i and have embraced
wholeheartedly the new unified Power Systems platform," said Scott Handy,
IBM's vice president of marketing and strategy, IBM Power Systems. "Twenty
years after the AS/400 was introduced, Power Systems users continue to
reflect the same pragmatic values from two decades ago. Their passion is
remarkable and speaks to the entire ecosystem in which Vision Solutions
has a vibrant role."

    In celebration of the anniversary, Vision Solutions and IBM will host a
free "State of Resilience on Power Systems" webcast Tuesday, Dec. 2, 2008
at 11 a.m. EST. The event will feature IBM's Scott Handy and Vision's
Edward Vesely who will feature news about recent Power Systems technology
and market developments, and findings from Vision's exclusive market
report. Participants who register for the Dec. 2 webcast also will receive
an advanced copy of "The State of Resilience and Optimization on IBM Power
Systems." Register today by going to www.visionsolutions.com/stateofpower.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Bernstein Research analyst Brad Hintz became the latest to join the ranks of analysts expecting a fourth-quarter loss at Goldman Sachs (GS.N), as he expects the company to be hurt by writedowns amid weak credit market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hintz, who also slashed his earnings estimates on Morgan Stanley (MS.N), expects the former investment banks to suffer as global economic conditions continue to deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, theflyonthewall.com reported that Citigroup cut its price target on Goldman shares to $125 from $150.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman fell 5 percent before the bell, while those of Morgan Stanley slid 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernstein's Hintz expects Goldman Sachs to post a fourth-quarter loss of 54 cents a share, hurt by writedowns related to its investments in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (601398.SS) (1398.HK) (ICBC) and its private equity holdings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is likely to lose $800 million from its investment at ICBC, due to the company's declining equity value on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman may also face reduced fixed income sales and trading revenues due to the difficult credit market conditions, Hintz, who had earlier expected a fourth-quarter profit of $2.12 a share at the company, said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past two weeks, a slew of analysts at brokerages including Fox-Pitt Kelton and UBS have forecast that Goldman will post a fourth-quarter loss, which would be its first ever as a public company.

&lt;p&gt;Nov 17 (Reuters) - Veteran banking analyst Richard Bove cut
his price target on JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) to $37 from
$45, after the company's Chief Executive, Jamie Dimon, said at
a New York investor conference that rising unemployment could
add to the bank's losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We need to be prepared for a very tough environment, and
we are," Dimon had said at the conference, "The wider economic
downturn could be worse for banks like JPMorgan than the credit
crisis that has restricted financial markets over the last
year." [ID:nN12298995]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There should be pressure on retail financial services,
credit cards and commercial banking from bad credit results,
Bove of Ladenburg Thalmann said in a note dated Nov. 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In the past, investors have ignored his (Dimon's) negative
predictions but it is impossible to do so this time. The
comments were simply too negative," said Bove, who maintained
his "neutral" rating on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of JP Morgan were trading down 61 cents at $33.86
early Monday morning on the New York Stock Exchange.

operating environment" during the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hintz prefers Morgan Stanley over Goldman Sachs for its
greater revenue diversification, lower reliance on capital
intensive trading revenues and the earnings stability that its
retail brokerage business provides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst has an "outperform" rating on Morgan Stanley,
while he rates Goldman Sachs "market-perform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley became bank holding
companies regulated by the U.S. Federal Reserve in September,
after Lehman Brothers LEHMQ.PK failed, Merrill Lynch MER.N
agreed to be bought and the financial markets spun out of
control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The change, effectively killing off the investment banking
model that had dominated Wall Street for more than 20 years,
enabled Goldman and Morgan Stanley to take deposits, gain
easier access to financing and gave them more flexibility to
buy retail banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the investment banking front, the current quarter was
weak for the two surviving securities firms with weak
underwritting volumes, analyst Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The potential for negative marks remains real as hedge
funds, banks and other institutions continue to de-lever their
balance sheets," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While mergers and acquisition advisory revenue is likely to
hold up the quarter, it is not likely to offset the weakness
from the underwriting side of the business, Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares closed at $66.73 Friday on the New York
Stock Exchange, while those of Morgan Stanley closed at
$12.03.

&lt;p&gt;
COSTA MESA, Calif., Nov. 17, 2008 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Emulex Corporation
(NYSE:ELX) today announced that its LightPulse(r) LP21000 family of Fibre
Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) Converged Network Adapters (CNAs) have been tested
and found to be compatible for use with IBM Systems x3650(7979), x3655(7943) and
x3755(7163) series servers. Emulex CNAs enable the consolidation of server I/O,
allowing IBM customers to reduce the number of network interface cards and
cables used by servers by as much as 50 percent, which in turn helps lower power
and cooling costs.

"With the largest installed base of Fibre Channel HBAs in IBM SANs worldwide, it
is essential that Emulex's family of LightPulse FCoE CNAs are compatible with
IBM servers, so that customers can make a seamless transition to the
next-generation data center," said Taufik Ma, vice president of product
marketing, Emulex Corporation. "The ability to reduce data center complexity,
while providing the same level of reliability, performance and manageability as
Emulex's Fibre Channel HBAs, makes extending SAN connectivity to other parts of
the data center using FCoE technology a prudent approach to data center
consolidation and convergence."

The Emulex LP21000 family of CNAs enables customers to further consolidate their
data centers by converging Fibre Channel and networking traffic over a 10Gb/s
Enhanced Ethernet network, resulting in more streamlined IT operations and
higher staff productivity. Emulex FCoE CNAs leverage field-proven Fibre Channel
SAN technology, allowing customers to extend their existing investments in
infrastructure, management, training and processes. Emulex CNAs also leverage a
common driver model and the familiar Emulex HBAnyware(r) management suite.

Emulex CNAs also support Emulex's Virtual HBA technology with industry-standard
N-Port ID Virtualization (NPIV) support, allowing customers to "virtualize" SAN
connections so that each virtual machine has independent access to its own
protected storage. With Emulex NPIV-enabled FCoE CNAs, customers have the
ability to track and chargeback storage utilization at the virtual machine level
using Emulex's HBAnyware management suite. For more information on Emulex
LightPulse CNAs, visit: http://www.emulex.com/products/fcoe/index.jsp.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM's (NYSE: IBM) second global online survey of consumer digital media
and entertainment habits revealed that consumers are adopting digital
content services -- such as social networking and videos -- on mobile
phones and personal computers at an accelerated pace, and it is impacting
traditional consumption habits.

    The survey, which was conducted with 2,800 people in six countries --
Australia, Germany, India, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S. -- also shows that
people are willing to get personal with advertisers by sharing information
about themselves if it results in targeted incentives that match their
lifestyle. This presents companies with significant advertising revenue
opportunities among today's informed and empowered consumers.

    "I Want My Ad-Supported Digital Content and Interactive Tools"

    Last year's study showed the decline of TV as the primary media device.
This year's study found large scale adoption and usage of digital content
services accessed via the PC and mobile phone, with ad-supported models
(versus consumer-paid) preferred almost three to one by respondents
globally. Adoption for most categories of digital content services doubled
from last year, with services such as social networking now at 60 percent
penetration and Internet data plans for mobile devices at over 40 percent
for respondents globally. While digital content services adoption is
widespread, interactivity through features such as user ratings tools and
video uploads is primarily concentrated among the more digital savvy
consumers.

    "With the rise of Web 2.0, millions of people can instantly create,
publish and consume content. In order to survive, advertisers must
understand how to reach their target audiences across multiple devices,"
said Dick Anderson, General Manager, IBM Media &amp; Entertainment. "Knowing
distinct consumer segment preferences and delivering consistent content
and messaging are essential for long-term success."

    Consumers desire, and are comfortable with, wired and wireless access to
content. 76 percent of consumers surveyed have already watched video on
their PC, up 27 percent from last year. 32 percent indicated they have
viewed video on a portable device or mobile phone, up 45 percent from last
year. Interest in mobile video content has more than doubled since last
year to 55 percent.

    For both PC and mobile video, over 70 percent of respondents prefer
advertising-supported models as opposed to consumer-paid models,
representing a huge growth opportunity for the industry. Preference for
ad-supported models ranged from 62 percent to over 80 percent by country,
with Japan having the highest preference for ad-supported on both devices.

    "I Watch Less TV Because of Online Video Alternatives"

    Consumers are moving beyond the trial stage of watching online video. Of
those who have watched videos on their PC, 45 percent are doing so
regularly -- at least a few times per month.

    As adoption of online video continues, cannibalization of overall
television consumption is becoming more apparent. Over 50 percent of
respondents who have watched online video claim they watch slightly less
-- 15 percent -- to significantly less -- 36 percent -- television as a
result, implying place-shifting alternatives may be changing consumer
"couch potato" behavior.

    "Hey Corporate America, Get out of my Online Video!"

    When asked how they prefer to view advertising associated with online
videos, the majority of respondents said they prefer to see it before or
after a video. Respondents from all six countries polled protested
traditional television models such as interruption advertisements during
the video or the use of product placements within programs.

    "Consumers have grown accustomed to accessing new forms of content through
alternative sources, such as online video and video-on-demand, at no cost
to them -- no fee, with very limited advertising shown," said Saul Berman,
Global Lead Partner, Strategy &amp; Change Consulting, IBM Global Business
Services and the author of many recent IBM studies. "The industry must
find appealing ways to monetize new content sources or risk a similar fate
as that of the music industry where value shifted away from core players."

    "I'll Trade Information in Exchange for Incentives"

    Close to 60 percent of total respondents were willing to provide
information about themselves -- such as age, gender, lifestyle or
communications preferences -- in exchange for something of value. Younger
respondents had fewer concerns about revealing personal preferences, and a
sizeable portion of participants over the age of 45 were also willing to
share information about themselves. However, all respondents indicated the
need for perceived value and incentives as a trade-off to provide personal
information.

    Consumers listed free high-quality music/videos, discounts to favorite
stores and air travel/hotel points as the most desired and attractive
incentives. These findings were consistent across all countries polled,
with Japan and India having the least reservations about providing
personal preferences, with over 62 and 72 percent of respondents
respectively willing to share information, versus 45 percent of
respondents in the US.

    "I Want my Content and Messaging Integrated -- Here, There and Everywhere"

    The digital savvy consumers are embracing new multimedia devices. The
13-24 year old segment owns an average of between four to five multimedia
devices, with the most popular being portable music players, such as
iPods, game consoles such as Sony PlayStation, Microsoft Xbox or Nintendo
Wii, high definition television sets (HDTV) and portable game players. The
"Gadgetiers" -- early adopters, estimated at 15 percent of the market --
have on average between seven and eight multimedia devices, with the most
popular being portable music players, HDTVs, DVRs, and Internet-enabled
phones such as the iPhone or BlackBerry.

    As devices become more embedded in a person's lifestyle, consumers desire
more integration between them. Over 40 percent of respondents are
interested in content portability -- the ability to view and transport the
same piece of content across multiple devices. Nearly one in five
respondents was interested in consistent, tailored messaging across
devices. Advertisers must focus on consumer-choice and centricity in order
to effectively capture and retain consumers who are relying less on a sole
device for digital content.

    "As consumers continue to rely on more devices to view and access content
on their terms, interest in convergence over multiple media devices
grows," said Bill Battino, Managing Partner, Global Communications
Sector, IBM Global Business Services. "Operators must carefully think
through their opt-in strategies to take advantage of advertising and
commerce opportunities across TV, mobile devices and PCs."

    Geographical Preferences

    Within the six countries polled, Australia and the U.K. had the highest
adoption of social networking sites, with over 65 percent and 70 percent
respectively, compared to an average of 60 percent for all countries. The
U.S. had the highest adoption of premium video services for the
traditional TV at over 45 percent, versus Australia which had the lowest
penetration at less than 25 percent. The U.S. also had high adoption of
online TV/video sites such as HULU or YouTube, at close to 40 percent,
versus the U.K. which had the lowest at 28 percent. Japan, Germany and
India had the highest adoption of mobile services, including Internet
data plans and mobile content plans for video and music.

    While there were differences between countries, the majority of all
respondents stated that recommendations from friends had the most impact
on the type of content they viewed over celebrity, amateur and
professional endorsements.

    IBM Survey Methodology

    The online survey was conducted during the third quarter of 2008 by the
IBM Institute for Business Value. The questionnaire generated 2,800
responses in six countries: Australia, Germany, India, Japan, the U.K.,
and the U.S. The survey was split 50/50 male/female. It proportionately
reached demographic groups 13 years and over. Respondents reported a
range of household salary levels, though the vast was under U.S.
$100,000. The results can be considered statistically significant at the
95 percent confidence level and have a margin of error of +/- 0.0138
points.

    This consumer study is a component of the upcoming report "Beyond
Advertising: Fact or Fiction" jointly authored by Saul Berman, Bill
Battino and Karen Feldman, planned for release in late 2008. It is the
latest in a series of thought leadership papers including: "The end of
advertising as we know it," "The end of television as we know it,"
"Navigating the media divide: Innovating and enabling new business models"
and "Beyond access: Raising the value of information in a cluttered
market," providing recommendations for broadcasters, advertising agencies
and media distributors including telecommunication and cable companies.

    The IBM Institute for Business Value provides strategic insights and
recommendations that address critical business challenges to help clients
capitalize on new opportunities. The Institute is comprised of consultants
around the world who conduct research and analysis in 17 industries and
across five functional disciplines, including human capital management,
financial management, corporate strategy, supply chain management and
customer relationship management. IBM has a strong global focus on the
media and entertainment industry across all of its services and products,
serving all the major industry segments -- entertainment, publishing,
information providers, media networks and advertising. For more

    Editors Note: IBM also stopped people on the streets of Frankfurt, London,
Mumbai, New York, Los Angeles, Sydney and Tokyo to ask about their media
device and advertising preferences. See what they had to say:

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY Nov 19 (Reuters) - Mineral commodities used to
whiten ceramic dishes and make television screens are holding
up despite the commodities sell-off, Goldman Sachs JBWere said
on Wednesday, raising its price forecasts for zircon and
titanium dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs JBWere earlier this week issued its gloomiest
commodities outlook yet as industrial activity in China and
elsewhere slowed, forecasting copper prices to tumble 37
percent next year, iron ore 30 percent and steelmaking coals 43
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in a report on Wednesday it substantially lifted its
price forecasts for zircon as well as modestly raising high
grade titanium dioxide price forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Despite the weak outlook for global commodities, zircon
and high-grade titanium feedstocks are bucking the trend as
supply concerns come to the fore," Goldman analyst Malcolm
Southwood said in a report on the so-called minerals sands
sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While everyone from African copper miners to Australian
iron ore companies cut or halt output as the global financial
crisis digs deeper into manufacturing, minerals sands suppliers
are pushing for price rises over the next two years, the report
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Due to the industry's consolidated nature and the tight
supply outlook, this puts the pricing power firmly in favour of
the producers and they are now using it," Southwood said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beneficiaries of the higher prices will include Rio Tinto
Ltd/Plc (RIO.AX)(RIO.L), Exxaro Resources (EXXJ.J), Iluka Ltd
(ILU.AX) and DuPont (D.N), all of which are pushing customers
to pay more, Southwood said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Removal of more than 127,000 tonnes of zircon this year,
out of a world market of 1.25 billion tonnes, was giving
sellers a boost in negotiations underway over next year's
prices, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zircon was already selling for as much as $900 a tonne for
first-half 2009 delivery, which is $150 a tonne above the
current price, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Security of supply is key to these consumers at a time
when production is falling," Southwood said. "With no
alternative supplies believed to be available even at these
elevated prices, the risk to production is on the downside."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; High-grade titanium dioxide feedstocks are in a similar, if
not as acute, position to zircon, Southwood said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, pinched supplies of rutile, brought about by
production losses primarily in Sierra Leone and South Africa,
are handing pricing power to the producers, he said.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced it plans to acquire Transitive
Corporation, a privately held technology company headquartered in Los
Gatos, California, with a research and development team in Manchester,
United Kingdom. Financial terms were not disclosed.

    Transitive is a leader in cross-platform virtualization and a pioneer in
developing technologies that allow applications written for one type of
microprocessor and operating system to run on multiple platforms -- with
little or no modification. As a result, the technology will enable
customers to consolidate their Linux-based applications onto the IBM
systems that make the most sense for their business needs.

    Transitive's breakthrough technology has earned the company 48 worldwide
patents and numerous industry awards.

    This acquisition is part of IBM's strategy to help clients optimize the
efficiency and productivity of their computing infrastructure and improve
the utilization of the servers that run them. With this translation
technology, along with existing migration capabilities, IBM systems give
businesses a faster, easier path for server consolidation to reduce
operational expenses, floorspace and energy costs.

    Transitive technology is currently included as part of the IBM PowerVMTM
software designed to help customers consolidate their x86 Linux workloads
onto IBM Systems. IBM is seeing a growing trend of customers migrating
from under-utilized servers to IBM Systems, including onto mainframe and
Power Systems. The company is committed to developing additional tools and
solutions to make migrations even easier, while minimizing the risk and
increasing the financial returns for clients as they consolidate and
virtualize to achieve significant business benefit.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters Life!) - Despite growing up in the Bronx and more than three decades in the restaurant business in Manhattan, American chef David Waltuck's cuisine is grounded in classic French techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The owner, along with his wife Karen, of the famed New York restaurant Chanterelle, has weathered a fair share of struggles since it opened in 1979.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time New York City nearly buckled under a fiscal crisis, and more than two decades later the downtown restaurant survived the Sept 11 attacks on the World Trade Center which was not far away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through it all, Waltuck's creative, French-inspired cuisine has garnered awards and a devoted following. It also formed the basis for his latest cookbook "Chanterelle: The Story and Recipes of a Restaurant Classic".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He spoke to Reuters about his passion for French cooking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: How has your cuisine evolved?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: "It has not changed that much. I've gotten better with what I do. The essence of it hasn't changed. I'm basically self-taught. I'm still very French-oriented. There has been more of an opening to Asian ingredients and Middle Eastern ingredients, which I didn't use when I first started."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: By incorporating elements from other cuisines to your French-based cooking, is it fusion cooking?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: "I wouldn't call it fusion at all. If I use lemon-grass, soy sauce, ginger or couscous, it's always from a French aesthetic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: What is it about French cooking that appeals to you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: "It is well thought out. There is also the mentality in French cooking that codifies everything. It's good to have rules and a diagrammatic approach to sauces like mother sauces and breakdown to other sauces. Even if you don't follow that, it's nice to have that in your mind. It's a way of thinking about food and that's appealing to me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: Describe your relationship with your wife Karen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: "There is a classic idea of a restaurant which is a husband and wife enterprise: one is in the kitchen and the other is in front of the house. That's what we do, and it has worked out perfectly for us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q; How did 9/11 affect Chanterelle?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: "At that time, we had two restaurants -- Chanterelle and a bistro which we eventually sold. We were closed for a couple of weeks. There was burning for months. The smell was intense. Everyone was worried about his health being affected. It was definitely tough. It definitely changed the neighborhood. I think it's totally back now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: How are you coping with the current economic downturn?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: "We haven't raised our prices recently ... We are very careful not to waste anything. In terms of ingredients, we've always used the same ones as we've used. I feel that we have to use a certain quality of ingredients and we have to use a certain range of ingredients. This is a luxury restaurant."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RECIPE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POACHED HALIBUT WITH SAFFRON, LEEKS,  BASIL (Serves 4)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adopted from "Chanterelle: The Story and Recipes of a Restaurant Classic" by David Waltuck and Andrew Friedman (The Taunton Press, 2008)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 tablespoons unsalted, softened butter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 large shallot, minced&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four 6-ounce halibut fillets, any pin bones removed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1/2 cup dry white wine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1/2 cup fish stock or bottled clam juice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1/8 teaspoon high-quality saffron threads, plus more to taste&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 1/2 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pinch of kosher salt, plus more to taste&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 cups leeks (white and very light green parts only) cut into 1/4 x 2-inch ribbons (from about 4 leeks)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1-1/2 cups heavy cream&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 tablespoons fresh basil cut into chiffonade&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Rub one tablespoon of butter over the bottom of a deep, heavy-bottomed 10- or 12-inch saute pan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Sprinkle the shallot over the bottom of the pan and set the fillets on top without crowding them. Gently pour the wine and stock over and around the fish to come about two-thirds up their sides. Cover the pan tightly with a lid or aluminum foil, set over medium-high heat, and bring to a rolling boil, about 3 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Reduce the heat to medium and cook the fish for another minute. Remove the lid, then use a fish spatula or regular spatula to remove the fillets from the pan and transfer them to a large plate or platter. (They will be slightly undercooked, but will continue to cook via carry-over heat.) Cover loosely with foil to keep them warm. (If you used foil to cover the pan, you can use the same foil to cover the fish.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Reserve 1/2 cup of the poaching liquid and discard the rest. Return the liquid to the saute pan, set over high heat, and bring to a rolling boil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Add the saffron and boil for one minute to reduce it and extract some flavor from the saffron. Add the lemon juice, salt, the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, and the leeks, and cook, stirring frequently, until the leeks are wilted and the sauce is slightly reduced, 3 to 4 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Stir in the cream and continue to reduce over high heat until the leeks are softened but still al dente and the sauce just coats the back of a wooden spoon, about five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. Adjust the seasoning to taste with salt, more lemon juice if necessary, and a bit more saffron, if desired. Stir in the basil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8. To serve, place a halibut fillet on each of four dinner plates, taking care to drain any juices that may have accumulated so as not to dilute the sauce. Spoon the leeks and sauce over the fish. Serve immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts with force majeure declaration)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAGOS Nov 18 (Reuters) - U.S. energy giant Chevron (CVX.N)
declared a force majeure in Nigeria on Tuesday after a main
supply pipeline to its Escravos export terminal was sabotaged
last week, forcing it to shut in around 90,000 barrels per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron Nigeria Limited (CNL) ... confirms that it has
declared a force majeure effective November 18 through December
31, 2008," the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said onshore production was shut in in Delta state last
Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Repair plans are being prepared and it would be premature
to estimate completion time," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Delta state is one of three main states in the Niger Delta,
a network of mangrove creeks which are home to Africa's biggest
oil and gas industry. Attacks by militants and criminal gangs
have cut oil output in the region by a fifth since early 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pipeline, which feeds into the Chevron-operated Escravos
export terminal in Delta state, was hit in Abiteye, where
community members have attacked oil facilities in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Armed youths blew up the Abiteye-Olero pipeline in June,
forcing Chevron to cut around 120,000 bpd for nearly a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron operates onshore in Nigeria in a joint venture with
state-run oil firm the Nigerian National Petroleum Corp (NNPC).
Chevron holds 40 percent while NNPC holds 60 percent.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced new IBM Forms software that speeds up
business processes by removing bottlenecks caused by paper and by
allowing employees without technical skills in any department to create
electronic forms or surveys in minutes, which could save clients as much
as $500,000(1) per year.

    Until now, compiling forms and surveys required several technical workers
weeks, not minutes, at a significant cost in information technology (IT)
department time and salaries. Today, however, electronic forms are
increasingly employed to overcome the bottlenecks caused by inefficient,
paper-based forms and as a way to reduce a company's carbon footprint.

    The new version of IBM Lotus Forms, 3.5, makes it simple for nontechnical
employees to quickly create, store and route e-forms inside and outside of
an organization via e-mail and the Web. New features allow employees to
automate and compose their own forms, without needing software to be
installed on individual PCs or requiring help from inundated IT
departments.

    "Companies are realizing that paper is a roadblock for e-business, and
cutting down on its use also helps reduce their carbon footprint," said
Larry Bowden, VP, IBM Portal, Mashups and Forms Software. "From HR to
sales to finance, empowering individuals to rapidly and easily manage
forms removes bottlenecks and frees up resources, making an entire
organization more efficient."

    IBM Lotus Forms 3.5 software, capable of handling the most challenging
projects such as insurance and tax forms, comes with new "Turbo" software.
Turbo, also available as a stand-alone product, handles simple tasks such
as employee on-boarding, leave and vacation requests, customer
satisfaction surveys, job applications, product orders, and opinion
surveys. Based on an open software platform and Web 2.0 technology, Turbo
works with IBM WebSphere Portal software to provide one familiar
interface for a company's customers and employees.

    IBM WebSphere Portal Web 2.0 software is designed to securely combine
information from both the enterprise and the Web. A portal is a technology
for providing external and internal Web sites which can deliver
information, applications, and processes to provide a personalized
experience to individuals. Like other Web 2.0 technologies, they are
increasingly being used by businesses to empower employees with content,
social connections and other tools to solve problems.

    Deutsche Sporthochschule or "Germany Sports University" of Cologne,
Germany has automated the entry and processing of athletic data using IBM
Lotus Forms, IBM WebSphere Portal and the school's IT system. Prior to
employing this solution, the staff had an isolated view of an athlete's
records and needed to transcribe this data from spreadsheets and XML
files. This limited the quality of data for use in evaluations for
research.

    "We are excited about new IBM Lotus Forms software because it makes it
easier for us to design forms for new projects. Now with IBM Lotus Forms,
athlete records are directly entered into forms. This helps validate the
data right up front. Then it is posted directly onto the IBM DB2 database
software system. After this, complex, role-based searches can be conducted
through our portal search engines," said Mr. Nils Noell, Chief Technology
Officer, Deutsche Sporthochschule.

    Using electronic forms is one way to reduce the amount of paper used by an
organization. A recent IBM No Paper Weight Study indicates that when
companies stop printing their "born digital" documents, paper consumption
can be reduced by between 80-90 percent. The newest version of IBM Lotus
Forms helps organizations easily move all of their workers towards a
paperless environment, freeing them from the burden of slower business
processes and tasks encumbered by storing, printing and filing paper.

    With Business Partner EIM Corporation, IBM is helping the US Army automate
processes. The US Army represents one of the world's largest e-forms
installations. IBM Lotus Forms are currently used by more than 1.4 million
Army personnel worldwide, yielding an estimated $1.3 billion(2) in cost
savings to the US federal government. For more details about this savings
and a related news announcement, visit www.ibm.com/press.

    IBM Forms support open standards based e-forms built on XForms, for
compatibility with existing customer systems, providing an advantage over
competitive offerings. New IBM Lotus Forms has improved digital signature
capabilities and supports Safari browser 3.1 on the Macintosh platform.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 18 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) is in
the process of restarting a flexicoker unit at its 567,000
barrel-per-day refinery in Baytown, Texas, after planned
maintenance work that was delayed by Hurricane Ike, a spokesman
said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are completing the turnaround work and are in the
process of beginning a restart of the flexicoker," Russ
Roberts, a spokesman for the refinery, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He declined to give the capacity of a unit, which is
essentially a coker using proprietary technology, or to provide
an estimate on how long it would take the unit to reach full
rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The work began around two weeks after Hurricane Ike hit the
Texas coast on Sept. 13, causing the shutdown of several
refineries, including Baytown, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We were planning and preparing to start the turnaround
before the hurricane ... Ike delayed the start of the work,"
the spokesman said.

consumer and commercial lending businesses, Harte said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Harte, who has a "hold" rating on JPMorgan, also slashed
his price target on the bank's stock by $6 to $36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Harte cut his fourth-quarter profit view on the company by
78 percent and 2009 profit view by 16 percent. [ID:nWNAB4968]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company were trading up 10 cents at $32.87

&lt;p&gt; (Adds background, details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Tanya Mosolova and Katya Golubkova&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW Nov 18 (Reuters) - Russia's Gazprom (GAZP.MM) is
considering U.S. majors Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and ConocoPhillips
(COP.N) for its liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in Russia's
Arctic Yamal region, its deputy chairman said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alexander Medvedev also said Conoco could gain access to gas
deposits in Yamal in exchange for Russian gas export monopoly
Gazprom joining gas projects in Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The list (of possible participants) is currently being
made, but we do not exclude majors such as Exxon Mobil and
Conoco from joining the project," Medvedev told reporters on the
sidelines of a gas conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the summer Gazprom said it saw Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L)
as one of its potential partners in LNG projects in the gas-rich
Arctic Yamal peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Time frames of potential projects are not yet known, though
Gazprom has said it plans to produce the first 15 billion cubic
metres of gas in 2011, gradually bringing output to 250 bcm a
year or almost half its total output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom, supplier of a quarter of Europe's gas, holds around
one-fifth of global gas reserves, of which more than 10 trillion
cubic metres, or one third, is on Yamal. The firm needs tens of
billions of dollars to bring gas to its trunk pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the last year Gazprom has wavered over whether or not to
bring in foreigners to help develop the frozen peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ALASKA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Medvedev said Conoco could gain access to the Yuzhno
Tambeisky gas deposits in Yamal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His statements marked a major turning point in agreements
between Gazprom and the far northwestern U.S. state, which is
divided from Russia by the mostly frozen Bering Strait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Critics say the Alaskan gas pipeline, a project idea which
has existed since the 1970s, will be too costly and has already
faced severe delays due to revenue disputes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Medvedev said that while Alaska can pose technical
challenges, it is not dissimilar from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Recently, we had a meeting with top managers of Conoco and
outlined potential areas of cooperation. One of these areas
(involves) the Arctic, both in the United States and Russia...
they are very similar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom views Yamal as its key source of future gas output
as production is falling at mature deposits in West Siberia. The
firm has said new deposits on Yamal and in East Siberia and the
Russian Far East will account for half of its output by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industry analysts say Yamal will dwarf Shtokman, another
giant deposit located in the stormy Barents Sea, which will need
at least $20 billion in investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom last year teamed up with France's Total (TOTF.PA)
and Norway's StatoilHydro (STL.OL) on Shtokman after more than
10 years of talks. Conoco had also wanted to participate.

&lt;p&gt;  HAIFA, ISRAEL, Nov 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) is announcing a collaborative effort with European Union
partners to develop new technology that will help support active aging
and prevent cognitive decline in the elderly population.

    Based on intelligent audio and visual processing and reasoning, the
"HERMES Cognitive Care for Active Aging" project will develop a
combination of home-based and mobile device-based solutions to help older
people combat the natural reduction in cognitive capabilities. The
three-year project includes a special focus on developing an interface
that will be comfortable for technology-averse users.

    As people approach middle age, their cognitive abilities begin to decline,
and forgetfulness permeates nearly every aspect of daily life. This
problem is especially acute among the aging, a generation where not
everyone is comfortable with new hi-tech 'brainboosting' gadgets and may
even shy away altogether from any new technology devices.

    "HERMES is helping realize the vision of lengthening the stage of
independent living and helping aging populations remain active," explained
Prof. Manfred Tscheligi, Director of CURE (Center for Usability Research &amp;
Engineering) and coordinator of the HERMES project. "Developing innovative
yet non-intimidating technology to address the needs of this valuable
population is a challenge that this community of researchers is eager to
embrace."

    The HERMES project brings together experts ranging from gerontology and
speech processing, to hardware integration and user-centered design to
achieve the common goal of cognitively supporting older people. The first
stage, a joint effort of the user partners CURE in Austria and INGEMA in
Spain, will work on better understanding the memory needs of the elderly
through a range of user-centered methods. The technology partners in the
consortium, including the IBM Research Lab in Haifa (Israel), Athens
Information Technology (Greece), Bradford University (UK) and TXT
e-Solutions (Italy) will work to develop the sensory and perceptual
technologies.

    The HERMES "home of the future" prototype will be equipped with
microphones and video cameras to record conversations and experiences at
the user's discretion. The elderly will be equipped with a mobile device
that records conversations, experiences, location coordinates, dates and
times outside the home, for example at the doctor's office, the bank, or
with acquaintances. All the information will be stored, processed and
analyzed to help augment the person's memory.

    "With HERMES, our research into multimedia technologies is taking a real
leap forward in transforming how people will go about their daily lives,"
noted Ron Hoory, manager of speech technologies at the IBM Haifa Research
Lab. "The project will enable us to target more complex dynamic
environments that demand new innovative approaches. These new approaches
can work equally well for business environments, to help analyze telephone
calls in a call center, broadcast news and video, or any scenario where
speech is of essence."

    The project's ultimate goal is to build a prototype system that will offer
three main services:

     The first service will help the user remember what happened in the
recent past. For example, Alice can ask the system, "What did my daughter
say to me yesterday when we discussed the snow storm in Montreal?" The
system will search its repository of recordings based on the time window
and the keywords of the content, and then let Alice choose to play back
the relevant conversations recorded in audio or on video.   The second
service will give the person reminders or prompts to help manage their
daily schedule. For example, if George notices that the jar of coffee is
almost finished, he can tell the system to add a reminder to buy coffee.
The system will connect the words "coffee," "buy" and name of the local
store where George usually shops. When George passes the store and his
mobile device notices the store location, the system will remind him to
buy coffee using a text-to-speech synthesis in a natural human voice.  
The third service provided will be memory fitness exercises based on
actual personal experiences. For example, at any given time, the system
will have a list of appointments, some from the past and others that are
yet to take place. The system can present the appointments and ask the
user to organize them by category or quiz the user by asking the exact
time for next week's doctor's appointment. Another question might be:
From the following three appointments which is first, second, and third?
These games help jog the user's memory and are based on actual

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 18 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded
Evergreen Solar Inc ESLR.O and Ascent Solar Technologies Inc
(ASTI.O) to "underweight" from "neutral" and said it was
unlikely that these companies could generate positive free cash
flow until 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Solar companies will face increased pricing pressure from
lower subsidies in Europe and a potentially shrinking pool of
capital available to system owners to finance solar projects,
analyst Christopher Blansett wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given this view, we recommend investors focus on companies
that can absorb margin compression, can cut capex in order to
remain FCF positive and are more likely to remain solvent in
light of the possibility of further subsidy reductions in
Europe in 2010," the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blansett also said the reduced solar subsidies next year,
higher solar system borrowing costs and increased competition
at all levels of the solar photovoltaic foodchain will cause
pricing pressures for solar components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He expects solar system and associated component prices to
decline more than 25 percent in 2009, but sees solar demand to
remain strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also initiated coverage of First Solar Inc (FSLR.O) with
an "overweight" rating and a price target of $102, and said the
company already has significant manufacturing scale, a strong
balance sheet and will better weather the turbulence facing the
solar energy industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Ascent Solar Technologies closed at $3.84, while
those of Evergreen Solar closed at $3.21 Monday on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First Solar's stock closed at $115.55 Monday on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN JOSE, CA and ARMONK, NY, Nov 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced the launch of
two additional offerings for enhancing the retail banking experience that
build on their Front Office Solutions for Retail Banking announced in
November 2007. The Optimized Self-Service and Cisco TelePresence(TM)
solution modules help enable retail banks to use their experts more
efficiently for direct client interaction regardless of where they are
located or which delivery channel (e.g. phone, Internet, video,
telepresence, etc.) they are using for communications.

    Today, financial institutions are working closer with customers to provide
more personalized and up-to-date products and services that better meet
their customers' changing financial needs. Independent of the time of day
or the delivery channel that clients utilize, banks are striving to deploy
technologies and information technology (IT) architectures that help
improve business processes to optimize a collaborative customer
experience.

    Cisco TelePresence(TM) for Banking allows users to experience virtual
face-to-face interactions with others in any global location, and it
eliminates the cost, time and carbon footprint associated with physically
traveling to meetings. The value of Cisco TelePresence helps retail banks
transform their collaboration at three levels:


--  Enhanced customer interaction through remote expert support in the
    bank branch or in new market penetration
--  Intercompany collaboration (for example, bank to outsource partner)
--  Internal efficiencies through reduced travel and consistent executive
    communications
    

    
At Bank of Montreal (BMO), enhancing internal collaboration, reducing
travel costs and taking a green approach were at the top of its agenda.
"BMO Financial Group has offices in Canada and around the world, and our
employees log more than 60 million miles per year on business travel. At
last, Cisco TelePresence video conferencing presents a real alternative to
meeting face-to-face, and thanks to the high-resolution images in the
technology, it's almost as if you were in the same room," said BMO's
Michael Thornburrow, senior vice president, Corporate Real Estate &amp;
Strategic Sourcing. "Cisco TelePresence is an important contribution to
our plan to achieve carbon neutrality, and it will help us remove tons of
CO2 emissions from the atmosphere every year. The Cisco team has been
great partners on this project at every step along the way."

    Optimized Self-Service Solution integrates bank client access channels,
such as kiosks, PDAs, cell phones, Internet, and voice response
(telephone), to provide a consistent quality user experience to banking
clients. Optimized Self-Service integrates delivery channels using tested
and integrated Cisco(R) Unified Communications Manager and IBM Lotus(R)
offerings. Contact Center integration provides the ability to quickly
identify and locate subject-matter experts to provide efficient customer
service through voice or video interaction that is delivered to the
channel the client is using.

    "Building on our focused collaboration, IBM and Cisco are providing our
joint banking clients with the innovative offerings in telepresence and
self-service technologies to help banks cost-effectively improve sales and
service delivery in response to customers' anytime-anywhere banking
needs," said Paul Jameson, director of marketing for Financial Services,
Cisco. "Banks may improve collaboration with customers to enhance the
relationship through the delivery of more personalized products and
services."

    "We are working closely with partners such as Cisco to help our banking
clients as they strive to provide a consistently excellent customer
experience and quality of service across all channels, whether in the
branch or via phone, Internet, video, telepresence or however," said Sunny
Banerjea, global solutions executive, IBM Banking Industry. "While
self-service channels can give you greater reach and lower the cost of
service, they can also distance you from your customers. However, with IBM
and Cisco Front Office Solutions for Retail Banking, banks have the
communications technologies, collaborative capabilities, and rich digital
media to allow them to provide their self-service customers with a more
'high touch' experience."

    The IBM and Cisco Front Office Solutions for Retail Banking are now
generally available from IBM and Cisco. The companies will demonstrate the
solutions at the 2008 BAI Retail Banking Conference and Expo, Nov. 18-20,
in Orlando, Fla., at booths 1300 (IBM) and 1311 (Cisco).

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Those Beverly Hills Chihuahuas might have run their course, but a Hollywood White Shepherd efficiently marks his territory in "Bolt," an animated adventure about a canine action hero who's inadvertently shipped from his studio to the East Coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it will never be mistaken for Pixar pedigree when it reaches theaters next Friday, this genial production is a notable step up for Walt Disney Animation Studios and the first to fall under the creative guidance of Pixar's John Lasseter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With easy-on-the-ears voice work from John Travolta and Miley Cyrus and easy-on-the-eyes digital 3-D (it's Disney's first animated effort to be conceived and designed from the outset with the format in mind), the film should handily tickle its target audience, especially at the select venues equipped to hand out those 3-D glasses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting the dimensional stage with an extended action sequence that shows off the fresh technology, the story-within-the-story kicks in revealing TV superdog Bolt (Travolta) to be unaware that his villain-chasing studio environment is really all make-believe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he's accidentally shipped to New York, Bolt embarks on a cross-country quest, convinced that his person, Penny (Cyrus), remains in the clutches of evil back on that Hollywood soundstage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although his superpowers would appear to be on the fritz, he receives assistance from his two traveling companions: Mittens ("Curb Your Enthusiasm's" Susie Essman), a world-weary street cat, and Rhino (Mark Walton), a starstruck, plastic ball-encased hamster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serving as the feature debut for both co-directors Chris Williams and Byron Howard, the longtime Disney Animation employees keep things moving along at a pleasant visual clip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It still would have been nice to see the script, credited to Williams and Dan Fogelman ("Cars"), have more of a comedic punch, with fuller character quirks and complexities to go along with the enhanced visual dimension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The generic story line also follows an all-too-traveled path, sharing plot points with Disney's recent "101 Dalmatians" direct-to-DVD sequel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there's a terrific tenderness in Travolta's performance, while Cyrus and company (also including Malcolm McDowell as the diabolical Dr. Calico and James "Inside the Actors Studio" Lipton stretching -- or maybe not -- as a pompous director) are similarly effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And because they had him in the recording studio, anyway, the producers coaxed Travolta into singing an end-credits duet with Cyrus, the sweetly innocuous "I Thought I Lost You."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW Nov 18 (Reuters) - Russia's Gazprom (GAZP.MM) is
considering U.S. majors Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and ConocoPhillips
(COP.N) for its liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Russia's
Arctic Yamal region, its deputy chairman said on Tuesday.
 "The list (of possible participants) is currently being
made, but we do not exclude majors such as Exxon Mobil and
Conoco from joining the project," Alexander Medvedev told
journalists on the sidelines of a gas conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; He also said Gazprom could work in gas projects in Alaska
with Conoco in exchange for the U.S. major gaining access to the
Yuzhno Tambeisky deposits in Arctic Yamal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But nothing concrete has been decided yet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Tanya Mosolova and Katya Golubkova, writing by

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's upcoming security software is not designed to take sales from Symantec Corp and McAfee Inc as it is a stripped-down, free product that focuses purely on anti-virus protection, a Microsoft executive said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Symantec and McAfee tumbled on Wednesday on concerns that Microsoft's new anti-malware program, to be launched in the second half of 2009, would compete with their products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malware, a term derived from the words malicious and software, is designed by hackers to attack personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said on Tuesday it planned to introduce the free security software after discontinuing a $50 security suite that competes with products from Symantec and McAfee, the world's two biggest makers of security software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is really focused on the 50 to 60 percent (of PC users) who don't have, or won't pay for, anti-virus protection, anti-malware protection," Amy Barzdukas, senior director of product management for Microsoft's Online Services and Windows Division, told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's new product, code-named Morro after Brazil's Morro de Sao Paolo beach, only includes anti-malware software, whereas security suites from Symantec and McAfee include encryption, firewalls, password protection, parental controls and data backup programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Morro will be offered around the world, one focus will be on emerging markets such as Brazil where a large number of consumers cannot afford to buy anti-virus suites, Barzdukas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Symantec fell 9.44 percent to $11.23, McAfee dropped 6.62 percent to $26.68, and Microsoft was down 6 percent at $18.45&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle, editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of JPMorgan Chase  Co , Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp tumbled to multiyear lows on Wednesday on expectations that deteriorating credit conditions and a contracting economy will weigh heavily on the three largest U.S. banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares fell as much as 9.6 percent to their lowest level in 5-1/2 years, predating the arrival of Jamie Dimon as chief executive. Citigroup dropped as much as 14.1 percent to a 13-year low, and was surpassed as the fourth-largest bank U.S. by market value by U.S. Bancorp, which has one-eighth as much in assets. Bank of America shares fell as much as 10.9 percent to an 11-1/2-year low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three banks are in the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, and even before Wednesday had lost more than $450 billion of market value from recent highs -- Bank of America in November 2006, Citigroup the next month, and JPMorgan in May 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investor worries swelled after Credit Suisse analysts said two big, new commercial loans were near default. That fanned fears that credit deterioration that has already saturated the residential mortgage market and worsened in credit cards was heading to a major new area, commercial real estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, new government data showed that consumer prices dropped in October at the fastest pace ever, while housing starts that month were the fewest on record. The data showed how fast the already troubled U.S. economy is weakening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Part of the dread is about just how bad the financials have been doing," said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz  Associates Inc, a Toledo, Ohio investment adviser. "Even in those that are supposed to be the leaders -- JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Bank of America -- there's just tremendous, continued declines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup on Wednesday also said it agreed to buy $17.4 billion of assets remaining in a series of funds known as structured investment vehicles. Such vehicles were among the earlier major classes of investments to implode in the global credit crunch that began last year. On Monday, Citigroup announced 52,000 job cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, JPMorgan shares were down $2.63, or 8.2 percent, at $29.51, after earlier falling to $29.06; Citigroup was down $1.05, or 12.6 percent, to $7.31, after earlier falling to $7.18; and Bank of America was off $1.60, or 10.5 percent, to $13.59, after earlier dropping to $13.54.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo, the second-largest U.S. bank by market value after JPMorgan, was down $1.59, or 5.9 percent, to $25.61 in afternoon trading. Wachovia Corp, which Wells Fargo is buying, fell 34 cents, or 6.5 percent, to $4.92. Merrill Lynch  Co, which Bank of America is buying, fell $1.05, or 9.2 percent, to $10.35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Doris Frankel in Chicago and Dan Wilchins in New York, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;  LONG ISLAND, NY, Nov 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
National Grid, the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) and IBM (NYSE: IBM)
are working together on an energy-efficiency program to raise awareness
and increase the use of energy-saving options in their customers'
information technology operations. The three companies are collaborating
as a result of their work with the Advanced Energy Research and
Technology Center (AERTC).

    IBM, National Grid and LIPA announced their plans at the AERTC 2008
Advanced Energy Conference on Long Island, N.Y.

    Energy-efficiency programs like the ones these three companies are
creating can help organizations identify and implement strategies that
apply new technologies and best practices to reduce both energy usage and
energy-related costs. Curtailing fast-growing energy demand from IT can
also help lessen the need to build additional energy generation capacity,
and thus avoid potential new greenhouse gas emissions.

    The new, joint initiative is designed to:


--  Raise customer awareness in National Grid's and LIPA's service areas of
the need to be more attentive to energy and environment issues.
--  Educate IT organizations on how to evaluate, manage and deploy more
"intelligent" IT infrastructures for the future -- with better integration,
monitoring and control -- with lower operating costs and the potential to
delay or decrease future capital investments for power, cooling, or IT
equipment.
--  Educate facilities and IT managers on technologies such as IBM Tivoli
Monitoring for Energy Management and IBM Systems Director Active Energy
Manager that can help them implement an integrated management approach to
their technology infrastructures. An integrated approach enables facilities
and IT managers to create holistic and more efficient plans to manage their
datacenters.
--  Offer energy and IT subject-matter experts and services from LIPA,
National Grid, IBM and qualified business partners that can help
organizations develop and deploy more energy-efficient datacenters.

    
This collaboration adds the strength of IBM's expertise in IT,
software applications, and datacenter management to National Grid's and
LIPA's current energy-efficiency services offerings.

    "This new initiative will help IBM, National Grid and LIPA customers run
their IT operations more efficiently," said Rich Lechner, vice president,
energy and environment, IBM. "By taking advantage of the combined
capabilities of our companies, the resulting set of solutions and services
will help our customers reduce their energy use and improve the overall
efficiency of their business, while at the same time doing good for the
planet."

    "Energy efficiency can help postpone the need to build additional
generating facilities and it also provides tools our customers can utilize
to control their own energy consumption, thereby lowering their monthly
bills," said LIPA President and CEO Kevin S. Law. "It's the cheapest,
cleanest and fastest way to meet Long Island's energy needs while reducing
global warming pollution. We are proud to be partnering with IBM and
National Grid in introducing efficiency concepts in datacenters."

    IBM has intensified its focus on data center energy efficiency as part of,
"IBM Project Big Green," the largest undertaking of its kind in the world.
In addition to its comprehensive set of products and services to help
clients meet their energy and environment goals, the company is taking
action to improve its own operations. One project involves consolidating
3,900 servers to about 30 mainframes which IBM expects will save 80
percent on energy costs and 85 percent on datacenter floor space. One
year into the project, the company has found that for each dollar savings
in energy costs it has achieved, it has seen an additional six to eight
dollars in operational savings.

    Availability

    The new energy-efficiency program will be deployed in early 2009.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings places the following classes of J.P. Morgan Chase, series 2008-C2 on Rating Watch Negative: 

-- $16.0 million class H at 'BBB+'; 

-- $14.6 million class J at 'BBB'; 

-- $14.6 million class K at 'BBB-'; 

-- $8.7 million class L at 'BB+; 

-- $4.4 million class M at 'BB'; 

-- $5.8 million class N at 'BB-'; 

-- $4.4 million class P at 'B+'; 

-- $2.9 million class Q at 'B'; and 

-- $4.4 million class T at 'B-'. 

In addition, Fitch affirms and assigns Outlooks to the following classes: 

-- $22.2 million class A-1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

-- $68.1 million class A-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

-- $105.5 million class A-3 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

-- $54.5 million class A-SB at 'AAA; Outlook Stable; 

-- $354.6 million class A-4 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

-- $145 million class A-4FL at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;

-- $10.2 million class E at 'A+; Outlook Negative; 

-- $13.1 million class F at 'A'; Outlook Negative; and 

-- $11.7 million class G at 'A-'; Outlook Negative. 

The Rating Watch Negative placements are due to the recent transfer of two loans representing approximately 20% of the transaction to special servicing for imminent default. Fitch expects to resolve the Rating Watch status of these classes as more information on the potential workouts of the loans becomes available. 

The Negative Rating Outlooks reflect the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the workouts as various strategies continue to be discussed. The Outlooks may be revised or changed when the Rating Watch status is resolved. 

The largest loan (10.8%) in the transaction is The Promenade Shops at Dos Lagos. The loan is secured by a 345,847 square foot (sf) lifestyle/entertainment retail center built in 2006-2007, which was the first of two phases of development. The sponsor has expressed financial hardship due to the serious downturn in the economy and slower than anticipated growth of the surrounding neighborhood residential real estate market. Fitch's cash flow analysis at issuance considered contractual rent obligations, which represented approximately 91.4% of the net rentable area (NRA) at an average in-place rate of $23.50 per square foot (psf). Cash flow has declined from issuance and is no longer sufficient to meet the monthly debt service obligation. 

The third largest loan (8.9%) in the transaction is a portfolio of two full service Westin Hotels, totaling 899 rooms. The hotels are located in Tucson, AZ, and Hilton Head, SC. The borrowers indicated that they will have difficultly paying debt service going forward as a result of declining market performance. There is approximately $31.5 million of mezzanine debt that is subordinate to the trust amount. The loan is pari passu in that only the $104 million A-2 note is collateral to this transaction; the $105 million A-1 note was securitized in the JPMCC 2007-C1 transaction which is not rated by Fitch. 

The special servicers for the loans are currently reviewing workout options with the borrowers. Fitch will continue to monitor the workout of these loans and their potential effect on the transaction. 

Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com. Published ratings, criteria and methodologies are available from this site, at all times.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Federal Reserve minutes, updated share prices)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu and Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 19 (Reuters) - Shares of JPMorgan Chase  Co
(JPM.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N)
tumbled to multiyear lows on Wednesday on expectations that
deteriorating credit conditions and a contracting economy will
weigh heavily on the three largest U.S. banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In afternoon trading, JPMorgan shares were down $2.88, or 9
percent, at $29.26; Citigroup skidded $1.24, or 14.8 percent,
to $7.12; and Bank of America dropped $1.67, or 11 percent, to
$13.52. Citigroup was displaced as the nation's fourth-largest
bank by market value by U.S. Bancorp (USB.N), which has
one-eighth as many assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of JPMorgan sank to a 5-1/2-year low, predating the
arrival of Jamie Dimon as chief executive, while Citigroup and
Bank of America fell to 13-year lows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The banks are in the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI,
and even before Wednesday had lost more than $450 billion of
market value from their recent highs -- Bank of America in Nov
2006, Citigroup the next month, and JPMorgan in May 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Part of the dread is about just how bad the financials
have been doing," said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz 
Associates Inc, a Toledo, Ohio investment adviser. "Even in
those that are supposed to be the leaders -- JPMorgan, Wells
Fargo (WFC.N), Bank of America -- there's just tremendous,
continued declines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investor worries swelled after Credit Suisse analysts said
two big, new commercial loans were near default. That fanned
fears that credit deterioration that has already saturated the
residential mortgage market and worsened in credit cards was
heading to a major new area, commercial real estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, new government data showed that consumer prices
dropped in October at the fastest pace ever, while housing
starts that month were the fewest on record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And minutes released Wednesday of the Federal Reserve's Oct
28-29 meeting show that the central bank has slashed its
forecast for U.S. economic growth through 2009, and said the
economy could contract next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup on Wednesday also said it agreed to buy $17.4
billion of assets remaining in a series of funds known as
structured investment vehicles. Such vehicles were among the
earlier major classes of investments to implode in the global
credit crunch that began last year. On Monday, Citigroup
announced 52,000 job cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wells Fargo, the second-largest U.S. bank by market value
after JPMorgan, was down $1.48, or 5.4 percent, to $25.72 in
afternoon trading. Wachovia Corp WB.N, which Wells Fargo is
buying, fell 34 cents, or 6.5 percent, to $4.92. Merrill Lynch
 Co MER.N, which Bank of America is buying, fell $1.05, or
9.2 percent, to $10.35.

adding more than 20,000 employees in the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Yahoo fell 19 percent to $9.38, while Microsoft

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 19 (Reuters) - Shares of JPMorgan Chase  Co
(JPM.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N)
tumbled to multiyear lows on Wednesday on expectations that
deteriorating credit conditions and a contracting economy will
weigh heavily on the three largest U.S. banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan shares fell as much as 9.6 percent to their lowest
level in 5-1/2 years, predating the arrival of Jamie Dimon as
chief executive. Citigroup dropped as much as 14.1 percent to a
13-year low, and was surpassed as the fourth-largest bank U.S.
by market value by U.S. Bancorp (USB.N), which has one-eighth
as much in assets. Bank of America shares fell as much as 10.9
percent to an 11-1/2-year low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The three banks are in the Dow Jones industrial average
.DJI, and even before Wednesday had lost more than $450
billion of market value from recent highs -- Bank of America in
November 2006, Citigroup the next month, and JPMorgan in May
2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investor worries swelled after Credit Suisse analysts said
two big, new commercial loans were near default. That fanned
fears that credit deterioration that has already saturated the
residential mortgage market and worsened in credit cards was
heading to a major new area, commercial real estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, new government data showed that consumer prices
dropped in October at the fastest pace ever, while housing
starts that month were the fewest on record. The data showed
how fast the already troubled U.S. economy is weakening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Part of the dread is about just how bad the financials
have been doing," said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz 
Associates Inc, a Toledo, Ohio investment adviser. "Even in
those that are supposed to be the leaders -- JPMorgan, Wells
Fargo (WFC.N), Bank of America -- there's just tremendous,
continued declines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup on Wednesday also said it agreed to buy $17.4
billion of assets remaining in a series of funds known as
structured investment vehicles. Such vehicles were among the
earlier major classes of investments to implode in the global
credit crunch that began last year. On Monday, Citigroup
announced 52,000 job cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
JPMorgan shares were down $2.63, or 8.2 percent, at $29.51,
after earlier falling to $29.06; Citigroup was down $1.05, or
12.6 percent, to $7.31, after earlier falling to $7.18; and
Bank of America was off $1.60, or 10.5 percent, to $13.59,
after earlier dropping to $13.54.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wells Fargo, the second-largest U.S. bank by market value
after JPMorgan, was down $1.59, or 5.9 percent, to $25.61 in
afternoon trading. Wachovia Corp WB.N, which Wells Fargo is
buying, fell 34 cents, or 6.5 percent, to $4.92. Merrill Lynch
 Co MER.N, which Bank of America is buying, fell $1.05, or
9.2 percent, to $10.35.

&lt;p&gt;  VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, Nov 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Simba Technologies Inc., industry's choice for standards-based relational
and multi-dimensional data connectivity, announced today that it will
demonstrate native Microsoft(R) Excel(R) 2007 connectivity to Oracle(R)
OLAP 11g at the Business Intelligence Warehousing and Analytics (BIWA)
Summit at Oracle World Headquarters on December 2-3, 2008. Excel 2007
connectivity for Oracle, built using Simba's MDX 2005 Query Language
technology, provides users with an unprecedented level of access and
functionality that is the same as native Excel connectivity to Microsoft
Analysis Services and SAP NetWeaver(R) BI.

    "Microsoft continues to add business intelligence and OLAP functionality
to Excel," said Amyn Rajan, Simba's CEO who will be attending the event.
"Native Excel 2007 connectivity to Oracle enables Oracle customers to
perform ad hoc query and analysis and take full advantage of all the
latest BI and OLAP functionality within Excel."

    With native connectivity, Oracle customers can easily and directly
connect the latest version of Microsoft Excel to Oracle data cubes to
gain advanced analytics. Simba's MDX 2005 Query Language technology, upon
which the connectivity is based, is compliant with the latest MDX
enhancements from Microsoft.

    "The MDX 2005 Query Language is the key to gaining functionality with all
the latest OLAP business intelligence and analytics applications like
Excel 2007. This is a big win for both Oracle and Microsoft customers,"
added Rajan.

    With direct Microsoft Excel 2007 connectivity to Oracle OLAP 11g, Oracle
customers can upgrade to Microsoft's latest Excel version to take
advantage of its enhanced dimensional and analytics capabilities.

    Simba's BIWA Summit 2008 demonstrations will show IT/Oracle
Administrators and Business Analysts how they can streamline, directly
connect to and analyze their Oracle data from current OLAP tools like
Excel. Simba will preview a new MDX 2005 Query Language provider that
enables direct connectivity to Oracle OLAP 11g, enabling access and
advanced functionality within applications like Excel 2007 Pivot Tables.

    Simba representatives will be at the conference to provide demonstrations
of native Excel 2007 connectivity to Oracle OLAP 11g. Simba, a BIWA
Summit 2008 Gold Sponsor, will also present a conference session on
December 2nd, highlighting functionality in Microsoft Excel 2007 Pivot
Tables and explaining MDX 2005 Query Language connectivity options for
Oracle OLAP for enhanced business intelligence. Simba will also
demonstrate ad hoc query and reporting capabilities of Excel 2007 against
Oracle OLAP.

    "We're excited to have Simba involved in BIWA Summit 2008 and present
new, simplified solutions for connecting popular applications like Excel
to Oracle," said Dan Vlamis, Conference Chair for BIWA Summit 2008. "We
are excited that they have chosen BIWA Summit 2008 to debut new
technology."

&lt;p&gt;New Branding Honored
BLOOMFIELD, Conn.--(Business Wire)--
B-to-B Magazine has honored CIGNA's Michael Showalter as one of its 2008 Top Marketers of the Year for his leadership role in developing a comprehensive marketing campaign and corporate rebranding effort to help simplify health care. The campaign, one of the most significant ever undertaken by CIGNA, included not only mass media advertising, but also several consumer education programs designed to help people better understand how to improve their health and take the best advantage of the health care plan available to them. The company&#8217;s programs also include innovative use of online sites such as Facebook. 

&#8220;It&#8217;s imperative that our industry recognize that the health care system could be improved,&#8221; said Showalter, CIGNA's vice president for strategy and marketing. &#8220;At CIGNA, we know that we can&#8217;t reform the health system overnight, but we can start the reform process.&#8221; 

Showalter chose Doremus, a New York-based advertising company, to create the campaign entitled &#8220;It's time to feel better.&#8221; The campaign directs consumers to www.itstimetofeelbetter.com, an interactive Web site offering consumer health tips and health care education. The television commercials ran in Georgia and Colorado on cable and broadcast, while print ads appeared across the nation. 

Showalter also recognized the value in emerging media and sponsorships, leading an online advertising campaign on ESPN and Yahoo and reaching out to consumers using non-traditional media like video games, Second Life and Facebook. 

&#8220;We want to involve individuals in the process,&#8221; said Showalter. &#8220;They can help us get our health care system working again.&#8221; 

Showalter joined CIGNA in 2005 from Definity Health, where he pioneered one of the nation's first consumer-driven health plans, bringing extensive consumer marketing background to the company. 

CIGNA (NYSE:CI), a global health service company, is dedicated to helping people improve their health, well-being and security. CIGNA Corporation's operating subsidiaries provide an integrated suite of medical, dental, behavioral health, pharmacy and vision care benefits, as well as group life, accident and disability insurance, to approximately 47 million people throughout the United States and around the world.

&lt;p&gt;Plans to Help Organisations Reduce Costs and Increase Productivity Using Enterprise Speech Analytics
FORT MYERS, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
CallMiner Inc., the industry leader in advanced speech analytics, today announced it had promoted Adam Walton to Vice President International effective immediately. Walton will be responsible for CallMiner's business outside of the U.S. and Canada, and he will be based in CallMiner's U.K. office. 

&#8220;Enterprises in the United Kingdom and Europe continue to lead the rest of the world in the early adoption of speech analytics,&#8221; said Terry Leahy, CallMiner's president and chief executive officer. &#8220;Adam has a keen understanding of these market dynamics and has helped one of our largest global customers achieve their programme goals on time and under budget. Adam was the perfect choice for this new role.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;FREEPORT, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Landowner Jolly Bay LLC, a company dedicated to responsible and sustainable growth for Walton County and its residents, has filed a petition with the Circuit Court to reverse the Board of County Commissioners of Walton County, Fla.&#8217;s denial of its project, which is located &#189; mile from the northeast 331 bridge landing off Jolly Bay Road. The County Commission, on September 22, 2008, denied the project based on an unadopted standard made up by County staff after receiving public opposition to the project. The project includes an upscale recreational vehicle park, a bed &amp; breakfast, a 73-unit condominium, a boat docking facility and commercial spaces. Setting this project apart from other local projects, the plans had the project situated on 17 acres of a 60-acre tract of land in order to preserve 43 acres of natural beauty, and to ensure the integrity of, and compatibility with the surrounding area. 

&#8220;Developers worked closely with the planning department staff over a two-year period to design the project to meet all Walton County Comprehensive Plan and Land Development Code requirements before submitting its application. The plan met all requirements and received a unanimous vote in favor by the Planning Commission, only to have the Walton County Commissioners vote unanimously to deny the project based on an unadopted standard made up by County staff after receiving public opposition to the project,&#8221; stated Dana Matthews, of Matthews and Hawkins, attorney for Jolly Bay. 

Matthews explained, &#8220;What is most disturbing is that the County Commission and County Staff are&#160;repeating the same error that caused the Walton County Circuit Court to overturn a County Commission decision to deny the Inlet Beach project in 2001.&#8221; In the 2001 Inlet Beach Capital case, the Circuit Court reversed the Walton County Board of County Commissioner&#8217;s denial of a project and held that Walton County cannot base the denial of projects on its own un-adopted subjective interpretations of its land use regulations because landowners must have notice of the conditions that they must meet in order to improve their property. &#8220;It is disappointing that the County Commission has again denied a project in this manner, and that it has cost this landowner millions of dollars and now they have no choice but to go to the Court system to seek a remedy,&#8221; he added. 

Jolly Bay LLC is represented by Dana Matthews, of Matthews and Hawkins, at 850-837-3662, who is available for comment.

&lt;p&gt;Armament Research Development and Engineering Center improves employee productivity with quick return on investment
BOSTON--(Business Wire)--
Nucleus Research analysts examined the deployment of IBM Cognos 8 BI version 8.3 at the United States Army&#8217;s Armament Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) and found the company achieved a 146% return on investment (ROI) in less than 19 months. 

ARDEC is the US Army&#8217;s principal research, developer and sustainer of current and future armament and munitions systems. It is responsible for the development, production, field support and demilitarization of munitions, weapons, fire-control systems and related equipment used by US soldiers. Looking to cut costs and boost productivity, ARDEC explored enhancing business intelligence for more efficient operations. 

With the latest version of IBM Cognos 8 BI software, the US Army has improved how it uses business intelligence to boost productivity of analysts and its finance staff. ARDEC has standardized report creation for new efficiencies and now has a program for best practice propagation across the organization. 

&#8220;Implementing IBM Cognos&#8217; business intelligence reporting solution on top of SAP and other data sources has dramatically improved ARDEC&#8217;s ability to view and analyze more relevant, accurate, validated information. As a result, ARDEC can make more effective strategic business decisions about engineering programs that ultimately help get weapons in the hands of soldiers more quickly,&#8221; said Barbara Kovalsky, Chief Financial Business Intelligence and Corporate Financial Operations, ARDEC. 

&#8220;ARDEC achieved high ROI by putting BI into the hands of as many people as possible, while letting them create and fine-tune their own BI tools. Those who consume information are more productive because they have the data they need, and those who had been building reports have moved onto more important tasks,&#8221; said David O&#8217;Connell, Senior Analyst, Nucleus Research. 

The full case study is available at NucleusResearch.com All Nucleus Research ROI case studies are independent assessments, evaluating the costs and benefits from the IT deployment.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - To impress shareholders, Yahoo Inc's (YHOO.O) next chief executive needs just one qualification: the willingness to do a deal with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's because this remains Yahoo's best option, short of a dramatic turnaround plan, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if Microsoft does eventually buy Yahoo, shareholders should brace themselves for a price far lower than the $47.5 billion the software behemoth offered earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street analysts estimate that Microsoft would not offer more than $17-$20 per share for Yahoo, whose stock has fallen below $12 from a high of $30.25 in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online display advertising, a core Yahoo business, has also shrunk as corporate advertisers scale back on Web marketing promotions amid a global economic slump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Chief Executive Jerry Yang, who on Monday agreed to step down from his role once the board finds a replacement, Yahoo searched for alternatives to being bought, exploring partnerships with Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Time Warner Inc's (TWX.N) AOL unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Google, which struck a search advertising deal with Yahoo in June only to abandon it as regulatory concerns grew, is unlikely to come back for more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Yahoo's months-long discussions with Time Warner about combining its AOL unit, have not led to a deal so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Microsoft, for all its proclamations to the contrary, still needs Yahoo's assets to bolster its presence in online search and advertising, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the scales will be tipped in Microsoft's favor if and when the new Yahoo CEO does reach out to negotiate a new deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not going to be Microsoft calling Yahoo saying, 'We're making a bid for $17 a share'," Needham  Co analyst Mark May said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is done negotiating with Yahoo. If Yahoo wants to do a deal, its board needs to have full agreement" on the price they want to sell the company for, May added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft offered to buy Yahoo for $44.6 billion on January 31, which Yahoo rejected. It sweetened its cash-and-stock bid to $47.5 billion, but withdrew it after talks fell apart on price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft later came back with a proposal to buy Yahoo's search assets, but Yahoo turned it down as well, choosing to team up with archrival Google instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo and Time Warner also began talking about a deal under which Yahoo would fold AOL's online content and advertising assets into its operations, with Time Warner taking a stake in the combined company, sources have told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite advanced talks, a deal hasn't happened because of challenges to valuing the businesses given the weak advertising market and Yahoo's falling stock price, as well as concerns over integrating the platforms, the sources have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have been skeptical about such a deal because they don't believe it would dramatically improve Yahoo's earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yahoo-AOL? What would that bring to the table? There's no point in having a marriage of convenience. It's not going to last," said Mukul Krishna, global digital media director at Frost  Sullivan, a research and consulting firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krishna said Yahoo's shareholders are looking for something more tangible to offset the stock's losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo needs either a substantial turnaround plan, complete with cost-cutting and a "roadmap to profitability," or an acquisition by Microsoft to satisfy investors, Krishna said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft will be only too happy to restart the conversation, but it will be calling the shots," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activist investor Carl Icahn's presence on Yahoo's board may help bring Microsoft to the table, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn, a major Yahoo shareholder, has publicly reiterated hopes of a Yahoo-Microsoft deal several times. He did not return calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said they expect Microsoft to eventually come back because it needs Yahoo nearly as much as Yahoo needs it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft wants Yahoo's search audience, the traffic, the clicks," Needham's May said. "They want to have as much as Google does. So it's important for Microsoft to have a big presence in search and display."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Cowen  Co analyst Jim Friedland said Microsoft is unlikely to want to rush into talks with Yahoo even with a new CEO knocking on its door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both companies are seeing declines in their Web businesses due to the global economic downturn, and as Yahoo's "only potential buyer," Microsoft can take its time, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anupreeta Das; editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

in the region, a TPAO source told Reuters previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Drilling is expected to begin by the end of 2009 or the
start of 2010 if oil is found in the Black Sea, where officials
estimate the volume of reserves at 10 billion barrels.

&lt;p&gt;  TORONTO, ONTARIO, Nov 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Compugen announced today that it has been selected as the winner in the
Large Account Reseller-Program Excellence category at the 2008 Microsoft
Partner Program IMPACT Awards. Compugen was also named winner in the
category Desktop Deployment of Office &amp; Windows Vista. The sixth annual
IMPACT awards recognize excellence across the large and diverse community
of Microsoft's Canadian technology partners. The winners were announced
at a gala event in Toronto on November 13, 2008.

    "As real leaders in their fields, technology partners like Compugen
continue to help customers optimize their business performance," said
Lora Gernon, Senior Director, Partner Group, Microsoft Canada Co. "Our
annual IMPACT Awards celebrates top technology partners who have shown
true passion through their tremendous service to customers and innovative
solutions."

    Compugen was chosen as the best Canadian large-account reseller for its
comprehensive and innovative approach to licensing for large accounts,
including robust sales and marketing execution that led to the highest
growth in sales in Canada, operational excellence, deep licensing
expertise and the technical capabilities and experience to help customers
deploy and operate their technology - true end to end business value for
customers. Its award for business desktop deployment recognizes the
state-of-the-art deployment methodology that has enabled Compugen's
customers to adopt new technology with ease.

    "This new LAR award recognizes that customer requirements for the
purchase of software are changing from "transaction" to "adoption". It is
no longer of sufficient value to them to simply transact a license sale.
Today, customers require a LAR to be able to bring a depth of expertise
in related services that enables customers to adopt the technology in
order to realize the true value of their business desktop; for example,
through exercising their software assurance benefits with a trusted
partner of the highest in-house technical competence using streamlined
deployment methods and complete lifecycle services," said Harry Zarek,
Compugen's President and CEO. "We are particularly proud to be the most
technically competent Microsoft LAR in Canada as evidenced by our
standing in the Microsoft Partner Program and by the many awards we have
received both in Canada and worldwide, including the 2007 and 2008
Worldwide awards for excellence in the deployment of business desktops
and Exchange server."

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Repeats story first issued Nov. 18) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Anupreeta Das &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 18 (Reuters) - To impress shareholders, Yahoo Inc's (YHOO.O) next chief executive needs just one qualification: the willingness to do a deal with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    That's because this remains Yahoo's best option, short of a dramatic turnaround plan, analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But if Microsoft does eventually buy Yahoo, shareholders should brace themselves for a price far lower than the $47.5 billion the software behemoth offered earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Wall Street analysts estimate that Microsoft would not offer more than $17-$20 per share for Yahoo, whose stock has fallen below $12 from a high of $30.25 in February. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Online display advertising, a core Yahoo business, has also shrunk as corporate advertisers scale back on Web marketing promotions amid a global economic slump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Under Chief Executive Jerry Yang, who on Monday agreed to step down from his role once the board finds a replacement, Yahoo searched for alternatives to being bought, exploring partnerships with Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Time Warner Inc's (TWX.N) AOL unit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But Google, which struck a search advertising deal with Yahoo in June only to abandon it as regulatory concerns grew, is unlikely to come back for more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Meanwhile, Yahoo's months-long discussions with Time Warner about combining its AOL unit, have not led to a deal so far. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    And Microsoft, for all its proclamations to the contrary, still needs Yahoo's assets to bolster its presence in online search and advertising, analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But the scales will be tipped in Microsoft's favor if and when the new Yahoo CEO does reach out to negotiate a new deal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It's not going to be Microsoft calling Yahoo saying, 'We're making a bid for $17 a share'," Needham &amp; Co analyst Mark May said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Microsoft is done negotiating with Yahoo. If Yahoo wants to do a deal, its board needs to have full agreement" on the price they want to sell the company for, May added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft offered to buy Yahoo for $44.6 billion on Jan. 31, which Yahoo rejected. It sweetened its cash-and-stock bid to $47.5 billion, but withdrew it after talks fell apart on price. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft later came back with a proposal to buy Yahoo's search assets, but Yahoo turned it down as well, choosing to team up with archrival Google instead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Yahoo and Time Warner also began talking about a deal under which Yahoo would fold AOL's online content and advertising assets into its operations, with Time Warner taking a stake in the combined company, sources have told Reuters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Despite advanced talks, a deal hasn't happened because of challenges to valuing the businesses given the weak advertising market and Yahoo's falling stock price, as well as concerns over integrating the platforms, the sources have said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts have been skeptical about such a deal because they don't believe it would dramatically improve Yahoo's earnings.  "Yahoo-AOL? What would that bring to the table? There's no point in having a marriage of convenience. It's not going to last," said Mukul Krishna, global digital media director at Frost &amp; Sullivan, a research and consulting firm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Krishna said Yahoo's shareholders are looking for something more tangible to offset the stock's losses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Yahoo needs either a substantial turnaround plan, complete with cost-cutting and a "roadmap to profitability," or an acquisition by Microsoft to satisfy investors, Krishna said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Microsoft will be only too happy to restart the conversation, but it will be calling the shots," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Activist investor Carl Icahn's presence on Yahoo's board may help bring Microsoft to the table, analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Icahn, a major Yahoo shareholder, has publicly reiterated hopes of a Yahoo-Microsoft deal several times. He did not return calls seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts said they expect Microsoft to eventually come back because it needs Yahoo nearly as much as Yahoo needs it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Microsoft wants Yahoo's search audience, the traffic, the clicks," Needham's May said. "They want to have as much as Google does. So it's important for Microsoft to have a big presence in search and display." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But Cowen &amp; Co analyst Jim Friedland said Microsoft is unlikely to want to rush into talks with Yahoo even with a new CEO knocking on its door. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Both companies are seeing declines in their Web businesses due to the global economic downturn, and as Yahoo's "only potential buyer," Microsoft can take its time, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Anupreeta Das; editing by Richard Chang) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((anupreeta.das@thomsonreuters.com; +1 415 677 2511; Reuters Messaging: anupreeta.das.reuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: YAHOO/  Keywords: YAHOO/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2008.

Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets.

Here are highlights from Tuesday&#8217;s Analyst Blog:

Chevron Outlook Improved

We are maintaining our Buy recommendation for San Ramon, California-based Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX), the 4th largest publicly traded oil and gas company, based on proved reserves, following the company's third-quarter results, which benefited from strong upstream and much-improved downstream performance. 

On November 3, Chevron agreed to sell its marketing businesses in Kenya and Uganda to Total SA (NYSE: TOT). We believe that the company is capable of generating above peer group average production and reserve growth in the long run. Our unchanged $100 price objective is based on 9.9x our revised 2009 EPS estimate, in-line with its historical trading pattern relative to its peers. 

CarMax Valuation Too High

CarMax, Inc. (NYSE: KMX) continues to face a difficult used-vehicle environment, largely due to aggressive incentives from new vehicle manufacturers. Declining used-car value due to the ongoing weakness in the overall economy and higher funding cost at the CarMax Auto Finance are eroding the margins of the company. 

The current economic slowdown and reduced consumer spending had a negative impact on the company's retail business. It is aggressively cutting prices on trucks and SUVs to reduce inventory. A drop in earnings and a conservative guidance for 2009 along with a higher valuation make us apprehensive about the stock's performance in the near term. 

McCormick &amp; Schmick's a Hold

McCormick &amp; Schmick's Seafood Restaurant (Nasdaq: MSSR), based in Portland, Oregon, is a leading national seafood restauranteur operating in the affordable upscale dining segment. The company's traffic and comps are falling at an accelerating rate as the recession and stock market crash darken consumer psychology. With no franchises, the company is highly levered to changes in comps and we expect fourth-quarter EPS to fall 33%. 

Longer term however, we think the company is well positioned to weather the recession with a solid balance sheet, well contained G expenses, and food and labor costs that in fourth quarter began declining as a percentage of revenue. Low leverage is enabling the company to comfortably continue its expansion plan, which has been greatly scaled back for 2009 to 6 units from 11 planned for 2009. 

Nat'l Resrc Ptrs a Cheaper Buy

We are maintaining our Buy recommendation on Houston, TX-based Natural Resource Partners, L.P. (NYSE: NRP), a master limited partnership engaged mainly in owning and managing coal properties in the Appalachian region, the Illinois basin and the Powder River basin. However, we are decreasing our target price from $40 to $33.50 per unit. 

The partnership looks to improve distributable cash flow next year as its lessees have locked in '09 coal production at prices above 08 levels. Its low CapEx requirements, strong cash flow profile and $250 MM of available liquidity should put the partnership in a strong position in 2009.

Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Dell Inc. (Nasdaq: DELL), Hewlett-Packard Co. (NYSE: HPQ), IBM Corp. (NYSE: IBM), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) and Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE: EPD).

Here are highlights from Tuesday&#8217;s Analyst Blog:

DELL is Now a Sell

Dell Inc. (NYSE: DELL) has been making progress on channel strategies, operations, and new products since Michael Dell retook control of the company last year. However, Dell is likely experiencing headwinds from a slowing global economy and its share price has been sliding since reporting disappointing first quarter earnings on August 28th. 

Dell is currently trading near its recent low price that translates to a P/E multiple of 7.4X our FY2009 EPS estimate of $1.48, a discount to the industry median as well as to its core competitors, Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE: HPQ) and IBM Corp. (NYSE: IBM). Dell appears to be headed back in the direction of cutting prices to gain share at the expense of profitability, its traditional reaction to declining market share. Given the company's history, we do not expect much investor interest in the stock until Dell can demonstrate that this is a profitable strategy. 

Caterpillar Balancing Out

Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) reported third quarter EPS of $1.39, below our expectations of $1.59, due to higher material costs, weaker machine sales volume in North America and Europe, and an unfavorable currency movement. 

The company maintained its full-year 2008 outlook. The company expects sales and revenues to top $50 billion and EPS to be about $6.00. For 2009, CAT currently expects sales and revenue to be about flat with its 2008 results. As long as commodity prices stay above the marginal cost of production, we believe global mining and energy markets can provide an offset to weaker construction spending. 

Enterprise a Buy-Rated MLP

Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE: EPD) reported strong third-quarter results, raised quarterly distribution, and declared that it had sufficient internal resources to meet its next year's growth capital needs. Total gross operating margin increased 32% year-over-year, primarily driven by the diversified NGL (natural gas liquids) and natural gas pipeline and storage businesses. 

Importantly, the partnership announced a 6.6% year-over-year increase in quarterly distribution to the annualized run rate of $2.09 per unit. Quarterly distributable cash flows provided very comfortable 1.2x coverage to cash distributions to limited partners.

</body></entry><entry author="Carl DiOrio" date="2008-11-19T10:09:48+0000" url="http://www.reuters.com/article/filmNews/idUSTRE4AI2RG20081119"><headline>Disney, Imax think 3-D</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Imax has big things planned for Disney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the giant-screen exhibitor announced a comprehensive pact with Disney to release five 3-D movies in Imax theaters simultaneously with their openings in conventional venues. The deal follows Imax's success from a long-running relationship with Warner Bros. and more recent day-and-date arrangements with other studios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Disney agreement will launch with the November 6, 2009, release of Robert Zemeckis' 3-D animated feature "A Christmas Carol." It may be no coincidence that Zemeckis' animated seasonal drama "The Polar Express" -- which Warners unspooled in 2004 -- saw outsized grosses when released simultaneously in scores of Imax 3-D venues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Imax has a great track record and a loyal following when it comes to presenting epic entertainment," Disney distribution president Chuck Viane said. "We believe we have a unique and exciting slate of films that lend themselves to the Imax format."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imax has been aggressively working to transition from an emphasis on space and nature films to the regular release of commercial Hollywood tentpoles in its proprietary giant-screen format. In a related move, Imax is converting hundreds of its auditoriums to digital projection in a transition to digital 3-D exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, the giant-screen exhibitor has used special film prints in programing occasional 3-D titles. But Imax missed out this year on Disney's digital 3-D phenom "Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imax Filmed Entertainment chief Greg Foster said the Disney pact "dovetails ideally with our strategy to build a slate of top-quality movies from the best filmmakers and studios."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imax succeeded impressively on that score with Warners' "The Dark Knight," whose $995 million in worldwide box office includes more than $62 million in giant-screen grosses from hundreds of Imax 2-D venues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imax is now showing DreamWorks Animation's family comedy "Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa" in many of its auditoriums, and DWA's 3-D tentpole "Monsters vs. Aliens" figures prominently in Imax's first-quarter plans. The Toronto-based company launched a five-film pact with DreamWorks Animation in the summer with "Kung Fu Panda."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imax had been set to play Warners' "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" over the holidays until the studio postponed its scheduled opening for the adventure tentpole until July. To compensate in the fourth quarter, Imax recently inked an agreement with Fox to open "The Day the Earth Stood Still" in dozens of giant-screen venues simultaneously with its December 12 bow in conventional theaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zend PHP Project Now Speedier, Gains Significant Momentum with IBM i, additional AJAX support, &amp; Adobe Contribution of AMF for PHP-based Adobe Flash &amp; Flex Web Applications
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Zend Technologies, Inc. (privately held, venture-backed) announced today at Adobe Systems&#8217; (NASDAQ: ADBE) annual gathering of web designers and software development professionals that they have jointly delivered support in Zend Framework 1.7 for Action Message Format (AMF), a key element of their partnership to improve rich Internet application development. 

Zend Framework 1.7 also features significant performance enhancements, speeding load times by 25%-50%, makes available for general release a native DB2 Adapter to access DB2/400 data on the IBM i platform, updates Dojo Toolkit support (including a new editor dijit), and also provides, through a Zend Framework community contribution, a component for the popular JQuery AJAX library. 

&#8220;Over the life of the Zend Framework project, with close to 9.5 million downloads since project inception, momentum and community support has consistently continued to grow,&#8221; said Andi Gutmans,&#160;CTO, Sr. VP R and Alliances,&#160;and co-founder at Zend. &#8220;New to this release is a native DB2 driver for the fast-growing IBM i platform, plus we&#8217;ve incorporated our agile continuous integration process for IBM i meaning Zend Framework on i5/OS gets unit-tested thoroughly and continuously as we make changes to the code.&#8221; 

&#8220;We&#8217;re particularly proud that in Zend Framework 1.7 the community contributions make up well over half of the new and improved components,&#8221; continued Gutmans, &#8220;including a component for the JQuery AJAX JavaScript library. We&#8217;re also really happy that Adobe Systems has joined the Zend Framework project as a contributor with a new AMF component supporting their Flex framework and the Flash Platform, part of a larger partnership with them, which also includes cooperation aimed to ensure their FlexBuilder environment works with our Zend Studio PHP development environment on the Eclipse platform.&#8221; 

Zend Framework is a Zend-sponsored open source PHP application framework best known for its support for flexible, efficient creation of web applications. The Flex framework is a highly productive, open source framework from Adobe for building and maintaining expressive Web applications that deploy consistently across all major browsers and operating systems using Adobe&#174; Flash Player. 

Integration of AMF support into Zend Framework means PHP developers can now use the open, binary, high-speed format to enable their applications built with Adobe Flex&#174; and Adobe Flash&#174; to easily and rapidly exchange data with their servers. 

PHP developers can now immediately download the latest release of Zend Framework 1.7 and leverage the fast, reliable transfer of data between the server and client tiers of their web applications. To download Zend Framework&#8217;s latest version or to learn more, please visit http://framework.zend.com and for more details &amp; tutorials on using the AMF component, please visit http://developer.adobe.com/flex/

&#8220;Adobe Flex and Flash are being rapidly adopted by developers, enterprise IT departments and independent software providers who rely on the power and capabilities of PHP,&#8221; said Michele Turner, vice president, product marketing and management at Adobe. &#8220;Today, we&#8217;ve enabled those developers using Flex and Zend Framework to rapidly deliver rich, highly engaging web applications to both the browser and the desktop.&#8221; 

One customer already making use of the new Action Message Format support in Zend Framework is Synapse Group, an interactive agency with creative artists and software developers jointly building high-touch web technology for Fortune 100 clientele, so they can effectively engage consumers: 

&#8220;Our mission is to create unforgettable user experiences. Zend&#8217;s solutions have allowed us to do just that. Support in Zend Framework for Adobe&#8217;s Flash Platform means we can integrate our rich Adobe Flex and Flash front-end user interfaces with our PHP-driven back-end platforms much faster and more reliably, while delivering high-value for our clients and for our own technology platform offerings,&#8221; said Zach Saltzberg, Founder and Creative Director at Synapse Group. &#8220;We have leveraged Zend &amp; Adobe&#8217;s technology to develop our latest products and platforms, including Syndeca &#8211; our rich media publishing platform in use by Fortune 100 companies, Plexity &#8211; our customized tracking &amp; analytics solution, and Sharality - a viral sharing, auto-installing tool connecting the social web.&#8221; 

&#8220;Zend_Amf&#160;delivers many advantages over other AMF back-ends&#8212;like a vibrant open source community and wide support. As early adopters of AMF technology for web application development, we&#8217;re happy that Zend &amp; Adobe have delivered this key technology together so we can have all our application components standardized on one framework and a single application stack,&#8221; says Kai Harris, Director of Operations at Synapse Group. &#8220;This simplifies our internal development and test process, as well as reduces the operations overhead needed to manage our application clusters.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - To impress shareholders, Yahoo Inc's next chief executive needs just one qualification: the willingness to do a deal with Microsoft Corp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's because this remains Yahoo's best option, short of a dramatic turnaround plan, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if Microsoft does eventually buy Yahoo, shareholders should brace themselves for a price far lower than the $47.5 billion the software behemoth offered earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street analysts estimate that Microsoft would not offer more than $17-$20 per share for Yahoo, whose stock has fallen below $12 from a high of $30.25 in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online display advertising, a core Yahoo business, has also shrunk as corporate advertisers scale back on Web marketing promotions amid a global economic slump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Chief Executive Jerry Yang, who on Monday agreed to step down from his role once the board finds a replacement, Yahoo searched for alternatives to being bought, exploring partnerships with Google Inc and Time Warner Inc's AOL unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Google, which struck a search advertising deal with Yahoo in June only to abandon it as regulatory concerns grew, is unlikely to come back for more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Yahoo's months-long discussions with Time Warner about combining its AOL unit, have not led to a deal so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Microsoft, for all its proclamations to the contrary, still needs Yahoo's assets to bolster its presence in online search and advertising, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the scales will be tipped in Microsoft's favor if and when the new Yahoo CEO does reach out to negotiate a new deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not going to be Microsoft calling Yahoo saying, 'We're making a bid for $17 a share'," Needham  Co analyst Mark May said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is done negotiating with Yahoo. If Yahoo wants to do a deal, its board needs to have full agreement" on the price they want to sell the company for, May added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft offered to buy Yahoo for $44.6 billion on January 31, which Yahoo rejected. It sweetened its cash-and-stock bid to $47.5 billion, but withdrew it after talks fell apart on price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft later came back with a proposal to buy Yahoo's search assets, but Yahoo turned it down as well, choosing to team up with archrival Google instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo and Time Warner also began talking about a deal under which Yahoo would fold AOL's online content and advertising assets into its operations, with Time Warner taking a stake in the combined company, sources have told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite advanced talks, a deal hasn't happened because of challenges to valuing the businesses given the weak advertising market and Yahoo's falling stock price, as well as concerns over integrating the platforms, the sources have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have been skeptical about such a deal because they don't believe it would dramatically improve Yahoo's earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yahoo-AOL? What would that bring to the table? There's no point in having a marriage of convenience. It's not going to last," said Mukul Krishna, global digital media director at Frost  Sullivan, a research and consulting firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krishna said Yahoo's shareholders are looking for something more tangible to offset the stock's losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo needs either a substantial turnaround plan, complete with cost-cutting and a "roadmap to profitability," or an acquisition by Microsoft to satisfy investors, Krishna said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft will be only too happy to restart the conversation, but it will be calling the shots," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activist investor Carl Icahn's presence on Yahoo's board may help bring Microsoft to the table, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn, a major Yahoo shareholder, has publicly reiterated hopes of a Yahoo-Microsoft deal several times. He did not return calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said they expect Microsoft to eventually come back because it needs Yahoo nearly as much as Yahoo needs it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft wants Yahoo's search audience, the traffic, the clicks," Needham's May said. "They want to have as much as Google does. So it's important for Microsoft to have a big presence in search and display."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Cowen  Co analyst Jim Friedland said Microsoft is unlikely to want to rush into talks with Yahoo even with a new CEO knocking on its door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both companies are seeing declines in their Web businesses due to the global economic downturn, and as Yahoo's "only potential buyer," Microsoft can take its time, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anupreeta Das; editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - After pulling the plug on an experimental obesity drug from a troubled class of medicines, Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) Chief Executive Jeff Kindler said the world's largest drug maker would continue to pursue treatments for the emerging health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether from its own research and development or through licensing deals, Kindler is hopeful Pfizer can come up with a viable weight loss drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a group of scientists that spend a lot of time on discovery in that area and it is certainly something that we look to doing both internally and with alliances," Kindler said at the Reuters Health Summit in New York on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a huge unmet medical need that has to be addressed and we hope to be at the forefront of that science," Kindler said, echoing similar comments from top executives of Merck and AstraZeneca about the need for obesity medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Pfizer joined a growing list of drug makers that abandoned obesity treatments which work as an appetite suppressant by blocking the receptors in the brain that make people hungry after smoking marijuana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it was terminating late stage development of its experimental obesity drug, CP-945,598, citing a more conservative regulatory climate and problems seen with other medicines from the same class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The class of drugs known as cannabinoid receptor antagonists have been linked to psychiatric side effects, such as depression and suicidal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merck  Co (MRK.N), Belgium's Solvay SA (SOLB.BR) and Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) -- whose Acomplia was the first medicine in what was once seen as a promising class -- recently pulled the plug on their cannabinoid weight loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca has another experimental cannabinoid obesity drug called AZD2207 in mid-stage development that it has yet to declare dead in the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca CEO David Brennan declined this week to divulge the fate of that drug, but it appears to be a longshot to reach the market at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If this is a class issue then it's going to be difficult," Brennan said of the psychiatric side effects seen with similar drugs. "But we look at it the context of does our compound have some unique differentiating characteristics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its own disappointment with its taranabant cannabinoid drug Merck, like Pfizer, plans to forge ahead with research in the chemical weight loss arena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're putting major resources into obesity both internally and externally," Merck CEO Richard Clark told the Health Summit this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity is emerging as one of the biggest health crises facing the developed world. It is expected to weigh heavily on future health care costs because it leads to serious chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in July that more than a quarter of all Americans are now classified as obese with children a fast growing part of the epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kindler called obesity "a critically important unmet medical need."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It involves so many different aspects," he said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration was hurt by turnover at the top during the George W. Bush administration and needs a strong, independent leader, Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) Chief Executive Jeff Kindler said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four different officials led the FDA during Bush's tenure, which started in 2001. More than half of that time, the top spot was filled by a temporary leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we've had in the last eight years is we've have had a lot of turnover in the leadership of that agency for a variety of reasons. Any organization, especially one with that kind of scientific mission, benefits from stability in leadership," Kindler told the Reuters Health Summit in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think it was good for the FDA to have as many changes of leadership that it has had," Kindler added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Bush's presidency, the FDA struggled through drug safety controversies and came under attack by lawmakers and consumer groups. Drug makers complained the agency became unpredictable and too focused on drug side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kindler, head of the world's largest drug maker, said it was a "worthy idea" to consider a fixed term for FDA commissioner. Now, the president can select a new leader at any point during his four years in office. A 2006 Institute of Medicine report recommended a fixed, six-year term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fixed term could "would to some extent remove them from the political pressures." Kindler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need a strong, independent, well-resourced FDA. The starting point for that is to have a commissioner who has strong scientific credentials and credibility and stature who can bring independence to bear on the agency, to ensure that it is proceeding as far from politics as is possible," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency has "many, many really terrific, hard-working scientists who are really dedicated to the public health" but are overwhelmed with too much work and not enough funding, Kindler added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their workload exceeds the resources that we have provided to them to do their job, and we have to address that," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schering-Plough Corp SGP.N Chief Executive Fred Hassan, also speaking to the Reuters summit, endorsed a fixed term for the FDA's top job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you go back to the last several years, it is really a pity that there have been large lots of time when there has been no permanent commissioner in place. We need fixed terms," Hassan said, speaking by telephone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For summit blog: summitnotebook.reuters.com/))&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Ransdell Pierson and Susan Heavey; Editing by Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co is cutting 10 percent of its investment banking staff -- about 3,000 jobs -- as the economic slowdown starts to bite into its earnings, people familiar with the situation said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares slid as much as 18 percent as one analyst said the cuts could reflect greater-than-expected weakness at the bank, long seen as one of the industry's few stalwarts through the credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because JPMorgan has held up relative to the group, they're more vulnerable to a fall," said Ben Wallace, securities analyst at Grimes  Co in Westborough, Massachusetts, which holds JPMorgan shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cutting investment banking jobs raises questions about profitability at the firm," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company will likely cut staff in line with competitors such as Goldman Sachs Group, which is cutting 10 percent, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, JPMorgan let go at least six equity sales officials from its New York desk, according to one person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank declined comment. Its shares were down 12 percent at $25.01 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange after falling as low as $23.21 earlier in the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONSUMER RISK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has not had to take the severe writedowns on risky classes of mortgage-related assets that other banks have reported because it has limited exposure to such securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in recent calls with investors and analysts, Jamie Dimon, the bank's chief executive, has been warning about possible losses from exposure to consumer debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a conference two weeks ago, Dimon said the wider economic downturn could be worse for banks like JPMorgan than the credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is beginning to see customers miss payments on some of its $250 billion of prime mortgages and home equity loans. It has announced a plan to renegotiate $70 billion of mortgages over the next two years to help those customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's investment bank has just under 31,000 employees, up 20 percent from a year earlier, according to a third-quarter regulatory filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan took on about 6,000 staff from nearly insolvent Bear Stearns Cos in March and has also added about 40,000 staff through its acquisition of failed thrift Washington Mutual Inc, according to its third-quarter earnings statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's total head count was 228,452 at the end of September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Matthew Lewis and John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) top executive is counting on higher sales in emerging markets and revenue from older medicines to generate enough revenue in the next three years to help offset an expected plunge in sales of its top selling Lipitor cholesterol drug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff Kindler, speaking at the Reuters Health Summit on Thursday, also expects the company's new organizational structure to take hold and make a difference before $12 billion-a-year Lipitor faces generic competition in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kindler's game plan comes at a critical time for the world's largest drug maker and does not necessarily include the kind of big acquisition that many investors are hoping for. The shares at $14.45 are trading at 11-year lows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CEO said his strategy to prepare for the loss of Lipitor also includes maximizing sales of current products, launching new medicines, and cost cutting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And its new corporate structure focused on five business units will help the company be more efficient, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many of these strategies were just adopted in March of this year. It's early days. But I think we are demonstrating with every quarter that we are in fact executing on this," Kindler told Reuters reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer was built in the last 10 years on two of the biggest deals in the sector -- the purchase of rivals Warner Lambert and Pharmacia. But when asked about acceding to pleas from some analysts and investors to make another acquisition to obtain products to replace Lipitor, Kindler expressed caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Business development -- whether it is a small deal, a medium-sized deal or a large deal, is an enabler for strategies. It is not a strategy in and of itself," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on Pfizer's strength in emerging markets is a priority. The CEO said Pfizer is achieving "enormous growth" in China, Brazil, Turkey, India, Korea and Russia. In developing markets in Asia, he noted there will be $80 billion of additional growth between now and when Lipitor goes off patent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a 3-4 percent share of that market today. If we just hold our share and capture our share of the $80 billion growth -- that is a significant opportunity for us. If we grow that share -- it's even more significant."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kindler declined to forecast how much its market share might grow overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also touted Pfizer's strength in the "established product business," meaning sales of its branded drugs that have lost patent protection as well as its own generics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even today, Lipitor off-patent in some markets is competing successfully against generic" forms of the drug, he said. "Because in many of these markets the patient and physician are focused on quality and the brand they know ... and Lipitor is a very successful competitor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kindler declined to outline any plans to use its large cash position to boost the company's industry-topping dividend, or a share buyback plan, either of which might entice investors and provide a boost to its slumping share price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are positioning ourselves very well for the period after Lipitor loses exclusivity to be a strong and profitably growing company," Kindler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares dropped 7 percent to close at $14.45 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, down 41 percent from their trading level last December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For summit blog: summitnotebook.reuters.com/))&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson, Edward Tobin; editing by Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc (C.N), JPMorgan Chase 
Co (JPM.N) and Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) are among the
final bidders for Chevy Chase Bank, a Bethesda, Maryland,
lender, sources familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Other banks that looked at Chevy Chase earlier in the
process included SunTrust Banks Inc (STI.N) and BBT Corp
(BBT.N), one source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevy Chase has $11.4 billion of deposits and 292 branches,
according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The key thing with that bank is that the asset side is not
very attractive, but the deposit side is incredibly valuable
because it is in Washington, D.C.," the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A deal would make the most difference to Capital One, which
is based in McLean, Virginia, and had $98.9 billion in deposits
as of Sept 30. It has 739 branches primarily in New York, New
Jersey, Texas and Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevy Chase could help it expand its reach in the affluent
Washington, D.C., area, while reducing reliance on credit
cards, where growth is slowing and credit losses are mounting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For JPMorgan and Citi, Chevy Chase would be a drop in the
bucket. JPMorgan has $969.8 billion in worldwide deposits. Citi
had $780.3 billion as of Sept. 30, about a quarter of which are
in the United States. Both companies have more than $2 trillion
of assets on their balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For Citi, the bid comes at a tough time. Its shares lost
about one-third of their value in the first three days of this
week as investors worried that Chief Executive Vikram Pandit's
plan to cut expenses by 20 percent and eliminate 52,000 jobs
won't restore the bank to health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citi's largest individual investor said on Thursday he
would boost his stake modestly, but failed to revive investor
confidence as the bank's shares tumbled more than 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevy Chase was founded in 1969 by Chairman and Chief
Executive B. Francis Saul II. It opened its first branch in a
trailer on Connecticut Avenue in Chevy Chase, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. banks are broadly looking to expand their branch
networks and amass pools of low-cost retail deposits after
seeing how unreliable capital markets can be when times are
tough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase has already put this strategy into play by
buying banking assets of Washington Mutual Inc WAMUQ.PK from
the FDIC for $1.9 billion. Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N) trumped a 
Citigroup bid to take over East Coast banking giant Wachovia
Corp WB.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even securities giants Goldman Sachs group Inc (GS.N) and
Morgan Stanley (MS.N) have become banks and joined the hunt for
deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citi, JPMorgan and SunTrust declined to comment. BBT,
Capital One and Chevy Chase were not immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Gunna Dickson)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (For more MA news and our DealZone blog, go to

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Nov 20 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said
on Thursday it had to curtail plans for expansion of a new
development in Colorado's Piceance Basin due to a drop in local
natural gas prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The company said it would stick to having just two rigs in
the basin, where it only started production in August, instead
of expanding to six rigs as previously planned. No changes in
the workforce numbers were anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Due to weak natural gas prices in the Rockies, and
Chevron's robust set of global investment opportunities, it
will fund its Piceance Basin Natural Gas Program at
approximately 2008 funding levels going forward," a spokesman
said in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The San Ramon, California-based company also said
maintaining the status quo reflected the current regulatory
environment, not the uncertain one it faces in the near future,
and the "potentially increased costs of doing business in
Colorado."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A clear left-ward shift in the U.S. election has caused
worries among oil and gas drillers about tighter regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The outlook for gas in the Piceance has generally been
strong. Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N), after buying full
control of property there in September, said it expected to
extract 200 million cubic feet a day in 2010, compared with 50
million before the acquisition.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 20 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that the State of Georgia has awarded IBM
a contract, valued by the State at $873 million, for information
technology (IT) outsourcing services over eight years. The contract also
includes two additional one-year optional extensions. The announcement
was made by Governor Sonny Perdue of Georgia at a news conference in
Atlanta this afternoon.

    The contract will support Governor Perdue's initiatives to better serve
Georgia residents by consolidating 11 independent IT environments into an
integrated and reliable operation. The agreement was signed on November
20, 2008.

    "Georgia's technology investments have not resulted in a reliable,
recoverable and secure system that ensures data is protected and needs are
being met," Governor Perdue said. "We have one of our nation's most
respected technology companies on board for this transformation, and I
look forward to our partnership in providing the state better services
than we have today at a cost savings to the taxpayer."

    IBM will provide the State with a range of data center services including
mainframe and midrange system management, service desk, disaster recovery
and IBM Internet Security Systems will supply security services. In
addition, the agreement will enable the State to replace an aging
infrastructure and migrate older technologies onto newer IBM technology
platforms. As subcontractors to IBM, Dell will update and manage the
state's client systems utilizing its desktop management platform and
provide service desk support. Print services will be provided by Xerox
(NYSE: XRX).

    Anticipated benefits of the data center consolidation and outsourcing
services agreement include standardizing service levels across the State,
proactive management and diagnosis of technology issues, improvement of
disaster recovery capabilities and the creation of a consistent
information security solution.

    "This initiative demonstrates the State of Georgia's commitment to the
smart and strategic use of information technology to better serve its
citizens," said David Liederbach, General Manager, IBM Global Technology
Services, Public Sector. "IBM will help the State enhance its end user
services and transition to an efficient, stable and flexible
infrastructure, capable of handling Georgia's future information
technology needs."

    The agreement addresses career opportunities for state employees who
currently perform data center services, with close to 300 state employees
being offered positions at IBM, Dell or Xerox.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details on share move, analyst comment, byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Elinor Comlay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 20 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) is
cutting 10 percent of its investment banking staff -- about
3,000 jobs -- as the economic slowdown starts to bite into its
earnings, people familiar with the situation said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan shares slid as much as 18 percent as one analyst
said the cuts could reflect greater-than-expected weakness at
the bank, long seen as one of the industry's few stalwarts
through the credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Because JPMorgan has held up relative to the group,
they're more vulnerable to a fall," said Ben Wallace,
securities analyst at Grimes  Co in Westborough,
Massachusetts, which holds JPMorgan shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Cutting investment banking jobs raises questions about
profitability at the firm," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company will likely cut staff in line with competitors
such as Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N), which is cutting 10
percent, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Thursday, JPMorgan let go at least six equity sales
officials from its New York desk, according to one person
familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank declined comment. Its shares were down 12 percent
at $25.01 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange
after falling as low as $23.21 earlier in the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CONSUMER RISK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan has not had to take the severe writedowns on risky
classes of mortgage-related assets that other banks have
reported because it has limited exposure to such securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in recent calls with investors and analysts, Jamie
Dimon, the bank's chief executive, has been warning about
possible losses from exposure to consumer debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At a conference two weeks ago, Dimon said the wider
economic downturn could be worse for banks like JPMorgan than
the credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank is beginning to see customers miss payments on
some of its $250 billion of prime mortgages and home equity
loans. It has announced a plan to renegotiate $70 billion of
mortgages over the next two years to help those customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's investment bank has just under 31,000
employees, up 20 percent from a year earlier, according to a
third-quarter regulatory filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan took on about 6,000 staff from nearly insolvent
Bear Stearns Cos in March and has also added about 40,000 staff
through its acquisition of failed thrift Washington Mutual Inc
WAMUQ.PK, according to its third-quarter earnings statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank's total head count was 228,452 at the end of
September.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com releases the latest Zacks Industry Rank. Stocks featured in this
week&#8217;s analysis includes Baidu.com (Nasdaq: BIDU), Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT),
Sohu.com (Nasdaq: SOHU), United Online (Nasdaq: UNTD) and Yahoo (Nasdaq: YHOO). 

To see the Zacks Industry Rank and the trend in earnings estimates revisions for
more than 200 industry groups, visit http://at.zacks.com/?id=3154. 

Zacks Industry Rank Analysis is written by Charles Rotblut, CFA, Senior Market
Analyst for Zacks.com. 

This week: Internet Stocks: Look Beyond Yahoo

Key points:

* Despite the resignation of Jerry Yang, forecasts are trending downward for
Yahoo 
* Other Internet companies are doing well, however, such as Sohu.com and United
Online

Without Merger, Few Positive Catalysts For Yahoo Over The Short-Term

Yesterday, Yahoo (Nasdaq: YHOO) announced the resignation of Jerry Yang from the
CEO post. The announcement was met with cheer as shares rose by nearly a buck to
$11.55. 

Playing a role in the upward move were speculators hoping for renewed merger
talks with Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT). The problem is that there is no guarantee
that a merger will occur. 

Without a merger, there are few catalysts for the stock. Naming a well-respected
outsider as a CEO might help, but the company is struggling with both tough
competition and a weak economy. During the past 30 days, 17 brokerage analysts
have lowered their 2009 profit projections. 

There Are Attractive Internet Stocks

Despite the problems with Yahoo, Internet Services
(http://at.zacks.com/?id=4984) is among the top 50 industry groups. This group
contains 1 Zacks #1 Rank ("strong buy") stock, United Online (Nasdaq: UNTD), and
7 Zacks #2 Rank ("buy") stocks, including Sohu.com (Nasdaq: SOHU). 

Overall, stocks within the better-ranked groups tend to outperform the markets.
And while investors might be inclined to look at the top 10 or 20 groups, stocks
within the top 80 groups can be viable investment candidates. 

Games Score High For Sohu.com

Sohu.com operates a leading web portal in China, while also providing various
other Internet and wireless services, such as online gaming. 

SOHU's third-quarter earnings of $1.02 per share were 11 cents above
expectations. (The company has now topped expectations for 6 consecutive
quarters.) Revenues more than doubled to $120.7 million, thanks to an 18% rise
in advertising revenues (the Olympics helped) and a 330% increase in gaming
revenues. 

The company projected fourth-quarter profits to total $1.20 per share, which was
10 cents above the then consensus earnings estimate. Analysts have not only
raised their forecasts for the current quarter, but also upped their predictions
for 2009 earnings. The consensus estimate now calls for profits to total $4.75
next year, a 12-cent increase over the average forecast of a month ago. 

United Online Blossoms

United Online may be best known in the U.S. for its social networking web site
Classmates.com and low cost ISP NetZero. Thanks to last August's acquisition of
FTD Group, Inc., the company also operates the largest network of florists. 

UNTD matched third-quarter expectations with profits of 22 cents per share.
Revenues rose 33% to $169.2 million, thanks to the inclusion of FTD. Classmates
generated growth of 18%, though the company's communication segment struggled. 

Following the earnings report, the 2 covering brokerage analysts raised their
2008 and 2009 profit forecasts. The 2008 consensus earnings estimate of $1.02
per share is 14 cents higher than the average forecast of a month ago. The 2009
consensus earnings estimate of $1.26 per share is 42 cents above the average
forecast of a month ago. 

Short-Term Outlook Changes for Baidu.com.

The third-quarter numbers from Chinese language search engine Baidu.com (Nasdaq:
BIDU) also looked good. The company earned $1.46 per share, 22 cents better than
analysts had forecast. Revenues rose 85% to $135.4 million. More advertisers
signed with the company and revenues per customer rose. Again, the Olympics
helped. 

The majority of the covering brokerage analysts raised their 2008 and 2009
projections in response. 

Given this backdrop, BIDU would seem to be another Internet-related candidate.
However, a press release from the company removed some of the luster from the
stock, at least over the short-term. 

Following a news report, Baidu.com admitted to accepting paid listings for
certain popular medical terms from medical companies that did not hold the
proper licenses. BIDU has removed the paid listings in question until the
advertisers can show proof of the proper licenses. 

Baidu estimates that the customers in question accounted for 10% to 15% of total
revenues. It is unclear how much of the revenues will be recovered in the
future, though 1 analyst has already reversed course and cut his profit
forecasts for the remainder of 2008 and all of 2009. It is possible that more
analysts will cut their forecasts going forward.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 20 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that since 2004, more than 5,000
companies worldwide have replaced their HP, Sun, and EMC products with
energy-efficient IBM Systems and Storage. Companies have invested in
IBM's System z, Power and System x servers as well as IBM Storage to
tackle their most challenging business objectives and to help reduce
sprawling data center costs for labor, energy and real estate.

    "Our problems with our hardware vendors were snowballing. Rising energy
costs, the need for additional servers, poor support and lack of
reliability led us to the decision to make the change to an IBM solution,"
said Ron Payne, director of infrastructure services for Alagasco, which
provides clean-burning, energy-efficient natural gas to more than 450,000
homes, businesses and industries in central and north Alabama. Under the
guidance of IBM and IBM Business Partner Mainline Information Systems,
Alagasco expects significant savings from its IBM server consolidation
project by migrating off HP and Sun servers.

    IBM most recently announced the System z Migration Factory, which builds
on the company's Migration Factory programs for IBM's Power Systems and
storage products. The Migration Factory includes competitive server
assessments, migration services, and other resources to help customers
achieve energy and space savings and lower their cost of ownership.
Highlights include:

    For System z: In less than one year, IBM has migrated more than 150
customers worldwide from competitive systems to IBM mainframes in
industries such as Distribution, Financial Services, General Business and
Public Sector. For Power Systems: IBM has migrated more than 1,300
customers worldwide in industries such as Financial Services,
Communications, Public Sector, and General Business. For Storage: IBM has
migrated approximately 2,900 customers worldwide in industries including
Communications, Financial Services, General Business and Public Sector. 

    Sample IBM Migration Factory customers include Adecco, Baylor, Ercot,
OSRAM SYLVANIA, Phase 2, Prudential Fox &amp; Roach, Ranstad, among others.

    IBM has also migrated more than 800 customers around the globe this year
to its System x products in industries such as Distribution, Financial
Services, and General Business.

    "Based on the long, positive experience we have made with IBM and their
infrastructure solutions and services, we feel well prepared for the
future," said Franz-Theo Brockhoff, Deputy Chairman of the Board of Finanz
Informatik. Finanz Informatik recently awarded IBM with a five-year
extension of its strategic contract with IBM focused around streamlining
FI into a new enterprise data center to help lower technology costs,
reduce energy consumption, and improve overall IT performance.

    "Clients continue to seek out Sirius and IBM for solutions to address
their technology requirements and facilitate growth in the current
business environment. Technology migrations require a holistic approach,
carefully selected technologies, and knowledgeable experts. And because
of our IBM certified and seasoned teams of sales and technical
professionals, we're uniquely positioned to help our clients select the
right IBM technology solution for their needs," said Joe Mertens,
president of IBM Premier Business Partner Sirius Computer Solutions.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc (C.N), JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) and Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) are among the final bidders for Chevy Chase Bank, a Bethesda, Maryland, lender, sources familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other banks that looked at Chevy Chase include SunTrust Banks Inc (STI.N) and BBT Corp (BBT.N), one source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bids come as the largest U.S. banks turn their attention to expanding branch networks and amassing pools of low-cost retail deposits after seeing how unreliable capital markets can be when times are tough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This strategy has already been put into play by JPMorgan, which snapped up banking assets of Washington Mutual Inc WAMUQ.PK from the FDIC for $1.9 billion, and by Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N), which trumped a low-ball Citigroup bid to take over East Coast banking giant Wachovia Corp WB.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even securities giants Goldman Sachs group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) have become banks and joined the hunt for deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevy Chase has $11.4 billion of deposits and 292 branches, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The key thing with that bank is that the asset side is not very attractive, but the deposit side is incredibly valuable because it is in Washington, D.C.," the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevy Chase was founded in 1969 by Chairman and Chief Executive B. Francis Saul II. It opened its first branch in a trailer on Connecticut Avenue in Chevy Chase, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citi, JPMorgan and SunTrust declined to comment.

&lt;p&gt; (Changes source; adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 20 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded
VeriFone Holdings Inc (PAY.N) to "neutral" from "overweight" on
Thursday, a day after the electronic payment technology
provider cut its fourth-quarter outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock shed more than half of its value to touch a
lifetime low in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given the uncertainty around forward estimates and limited
disclosure until VeriFone reports fourth-quarter results in mid
December, we no longer have conviction in recommending the
name," JP Morgan said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said it expects the company's 2009 outlook to
be conservative, given the tough retail backdrop, challenging
selling environment and need to set a beatable bar to
re-establish investor confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wedbush Morgan Securities, which also said the company's
2009 performance would likely be below trend, cut its price
target on the stock to $6 from $11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, VeriFone forecast fourth-quarter non-GAAP
earnings of 18 cents to 20 cents a share on revenue of $244
million to $246 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of VeriFone were trading down more than 53 percent
at $2.90 on the New York Stock Exchange. They touched a
lifetime low of $2.31 earlier in the session. The company went
public in 2005.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO Nov 20 (Reuters) - JP Morgan (JPM.N) now looks

zero by January. Economist Michael Feroli said in a research
note:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; *  "We now look for a 50 bps cut in the target fed funds
rate at the Dec 16 meeting, followed by an additional 50 bps

policy (ZIRP) for the remainder of 2009."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; *  "Deflation becomes more likely in an environment where
labor market slack is building, and ongoing financial
tightening is delaying the prospect that slack begins to get
worked down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * "Taking the target rate to 0 percent would not be
costless for the Fed. One concern that has been voiced in the
past relates to the effect on money market mutual funds.  We
do not think this cost is enough to constrain the Fed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * "We don't believe going to ZIRP implies that the Fed
cannot do more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ros Krasny; Editing by Jan Paschal)

&lt;p&gt;DENVER &amp; HONOLULU--(Business Wire)--
Intermap Technologies and FS Dreamscapes today announced the release of NEXTMap&#174;
ProMesh&#8482; Oklahoma, another region in their series of terrain mesh and
photoscenery downloads that already include California, Florida, Hawaii,
Mississippi, and the United Kingdom, for Microsoft&#174; Flight Simulator X and ESP. 

&#8220;This is a special title in the series,&#8221; says Dean Montford, president and CEO
of FS Dreamscapes. &#8220;Simulator pilots can now experience flying over Oklahoma
with 3-foot vertically accurate elevation data which dramatically increases the
realism of the state&#8217;s terrain and makes flying visual flight rules even more
immersive. The data is a significant increase in detail compared to the default
15-foot vertical accuracy of the USGS national elevation dataset that had been
the standard until now." 

This terrain is eight times the resolution and sixty-four times more detailed
than the default Flight Simulator X terrain mesh for the United States. Instead
of appearing flat and barren, NEXTMap ProMesh Oklahoma is based on Intermap&#8217;s
highly uniform and reliable elevation data that allows users to view every hill,
gully, freeway overpass, and ground feature as they fly over the state. 

&#8220;The NEXTMap ProMesh Oklahoma product allows pilots to fly near real-world
missions through pre-visualizing the surrounding terrain safely within the
Microsoft Flight Simulator X and ESP applications. As Intermap continues to
increase the digital mapping coverage across the U.S we&#8217;ll continue to enable FS
Dreamscapes to expand the coverage of their leading flight simulator dataset.
Ultimately, pilots will be able to fly from coast to coast across the U.S. when
the project is complete,&#8221; stated Kevin Thomas, vice president of marketing for
Intermap Technologies. 

NEXTMap ProMesh add-ons for Flight Simulator and Microsoft&#174; ESP allow consumers,
pilot trainees, researchers, and scientists to maneuver real time within a 3D
visualization simulation platform. The use of Intermap&#8217;s NEXTMap&#174; USA and
NEXTMap&#174; Europe uniformly derived digital terrain models within the Flight
Simulator and ESP platforms are paving the way for future real time visual
simulation technologies with practical real world applications. 

Microsoft Flight Simulator photoscenery and terrain mesh products are available
for purchase and download at:&#160;www.fsdreamscapes.com/store

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs has cut its 2009 forecast for U.S. crude oil to $80 a barrel from $86, the U.S. bank said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman said the revision to its average 2009 forecast reflected the weaker near-term environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm said poor credit conditions and their negative implications for economic activity would continue to pressure U.S. crude prices toward Goldman's near-term downside scenario of $50 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The duration of this very low price environment and the timing and extent of a potential recovery is still uncertain, with risks of prolonged weakness and of sustained recovery in 2H09 still largely balanced," it said in the note, published this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. crude fell under $50 a barrel on Thursday for the first time in nearly two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said the pressure on the oil complex had increased in the past few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the near term, we do not expect significant upside potential and as a consequence we are closing all of our oil trading recommendations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These included: a long gasoline crack trade, a WTI option three-way trade, a long 2021 WTI NYMEX swap and long long-dated WTI timespreads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said there were few signs that credit conditions had eased significantly in the financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The steepening of the contango (in the oil forward curve) has opened up carry-trade opportunities that are slow to be closed due to constrained credit conditions," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This underscores that across asset classes, trades that require up-front cash display exceptionally high return potential."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jane Merriman, editing by Anthony Barker)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI (Reuters) - Nokia smartphones will be able to access IBM Lotus Notes corporate email starting from next month, the two firms said on Thursday, as the world's top handset maker battles Blackberry-maker RIM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nokia said thanks to the new software more than 80 million users of its smartphones can access IBM's Lotus email. In September Nokia signed a similar deal with Microsoft, the leading corporate email provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With this partnership we are able to  mobilize close to 90 percent of corporate emails without any extra investments from corporations," Ilari Nurmi, VP at Nokia, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of companies have servers in place and a lot of Nokia devices on the premises. It's an important factor in cost-conscious times," Nurmi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia dropped development of its own corporate email product this year, choosing to look for partners instead while focusing on developing phones for business users to better challenge RIM, the leading mobile email vendor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since revising its business strategy, Nokia has sharpened its focus and is turning up the heat on RIM and Microsoft, particularly in the SMB segment," said Geoff Blaber, analyst with research firm CCS Insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Adding support for Lotus Notes is a huge step forwards. The move gives Nokia the capability to target a much broader market and a segment where RIM has dominated to date."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement comes against a backdrop of falling demand for cellphones worldwide as the global economy falters, with Nokia warning last week that it expects industry volumes in 2009 to contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts have tapped smartphones as the market segment with the best hope for growth in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the third quarter Nokia sold 1.1 million of its new sleek, full-keyboard E71 phones, outselling RIM's business user-targeted Blackberry Bold by five-to-one, according to Nokia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Blackberry Bold went on sale in its key United States market only in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week Nokia unveiled a somewhat stripped-down version of E71, the Nokia E63, which is expected to begin shipping in the coming weeks for an estimated retail price of 199 euros before taxes and subsidies -- almost half the E71s estimated retail price unveiled in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia's Nurmi said the E63 could well outsell E71.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From affordability standpoint there is clearly bigger potential for this product," he told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RIM's dominant position in the mobile email market was not set in stone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is not a mature market. We are all going to grow the market," said Kevin Cavanaugh, vice president of IBM Lotus Software. (Reporting by Tarmo Virki; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  CAMPBELL, CA, Nov 20 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
YouSendIt, Inc. today announced a new way to send files through Microsoft
Office by launching a direct-delivery service for Word, Excel(R) and
PowerPoint(R). Available for Office 2003 and 2007, the service lets users
send files of up to 2GB directly from some of the most widely used
business applications in the world, speeding the delivery of various file
types and creating a more efficient workflow.

    "YouSendIt's direct delivery service for Microsoft Office is an integrated
part of a larger framework we are building to help business professionals
shorten their work cycle and simplify their daily activities," said
YouSendIt CEO Ivan Koon. "This service speeds file transfers and shortens
project completion times for YouSendIt users. We are rapidly becoming part
of the world's leading operating environments for professionals in every
industry, and integration with Microsoft Office is a big step in that
direction."

    YouSendIt's integration with Office means a more productive, more
efficient communication flow, allowing users to skip a step and send
files directly from the Office application in which they are working. It
also allows businesses to avoid using FTP transfers or burning large
files to a CD to mail via overnight courier. Files delivered through
YouSendIt are secure and can be tracked with assured delivery, including
delivery receipt, so the sender knows exactly when files have been
received.

    The YouSendIt service for Office delivers rich sending options, including:


--  File expiration control - Users can configure the amount of time a
    file is available for download and/or the number of times it is downloaded.
--  Password protection, certified delivery, return receipt - Advanced
    tracking and security features ensure that only the intended recipient can
    download a file.
    

    
The direct-delivery service for Microsoft Office complements the
existing YouSendIt service for Outlook(R), which allows users to
circumvent e-mail size limitations and relieve Exchange servers of bulky
attachment burdens.

    Registered YouSendIt users can download the direct-delivery service for
Office and for other applications at
http://www.yousendit.com/cms/applications. For more information about

&lt;p&gt;If Walujo's latest bid for Bumi succeeds, he will have thrown a much-needed lifeline to Bakrie  Brothers (BNBR.JK), which has interests in coal, palm oil, telecoms and property and is controlled by the family of Chief Social Welfare Minister Aburizal Bakrie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bakrie business empire borrowed heavily to expand and is now struggling to pay back debt, prompting investors to dump Bakrie group shares amid a global sell-off. But for Northstar, Bumi could prove a challenge to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walujo may have a couple of Indonesian state-owned enterprises in his consortium, and will have to deal with ministers as well as the local politicians and communities in the districts where Bumi's mines are located.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walujo, 34, did not respond to several requests for an interview. But those in the tight-knit private equity community who follow Indonesia say he has the skills to pull off the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs (GS.N) alumni, analysts say he built up an enviable network of contacts as a young investment banker and through his marriage to the daughter of Theodore Rachmat, who previously ran auto distributor Astra International (ASII.JK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was at Goldman that he got to know giant U.S. private equity firm Texas Pacific Group (TPG) TPG.UL, which now has a joint venture with Northstar and which may join in the Bumi deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walujo's Facebook entry shows his network includes high-profile Indonesian officials such as Dino Patti Djalal, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's foreign affairs spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NETWORKING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those networks have proved useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Indonesian coal miner Adaro Indonesia needed strategic investors, Walujo worked on the deal and wooed a consortium including his father-in-law, the Government of Singapore Investment Corp (GIC), Citigroup (C.N), and private equity fund Farallon Capital, a person familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thanks to his in-laws, he's been hanging around the coal sector for years," said one person who knows him but did not want to be quoted by name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bumi controls two major coal mines, PT Kaltim Prima Coal and PT Arutmin Indonesia, located in Indonesia's resource-rich East Kalimantan province. Both mines produce high quality coal used in power plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walujo tried to buy Bumi from the Bakrie family in 2006, bankers said, but was outbid by a rival, and the deal later fell apart. Undeterred, Northstar offered $1.3 billion for a 35 percent stake in Bumi earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Northstar deal values Bumi at $3.7 billion, while its current market value is now 63 percent below that, at $1.37 billion, prompting talk that the deal will either fall apart or have to be renegotiated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think this deal can go through. Northstar alone doesn't have the backing, unless TPG or Teddy Rachmat wants to get involved," said an analyst at a major brokerage house in Jakarta, who also declined to be identified while the status of the deal was unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other potential buyers have also expressed an interest, including the Philippine conglomerate San Miguel SMCB.PS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People familiar with Northstar say it has several hundred million dollars in funds and has blue-chip U.S. and European names among its investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it also has the advantage of being an Indonesian fund -- an important factor at a time when Southeast Asia's biggest economy is heading for elections and appears to be increasingly nationalistic when it comes to ownership of strategic assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walujo spent three years as senior vice president of PCCW Japan, where he was a key member of the MA and financial management team, according to biographical details published at a recent private equity conference he attended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before that, he was an investment banker at Goldman Sachs in London and New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who know him describe him as hard-working, ambitious, and a consummate networker. With the recent arrival of his first baby, one joked, he will have the perfect excuse to stay up late, phoning and emailing clients halfway around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Saeed Azhar in Singapore; Editing by Ed Davies and Alex Richardson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Nokia smartphones to support IBM's Lotus Notes email&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Nokia sees cost benefit vs RIM in mobile email battle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Handset maker says new cheaper E63 could well outsell E71&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Adds comments from Nokia, IBM, analyst)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Tarmo Virki&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HELSINKI, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Nokia (NOK1V.HE) smartphones
will be able to access IBM Lotus Notes corporate email starting
from next month, the two firms said on Thursday, as the world's
top handset maker battles Blackberry-maker RIM RIM.TO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nokia said thanks to the new software more than 80 million
users of its smartphones can access IBM's (IBM.N) Lotus email.
In September Nokia signed a similar deal with Microsoft
(MSFT.O), the leading corporate email provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With this partnership we are able to to mobilise close to
90 percent of corporate emails without any extra investments
from corporations," Ilari Nurmi, VP at Nokia, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A lot of companies have servers in place and a lot of Nokia
devices on the premises. It's an important factor in
cost-conscious times," Nurmi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nokia dropped development of its own corporate email product
this year, choosing to look for partners instead while focusing
on developing phones for business users to better challenge RIM,
the leading mobile email vendor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Since revising its business strategy, Nokia has sharpened
its focus and is turning up the heat on RIM and Microsoft,
particularly in the SMB segment," said Geoff Blaber, analyst
with research firm CCS Insight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Adding support for Lotus Notes is a huge step forwards. The
move gives Nokia the capability to target a much broader market
and a segment where RIM has dominated to date."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The announcement comes against a backdrop of falling demand
for cellphones worldwide as the global economy falters, with
Nokia warning last week that it expects industry volumes in 2009
to contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts have tapped smartphones as the market segment
with the best hope for growth in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the third quarter Nokia sold 1.1 million of its new
sleek, full-keyboard E71 phones, outselling RIM's business
user-targeted Blackberry Bold by five-to-one, according to
Nokia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Blackberry Bold went on sale in its key United
States market only in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week Nokia unveiled a somewhat stripped-down version of
E71, the Nokia E63, which is expected to begin shipping in the
coming weeks for an estimated retail price of 199 euros before
taxes and subsidies -- almost half the E71s estimated retail
price unveiled in June.
 Nokia's Nurmi said the E63 could well outsell E71.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "From affordability standpoint there is clearly bigger
potential for this product," he told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RIM's dominant position in the mobile email market was not
set in stone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is not a mature market. We are all going to grow the
market," said Kevin Cavanaugh, vice president of IBM Lotus
Software.

&lt;p&gt;  FREMONT, CA, Nov 20 (MARKET WIRE) --

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 20 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today is making available a new social networking tool
called Pass It Along to help organizations take a more user-friendly,
collaborative approach to knowledge sharing. The new technology expands
the notion of social networking for employees and learners -- and
includes advanced features such as learning paths, visual mapping and
expertise profiling.

    Nearly 22 million workers are set to retire this year in the United States
alone, posing a significant challenge for businesses as they look to
retain industry expertise and skills. As a result, organizations of all
sizes are now looking for new ways to help their workforce more easily
share and gain knowledge for competitive advantage.

    IBM is helping to address this issue with Pass It Along technology that
integrates knowledge management, social networking and Web 2.0 concepts to
simplify the way information is shared and consumed by users. The new
technology enables users to access, share and rate essential information;
categorize information from the Web or an intranet according to interest;
and complete learning paths and create learning networks to help
facilitate ongoing knowledge sharing.

    As part of the underlying technology, IBM has implemented a unique
information access model that allows contributors to decide how broadly
their information is shared and who else can collaborate on contributions.
For example, businesses can use the technology for a wide variety of
internal and external needs including the orientation of new hires,
training a sales force or collaborating with clients, vendors and business
partners.

     "Organizations looking to on-board new resources, conduct business
process training, and complement formal education delivery with an
informal tool that easily serves up essential information will find Pass
It Along useful," said Dr. Tony O'Driscoll, a professor at Duke
University's Fuqua School of Business. "Software developers in particular
can use the technology within their existing IT infrastructure without
the typical administration costs associated with traditional knowledge
management applications."

    Key benefits of Pass It Along include:

    The ability to retain key knowledge to pass along to new generations of
workers: As the workforce continues to mature, knowledge can be lost as
workers retire. This raises the challenge of bringing new employees --
particularly in global teams -- up to speed with key information. With
Pass It Along, that information can be easily exchanged among a company's
workforce by harnessing expertise of individual team members.
 
 Learning
around niche-topics and specialized projects can be created and
disseminated quickly without heavy investments: Pass It Along is useful
for projects involving business partners, vendors and clients who have
immediate training and knowledge exchange needs. For example, software
developers can use Pass It Along to cultivate real-world database and
operating system skills to remain relevant and competitive. IBM has
already made knowledge paths available to developers on topics such as
Linux administration and working with DB2. 
 
 An enhanced learning
experience through user-generated content enhances the learning
experience: Learners today are not only more diversified in terms of age,
ethnicity and location -- but they are more adept with technology and
bring new expectations to the learning environment. Pass It Along allows
users to visually map out the learning process, easily add to their own
knowledge base, extend their knowledge assets to others and form learning
groups based on niche interests. Through data clouds, users can better
link knowledge to associated experts, and create more powerful learning
networks both within and outside of an organization.

    IBM developerWorks has launched a beta version of Pass It Along to provide
developers with a peer-to-peer knowledge exchange network. In this test
bed, over 1300 developers have begun using Pass It Along, creating over
120 topics, with popular topics including XML and Linux. The beta offers
the opportunity to gain real user feedback and allows developers to
create and organize information dynamically based on what they value.

    A no-cost, demo version of Pass It Along is available as a service at:

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds analyst comments)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 20 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded Eagle
Bulk Shipping Inc (EGLE.O), and said all drybulk companies
under its coverage, except Diana Shipping Inc (DSX.N), may be
in breach of debt covenants if the market value of assets have
significantly fallen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, which also downgraded Navios Maritime
Partners LP (NMM.N), upgraded Diana Shipping as it believes the
company has the best financial status to survive the current
downturn hitting the dry bulk sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although sale and purchase activity had resumed in the dry
bulk sector after several weeks of a slump, there was a big
drop in asset sales prices, analyst Jonathan Chappell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "After a long absence of second-hand vessel sales during
the accelerating rate decline since the end of the summer, a
couple of modern ships have now been sold at prices that are
more than 50 percent below last-done deals for similar assets,"
Chappell said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eagle Bulk Shipping, Navios Maritime Partners, Genco
Shipping  Trading Ltd (GNK.N) and Navios Maritime Holdings Inc
(NM.N) could "technically be in breach of debt covenants" if
the lower asset prices are proven to be new market levels, the
analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eagle Bulk Shipping's rating was cut to "underweight" from
"neutral," while Navios Maritime Partners was downgraded to
"neutral" from "overweight." Diana Shipping was upgraded to
"overweight" from "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given the massive volatility of the dry bulk stocks and
the ongoing unfavorable industry data points, we believe it is
far less risky to use pair trades in this sector with a focus
on financial risk and liquidity," Chappell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Diana Shipping closed at $8.55, while those of
Navios Maritime Partners closed at $4.77 Wednesday on the New
York Stock Exchange. Shares of Eagle Bulk closed at $6.45 on
Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;Aspera Technology Boosts Global Transfers with IBM CoD Centers 50x and More


EMERYVILLE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Aspera, creators of next-generation software technologies that move the world&#8217;s
digital assets at maximum speed regardless of file size, transfer distance or
network conditions, today announced an agreement to provide its high-speed file
transfer technology to IBM&#8217;s Computing on Demand (CoD) offering. IBM&#174; CoD
provides flexible computing power by the hour, week or year, allowing businesses
to scale their infrastructure without further capital investment. 

IBM CoD members now have the option to access their integrated computing
environment with Aspera&#8217;s high-performance file transport technology. The Aspera
high-speed file transfer option installed on the member&#8217;s &#8220;home&#8221; management node
in the CoD center and at the member&#8217;s location provides maximum transfer speed,
total reliability and complete security to and from the off-site high-capacity
computing center. 

Using the Aspera option to connect to the IBM CoD center in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.,
customers in Hakozaki, Japan, reported a 50x improvement in transfer performance
over FTP. 

&#8220;When large data sets need to be moved between a customer site and the cloud,
traditional file transfer solutions such as FTP fail to provide the transfer
performance required to fully benefit from the vast computing power at hand,&#8221;
said Cary Capece, senior vice president of sales and business development at
Aspera. &#8220;The integration of Aspera technology to IBM&#8217;s CoD solution delivers
maximum transfer speed, securely and reliably, enabling members to further
improve productivity and effectively take advantage of their on-demand
supercomputing environment.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt; *Withdraws EU application for non-prescription Viagra&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  *Still believes 50mg dose meets guidelines for OTC status
 (Adds analyst comment, recasts)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON Nov 20 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) has pulled its
bid to make its blockbuster impotence pill Viagra available in
the European Union without prescription, the company said on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer withdrew its request to sell Viagra over the counter
in 50 milligram doses following comments it received from the
European Medicines Agency, which was weighing the application on
a drug that last year generated sales of $1.76 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a statement the company said it pulled the application
"recognizing that there were some concerns regarding the
proposed supply of Viagra 50 milligram tablets without a
prescription in the European Union."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said it believed that dose of Viagra still meets
guidelines for a switch to non-prescription, and that it would
continue to work with regulators to improve access to the drug
and other medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peter Cartwright, an analyst at Evolution Securities, said
the decision would not likely have a big impact on Pfizer, and
that the decision indicates the company may have met more
regulatory resistance than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a commercial decision," he said. "If the aggravation
is too much, put your efforts elsewhere."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Impotence is a common condition worldwide, and drugs like
Pfizer Inc's Viagra or sildenafil, Eli Lilly and Co's (LLY.N)
Cialis or tadalafil, and Bayer AG's BAYG.DE Levitra or
vardenafil, work by increasing blood flow to the genitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer has not filed an application with U.S. regulators to
make Viagra available over the counter in the United States, the
world's biggest drug market.

Here are highlights from Wednesday&#8217;s Analyst Blog:

Is Latest Bad News Good News?

The best indicator of future housing starts is building permits, and they were
even softer than the data for starts. In October, they fell to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 708,000, down 12.0% for the month (from 805,000, revised
up from 786,000 originally reported) and are down 40.1% on a year-over-year
basis. 

All regions of the country were weak, but the Northeast was by far in the worst
shape, falling 23.7%, followed by the South (-13.5%) and the West (-8.8%). The
Midwest was relatively strong on a monthly basis, down just 3.7%. On a
year-over-year basis, the Northeast is once again the weakest, down 51.0%,
followed by the West (-48.0%). On a relative basis, the South (-36.3%) and the
Midwest (-39.5%) were the least weak (can't really call down 36.3% "strongest").


Avoid the homebuilders -- they serve NO economic function at this time, nor are
they likely to do so for the forseeable future. I am frankly amazed that we have
not seen more of the big publicly traded homebuilders like D.R. Horton, Inc.
(NYSE: DHI), Standard Pacific Corp. (NYSE: SPF) or Beazer Homes USA, Inc. (NYSE:
BZH) file for Chapter 11 yet. I would not consider buying any of them until they
are trading for pocket change prices (well under $1 per share). 

Stick with large non-cyclical firms with super solid balance sheets instead,
like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) or McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD).

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer announced today that it has withdrawn its application to switch the legal
status of the 50 mg tablet strength of Viagra from &#8216;prescription only&#8217; to
&#8216;non-prescription&#8217; in the European Union (EU). 

Viagra is a well established oral medication for the treatment of erectile
dysfunction (ED) and all current doses of Viagra will continue to be available
to patients by prescription from their doctor. 

Pfizer believes that Viagra 50 mg is a suitable candidate for non-prescription
supply through pharmacists in the EU and meets the criteria set out by the
European Commission guideline for changing the classification of a medicinal
product to non-prescription. However, in a letter to the European Medicines
Agency (EMEA), Pfizer said that it has decided to withdraw the application in
order to fully consider comments from the EMEA&#8217;s Committee for Medicinal
Products for Human Use (CHMP), recognizing that there were some concerns
regarding the proposed supply of Viagra 50 mg tablets without a prescription in
the EU. The CHMP noted that when Viagra is used in accordance with the currently
approved&#160;prescribing information, its safety profile remains favorable. The
withdrawal of the application will enable evaluation of further information and
additional data that may be required to allow any future assessments under the
centralized procedure. 

Pfizer believes that access to Viagra 50 mg without a prescription in a pharmacy
setting in the EU would provide valuable benefits to male patients suffering

medicines from uncontrolled sources and the missed opportunity to get important

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer announced today that it has withdrawn its application to switch the legal
status of the 50 mg tablet strength of Viagra from &#8216;prescription only&#8217; to
&#8216;non-prescription&#8217; in the European Union (EU). 

Viagra is a well established oral medication for the treatment of erectile
dysfunction (ED) and all current doses of Viagra will continue to be available
to patients by prescription from their doctor. 

Pfizer believes that Viagra 50 mg is a suitable candidate for non-prescription
supply through pharmacists in the EU and meets the criteria set out by the
European Commission guideline for changing the classification of a medicinal
product to non-prescription. However, in a letter to the European Medicines
Agency (EMEA), Pfizer said that it has decided to withdraw the application in
order to fully consider comments from the EMEA&#8217;s Committee for Medicinal
Products for Human Use (CHMP), recognizing that there were some concerns
regarding the proposed supply of Viagra 50 mg tablets without a prescription in
the EU. The CHMP noted that when Viagra is used in accordance with the currently
approved&#160;prescribing information, its safety profile remains favorable. The
withdrawal of the application will enable evaluation of further information and
additional data that may be required to allow any future assessments under the
centralized procedure.

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA Nov 20 (Reuters) - Patrick Walujo of private
equity firm Northstar Pacific has long coveted Bumi Resources
(BUMI.JK), Indonesia's biggest coal miner and the Bakrie
group's prize that was put up for sale to settle debts of more
than $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; If Walujo's latest bid for Bumi succeeds, he will have
thrown a much-needed lifeline to Bakrie  Brothers (BNBR.JK),
which has interests in coal, palm oil, telecoms and property
and is controlled by the family of Chief Social Welfare
Minister Aburizal Bakrie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Bakrie business empire borrowed heavily to expand and
is now struggling to pay back debt, prompting investors to dump
Bakrie group shares amid a global sell-off. But for Northstar,
Bumi could prove a challenge to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walujo may have a couple of Indonesian state-owned
enterprises in his consortium, and will have to deal with
ministers as well as the local politicians and communities in
the districts where Bumi's mines are located.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walujo, 34, did not respond to several requests for an
interview. But those in the tight-knit private equity community
who follow Indonesia say he has the skills to pull off the
deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman Sachs (GS.N) alumni, analysts say he built up an
enviable network of contacts as a young investment banker and
through his marriage to the daughter of Theodore Rachmat, who
previously ran auto distributor Astra International (ASII.JK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was at Goldman that he got to know giant U.S. private
equity firm Texas Pacific Group (TPG) [TPG.UL], which now has a
joint venture with Northstar and which may join in the Bumi
deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walujo's Facebook entry shows his network includes
high-profile Indonesian officials such as Dino Patti Djalal,
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's foreign affairs spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NETWORKING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those networks have proved useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Indonesian coal miner Adaro Indonesia needed strategic
investors, Walujo worked on the deal and wooed a consortium
including his father-in-law, the Government of Singapore
Investment Corp (GIC), Citigroup (C.N), and private equity fund
Farallon Capital, a person familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Thanks to his in-laws, he's been hanging around the coal
sector for years," said one person who knows him but did not
want to be quoted by name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bumi controls two major coal mines, PT Kaltim Prima Coal
and PT Arutmin Indonesia, located in Indonesia's resource-rich
East Kalimantan province. Both mines produce high quality coal
used in power plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walujo tried to buy Bumi from the Bakrie family in 2006,
bankers said, but was outbid by a rival, and the deal later
fell apart. Undeterred, Northstar offered $1.3 billion for a 35
percent stake in Bumi earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Northstar deal values Bumi at $3.7 billion, while its
current market value is now 63 percent below that, at $1.37
billion, prompting talk that the deal will either fall apart or
have to be renegotiated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't think this deal can go through. Northstar alone
doesn't have the backing, unless TPG or Teddy Rachmat wants to
get involved," said an analyst at a major brokerage house in
Jakarta, who also declined to be identified while the status of
the deal was unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other potential buyers have also expressed an interest,
including the Philippine conglomerate San Miguel SMCB.PS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People familiar with Northstar say it has several hundred
million dollars in funds and has blue-chip U.S. and European
names among its investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it also has the advantage of being an Indonesian fund
-- an important factor at a time when Southeast Asia's biggest
economy is heading for elections and appears to be increasingly
nationalistic when it comes to ownership of strategic assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walujo spent three years as senior vice president of PCCW
Japan, where he was a key member of the MA and financial
management team, according to biographical details published at
a recent private equity conference he attended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before that, he was an investment banker at Goldman Sachs
in London and New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those who know him describe him as hard-working, ambitious,
and a consummate networker. With the recent arrival of his
first baby, one joked, he will have the perfect excuse to stay
up late, phoning and emailing clients halfway around the
world.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has downgraded and assigned Rating Outlooks to JP Morgan Chase
Commercial Securities Corp., Series 2001-A, as follows: 

--$7.8 million class G to 'BB-' from 'BBB-'; Outlook Negative. 

In addition, Fitch has affirmed and assigned Outlooks to the following classes: 

--$22.7 million class A-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest only class X at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$6.8 million class B at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$7.9 million class C at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$10.8 million class D at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$3.4 million class E at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$5.1 million class F at 'AA'; Outlook Stable. 

Fitch does not rate the $8.8 million class NR. Class A-1 has been paid in full. 

The downgrade is the result of expected losses on the specially serviced asset,
uncertainty regarding the upcoming maturity of the largest loan in the pool and
potential adverse selection with only 13 loans remaining. Rating Outlooks
reflect the likely direction of any rating changes over the next one to two
years. As of the November 2008 distribution date, the pool's collateral balance
has been reduced 35.7%, to $73.2 million from $113.8 million at issuance. Four
loans (14.7%) have defeased. 

Fitch is closely monitoring the largest remaining loan (29.9%), which was
previously in special servicing and had its maturity date extended to January
2009. The loan is secured by a 795,517 square foot (sf) retail center in Maple
Heights, Ohio and was originally scheduled to mature in October 2007. The
servicer reported a June 2008 debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 0.97 times
(x) and physical occupancy as of September 2008 of 62.3%. Fitch does not expect
the borrower to be able to complete a refinance given the illiquidity of the
current credit environment. 

In addition to the largest loan, Fitch has identified three other Loans of
Concern, which includes the specially serviced asset. The specially serviced
asset (8.8%) is an office complex located in Norcross, GA. Fitch expected losses
would be absorbed by the non-rated class NR. 

The second largest Loan of Concern (5.7%) is secured by a 52,927 sf retail mall
located in Woodland, CA. Servicer reported June 2008 occupancy was 92.6%,
however the largest tenant, Target, vacated in 2008 and another tenant,
Mervyn's, filed for bankruptcy and is liquidating. A discount retailer is
expected to take the space vacated by Target in 2009. The loan is scheduled to
mature in January 2010. 

The fourth Loan of Concern (5.7%) is secured by a 52,927 sf office facility
located in Pembroke, MA. Servicer reported September 2008 occupancy of 56%, a
decline from June 2008 occupancy of 77%. Servicer reported DSCR as of June 2008
was 1.12x. 

Fitch also remains concerned with the increasing concentrations in the
transaction. The deal is concentrated with 52.6% retail and 10.2% healthcare
properties. In addition, the top five loans, which include the specially
serviced asset, represent 69.2% of the overall transaction outstanding. All of
the remaining pool is scheduled to mature or has an anticipated repayment date
(ARD) before the end of 2010, with approximately 61.6% of the remaining pool is
scheduled to mature in 2009. 

The majority of the collateral in this transaction are loans that were
originated for securitization but were removed from their prospective conduit
pools.

the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com. Published ratings, criteria and
methodologies are available from this site, at all times. Fitch's code of

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com releases details on a group of stocks that are currently members of
the exclusive Zacks #5 Rank List &#8211; Stocks to Sell Now. These stocks are
currently rated as a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell): Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:
GS) and Hartford Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE: HIG). Further, Zacks
announced #4 Rankings (Sell) on two other widely held stocks: Foundation Coal
Holdings Inc (NYSE: FCL) and Cigna Corp (NYSE: CI). To see the full Zacks #5
Rank List - Stocks to Sell Now visit: http://at.zacks.com/?id=92

Since inception in 1988, the S 500 has outperformed the Zacks #5 Rank List &#8212;
Stocks to Sell Now by 81% annually (+2% versus +11%). While the rest of Wall
Street continued to tout stocks during the market declines of the last few
years, Zacks told investors which stocks to sell or avoid. 

Here is a synopsis of why GS and HIG have a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell) and
should most likely be sold or avoided for the next one to three months. Note
that a #5 Strong Sell rating is applied to 5% of all the stocks in the Zacks
Rank universe: 

Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) recently traded at a multi-year low amid
widespread fears that the company could post its first-ever quarterly loss.
Goldman, which has lost some important hedge fund customers, also faces
significant potential writedowns as the credit crisis deepens. The consensus
estimate is now pegged at a loss of 62 cents per share for the fourth quarter,
even as analysts question if the company should continue to enjoy a higher
valuation than peers. 

Hartford Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE: HIG) shares continue to head lower
due to concerns about the insurance company&#8217;s exposure to commercial mortgage
investments and the variable annuity business. The company also faces risk from
several downgrades in its credit rating after announcing its decision to buy a
thrift and seek government bailout money. Over the last month, the 2008
consensus estimate has dropped $2.45 to $4.50 per share. 

Here is a synopsis of why FCL and CI have a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) and should
also most likely be sold or avoided for the next one to three months. Note that
a #4 Sell rating is applied to 15% of all the stocks ranked by Zacks; 

Foundation Coal Holdings Inc (NYSE: FCL) swung to a quarterly loss and cut its
2008 guidance, faced with the challenges of a shortage of skilled labor and
lower production. In the third quarter, net loss was 46 cents per share,
excluding items, while analysts had projected a profit of 23 cents. For 2008,
the company forecast earnings of 27 cents to 65 cents per share, far below
consensus estimates. Foundation Coal expects production levels to remain low
through 2009. 

Cigna Corp (NYSE: CI) posted a 53.2% drop in third-quarter profit due to the
poor performance of its reinsurance business and said it expects fewer
memberships in 2009 than previously forecast. For the current fiscal year, Cigna
now sees earnings between $3.40 and $3.50 per share, down from $4.05 to $4.25. 

Truly taking advantage of the Zacks Rank requires the understanding of how it
works. The free special report; &#8220;Zacks Rank Guide: Harnessing the Power of
Earnings Estimate Revisions&#8221; is available to provide this insightful background.

About the Zacks Rank 

Since 1988, the Zacks Rank has proven that "Earnings estimate revisions are the
most powerful force impacting stock prices." Since inception in 1988, #1 Rank
Stocks have generated an average annual return of +30%. During the 2000-2002
bear market, Zacks #1 Rank stocks gained +43.8%, while the S 500 tumbled
-37.6%. Also note that the Zacks Rank system has just as many Strong Sell
recommendations (Rank #5) as Strong Buy recommendations (Rank #1). Since 1988,
Zacks Rank #5 stocks have underperformed the S 500 by 81% annually (+2% versus
+11%). Thus, the Zacks Rank system allows investors to truly manage portfolio
trading effectively.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
The Zacks Growth and Income Profit Track strategy looks for stocks with
unusually high dividend yields. Although this screen is based on a long-term and
lower risk approach to investing, it has a history of outperforming the S 500.
Four stocks meeting this screen&#8217;s exclusive criteria are: Nationwide Health
Properties Inc. (NYSE: NHP), W. P. Carey &amp; Co. LLC (NYSE: WPC), Pfizer Inc.
(NYSE: PFE) and NuStar Energy L.P. (NYSE: NS).View the entire list of stocks for

Nationwide Health Properties Inc. (NYSE: NHP) sports a dividend yield of 8.79%

sale-leaseback and build-to-suit financing for companies worldwide. 

W. P. Carey &amp; Co. LLC (NYSE: WPC) offers a dividend yield of 9.45%, and

paid out a dividend of 49 cents to shareholders of record on Sep 26. WPC
announced third-quarter earnings of 83 cents per share, while analysts expected
70 cents. WPC has long served as the preeminent provider of sale-leaseback

dividend yield of 8.23% and a per share price of $15.56. On Dec 1, the company

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
For a while there, it looked like Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) was relatively
well-protected from the financial crisis. Since the company doesn't actually
supply credit to cardholders, it seemed as though Visa would continue to benefit
as consumers increasingly favor plastic over cash for transactions. Today, some
of these high hopes have been dashed by cautious comments from the credit-card
concern.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that it has received an Employers for
Education Excellence (EEE) Award from the Texas Education Agency (TEA),
which recognized IBM for corporate policies and volunteer programs that
help benefit public schools in Texas.

    TEA credited IBM for its flexible work/life balance policies, which
encourage employees to be active supporters in schools where their
children attend and where they can volunteer, and for a number of
programs and initiatives specifically dedicated to improving public
education.

    "Improving public schools has long been IBM's top social priority, so we
are very honored to be recognized by the Texas Education Agency with this
award," said Tony Befi, IBM's senior state executive for Texas. "IBM is
proud to be a leader when it comes to creating innovative programs
targeting public education. Our culture is one that encourages employees
to balance work commitments with school, family and community
obligations."

    This is the first year for the EEE Awards, which are given in three
categories -- Gold, Silver and Bronze. IBM was presented with a Gold
Award. Winners in the Gold Award category have implemented policies that
encourage and support employees who attend parent-teacher conferences, who
implement policies to encourage employees to volunteer in school
activities, and who support employees who participate in student mentoring
programs.

    "This award is just one way of saying thank you to companies and
organizations who have demonstrated -- in a very tangible way -- a strong
commitment to public education," said Dr. Don McLeroy, chair of the Texas
State Board of Education. "Educating the next generation of leaders is an
enormous undertaking, and we all share some responsibility for
contributing to this important effort. These leaders have stepped up to
the challenge and I am proud that the board is honoring them for their
support."

    Among the many initiatives for which IBM was recognized is Transition to
Teaching (T2T), an innovative program that allows employees to take up to
three years to earn a teacher certification. IBM reimburses employees up
to $15,000 to cover course expenses and a leave of absence during a
classroom student-teaching internship. At the end of the three years, the
employee seeks a teaching job and, upon receiving a teaching contract,
leaves the company to become a teacher.

    The program, open to any IBM employee with at least 10 years of IBM work
experience and a technical degree, is designed to help meet the need for
more math and science teachers, particularly with technical backgrounds,
as well as to assist seasoned employees who wish to make a career change
to pursue teaching. Approximately 100 IBM employees around the U.S., and
six in Texas, are participating in the program.

    IBM employees are also strongly encouraged to pursue community
volunteerism, and a major vehicle for that is the IBM On Demand Community,
which allows employees and retirees to track their volunteer hours online.
If volunteers reach a minimum required threshold -- at least eight hours a
month for at least five months at a particular school or non-profit
organization -- they obtain a Community Grant of up to $1,000 in cash or
up to $7,500 in technology, such as PCs, laptops, servers, or early
childhood education computers.

    On Demand Community also includes a number of training modules to help
prepare volunteers. Examples of training topics include mentoring
students, promoting literacy, conducting science experiments with
students, engineering robots for kids, and introducing young children to
technology.

    Another volunteering resource IBM provides employees is MentorPlace, a web
site that facilitates student mentoring. MentorPlace allows employees to
exchange email with students and also provides teachers more than a dozen
learning modules. IBM conducts MentorPlace in several schools in the
Dallas and Austin Independent School Districts.

    IBM and Texas

    Since 1932, Texas has been home to IBM operations and technology
innovation. Today, IBM is one of the 25 largest employers in the state,
according to the Texas Workforce Commission.

    With major offices in Austin, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio, and 11,600
employees statewide, Texas represents IBM's third largest employee
presence in the U.S. These employees play an active role in Texas
communities, donating more than 152,000 volunteer hours and approximately
$4 million in cash and technology in 2007.

    IBM's Austin site, which celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2007, is one
of the company's largest, with 6,200 employees representing 30 business
divisions. Home to much of the company's processor design, hardware and
software development, and a research lab, Austin is one of IBM's most
important technology centers. While Austin makes up less than two percent
of IBM's worldwide population, it represents 10 percent of the company's
technical leadership. In 2007, for the fifth year in a row, the Austin
site contributed more U.S. patents than any other IBM location. Five of
IBM's top inventors call Austin home.

according to the Texas Workforce Commission.

    With major offices in Austin, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio, and 11,600
employees statewide, Texas represents IBM's third largest employee
presence in the U.S. These employees play an active role in Texas
communities, donating more than 152,000 volunteer hours and approximately
$4 million in cash and technology in 2007.

    IBM's Austin site, which celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2007, is one
of the company's largest, with 6,200 employees representing 30 business
divisions. Home to much of the company's processor design, hardware and
software development, and a research lab, Austin is one of IBM's most
important technology centers. While Austin makes up less than two percent
of IBM's worldwide population, it represents 10 percent of the company's
technical leadership. In 2007, for the fifth year in a row, the Austin
site contributed more U.S. patents than any other IBM location. Five of
IBM's top inventors call Austin home.

&lt;p&gt;BANGKOK (Reuters) - A maverick Thai general who has threatened to bomb anti-government protesters and drop snakes on them from helicopters has been reassigned as an aerobics teacher, the Bangkok Post said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major-general Khattiya Sawasdipol, a Rambo-esque anti-communist fighter more commonly known as Seh Daeng, reacted with disappointment to his new role as a military instructor promoting public fitness at marketplaces. "It is ridiculous to send me, a warrior, to dance at markets," he said, before launching an attack on his boss, army chief Anupong Paochinda. "The army chief wants me to be a presenter leading aerobics dancers. I have prepared one dance. It's called the 'throwing-a-hand-grenade' dance," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seh Daeng is something of a folk hero in Thailand on account of his reputed undercover exploits in Cambodia and Laos during the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His predictions of grenade attacks against People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) protesters occupying Government House made headlines last month, especially when they turned out to be correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One protester was killed and 23 wounded by a grenade blast on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seh Daeng has denied any involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ed Cropley; Editing by Darren Schuettler and Sanjeev Miglani)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs on Friday lowered its U.S. growth forecast citing a fiscal policy stagnation, record increase in unemployment and a sharp decline in profits, deepening and extending the expected recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman said it now expects U.S. GDP to fall 5 percent in the current quarter, with unemployment rate reaching 9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also forecast the 10-year yield to fall to 2.75 percent by the end of the first quarter of 2009, as compared to previously estimated 3.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The combination of weaker real activity and slower inflation means that profits of U.S. companies will fall even more sharply than we had previously expected," Goldman said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman now sees economic profits falling 25 percent in 2009 on an annual average basis, the biggest drop since 1938. It had earlier expected a fall of 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman expects unemployment rates to further go up in 2010 as well, as there is little chance of the economy returning to trend growth by that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GDP growth is expected to fall 3 percent and 1 percent in the next two quarters, bringing the drop in GDP close to the decline seen in 1982, economists at Goldman Sachs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have marked down our forecasts for US real GDP in response to continuing signs of falling domestic and foreign demand, labor market deterioration, renewed tightening in financial conditions, and an apparent impasse in fiscal policy pending the transfer of power to the Obama administration in late January," economists led by Jan Hatzius said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman had earlier expected a 3.5 percent fall in GDP for the current quarter and a 2 percent fall and zero growth for the subsequent two quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although a worsening economy is a major driver of the estimate cuts, the U.S. government's financial policy, which led to the tightening in financial conditions was the main reason for the adjustments, the economists said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the economy contracts, inflation pressure has started to ease. "However, we do not expect a broad-based, sustained pattern of significant price decline that would normally be associated with the term 'deflation' over the forecast horizon," they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman analysts also said the next round of bailout plan will exceed their earlier estimate of $200 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anurag Kotoky in Bangalore; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
A new report, announced today, found that IBM (NYSE: IBM) supercomputers
already deemed the most powerful in the world are also the most energy
efficient according to the findings of the latest Supercomputing 'Green
500 List' announced by The Green500.org.

    The report found that the top 20 most energy efficient supercomputers in
the world are built on IBM high performance computing technology. The list
includes supercomputers from across the globe being used for a variety of
applications such as astronomy, climate prediction and pharmaceutical
research. IBM also holds 39 of the top 50 positions on this list.

    The number one most energy efficient system in the world -- an IBM
supercomputer based on QS22 Blade servers at the Interdisciplinary Centre
for Mathematical and Computational Modelling, University of Warsaw --
produces more than 536 Mflops (millions of floating point operations per
second) per watt of energy.

    By comparison, the first non IBM entry on the list offers about half the
performance -- 240 Mflops per watt -- than IBM's number one system. The
most energy efficient system from HP offer's less than half the
performance -- 217 Mflops per watt -- than the top IBM system.

    The recently announced world's fastest supercomputer in the world, the IBM
petaflop supercomputer at Los Alamos National Laboratories, is ranked at
number nine in energy efficiency, while the second most powerful
supercomputer in the world manufactured by Cray is ranked 80th on the
list, producing only 153 Mflops per watts.

    "Modern supercomputers can no long focus only on raw performance," said
David Turek, vice president, deep computing, IBM. "To be commercially
viable these systems most also be energy efficient. IBM has a rich history
of innovation that has significantly increased microprocessor energy
efficiency. We have also driven advances that include our Cool Blue
technology portfolio and added to our Project Big Green solutions that are
designed to simultaneously reduce data center costs and energy use."

    The average energy efficiency of all IBM systems on the Green500 list is
135.58 Mflops per watt, significantly higher than the 76.34 megaflops per
watt average of non-IBM systems and more than double that of HP, with a
total system energy efficiency average of 57.22 megaflops per watt.

    The Green 500 list is published by The Green500.org. It provides a ranking
of the most energy-efficient supercomputers in the world and serves as a
complementary view to the TOP500 list of worldwide supercomputers
announced earlier this week by Top500.org.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 21 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) cut rates at its

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Nov 21 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs is working on a
club loan of up to $1 billion for troubled gaming firm Venetian
Macau Ltd, ahead of next week's visit to Singapore and Macau by
Las Vegas Sands Corp CEO, Sheldon Adelson, banking sources said
on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Talks on the prospective financing are at a preliminary
stage, but sources believe the loan would be linked to Venetian
Macau's recently suspended development projects at sites five
and six on the Cotai Strip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A $5.25 billion financing for Venetian Macau was recently
put on hold after parent Las Vegas Sands (LVS.N) suspended its
Macau development in a move to improve the group's financial
situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The $5.25 billion loan for borrowers Venetian Macau Finance
Co and Venetian Macau US Finance Co LLC, had been earmarked for
the casino giant Las Vegas Sands' current Macau project sites
and for refinancing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Las Vegas Sands Corp, one of Las Vegas' biggest operators,
has been hit hard by the slowdown which cast doubt over its
financial future, however auditors PWC this week announced that
the company was viable after it raised capital last week to
support its operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any new loan would be likely to be completed on a club
basis, sources said, but bankers are mixed about the feasibility
of the project in the deteriorating economic environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some bankers said that the recent $2.1 billion equity
injection into Las Vegas Sands had stabilised the company and
would prevent covenant breaches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Others noted ongoing concerns about Macau's gaming sector
and credit concerns around parent Las Vegas Sands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bankers highlighted the secondary trading levels of a $2
billion loan for Venetian Macau US Finance as a guideline to the
premium that the company would pay for new funds in the current
market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The $2 billion seven-year term loan that was signed in 2006
is trading at 71.43 percent of face value, according to the
October Reuters LPC Asia Pacific Secondary Loan Composite, which
implies an all-in spread of 900 basis points for the new loan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The existing $2 billion loan was priced at 350 bps over
LIBOR and had three tranches -- a HK$1.95 billion-equivalent in
US dollars or HK$ revolving credit with a commitment fee of 125
bps; a HK$33.15 billion-equivalent in US dollars or HK$ term
loan with an average life of four years; and a HK$5.85
billion-equivalent in US dollars or HK$ delayed drawn term loan
with a commitment fee of 175 bps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banco Nacional Ultramarino, Bank of China Macau, Citigroup,
Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Standard Chartered Bank,
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp and UOB were the global lead
coordinating arrangers.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
ArvinMeritor, Inc. (NYSE: ARM), General Motors Corp. (NYSE: GM), EOG Resources,
Inc. (NYSE: EOG), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C).

Here are highlights from Thursday&#8217;s Analyst Blog:

ArvinMeritor Stays in Neutral

ArvinMeritor, Inc. (NYSE: ARM) has earned a leading position in most of the
markets it serves. Presently, the company is planning to spin off its Light
Vehicle Systems (LVS) business. The company is undergoing dramatic cost
reductions through its profit improvement initiative "Performance Plus." It is
also expanding geographically and outsourcing to low-cost countries. 

However, difficult conditions in North American and West European automotive
markets are primary concerns for the company. Downturn in the auto industry,
which took automakers such as General Motors Corporation (NYSE: GM) on the verge
of bankruptcy, makes us apprehensive about the near term prospects for auto
suppliers such as ARM. 

EOG Resources with More Upside

EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE: EOG) is a major independent oil and gas exploration
and production company, with operations in the U.S., Canada, offshore Trinidad,
and the U.K. North Sea. The company has historically concentrated on natural gas
in preference to exploring for oil. 

EOG's third-quarter earnings of $588.3 million were up sharply from the
year-earlier level, driven by increased volumes and improved commodity-price
realizations, partly offset by higher costs. Domestic natural gas production
grew 20%, while liquids volumes rose 65% over last year. 

Consumer Prices' Biggest Fall Ever

It looks like the Fed has been trying to do the right things, but it still is
not working. The massive increase in the money supply that is implied by the
huge expansion of the balance sheet does carry dangers. Monetary policy tends to
work with very long lags, and the data the Fed has to work with is far from
perfect. There is a real danger of an overshoot, which could cause very
significant inflation, even to the point of hyperinflation down the road. This
is not a path that central bankers like to go down, but at this point it looks
like they have little choice. 

Given the likely ineffectiveness of monetary policy at this point, I would
continue to avoid stocks like JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) and Citigroup (NYSE:
C).

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - CreditSights said an acquisition of Citigroup Inc by Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley would significantly add to earnings, if Citi's bad assets were absorbed by the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A potential acquisition of Citigroup would be significantly accretive to Goldman and Morgan Stanley's earnings as the potential buyer would be acquiring a significant future earnings stream for a relatively low price," said analyst David Hendler, in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, the potential need for mark-to-market adjustment on Citi's $2 trillion balance sheet would likely cause capital adequacy concerns for most buyers sans a government backstop," said Hendler, in the note dated November 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup's shares fell 60 percent last week to $3.77.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup's executives last week debated options as the company's share price sank, including merging with another bank or selling off businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup also spoke to the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury last week about the government making a public statement of support and perhaps even putting additional funds into the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Euan Rocha; Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Hollywood Reporter) - The Barack Obama media tour is making another stop -- and at another high-profile place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week after the president-elect and first lady-elect Michelle Obama spoke to "60 Minutes," they're sitting down for an interview with ABC's Barbara Walters. It'll air as a one-hour special Wednesday night on ABC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABC said the interview would touch on the transition, the economy, foreign policy and how the family is dealing with the immense change in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABC no doubt hopes that the Obama interview, which comes on the heels of a November 24 press conference in which the president-elect named his financial advisers, will be as much of a ratings success as the Obamas' interview with "60 Minutes." That November 16 broadcast gave the newsmagazine its best ratings in years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parts of the Barbara Walters interview will also air on ABC's "Good Morning America," "World News" and "Nightline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
As reported in this morning's Opening View, skeptical options speculators
centered on International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) on Friday. More
specifically, the blue chip saw nearly 49,000 puts cross the tape &#8211; 2.5 times
its average daily volume of fewer than 20,000 contracts. However, in today's
trading, calls seem to be the option of choice for IBM followers. In fact, by
noon EST, the tech titan had already seen roughly 26,500 calls change hands &#8211;
about 3.5 times its average volume of about 7,500 contracts.

&lt;p&gt;  BUCHAREST, ROMANIA, Nov 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
BitDefender(R) researchers detected a new significant wave of e-mail spam
purporting to verify and reinforce the "new security measures" from
Chase(TM) Online Banking Team.

    The online form, which claims to be the financial institution's portal,
spoofs several visual identification elements, such as the logo and
general layout, but its domain appears to be registered in Turkey (.tk).

    When users confirm via a PHP script, phishers are able to steal the data.
The retrieved information could be employed to empty bank accounts, but
also for subsequent spamming, phishing or vishing purposes.

    "In terms of security, the repercussions of the critical economic context
and unprecedented changes into the financial realm translated into highly
increased spamming and phishing activities," said Vlad Valceanu, Head of
BitDefender Antispam Research. "For e-criminals, the general concern and
panic are an ideal opportunity to gain access to sensitive information.
Now more than ever, users should be extremely cautious when handling their
financial and personal data throughout the Internet."

&lt;p&gt;Oil Giant Charged With Hypocrisy for Ad Campaign Touting &#8220;Green&#8221; Image While
Amazon Humanitarian Crisis Festers
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
Chevron has hired a &#8220;scientist&#8221; affiliated with a think tank dedicated to
denying the threat of global warming while it spends tens of millions of dollars
on a national advertising campaign to promote a "green" image. 

The Chevron consultant, Douglas Southgate, is actually an &#8220;environmental
economist&#8221; affiliated with a think tank called the Heartland Institute. Based in
Chicago, Heartland promotes the idea that there is a "debate" about global
warming despite the overwhelming scientific consensus that human activity is
responsible for it. The Institute also creates research that downplays the
dangers of secondhand smoke. 

Contributions to the Heartland Institute have flowed from the likes of Exxon,
Phillip Morris, and the ultraconservative Scaife Foundation. The Institute
stopped disclosing its funders in 2006 after it came under attack for producing
tailor-made research in support of its industry supporters. 

The disclosure of Southgate's affiliation is bound to raise even more questions
about Chevron's commitment to green policies, which observers say has fallen
significantly behind its industry rivals. Unlike industry peers Shell and BP,
Chevron has no significant human rights policy for countries where it operates
and currently faces numerous environmental problems around the globe --
including a potential $16.3 billion liability for toxic dumping in Ecuador's
Amazon. 

Southgate recently was quoted in news reports defending Chevron's practices in
Ecuador, which included the dumping of more than 18 billion gallons of toxic
waste into Amazon waterways and the abandonment of more than 900 waste pits
gouged out of the jungle floor. The indigenous groups in Chevron&#8217;s former
concession area have seen their populations decimated and ancestral lands
plagued by the toxic contamination. 

Amazonian communities have long charged that Chevron has fabricated "junk
science" to cover up the fact thousands of soil samples produced in the Ecuador
trial demonstrate life-threatening levels of contamination. An independent,
court-appointed expert who reviewed 54,000 chemical sampling results recently
found that 100% of Chevron's former well sites are contaminated with illegal
levels of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons. 

Chevron has tried to paper over its problems by spending millions to tout the
company&#8217;s new &#8220;human energy&#8221; slogan. 

"Chevron's so-called &#8216;green&#8217; advertising campaign is a fraud when compared to
the company's environmental record in the Amazon," said Pablo Fajardo, an
Ecuadorian lawyer and Goldman Prize winner who leads the Ecuador case. 

"Chevron is paying academics to distort research to hide a humanitarian and
environmental catastrophe in Ecuador," said Fajardo. &#8220;Their advertising budget
would be better spent on solving real problems.&#8221; 

Southgate is just one of the discredited experts employed by Chevron. Other
questionable Chevron "scientists" on the Ecuador case include Ralph Marquez, a
former chief lobbyist for the chemical industry in Texas, and Sara McMillen, a
Chevron scientist who speaks to the media about toxicological issues without
having a degree in the subject.

The Amazon Defense Coalition represents dozens of rainforest communities and
five indigenous groups that inhabit Ecuador&#8217;s Northern Amazon region. The
mission of the Coalition is to protect the environment and secure social justice

IBM Consumer Travel Survey Reveals Most Reported Travel Inconveniences Leading</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
In a new IBM (NYSE: IBM) survey, U.S. travelers report on the fairness of
various airline fees, the frequency of "travel inconveniences" and
industry practices that earn their loyalty in the current environment.
Consumers cited the biggest airline "rip-offs" to be baggage fees (78
percent), additional charges for redemption of miles (76 percent) and
first class ticket prices (58 percent). Surprisingly, 70 percent of
travelers deemed general cabin ticket prices as reasonable, and half of
all travelers thought fuel surcharges were valid as well.

    The phone survey of 1,000 consumers nationwide provides a window into
important areas of focus for travel providers vying for consumer loyalty.
Among the most frequently reported travel inconveniences were restrictions
associated with reward travel. Travelers ranked this as a more frustrating
experience than suffering through "misplaced hotel reservations."
Additionally, an important key learning was that consumers prefer paying
the lowest possible price and choosing amenities a la carte.

    The IBM consumer travel survey was fielded in order to better understand
consumer insights. IBM works with clients in the travel/aviation industry
to maximize the customer experience, and engender greater loyalty and
brand advocacy among consumers.

    "Travel providers must keep their finger on the pulse of consumers and be
able to respond to their changing needs and demands, while balancing the
associated business economics," said Bruce Speechley, Partner, Hospitality
and Leisure Practice Leader, IBM Global Business Services. "Loyalty cannot
be bought -- it has to be earned. That will only be done if travel
providers can serve up a consistent, differentiated experience that is
more valuable and relevant for individual customers."

    In an IBM report released today in conjunction with the survey results,
the company offers insights into smart strategies that can deliver a
superior customer experience through innovative rewards structures. The
report, entitled "Committed Customers or Captives?," from the IBM
Institute of Business Value, focuses on how providers can replace
reluctant customer allegiance with genuine loyalty.

    IBM Travel Survey - Key U.S. Findings:

    78 percent of respondents agree: Baggage Fees are "Rip-Offs."

Respondents are split 50/50 regarding the fairness of fuel surcharges. 

58 percent prefer paying the lowest possible ticket price, sacrificing
all amenities like food, blankets, pillows, beverages and headphones. 

During a flight delay, 31 percent prefer spending time in an Internet
cafe and value Internet access as one of the top three airport amenities. 

    
Analysis from the responses also showed that consumers are not looking
for additional shopping or service "experiences" while at the airport;
they are more interested in getting from Point A to Point B. Similarly,
consumers expressed a lack of interest in redeeming airline miles in
airport shops or for in-flight products and services. 68 percent of those
surveyed expressed a lack of interest in redeeming airline miles for
products and services in airport shops or in-flight. Responses showed
that cost-conscious travelers are more interested in banking their miles
in the hopes of saving money and receiving discounts on future flights.

    How the Airline Industry Stacks Up

    The survey revealed that travelers value one-stop loyalty rewards programs
(across airlines, hotels, restaurants and retailers) and yearn for
all-encompassing programs that consolidate multiple rewards. Consumers
ranked the cruise and hotel industries as the most highly ranked
industries for customer service.

    Another one of the key findings of the survey revealed that airline
troubles plague consumers twice as much as hotel or car rental. As
consumers become more price-conscious with softening demand, airlines will
have to redouble their efforts to engender greater loyalty and advocacy
among customers.

    Additional Highlights:

    Credit Card companies' loyalty programs are perceived to be best; 31
percent rated credit card loyalty programs over competitive programs
offered by hotel, airline and retail providers. 
 51 percent would prefer
a single points provider managing all accumulated rewards where points
could be redeemed across a network of partners (airlines, hotels,
restaurants, retailers, etc). 
 26 percent felt that the airline industry
should emulate the cruise industry to offer greater customer service. 

Consumers value the ability to choose which airline perks are most
important to them. For consumers that travel 2-4 times per year, lower
price airfare and fewer included amenities are preferred. For consumers
that travel 16+ times per year, an all-inclusive, more expensive airline
is preferred. 

    
New Insights into Customer Loyalty

    IBM's new customer loyalty report, like the IBM Consumer Travel Survey,
revealed that customer expectations are falling with regard to their
travel rewards programs. Research showed that 64 percent of travelers
surveyed were likely to stay with a selected travel provider to cash in
on the promise of future rewards, but only 48 percent were satisfied with
the value of their rewards. Although the travel industry boasts some of
the most populated rewards programs -- in 2007, a COLLOQUYtalk report
found that airline rewards programs alone had more than 250 million
members in the U.S., only 40 percent of travel memberships are considered
active -- pointing to a gap in membership numbers and everyday usage.

    The IBM report stresses the importance on improving the customer
experience to deliver a compelling and consistent touch point across
channels.

    Key recommendations of the report include:

    Look beyond miles: Improve the customer experience -- especially in
critical opportunities to delight travelers or recover from service
failures. 
 Choose a strategic position: Articulate the role of customer
loyalty from either a product-focused, partner coalition or comprehensive
rewards standpoint. 
 Commit to invest: Target the right level of
investment in loyalty program innovation. Use technology to strengthen
the ability to gain customer insights via data mining, predict and manage
unused capacity and socially connect with customers. 
 Strive to improve
continuously: Progress along a "value continuum" to strengthen
capabilities and improve loyalty over time. 

    
Survey Methodology

    The IBM consumer travel survey analysis is based on the findings of a
phone survey that was conducted by Braun Research among 1,000 U.S. adults
age 18 or older from October 25-27, 2008. The total results reported are
at the 95 percent confidence level with a margin of error of +/-3.1
percent. Respondents who have taken two or more personal or business
trips in the past 18 months were included.

&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI (Reuters) - The best opportunities for JPMorgan (JPM.N) in India are private equity deals, inbound acquisitions and, in future years, capital raisings for domestic banks, its India investment banking head said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With more companies seeking capital, private equity firms from the United States and Europe have the money to spend to inject cash, buy illiquid assets, or acquire an entire business, all potential boons to banks like JPMorgan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our focus is inbound activity and private equity deals from a strategic standpoint. There are a few large companies that do think this is a good time to make a move, provided the volatility settles down," Vedika Bhandarkar, JPMorgan's head of investment banking in India told Reuters on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some of the private equity players are talking about buy-outs in the small to mid-scale, $100 to $120 million, range."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan advised Japan's NTT DoCoMo Inc (9437.T) on its $2.7 billion deal to buy a 26 percent stake in Indian telecom Tata Teleservices TATASL.UL earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market volatility and a mismatch in valuation expectations between buyer and seller were the main culprits behind the slowdown in private equity deals across India, but that gap "is steadily disappearing," she said in an interview as part of this week's Reuters India Investment Summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another opportunity she spoke of was capital raisings for India's domestic banks, given an increase in non-performing loans (NPLs). While NPLs for India and China's major banks remain low compared to other countries, the consumer and corporate sectors are getting hit with tighter lending conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect bank capitalization activity to become a focus in the 2010-2011 timeframe," she said, explaining that for now banks were adequately capitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with most of Asia, India's stock and real estate markets have plunged this year, hit by the global credit crisis and a slowdown in the once-booming economy. However, the number of private equity firms coming to India appears to be growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York-based Kohlberg Kravis Roberts  Co. KKR.UL, one of the world's largest private equity firms and a pioneer of the business, is opening up its first office in India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bhandarkar said manufacturing was among the Indian sectors attracting interest from outside buyers, helped by domestic demand in areas such as consumer electronics and foods and beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEIZING MA SHARE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Year to date, JPMorgan has been involved with $5.5 billion worth of transactions, ranking them sixth in the India MA tables for both inbound and outbound deals. That's up from $1.1 billion of deals last year and a ranking of 18th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private equity and venture capital investments in India rose to $9.7 billion in the first nine months of this year from $9.5 billion a year earlier, according to Venture Intelligence, an Indian deal-tracking firm. While only a tiny uptick, the fact that private equity activity was able to increase amid the global credit crisis is significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KKR last week said it has hired Citigroup's (C.N) south Asia head Sanjay Nayar to head up its first Indian office. KKR's new Mumbai office is a vote of confidence for the private equity sector in India, which is expected to scoop up stakes in companies while prices are low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of companies that felt the necessity, have scaled back their capital expenditure," she said. "Having said that, there is an enormous amount of capital expenditure that is already being implemented, which needs to be funded."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York-based JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM.N), has weathered the financial market crisis better than most of its rivals. While it has not had to take severe writedowns on mortgage-related assets that other banks suffered, its chief executive has warned of possible losses from exposure to consumer debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has 11,500 employees in India. About 500 are in the business group spread across investment banking, asset management, banking, research, treasury and securities business. The rest are in the services group that includes its back office and technical support teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by John Mair)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Today, IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced new cloud computing services to help
businesses of all sizes take advantage of this increasingly-attractive
computing model. With today's announcements, IBM is applying its
industry-specific consulting expertise and established technology record
to offer secure, practical services to companies in public, private and
hybrid cloud models.

    Industry-specific Business Consulting Services for Cloud Computing - IBM
Global Business Services will use an economic model for assessing the
total cost of ownership for building private clouds, and/or moving data
and applications off-site in a public or hybrid cloud model. Technology
Consulting, Design and Implementation Services - IBM Global Technology
Services is announcing new services to help clients install, configure
and deliver cloud computing inside the data center. Cloud Security -
Spanning IBM Systems, Software, Services and IBM's lauded Research and
X-Force arms, this effort is aimed at re-architecting and re-designing
technologies and processes, to infuse security and shield against threats
and vulnerabilities in the cloud.

    The old one-server-per-application model has created a dire situation in
the data centers of large enterprises. Their infrastructures are becoming
too complex and expensive to maintain, and smaller organizations want new
ways to grow and expand their businesses without falling victim to these
same issues.

    Cloud computing, or network-delivered services and software, can save
customers up to 80 percent on floor space and 60 percent on power and
cooling costs, and deliver triple asset utilization(1). While the
economics are compelling to businesses of all sizes, concerns over
security, data portability and reliability are causing reluctance among
enterprise customers.

    New Services for Cloud Computing

    IBM's new business consulting services use economic modeling to assess the
total cost of ownership for building and integrating clouds. Initial
research indicates that organizations will employ both public and private
clouds to achieve business goals, and IBM can help companies find the most
effective balance, and manage it all as one integrated strategy.

    In addition, cloud technology consulting services will help clients create
roadmaps for re-constructing their IT environments, so they can take
advantage of cloud computing models to improve operational efficiency,
overall carbon posture and return on investment. With new cloud
implementation services, IBM will apply expert-level skills, methods,
guidance and project management techniques to help clients plan, configure
and test the servers, storage and technologies necessary to support a
dynamic technology environment.

    "Cloud strategies need to be in line with business strategies," said Willy
Chiu, Vice President, High Performance on Demand Solutions, IBM. "Over the
last year in our 13 cloud computing centers worldwide, we've worked with
clients to understand how to help them take advantage of both public and
private clouds to get the best economics."

    New Clients Move into the Cloud with IBM

    In addition to new services, IBM is helping new clients move into the
cloud. One of Houston's largest and fastest-growing human services
agencies, Neighborhood Centers serves over 200,000 citizens in Southwest
Texas and delivers key services including economic development services,
citizenship and immigration services, early childhood development
programs, a K-5 charter school and seniors programs. The non-profit
organization depends on IBM cloud services to back-up server and PC data
from distributed environments, and store it in secure off-site locations.

    "Neighborhood Centers is dedicated to helping citizens cope with
disruption and plan for contingencies in life -- as second responders in
emergencies we simply cannot afford to be shut down, or slowed down, by a
data loss," said Tom Comella, chief information officer, Neighborhood
Centers Inc. "IBM cloud services were critical in our community recovery
efforts following Hurricane Ike. Since we experienced no business
interruptions in any of our 20 facilities, we were able to focus on
bringing the community, our services and our citizens back online. But
the benefits of cloud services reach far beyond disaster recovery. Better
data protection -- demonstrating that we are good stewards of information
-- has become a selling point for us in willing contracts."

    IBM Research is working directly with clients to create replicable,
cloud-delivered, industry-specific services like Lender Business Process
Services or Healthcare Process Services, as well as horizontal business
services like CRM and supply chain management.

    In China, for example, IBM Research is piloting a newly developed cloud
computing platform, codenamed Project Yun which is Chinese for "cloud,"
for companies to access business services, designed to make the selection
and implementation of new cloud services as easy as selecting an item
from a drop-down menu. With no need for back-end provisioning, the IBM
platform stands to cut the time required to deliver new services
dramatically. The Yun platform allocates storage, server and network
resources for the customer application with zero human input, achieving
top performance, availability and power utilization.

    One of China's largest retailers with more than 10 million customers per
day, Wang Fu Jing Department Store, has deployed several key cloud
services from Project Yun, including a supply chain management solution
for its vast network of retail stores to easily share supply chain
information and visualize the execution of B2B business processes with
thousands of their own SMB suppliers via the cloud.

    Securing Enterprise Cloud Computing

    To ensure the widespread adoption of cloud computing services, IBM has
initiated a company-wide project to form a unified and comprehensive
security architecture for cloud computing environments. The effort, which
spans Systems, Software, Services and IBM's lauded Research and X-Force
arms, is aimed at re-architecting and re-designing technologies and
processes, to infuse security and shield against threats and
vulnerabilities. Security is built-in to the cloud, not an afterthought.

    The project incorporates next-generation security and cloud service
management technologies, as well as simplified security management and
enforcement, offering enterprise customers the same security and
compliance guarantees that are equivalent or better than what they can
expect in traditional computing environments.

    Built upon IBM's extensive industry security leadership, the project
focuses on developing trusted virtual domains, authentication, isolation
management, policy and integrity management and access control
technologies designed specifically for cloud computing

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
In a move that could spur the rise of the nascent computing model known
as "cloud," IBM (NYSE: IBM) today said it would introduce a program to
validate the resiliency of any company delivering applications or
services to clients in the cloud environment. As a result, customers can
quickly and easily identify trustworthy providers that have passed a
rigorous evaluation, enabling them to more quickly and confidently reap
the business benefits of cloud services.

    Cloud computing is a model for network-delivered services, in which the
user sees only the service and does not view the implementation or
infrastructure required for its delivery. The success to date of cloud
services like storage, data protection and enterprise applications, has
created a large influx of new providers. However, unpredictable
performance and some high-profile downtime and recovery events with newer
cloud services have created a challenge for customers evaluating the move
to cloud.

    IBM's new "Resilient Cloud Validation" program will allow businesses who
collaborate with IBM on a rigorous, consistent and proven program of
benchmarking and design validation to use the IBM logo: "Resilient Cloud"
when marketing their services.

    Operating the most data centers in the world, IBM has delivered remote
technology services to clients for decades and has developed strict
standards for service quality -- from infrastructure design to process
excellence. Through its new Resilient Cloud Validation program, IBM's
Business Continuity and Resiliency Services unit will build on its 40-year
history of eliminating downtime in the most demanding business
environments to help cloud service providers meet the highest standards
of resiliency. In addition, IBM Research has developed end-to-end tools
for assessment and discovery within a customer's configuration, modeling,
ROI analysis, optimization and migration to a highly virtualized cloud
environment.

    IBM announced today that Allscripts, a leader in delivering innovation
technologies that improve the health of patients and the bottom line of
physicians and other healthcare organizations, is the first company to
begin the certification process. The designation is expected to enable
Allscripts to enhance the current online data backup service it provides
to better serve the needs of the 150,000 physicians who use the company's
electronic health records, e-prescribing and practice management
solutions. Next Spring, Allscripts will release a new online backup
service, powered by IBM, which will provide a simple, easy to deploy
remote data protection service, helping to ensure that sensitive patient
information and medical documentation will be encrypted, securely stored
away from the customer location, and easily recovered at a moment's
notice.

    "Our physician clients have come to expect that the clinical information
stored by our software solutions is secure, private and available without
interruption around the clock. By partnering with IBM, we're able to
deliver an affordable, enterprise-class data protection and recovery
service through the cloud, to even the smallest physician practices," said
Paul Edge, Vice President of Solutions Management for Allscripts. "We're
dedicated to continuing to provide highly available cloud services to our
clients, and IBM is a critical partner for us -- we look forward to
continued work with IBM on the Resilient Cloud Proven program."

    "Every cloud service provider has the same objective: provide an
uninterrupted flow of information for their business," said Philippe
Jarre, IBM General Manager of Business Continuity and Resiliency
Services. "Since these providers power other businesses, there is a
'network effect' of downtime, it's absolutely critical to build to the
highest standards of resiliency."

    Getting Started

    IBM's Business Continuity and Resiliency Services have 155 data centers
around the globe, and offer a range of capabilities from advisory services
to fully-managed resilient infrastructures. These teams are available
today to evaluate current cloud architectures against resiliency best
practices, identify, quantify, and prioritize gaps and risks, then
provide the ongoing design assistance and management expertise to run
more resilient infrastructures.

    The IBM "Resilient Cloud" program will be available in early 2009.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds analysts' comments)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 24 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs cut its 2008 and 2009
earnings estimate on the Standard  Poor's 500 Index .SPX,
and said profits at non-financial companies in the index will
face the same decline experienced by financial firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a separate note, Citigroup cut its 2008 and 2009 targets
on the index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. government's bailout plan, attempts by financial
firms to recapitalize, the outcome of the U.S. presidential
elections and central bank intervention have failed to turn
equity markets around, "leaving many with a sense of
hopelessness as to what conditions are needed for stocks to
stop falling," Citi analyst Tobias Levkovich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup cut its 2008 target for the index to 850 points
from 1,200 points. The 2009 target was cut to 1,000 points from
1,300 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman cut its 2008 earnings-per-share estimate on the
index to $55 from $65 -- its third estimate cut in less than
three months. The 2009 estimate was cut to $53 from $68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SP 500 index was up more than 3.5 percent at 828.23
points on Monday morning.

Research and Markets

announced the addition of the "Pharma Company Profiles - Pfizer" report to their
offering. 

The success of pharmaceutical companies has always been driven by the successful
launches of blockbusters. Now the environment confronting the industry is
getting increasingly challenging, as competition, regulatory measures, patent
expiry, and healthcare cost-containment measures all are constraining revenue
and profit growth. Big Pharma players are redefining the threshold of
innovation. In this context, pharmaceutical companies will have to move towards
a 'new way of doing business' in order to create value for all stakeholders.
Those that will be good at anticipating changes and creating new business models
will be the real winners. 

Synergyst's Pharma Company Profiles, extensively analyses the Big Pharma
companies and the markets in which they operate. Report covers a detailed
analysis of the company focusing on the business segments in which it operates
and an analysis of its R initiatives and various products it has developed and
is developing. Further, the report provides a comprehensive analysis of
company's financials, its top competitors and the strategies it is implementing
to improve its market position. Report also presents analyst views and earning
estimates for the company.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN, Ireland--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/5b9f39/designing_matrix_o) has
announced the addition of John Wiley and Sons Ltd's new report "Designing Matrix
Organizations that Actually Work: How IBM, Proctor &amp; Gamble and Others Design
for Success" to their offering. 

Organization structures do not fail, says Jay Galbraith, but management fails at
implementing them correctly. This is why, he explains, the idea that the matrix
does not work still exists today, even among people who should know better. But
the matrix has become a necessary form of organization in today's business
environment. Companies now know that if they have multiple product lines, do
business in multiple countries, and serve many customer segments through a
variety of channels, there is no way they can avoid some kind of a matrix
structure and the question most are asking is "How do we learn how to operate
the matrix effectively?" In Designing Matrix Organizations That Actually Work,
Galbraith answers this and other questions as he shows how to make a matrix work
effectively.

&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI (Reuters) - The best opportunities for JPMorgan (JPM.N) in India are private equity deals, inbound acquisitions and, in future years, capital raisings for domestic banks, its India investment banking head said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our focus is inbound activity and private equity deals from a strategic standpoint. There are a few large companies that do think this is a good time to make a move, provided the volatility settles down," Vedika Bhandarkar, JPMorgan's head of investment banking in India told Reuters on Monday. "Some of the private equity players are talking about buy-outs in the small to mid-scale, $100 to $120 million, range."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market volatility and a mismatch in valuation expectations between buyer and seller was the main culprit for the slowdown in private equity deals across India, but that gap "is steadily disappearing," she said in an interview as part of this week's Reuters India Investment Summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another opportunity she spoke of was capital raisings for India's domestic banks, given an increase in non-performing loans (NPLs). While NPLs for India and China's major banks remain low compared to other countries, the consumer and corporate sectors are getting hit with tighter lending conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect bank capitalization activity to become a focus in the 2010-2011 timeframe," she said, explaining that for now banks are adequately capitalized, but will need to raise money as NPLs rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michael Flaherty  Narayanan Somasundaram; Editing by John Mair)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  SAN JOSE, CA, Nov 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Intacct, a leader in on-demand financial management and accounting
applications, today announced that Gemstone Hotels &amp; Resorts, LLC has
selected Intacct as its new financial system of record. Gemstone, a
company that specializes in managing upscale boutique hotels and unique
resorts across the U.S., chose Intacct to improve financial visibility,
decrease IT costs and streamline financial management of its multiple
properties.

    Gemstone, based in Park City, Utah, currently manages a dozen hotel and
resort properties across the U.S. The company is growing fast and expects
to double its number of properties within the next two years. This growth
and the added complexity these new properties will bring to Gemstone's
financial processes and IT infrastructure led the company to reevaluate
its previous Microsoft Dynamics(TM) AX ERP system.

    In evaluating potential options for a new financial management and
accounting system, Gemstone looked at solutions from Intacct, Microsoft
and Aptech, which offered a solution tailored specifically for the
hospitality industry. Gemstone quickly determined that the Microsoft and
Aptech solutions would require a significant investment in IT
infrastructure to implement and maintain, something they wanted to avoid.
Gemstone was also looking for a solution that offered robust reporting
capabilities. Intacct, with its Software as a Service (SaaS) delivery
model and powerful reporting and analysis capabilities became the obvious
choice.

    "We were very impressed with the deep functionality provided by the
Intacct financial management system. The increased financial visibility
from Intacct's reporting and dashboard capabilities will enable us to
better manage our business as we grow," said Greg Hooper, director of
property accounting. "We wanted a stable solution that was independent of
our corporate computer infrastructure, with its related support
requirements and periodic downtime."

    Intacct will provide Gemstone with a financial management system that
helps deal with the complex accounting involved with running multiple
properties, each with their own finances, staff and vendors. Intacct
delivers real-time visibility into operations, allowing resort managers
to easily view per-bed profitability reports and corporate managers to
view property-by-property comparisons. Intacct's multi-entity
functionality will also enable Gemstone to easily consolidate the
finances from all its properties, while allowing each unit to function
completely autonomously.

    Key benefits of Intacct for hospitality management companies like
Gemstone
include:


--  Superior financial and accounting applications that automate key
    processes and ensure GAAP and SOX compliance
--  Real-time business visibility into each property individually, as well
    as into the business as a whole, ensuring that companies are always on top
    of their finances
--  Granular permission controls so staff can enter information for their
    specific properties and locations, without accessing the rest of the
    company's financial management system
--  Financial consolidation in whatever way makes the most sense to their
    business -- whether its by geography, currency, ownership or operations
    

    
"One of the most impressive things about Intacct is its multi-entity
management capability," added Hooper. "We wanted a solution that would
allow us to easily add and remove financial entities as we acquire and
divest various properties. In addition, we needed a solution that would
continue to allow us to do both centralized and decentralized accounting.
Intacct meets these needs perfectly."

&lt;p&gt;BeyondTrust Privilege Manager 4.1 Enables Enterprises to Easily Create and
Manage Policies in Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista SP1
PORTSMOUTH, N.H.--(Business Wire)--
BeyondTrust Corporation, the first provider of Least Privilege Management
solutions, today announced support for Microsoft&#8217;s new Group Policy Management
capabilities available in Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista SP1. Using
BeyondTrust Privilege Manager 4.1, policies can now be created and managed
within the new Group Policy Management Editor on Windows Server 2008 and Windows
Vista SP1-based computers to implement the security best practice of Least
Privilege. This highly integrated solution makes it even easier for enterprises
to create and manage policies that eliminate administrator rights for end users,
and transparently grant administrative privileges to applications that require
them. 

&#8220;Organizations today are increasingly reliant on Group Policy to ensure that
their Windows servers and desktops are secure and well managed,&#8221; said Derek
Melber (MCSE, MVP) author of the &#8220;Group Policy Resource Kit&#8221; published by
Microsoft Press and one of only ten MVPs in the world in the area of Group
Policy. &#8220;By providing an easy-to-use solution that enables enterprises to remove
administrator rights and allows users to run all authorized applications through
tight integration with Group Policy, BeyondTrust Privilege Manager reduces the
overall cost of supporting enterprise Windows users and improves security.&#8221; 

Privilege Manager 4.1 introduces support for the new Microsoft Group Policy
Management Editor, which is now available in Windows Server 2008 and Vista
SP1-based computers that have Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT)
installed, and includes popular Group Policy preferences as native, built-in
functionality. Privilege Manager 4.1 offers new features and enhancements to
strengthen Least Privilege security, including:

* Support for creating and editing policies in the new Microsoft Group Policy
Management Editor on Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista SP1 with RSAT
installed. 
* Logging enhancements&#8212;new flexible options for specifying how much data on
application execution will be logged, enabling options such as logging all
application execution by users whose token includes administrators or only
logging application execution when there is a Privilege Manager rule match. 
* CD/DVD Rule elevation for MSI packages&#8212;allows for the installation of software
in MSI format from authorized CDs and DVDs that an enterprise may distribute to
users.

BeyondTrust&#8217;s award-winning Privilege Manager software is implemented as a Group
Policy extension. Organizations simply specify the privileges necessary for an
application. These privileges will be added to the application process when it
is launched enabling end-users without administrative privileges to run all
authorized applications. Privilege Manager will reduce support costs and provide
great flexibility for maintaining standardized desktop configurations, such as
those recently specified in the Federal Desktop Core Configuration mandate. 

&#8220;Group Policy has become the de facto standard mechanism for managing desktop
settings and maintaining standardized and secure desktop configurations in a
Windows environment,&#8221; said John Moyer, CEO of BeyondTrust. &#8220;As part of our
commitment to providing customers with the most comprehensive capabilities for
managing Windows user privileges throughout the enterprise, BeyondTrust is
introducing seamless integration with Microsoft&#8217;s new Group Policy offerings
with Privilege Manager 4.1. We look forward to delivering continued support for
the latest Group Policy technologies to help companies reduce desktop management
costs and make least privilege a manageable reality for their organizations.&#8221; 

Pricing and Availability

BeyondTrust Privilege Manager 4.1 is available immediately. Pricing starts at
$30 per seat. Current Privilege Manager customers will be upgraded as part of
their upgrade assurance program. Privilege Manager supports Microsoft Windows
Vista, 2000, XP, Server 2003, Server 2008 and 64-bit platforms. 

About BeyondTrust

BeyondTrust Corporation, a pioneer in Least Privilege Management, enables
enterprises to move beyond the need to trust users with excess privileges or
administrator passwords. BeyondTrust Privilege Manager was the first product to
enable the security best practice of Least Privilege in Windows environments by
allowing administrators to assign end-users permissions for required or selected
applications. Least Privilege strengthens security by limiting users to the
permissions they need to do their jobs. Hundreds of organizations worldwide in
industries such as financial, healthcare, government and military rely on
BeyondTrust Privilege Manager to secure their enterprises. For more information,

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds analyst comments)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 24 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Securities downgraded Science
Applications International Corp SAI.N to "underweight" from
"neutral," and said the defense supplier may be affected by an
anticipated tighter budget environment for defense companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While we believe the company has a highly capable
management team and sound strategy, we see its valuation
premium to the defense primes as excessive, particularly as it
is not immune to deteriorating industry fundamentals," analyst
Joseph Nadol wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nadol said he expects the U.S. government to rein in the
use of higher-margin time and material (TM) contracts. This
will hit the SAIC's margins, as such contracts provided about
35 percent of the company's sales in first half of the year, he
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Additionally, a decrease in spending on Iraq by the
government should also affect SAIC, Nadol said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company closed at $18.09 Friday on the New
York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Microsoft will be filled to the gills with "The Guild."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software giant has an exclusive lock on the long-awaited second season of the Internet cult hit, which will be the first to be distributed worldwide simultaneously across Microsoft's triple platform of Xbox 360's Live Marketplace, MSN and Zune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sprint has signed on to sponsor the 12-episode run, making it the first marketer to test Microsoft's new strategy to draw ad dollars with the combined reach of a gaming console, Internet portal and portable media player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A scripted comedy chronicling the misadventures of a group of online gamers, "Guild" premieres Tuesday on Independent Video, Xbox's new channel devoted to original content. "Guild" will lead a collection of ad-supported and fee-based programs, including such other game-oriented fare as "The Jace Hall Show," "Red vs. Blue" and first-season episodes of "Guild."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although launching with just five or six programs, Xbox has ambitions of expanding Independent Video beyond the gaming theme to embrace a broader audience. The channel is launching with the only other original deal it has done to date, the webisode "Horror Meets Comedy" from Safran Media Group, which is not gaming-related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After reaching 9 million views with a 10-episode season financed from viewer contributions via PayPal, "Guild" emerged last year as one of the more buzzed-about webisodes. Its star, creator and writer-producer, Felicia Day, has become the face of the original Web production world, starring opposite Neil Patrick Harris in one of the few other success stories in online originals, "Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog," created by Joss Whedon. "Horrible" also is syndicated on Xbox's Independent Video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key component of the deal allows for Day to retain the intellectual property rights to "Guild" while collecting an unspecified upfront license fee. A who's who of Web brands courted Day for rights to "Guild," from old-media companies to gamer-centric ad networks, though many insisted on retaining the traditional set of rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Day had been holding out for more than a year in search of a deal that gave her control of the creative and business sides of "Guild." "I was adamant about holding on to the rights of my series," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, Microsoft will not participate in revenue should "Guild" eventually graduate to TV or film, though the corporation does hold on to any gaming-related extensions. Which is fine by Scott Nocas, group product manager at Xbox Live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're a software and hardware company," he said. "If they want to do a movie deal, that's not our core business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four weeks after each episode of "Guild" airs, it moves into a second window on Watchtheguild.com, home base for the first season's episodes. However, Microsoft retains ad revenue in that window as well as in an unspecified split because episodes will air in an embedded MSN media player. Once the entire season is completed by the end of February, Day can make a new deal for a nonexclusive run beyond Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An added plus for going with Xbox is that "Guild" will be distributed day-and-date in nine languages in 26 countries where Xbox Live operates, reaching 14 million users. "Guild" found unintended international appeal late in its run, according to Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sprint will attach itself to "Guild" in various ways from preroll messaging to branded entertainment; mobile phone Sprint Instinct is shown being used by one of the series' characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each "Guild" episode runs 4-7 minutes long. A separate holiday special is also covered under the deal, which will allow "Guild" to shoot in high-definition for its Xbox window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the introduction of Independent Video, which was deployed last week as part of a relaunch of the Xbox Live Marketplace interface, all TV and film content was available on a transactional basis. "Guild" and "Horror," which is sponsored by the Air Force, will be Xbox's first free programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Horror" also will be pushed through all three Microsoft distribution points but won't move to MSN and Zune until after its Xbox run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DENVER, HONOLULU &amp; MUNICH, Germany--(Business Wire)--
Intermap Technologies and FS Dreamscapes today announced the addition of
NEXTMap&#174; ProMesh&#8482; Germany to their series of terrain mesh and photoscenery
downloads for Microsoft&#174; Flight Simulator X and ESP. Germany joins an extensive
NEXTMap ProMesh product suite that, to date, includes California, Florida,
Hawaii, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and the United Kingdom 

The FS Dreamscapes terrain is sixteen times the resolution and 256 times more
detailed than the default FSX terrain mesh for Europe. This is the most
significant terrain upgrade for Western Europe since the Shuttle Radar
Topography Mission (SRTM) data was introduced in Flight Simulator 2000. 

&#8220;We&#8217;re extremely excited to add Germany to our product line,&#8221; says Dean
Mountford, president and CEO of FS Dreamscapes. &#8220;For the first time in flight
simulator history, 1-meter vertically accurate data for Germany is now
available, making flying virtual flight rules over the country extremely
realistic. This is a massive increase in terrain detail compared to the current
default SRTM-derived 15-meter vertical accurate data. Users can now experience
the thrill of flying over the majestic peaks and through the breath-taking
valleys in the Bavarian Alps and Zugspitze, or try their hand at a low-level
flight path over the city of Berlin &#8211; the riverbanks rendered in high detail as
you zoom through the course at the air races. This is undeniably simulated
flying at its best." 

&#8220;NEXTMap ProMesh Germany allows pilots to fly near real-world missions through
pre-visualizing the surrounding terrain safely within the Microsoft Flight
Simulator X and ESP applications. As Intermap finalizes the digital mapping
coverage across Western Europe in early 2009, we&#8217;ll continue to enable FS
Dreamscapes to expand the coverage of their leading flight simulator dataset.
Ultimately, users will be able to experience the exhilaration of flying over the
continent&#8217;s most famous and historic landmarks,&#8221; stated Kevin Thomas, vice
president of marketing for Intermap Technologies. 

NEXTMap ProMesh add-ons for Flight Simulator and Microsoft&#174; ESP allow consumers,
pilot trainees, researchers, and scientists to maneuver real time within a 3D
visualization simulation platform. The use of Intermap&#8217;s NEXTMap&#174; USA and
NEXTMap&#174; Europe uniformly derived digital terrain models within the Flight
Simulator and ESP platforms are paving the way for future real time visual
simulation technologies with practical real world applications. 

Microsoft Flight Simulator photoscenery and terrain mesh products are available
for purchase and download at:&#160;www.fsdreamscapes.com/store.

&lt;p&gt;Top Three Tech Toys on Kids&#8217; Holiday Wish Lists Revealed in Survey Results

Parents Can Now Turn to Disney Family.com&#8217;s &#8220;Get Plugged In&#8221; Resource for Tips
on How to Determine What Tech Gadgets Are Right for Kids of All Ages
NORTH HOLLYWOOD, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Only seven percent of parents, when asked about their family&#8217;s technology use,
said they typically buy the latest and greatest gadgets and 53% said they choose
to buy new technology when prices drop. Additionally, 83% said access to new
technology in school has opened new worlds of possibilities for their children
and only 29% of respondents opposed having the U.S. government subsidize
computers for families even if it means raising taxes. These findings, among
others, were revealed in a recent online survey about kids and technology from
Disney Family.com (www.family.com). 

In addition to focusing on technology use at home and in school, the recent
survey asked what gadgets are most desired by kids today. According to the
results, the top three tech toys on the wish lists of respondents&#8217; kids were the
Nintendo Wii, an iPod and digital cameras. As kids continue to ask for more and
more new gadgets at younger ages, Disney Family.com created an online tech
timeline to help parents understand what technology is appropriate for kids of
all ages. 

Further survey findings include:

* Forty percent of respondents&#8217; children have cell phones. Of those, 36% are
responsible for paying all or part of their cell phone bill. 
* Forty-eight percent of respondents age 25 &#8211; 34 said their child(ren) began
using a cell phone at age five or younger. 
* While 80% of respondents are worried about online safety, 26% of respondents&#8217;
children age eight or younger are allowed to access the internet alone. 
* Eighty-one percent of respondents&#8217; children have provided a personal email
address to register for a site online; 69% have uploaded a photo online and 59%
have used online chat/instant messaging. 
* Forty-nine percent of respondents identified the internet as their first
source of information about online safety.

&#8220;After reviewing the survey findings and reading the conversations parents are
having on Disney Family.com, it&#8217;s clear that parents are welcoming technology
into their children&#8217;s lives, but aren&#8217;t sure how to make the experience safe and
secure,&#8221; said Emily Smith, vice president of Disney Online&#8217;s Family Group of
Sites. &#8220;To address parents&#8217; concerns and answer some of their questions, we
developed the &#8220;Get Plugged In&#8221; resource on Disney Family.com and enlisted
technology experts to help guide parents to make the best technology decisions.&#8221;


To teach parents more about new technology and to help them make smart decisions
about their family&#8217;s technology use, the new Disney Family.com &#8220;Get Plugged In&#8221;
resource (www.family.com/kidtech) includes simple tips and ideas to get up to
speed quickly, along with original articles from Warren Buckleitner, Ph.D.,
Editor of Children's Technology Review who teaches at Rutgers University and New
York University. 

&#8220;Parents find many aspects of technology confusing, such as how to know which
products are appropriate for their child. For example, a product designed for
children ages five to eight is clearly not appropriate for all children in that
age range. The skill set of a five year old is quite different from that of an
eight year old,&#8221; said Warren Buckleitner. &#8220;Through the collaboration with Disney
Family.com, we hope to provide parents with meaningful everyday ideas to help
them make smart decisions related to technology.&#8221; 

The Disney Family.com &#8220;Get Plugged In&#8221; resource features:

* A technology timeline to determine which gadgets match the skill sets of
children at every age
* Expert advice and tips for keeping kids safe online
* Top 20 Interactive Games for Kids of Every Age
* &#8220;Upgrade My Space&#8221; Sweepstakes &#8211; a chance to win a flat-screen TV and up to
$5,000 in prizes 
* &#8220;IM IQ&#8221; widget &#8211; a multi-level game that tests your texting lingo and
knowledge 
* Kids &amp; Technology Community Group &#8211; discuss the latest gadgets, tech tips and
more with other parents

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - CreditSights said an acquisition of Citigroup Inc by Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley would significantly add to earnings, if Citi's bad assets were absorbed by the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A potential acquisition of Citigroup would be significantly accretive to Goldman and Morgan Stanley's earnings as the potential buyer would be acquiring a significant future earnings stream for a relatively low price," said analyst David Hendler, in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, the potential need for mark-to-market adjustment on Citi's $2 trillion balance sheet would likely cause capital adequacy concerns for most buyers sans a government backstop," said Hendler, in the note dated November 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup's shares fell 60 percent last week to $3.77.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup's executives last week debated options as the company's share price sank, including merging with another bank or selling off businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup also spoke to the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury last week about the government making a public statement of support and perhaps even putting additional funds into the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Euan Rocha; Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latest Achievement Extends Life of Field That Has Produced More Than 2 Billion
Barrels
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today announced that its wholly owned subsidiary,
PT Chevron Pacific Indonesia, has started producing crude oil from the North
Duri Field Area 12 in Indonesia, where Chevron produces nearly half the nation&#8217;s
crude oil. 

First oil was achieved on Nov. 14, 2008, and production is projected to increase
to 34,000 barrels of crude oil per day by 2012. Initial production from North
Duri Area 12 will increase with the application of steamflood technology next
year. 

&#8220;The Duri Field is a remarkable base business success for Chevron. With the
application of technology, we have been able to extend the life of this field
and increase the amount of oil ultimately recovered,&#8221; said George Kirkland,
executive vice president, Upstream and Gas, Chevron. 

North Duri Area 12 represents the latest expansion of the Duri field, the
largest producing field Chevron operates in Indonesia. The Duri Field currently
produces nearly 200,000 barrels of crude oil per day. Discovered in 1941 on the
island of Sumatra, the field is one of the world&#8217;s largest steamflood projects.
Steamflooding is an enhanced oil recovery method that injects steam into the
reservoir to increase oil recovery. At the Duri Field, steamflooding has more
than tripled oil production, and has enabled the recovery of more than 2 billion
barrels of crude oil. 

&#8220;This remarkable achievement builds on our 84-year history in Indonesia, where
we are working together with the government to efficiently develop Indonesia&#8217;s
crude oil, natural gas and geothermal resources,&#8221; said Jim Blackwell, president,
Chevron Asia Pacific Exploration and Production Company. 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world&#8217;s leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business across the globe. The company&#8217;s success
is driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 59,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and other energy products; manufactures and sells
petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides
energy efficiency solutions; and develops and commercializes the energy
resources of the future, including biofuels and other renewables. Chevron is
based in San Ramon, Calif. More information about Chevron is available at
www.chevron.com.

"Safe Harbor" Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A jury began deliberating on Tuesday on whether Chevron Corp (CVX.N) is liable for a death and injuries among Nigerians in a clash that ended their three-day occupation of an offshore oil platform a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trial, closely watched because it raises so many tough issues that face resource-rich countries and multinational companies, was brought by one of the occupiers, Larry Bowoto, who was injured by gunfire in the clash with Nigerian forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs argued Chevron was liable for damages because it paid, fed and housed the troops flown in by helicopter to end the May 1998 occupation and that the U.S. oil company was negligent in calling them while negotiations were ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They don't want to be held accountable now but you, through our system of justice, get to hold them accountable," lawyer Dan Stormer told the jury in his closing argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron lawyer Bob Mittelstaedt insisted a company had a duty to protect its workers, but denied Chevron was liable for the actions of forces in a military operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hostage takers don't have any right to determine how long they hold hostages before the police are called," Mittelstaedt said in his closing remarks, adding that negotiations stalled because of a "ransom" demanded by the occupiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The decision was based on their concern about the safety of the workers," he told the federal court in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addressing the payments question, Mittelstaedt said because government forces were the only security option in an unstable part of Nigeria, it was normal for oil companies to pay them extra to guard property and also provide them food and housing given the remote locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He argued California-based Chevron officials who had said in 1998 that the company did not pay them were unaware of the practice. Stormer countered by pointing to court testimony of the payments by Chevron Nigeria Ltd being approved by Chevron Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the platform's occupation by about 100 Nigerian villagers, Chevron said it received threatening letters from a group demanding jobs for their people and compensation for pollution of their water by the oil industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workers on the platform, which is nine miles off the West African coast, testified that the protesters were drinking alcohol and threatening them. Mittelstaedt presented a photograph to the jury to prove they had access to knives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hostage-taking and ransom demands are a regular hazard for oil companies working in the Niger Delta, where impoverished villagers complain they see no benefit from the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only on Tuesday, Nigerian security forces said gunmen seeking to protect a trade in stolen crude had attacked military positions in the delta for the third time in a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parabe accounted for a fifth of Chevron's Nigerian daily crude oil output of 400,000 barrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bowoto case was brought against San Ramon, California-based Chevron under the Alien Tort Claims Act, which dates back to 1789 and allows foreigners to sue over human rights abuses committed in their countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) faces a similar trial in New York early next year on charges of human rights violations and racketeering in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A landmark decision a decade ago found another California oil company, Unocal Corp, could be sued in a U.S. court for its alleged role in human rights abuses in Myanmar.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Nov 25 (Reuters) - A jury began deliberating
on Tuesday on whether Chevron Corp (CVX.N) is liable for a
death and injuries among Nigerians in a clash that ended their
three-day occupation of an offshore oil platform a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The trial, closely watched because it raises so many tough
issues that face resource-rich countries and multinational
companies, was brought by one of the occupiers, Larry Bowoto,
who was injured by gunfire in the clash with Nigerian forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plaintiffs argued Chevron was liable for damages because it
paid, fed and housed the troops flown in by helicopter to end
the May 1998 occupation and that the U.S. oil company was
negligent in calling them while negotiations were ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They don't want to be held accountable now but you,
through our system of justice, get to hold them accountable,"
lawyer Dan Stormer told the jury in his closing argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron lawyer Bob Mittelstaedt insisted a company had a
duty to protect its workers, but denied Chevron was liable for
the actions of forces in a military operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Hostage takers don't have any right to determine how long
they hold hostages before the police are called," Mittelstaedt
said in his closing remarks, adding that negotiations stalled
because of a "ransom" demanded by the occupiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The decision was based on their concern about the safety
of the workers," he told the federal court in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Addressing the payments question, Mittelstaedt said because
government forces were the only security option in an unstable
part of Nigeria, it was normal for oil companies to pay them
extra to guard property and also provide them food and housing
given the remote locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He argued California-based Chevron officials who had said
in 1998 that the company did not pay them were unaware of the
practice. Stormer countered by pointing to court testimony of
the payments by Chevron Nigeria Ltd being approved by Chevron
Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prior to the platform's occupation by about 100 Nigerian
villagers, Chevron said it received threatening letters from a
group demanding jobs for their people and compensation for
pollution of their water by the oil industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Workers on the platform, which is nine miles (15 km) off
the West African coast, testified that the protesters were
drinking alcohol and threatening them. Mittelstaedt presented a
photograph to the jury to prove they had access to knives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hostage-taking and ransom demands are a regular hazard for
oil companies working in the Niger Delta, where impoverished
villagers complain they see no benefit from the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only on Tuesday, Nigerian security forces said gunmen
seeking to protect a trade in stolen crude had attacked
military positions in the delta for the third time in a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Parabe accounted for a fifth of Chevron's Nigerian daily
crude oil output of 400,000 barrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Bowoto case was brought against San Ramon,
California-based Chevron under the Alien Tort Claims Act, which
dates back to 1789 and allows foreigners to sue over human
rights abuses committed in their countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) faces a similar trial in New
York early next year on charges of human rights violations and
racketeering in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A landmark decision a decade ago found another California
oil company, Unocal Corp, could be sued in a U.S. court for its
alleged role in human rights abuses in Myanmar. Unocal settled
in 2005, just weeks before agreeing to be bought by Chevron.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted SELZENTRY&#8482; (maraviroc)
full (traditional) approval for use in treatment-experienced adults with
CCR5-tropic HIV-1 in combination with other antiretrovirals. SELZENTRY was
originally granted accelerated conditional approval in August 2007 based on
24-week data from pivotal Phase 3 studies. SELZENTRY now becomes the latest
fully approved treatment for HIV. 

&#8220;New, effective and well-tolerated treatment options are critical for
treatment-experienced persons living with HIV infection,&#8221; said W. David Hardy,
MD, Chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
and Associate Professor of Medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine,
University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). &#8220;Selzentry, the first oral entry
inhibitor, has proven to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for
treatment-experienced patients whose HIV has become resistant to other
treatments, but remains susceptible to this new class of medications.&#8221; 

The full approval of SELZENTRY is based on 48-week data from the MOTIVATE
(Maraviroc Plus Optimized Therapy in Viremic Antiretrovial Treatment Experienced
Patients) studies. The studies compared the safety and effectiveness of
SELZENTRY plus optimized background therapy to placebo plus optimized background
therapy in treatment-experienced CCR5-tropic HIV-1 patients. 

Accelerated conditional approval is granted to medicines that provide a
meaningful therapeutic advantage over existing treatments for serious or
life-threatening diseases. FDA grants full approval status once it is satisfied
with longer-term safety and efficacy data. Once full approval is granted,
restrictions on promotion and/or distribution that apply to conditionally
approved medicines are removed. 

&#8220;SELZENTRY has been on a long journey, from its initial discovery by Pfizer
scientists in 2000 to this full FDA approval,&#8221; said Dr. Howard Mayer, Pfizer&#8217;s
executive director, and development team leader for HIV/AIDS. &#8220;We are extremely
excited with this important milestone in SELZENTRY&#8217;s lifecycle and the potential
improvement it may bring to treatment-experienced people living with HIV/AIDS.&#8221; 

Results at Week 48 from the MOTIVATE studies were recently published in the
October 2, 2008 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine. 

About SELZENTRY

SELZENTRY is part of a new class of drugs called CCR5 antagonists, providing a
new approach to HIV treatment. A diagnostic test confirms whether a patient is
infected with CCR5-tropic HIV-1, which is also known as &#8220;R5 virus&#8221;. SELZENTRY
blocks viral entry into CD4 T-cells that express the CCR5 co-receptor, stopping
the R5 virus on the outside surface of the cells before it enters, rather than
fighting the virus inside the cell, as do all other classes of oral HIV
medicines. 

Data Supporting SELZENTRY Full Approval

The full approval is based on 48-week data which showed that a greater log
reduction in viral load from baseline was seen in patients receiving SELZENTRY
plus optimized background therapy, compared to those patients receiving placebo
plus optimized background therapy (MOTIVATE 1 and 2 pooled data = &#8211;1.68 log10
copies and &#8211;1.84 log10 copies/mL for SELZENTRY once-daily and twice-daily,
respectively, compared with &#8211;0.79 log10 copies/mL for placebo). 

More than twice as many patients receiving SELZENTRY plus optimized background
therapy over 48-weeks achieved undetectable viral loads (&lt;50 copies/mL HIV RNA)
compared with those receiving placebo plus optimized background therapy in
treatment-experienced CCR5-tropic HIV-1-infected patients (MOTIVATE 1 and 2
pooled data = 43 percent and 46 percent for SELZENTRY once-daily and
twice-daily, respectively, compared with 17 percent for placebo). 

Patients treated with SELZENTRY plus optimized background therapy achieved a
significantly higher increase in CD4 cells than those receiving placebo plus
optimized background therapy (MOTIVATE 1 and 2 pooled data = +116 and +124
cells/mm3 for SELZENTRY once-daily and twice-daily, respectively, vs. +61
cells/mm3 for placebo). 

Results analyzed at 48-weeks showed no clinically relevant differences in the
safety profile between the study treatment groups and remained consistent with
24-week results. The most common adverse events included upper respiratory tract
infections, cough, pyrexia, rash, and dizziness. 

About Pfizer

company taking new approaches to better health. We discover, develop,
manufacture and deliver quality, safe and effective prescription medicines to

health system support. At Pfizer, more than 80,000 colleagues&#160;in more than 90
countries work every day to help people stay happier and healthier longer and to
reduce the human and economic burden of disease worldwide. 

Indication

SELZENTRY, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, is indicated for
treatment-experienced adult patients infected with only CCR5-tropic HIV-1, who
have evidence of viral replication and HIV-1 strains resistant to multiple
antiretroviral agents. 

This indication is based on analyses of plasma HIV-1 RNA levels in two
controlled studies of SELZENTRY of 48 weeks duration. Both studies were
conducted in clinically advanced, 3-class antiretroviral (NRTI, NNRTI, PI, or
enfuvirtide) treatment-experienced adults with evidence of HIV-1 replication
despite ongoing antiretroviral therapy. 

The following points should be considered when initiating therapy with
SELZENTRY: (1) tropism testing is required for the appropriate use of SELZENTRY;
(2) use of SELZENTRY is not recommended in patients with dual/mixed or
CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 as efficacy was not demonstrated in a Phase 2 study of this
patient group; and (3) the safety and efficacy of SELZENTRY have not been
established in treatment-naive adult patients or pediatric patients. 

For more information on the approved U.S. label, including a boxed warning,
please see full prescribing information available at www.SELZENTRY.com.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nov 25 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse slashed its earnings
estimates on banking heavyweight JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N),
citing deterioration of credit quality across all asset
classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the company is expected to outperform its peers,
driven by strength and stability in its senior management team,
a strong balance sheet and competitive positioning, analyst
Susan Katzke said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan is expected to earn 7 cents a share in the current
quarter, compared with her earlier estimate of 48 cents a
share, weighed down by higher loan losses, additional reserves
for loans gone sour, and incremental mark-downs in its legacy
leveraged loans and commercial real estate, Katzke said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She also slashed her 2009 earnings estimate for the company
by 14 percent to $3 a share to reflect the cost of higher
consumer and corporate loan losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, which bought Seattle-based thrift Washington
Mutual's banking units in September, is highly exposed to
consumer credit. Brokerages, including Fox-Pitt and Citigroup,
have voiced concerns in the past few weeks about the bank's
heavy exposure to all areas of consumer credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan has not had huge write-downs on risky classes of
mortgage-related assets that other banks have reported because
it has limited exposure to such securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in recent calls with investors and analysts, Jamie
Dimon, the bank's chief executive, has been warning about
possible losses from exposure to consumer debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Katzke, who rates the stock of the company
"outperform", said sustained share price outperformance relies
on improving visibility of positive sequential earnings per
share comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We consider JPMorgan to be a core holding among financial
services stocks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She however, cut her price target on the stock to a range
of $45-$50 from $55 to reflect the estimate changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company closed up 8 percent at $29.77 Tuesday
on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;PORTLAND, Maine--(Business Wire)--
With the National Retail Federation projecting a 5.5 percent decrease in sales
this holiday season over last year and concerns about the economy continuing, it
is clear that consumers are looking for ways to enjoy the holidays without
breaking the bank. Still the survey also found that almost 55 percent of people
say that the gift card is the gift they want this holiday season. 

TD Banknorth offers holiday shoppers the TD Banknorth Visa&#174; Gift Card, the only
free Visa gift card that is gift-boxed and ready to give. The holiday-themed TD
Banknorth Gift Card comes with a free, elegant gift box, greeting card and
ribbon, and best of all, no purchase fee. 

Unlike TD Banknorth, other banks charge a fee &#8211; anywhere from $3.95 to $11.95 &#8211;
for each gift card purchased. Even comparable mall-issued gift cards can carry a
$1.50 purchase fee and additional charges for customer service calls.
Additionally, TD Banknorth does not charge replacement fees or customer service
fees, which many mall gift cards charge. 

TD Banknorth is one of a few banks offering new and existing customers the
convenience of an instantly-available, complete packaged gift. And, unlike gift
cards available from specific merchants, the TD Banknorth Gift Card is accepted
at millions of locations worldwide and enables recipients to buy what they want,
when they want, wherever Visa debit cards are accepted. 

Customers of the bank can purchase Gift Cards at any TD Banknorth location.
Customers choose the monetary amount for the Gift Card, which can be any
whole-dollar amount between $25 and $500. And since the card value is loaded
during the transaction, the Gift Card is instantly ready to give and ready to
use. 

Whether the Gift Card is used to purchase a luxury or a necessity, it's the
universal gift that is always the right size and color, in style, in demand and
appreciated. Recipients can register their Gift Card with TD Banknorth to check
the card's balance and ensure the card can be replaced if lost or stolen. 

Customers of TD Bank can also purchase a Visa Gift Card at any TD Bank location.

(This is an updated/corrected version of the previous release.) 

Fitch Ratings has assigned 'AAA/F1+' ratings to debt issued by JPMorgan Chase &amp;
Co. (JPM) through the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP).
Outstanding obligations under the TLGP bear the full faith and credit of the

U.S. Dollar or foreign currency. 

The TLGP gives JPMC additional funding flexibility to raise cash for general

as well as JPMC's large deposit base. 

Fitch assigns the following ratings to FDIC's TLGP debt issued by JPMC:

&lt;p&gt;  OSLO, NORWAY, Nov 25 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Norwegian oil and gas giant StatoilHydro has signed a long-term
agreement for IBM (NYSE: IBM) to implement a solution expected to bring
significant savings through an intelligent and more efficient process for
the management of turnaround projects.

    A turnaround or shutdown of an oil field typically takes between 10 000
and 80 000 man-hours. Up to now, all repairs and shutdowns have been
planned based solely on information regarding the maintenance record of
equipment and assets. The new IBM and StatoilHydro system for planning
and assisting shutdowns will make it easier for StatoilHydro to detect
execution problems and take action to reduce the duration and production
loss of each shutdown.

    With IBM's knowledge management tool, StatoilHydro will be able to manage
planned shutdowns up to a year in advance, preventing additional losses
and increased expenses. Planning and preparation for a shutdown begins 14
months ahead of scheduled maintenance. StatoilHydro can now evaluate
potential areas for improvement well in advance against a standardised set
of key performance indicators.

    Following several successful pilots, the solution is to be implemented at
around 35 offshore installations.

    "Much of the production losses on the Norwegian continental shelf come
from shutdowns. We believe this intelligent solution developed in
partnership with IBM is vital to implementing more effective work
processes, will help save costs and substantially boost production," says
Tom Anders Thorstensen Project Manager at StatoilHydro.

    StatoilHydro R together with IBM global industry experts and the IBM
Norwegian Centre of Excellence for Oil and Gas in Stavanger, Norway,
developed the shutdown solution. Running on IBM WebSphere, the Software
Oriented Architecture (SOA) enabled system is based on open standards and
may be offered to other industries in the future.

    "StatoilHydro has run pilots of the solution which have been successful.
The tests confirm significant savings potential in standardising the
processes connected to planning and assisting shutdowns. We are looking
forward to seeing the results when we implement the solution into our
turnaround processes, and expect to see some improvements already with
some of the turnarounds scheduled for next year," says Frode Garmanslund,
Vice President for Turnaround Management &amp; Planning, StatoilHydro.

    "IBM works closely with companies like StatoilHydro, bringing together
business processes and technology enabling faster exploration, increased
oil recovery and better data sharing," says Kaare Finbak, Project Manager
for IBM Norway. "Smart systems like this one have the potential to enhance
efficiencies in other industries globally, enabling the extraction of
relevant information quickly in order to support crucial decision making."

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Citigroup, quotes, new sales)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Walden Siew&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 25 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) boosted
its bond sale under a new government lending program on
Tuesday, a promising first attempt at thawing frozen credit
markets that may unleash $600 billion in new debt sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's inaugural $5 billion sale is the first test as
U.S. banks line up to sell bonds guaranteed by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. after sluggish investment-grade and
junk bond sales in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plan comes as banks face significant capital
constraints, high borrowing costs and massive amounts of debt
that are maturing and need to be rolled over next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup (C.N), JPMorgan (JPM.N) , Morgan Stanley (MS.N)
and Bank of America (BAC.N) also are preparing sales in what
may be the start of a flood of new sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's debt sale, which carry top ratings by all three
ratings firms, was nearly double initial talk of between $2
billion to $3 billion after decent demand, as the debt is
guaranteed under the FDIC's so-called Temporary Liquidity
Guarantee Program. Investors are watching the deal as an
indicator of demand for bonds under the new program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The offering by Goldman Sachs is extremely well received,"
said David Dietze, chief investment officer of Point View
Financial Services in Summit, New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The beauty of it is that the cost to issue this debt is
much less than their cost to issue it naked, as it were,
without the FDIC backing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's debt priced at 200 basis points, tighter than
original price talk of 220 basis points over U.S. Treasuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dietze said the debt is more attractive to investors than
agency debt such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac because of the
explicit government guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FDIC's program, approved on Friday, follows a similar
British plan put in place in October to help fill a financing
gap for banks shut out of the corporate bond market due to
tight credit conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It all goes back to restoring confidence in the system,"
said Jason Polun, a banking analyst at mutual fund T. Rowe
Price. "People always talk about frozen markets. Well, this
will help bring liquidity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "SECURITY"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase said on Tuesday it planned to sell
three-year debt, denominated in euros and in sterling and both
in benchmark size, which typically means $500 million or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lending program is "a key step in getting these
companies to resume lending to consumers and businesses and
allow them to rebuild capital," Dietze said. "Clearly people
want security and these bonds offer security."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup's sale may price next week, according to a source
familiar with the deal. Morgan Stanley also announced a
guaranteed debt issue on Tuesday, while Bank of America plans a
similar sale that may price next week, according to IFR, a
Thomson Reuters publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Barclays Capital analyst said the new FDIC program may
result in as much as $600 billion in total debt sales. The
market could see about $50 billion in issuance per month until
the deadline for debt issuance next June, or about $400 billion
of new sales, Bank of America estimated in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Through 2009, about $900 billion of maturing debt in the
United States and Europe are putting the squeeze on companies
that need to borrow at a high cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investment-grade bonds, for example, recently traded at
double-digit yields, while high-yield bond are now trading at
more than 22 percent, a sign of what investors are demanding to
take on the risk of holding those securities. For more details,

&lt;p&gt;  JACKSON, MI and ARMONK, NY, Nov 25 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) has signed a service agreement with Consumers Energy, a
Michigan electric and natural gas utility, to help plan, deploy and test
an Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) and smart grid field pilot
network.

    The field pilot is expected to help Consumers Energy evaluate several AMI
technologies needed for full deployment and will confirm vendor
capabilities. The project plan calls for testing the AMI network's ability
to support minimum smart grid functions, collect interval energy usage
data for demand response analysis and capture operational metrics for full
deployment planning. The project also is designed to emphasize AMI field
pilot aspects and include the smart grid as a secondary objective.

    "We selected IBM because of its widespread experience in supporting other
utilities with developing their AMI/smart grid programs and pilot
deployments," said Maureen Trumble, Consumers Energy's AMI program
director. "With the expertise and support of the IBM team, we plan to
develop field pilot operating procedures, testing approaches and testing
scripts."

    Consumers Energy's AMI technology, systems and deployment pilot, which
includes meter and telecommunications installations, is scheduled to begin
in 2009. The plan for the pilot project includes hardware,
telecommunications, operations and back-office system software solutions
from numerous vendors.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 25 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
American Electric Power (AEP) (NYSE: AEP) has selected IBM (NYSE: IBM) as
the overall systems integrator for gridSMART(SM), AEP's comprehensive
suite of customer programs and advanced technology initiatives that
create the energy delivery system of the future.

    The gridSMART initiative includes customer programs, new energy delivery
system technologies, local generation and storage devices, and additional
efficiency enhancements.

    The agreement will add IBM's broad capabilities in designing and
implementing Intelligent Utility Networks to AEP's initiative.

    IBM will provide AEP with support services across the program, including
program management, business process design, systems planning, and system
interfaces. The agreement also leverages IBM's unique capabilities in
research, software and IT infrastructure, enabling AEP to take advantage
of IBM's global investments in developing Intelligent Utility Network
solutions.

    AEP's gridSMART initiative is among the first in the industry to introduce
intelligence across the entire transmission and distribution system. Among
the benefits expected for customers are: fewer outages, improved service
and reliability, and the ability to better manage their energy use.
Benefits for AEP include: planning and operating its system more
efficiently, increased service quality, proactive outage notification
capabilities, and enabling future technology advancements as they develop.

    IBM joins an AEP gridSMART team that will implement advanced customer
service, energy delivery and metering technologies across the nation's
largest electricity transmission system, and a distribution system that
delivers electricity to more than 5 million customers in 11 states.

    "IBM's commitment to the development of a smarter electricity grid aligns
with the activities we already have underway," said Michael G. Morris,
AEP's chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Combining our own
expertise on utility operations with IBM's expertise and experience in
systems integration will bring the implementation of systems that best
meet our customers' needs."

    Initially, the gridSMART initiative will focus on four projects:


--  A pilot of advanced metering, distribution grid management, and energy
efficiency technologies in South Bend, Ind., that as already begun.
--  Establishment of up to three model city demonstrations of approximately
100,000 customers each, where AEP can validate and refine its gridSMART
vision.
--  Completion of a five-year Application Portfolio Roadmap that will
outline how technology will transform AEP's future electricity distribution
business.
--  Mobilization of several innovative customer service and energy
conservation initiatives, including new online energy management tools.


    
"AEP's wide-ranging initiative is one of the world's best examples of
how an Intelligent Utility Network can fundamentally transform the way
power is distributed and used," says Guido Bartels, IBM's General
Manager, Global Energy &amp; Utilities Industries. "We also see it as a
further demonstration of IBM's continued efforts to bring innovative
solutions to the global challenges in energy and the environment."

    Future phases of gridSMART will take AEP further towards the Intelligent
Utility Network introducing additional enhancements to the network,
including installation of smart meters for all AEP customers by 2015;
development of fuel cells, large-scale batteries and other distributed
energy technologies; and support for emerging electric hybrid vehicles.

United States, delivering electricity to more than 5 million customers in
11 states. AEP ranks among the nation's largest generators of electricity,

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 25 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) boosted a
planned bond sale on Tuesday under a new government lending
program in what may be a promising first crack to loosen frozen
credit markets and unleash $600 billion in new debt sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman was the first test as U.S. banks line up to sell
debt guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. after
investment-grade and junk bond sales slowed in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plan comes as banks face significant capital
constraints, high borrowing costs and massive amounts of debt
that are maturing and need to be rolled over next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs sold $5 billion of new bonds on Tuesday,
while JPMorgan (JPM.N) , Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Bank of
America (BAC.N) are preparing sales in what may be the start of
a flood of new sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's debt sale was nearly double initial talk of
between $2 billion to $3 billion after decent demand, as the
debt is guaranteed under the FDIC's so-called Temporary
Liquidity Guarantee Program. Investors are watching the deal as
an indicator of demand for bonds under the new program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The offering by Goldman Sachs is extremely well received,"
said David Dietze, chief investment officer of Point View
Financial Services in Summit, New Jersey. "The beauty of it is
that the cost to issue this debt is much less than their cost
to issue it naked as it were without the FDIC backing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's debt priced at 200 basis points, tighter than
original price talk of 220 basis points over Treasuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dietze said the debt is more attractive to investors than
agency debt such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac because of the
explicit government guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FDIC's program, approved on Friday, follows a similar
British plan put in place in October to help fill a financing
gap for banks shut out of the corporate bond market due to
tight credit conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barclays was the first bank to tap that program with a 3
billion euro sale on Oct. 22. The offer was priced at midswaps
plus 25 basis points, a similar range to agency debt, and
attracted more than 4 billion euros of orders from investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "SECURITY"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase said on Tuesday it planned to sell
three-year debt, denominated in euros and in sterling and both
in benchmark size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lending program is "a key step in getting these
companies to resume lending to consumers and businesses and
allow them to rebuild capital," Dietze said. "Clearly people
want security and these bonds offer security, and you have the
premium over Treasuries."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan is managing the "AAA" rated deal itself, an
official at the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley also announced a guaranteed debt issue on
Tuesday, while Bank of America plans a similar sale that may
price next week, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters
publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Barclays Capital analyst said the new FDIC program may
result in $400 billion to $600 billion in total debt sales. The
market could see about $50 billion in issuance per month until
the deadline for debt issuance next June, or about $400 billion
of new sales, Bank of America estimated in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Through 2009, about $900 billion of maturing debt in the
United States and Europe are putting the squeeze on companies
that need to borrow at a high cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investment-grade bonds, for example, recently traded at
double-digit yields, while high-yield bond are now trading at
more than 22 percent, a sign of what investors are demanding to
take on the risk of holding those securities. For more details,
click [ID:nN21490786]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FDIC approved the program to guarantee to banks' new
senior unsecured debt, potentially allowing the firms to issue
debt with top "AAA" ratings.

&lt;p&gt;Black Canyon Dehydration FacilityAwarded for Second Time
KEMMERER, Wyo.--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation&#8217;s (NYSE:XOM) Black Canyon Dehydration Facility has
received the Wildlife Habitat Council&#8217;s (WHC) certification for efforts to
conserve and restore natural ecosystems in and around company operations. This
was one of four ExxonMobil sites awarded including others in Texas, New Jersey
and Montana and marks the second time the site has received this prestigious
honor. 

When WHC was formed in 1988, the founders conceived a new and innovative concept
of bringing together conservation and business. This was the first cooperative
effort between the environmental community and industry. 

The Black Canyon Dehydration Facility was one of 214 sites recognized at the
2008 Symposium for creating a Wildlife at WorkSM program. The certification
program recognizes outstanding wildlife habitat management and environmental
education efforts at corporate sites, and offers third-party validation of the
benefits of such programs. Certification requirements are strict and require
that sites apply for periodic renewal. 

&#8220;Exxon Mobil Corporation is dedicated to preserving wildlife and ecosystems
around the globe including here in Kemmerer,&#8221; said ExxonMobil's Rockies
Operations Superintendent Monte K. Olson. &#8220;We accept this year&#8217;s positive
recognition from the Wildlife Habitat Council for these facilities and hope to
see other sites continually recognized for their dedication to the environment
as well." 

"Our facilities&#8217; wildlife areas are something we take pride in and often share
with visitors for them to enjoy and experience,&#8221; he added. 

&#8220;This year, our 20th Anniversary, WHC celebrates two decades of solid leadership
and on-the-ground achievements by our members in wildlife habitat preservation
and conservation education,&#8221; said Robert Johnson, WHC president. &#8220;WHC members
are continuing to lead the way to further define and demonstrate how
corporations can use their lands to preserve our biodiversity, while preparing
new generations through conservation education to understand how to be better
leaders and managers for tomorrow&#8217;s sustainable businesses and communities.
Congratulations to ExxonMobil for their volunteer-based efforts to preserve the
biodiversity of their community and the world, and to connect people to nature.&#8221;


The most significant effort on ExxonMobil&#8217;s Kemmerer location is a joint effort
with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department to create the Sawmill Creek Trout Pond
to provide a habitat for natural spawning. Today, employees at the site are
making efforts to further enhance the creek to meet recent changes in water
sources.

&lt;p&gt;New Jersey Research Site Awarded for Third Time
ANNANDALE, N.J.--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation&#8217;s (NYSE:XOM) Clinton Research Facility has received the
Wildlife Habitat Council&#8217;s (WHC) certification for efforts to conserve and
restore natural ecosystems in and around company operations. This was one of
four ExxonMobil sites awarded including others in Texas, Montana and Wyoming and
marks the third time the site has received this prestigious honor. 

When WHC was formed in 1988, the founders conceived a new and innovative concept
of bringing together conservation and business. This was the first cooperative
effort between the environmental community and industry. 

The Clinton Research Facility was one of 214 sites recognized at the 2008
Symposium for creating a Wildlife at WorkSM program. In addition, 97 Corporate
Lands for LearningSM programs reach thousands of learners from schools and scout
groups to master gardeners and university researchers. The certification program
recognizes outstanding wildlife habitat management and environmental education
efforts at corporate sites, and offers third-party validation of the benefits of
such programs. Certification requirements are strict and require that sites
apply for periodic renewal. 

&#8220;Exxon Mobil Corporation is dedicated to preserving wildlife and ecosystems
around the globe and that includes here in Clinton, New Jersey,&#8221; said Emil
Jacobs, vice president of Research and Development for ExxonMobil. &#8220;We accept
this year&#8217;s positive recognition from the Wildlife Habitat Council for the work
we have done to improve wildlife habitat at the Clinton facility. We are proud
of our work and often share it with visitors for them to enjoy and experience.&#8221; 

&#8220;This year, our 20th Anniversary, WHC celebrates two decades of solid leadership
and on-the-ground achievements by our members in wildlife habitat preservation
and conservation education,&#8221; said Robert Johnson, WHC president. &#8220;WHC members
are continuing to lead the way to further define and demonstrate how
corporations can use their lands to preserve our biodiversity, while preparing
new generations through conservation education to understand how to be better
leaders and managers for tomorrow&#8217;s sustainable businesses and communities.
Congratulations to ExxonMobil for their volunteer-based efforts to preserve the
biodiversity of their community and the world, and to connect people to nature.&#8221;


The Clinton Research Facility in New Jersey recently was certified as a
&#8220;Corporate Lands for Learning Site.&#8221; Located in rural New Jersey, two-thirds of
the 750-acre site is available for wildlife habitat projects. Site activities
include bluebird boxes, native bird habitats and environmental education
activities with the local community. 

Each year, the site&#8217;s wildlife team hosts a workshop on Take Your Child to Work
Day designed to teach children about the biological diversity and habitat niches
found on the site and foster general environmental awareness about the region.
Employees assist local elementary and middle schools with field-based ecology
lessons, curriculum enhancements, and tours of the site grounds and
laboratories. 

Additionally, the site hosts high school students as part of ExxonMobil&#8217;s Green
Team Summer Jobs program where participants work to improve trail systems and
learn about the environment.

&lt;p&gt;Irving, Montana, New Jersey and Wyoming Sites Awarded
IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Four Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) facilities have received the Wildlife
Habitat Council&#8217;s (WHC) certification for efforts to conserve and restore
natural ecosystems in and around company operations. The company&#8217;s headquarters
in Irving, Texas, the Billings Refinery in Billings, Montana, the Clinton
Research Facility in Clinton Township, New Jersey, and the Black Canyon
Dehydration Facility in Kemmerer, Wyoming, received the prestigious awards. 

When WHC was formed in 1988, the founders conceived a new and innovative concept
of bringing together conservation and business. This was the first cooperative
effort between the environmental community and industry.

&#8220;Exxon Mobil Corporation is dedicated to preserving wildlife and ecosystems
around the globe while taking on the world&#8217;s toughest energy challenges,&#8221;
ExxonMobil Corporate Environmental Manager Rick Mire said. &#8220;We accept this
year&#8217;s positive recognition from the Wildlife Habitat Council for these four
facilities and hope to see other sites continually recognized for their
dedication to the environment as well. Our facilities&#8217; wildlife areas are
something we take pride in and often share with visitors for them to enjoy and
experience.&#8221; 

&#8220;This year, our 20th Anniversary, WHC celebrates two decades of solid leadership

biodiversity of their community and the world, and to connect people to nature.&#8221;


Certified by WHC since 2003, the company&#8217;s Irving headquarters provides
significant opportunity for local wildlife to flourish on 245 acres. Enhancement
programs began in 1996 with an Eastern Bluebird habitat. The site recently
installed 15 new bluebird nest boxes and protected them against colonization by
fire ants. Today, wildlife teams maintain an on-site stream, Hackberry Creek.
Employees regularly sponsor cleanups of the area to safely remove garbage
without disturbing natural habitat, while also featuring nature walks and
activities for the ExxonMobil Green Team and other outdoor programs. 

The Billings Refinery site is located on 720 acres abutting the Yellowstone
River and other large habitat areas. In addition to building nesting platforms
for ospreys, employees and their families also constructed 30 American Kestrel
nest boxes and monitor them on a regular basis. The American Kestrel, often
known as the &#8220;Sparrow Hawk,&#8221; is the smallest North American falcon. The site&#8217;s
wildlife team is currently replanting a former quarry area and partners with
area Boy Scout troops and school classes on other environmental activities. 

The Clinton Research Facility in New Jersey recently was certified as a
&#8220;Corporate Lands for Learning Site.&#8221; Located in rural New Jersey, two-thirds of
the 750-acre site is available for wildlife habitat projects. Site activities
include bluebird boxes, native bird habitats and environmental education
activities with the local community. 

The most significant effort on ExxonMobil&#8217;s Kemmerer location is a joint effort
with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department to create the Sawmill Creek Trout Pond
to provide a habitat for natural spawning. Today, employees at the site are
making efforts to further enhance the creek to meet recent changes in water
sources.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 25 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
In this era of globalization and economic change, organizations are
facing growing pressures to use software as a competitive differentiator.
To help companies address this challenge, IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced
new offerings designed to lower software costs by helping business
leaders and IT professionals more effectively collaborate. As a result,
these businesses can now deliver high-quality software at a quicker pace,
while meeting the evolving needs of the business. Using IBM's new Rational
Quality Management Portfolio, key decision makers, such as CIOs, lawyers
and financial consultants, now have a voice in the software delivery
process.

    Today, businesses must meet a wide array of quality assurance standards
before ever releasing a product to the public. When the software that runs
these products fails to meet business needs or doesn't perform as expected
-- a business lets down its customers, stakeholders, business partners,
employees and ultimately their brand -- directly affecting their bottom
line.

    For example, if a medical company is forced to recall a large amount of
defibrillator devices due to defects in the software, they are wasting
valuable time, money and resources that could have been saved by ensuring
the software met stringent quality standards prior to delivering it to the
marketplace.

    According to the Standish Group, businesses lose over $300B* annually in
software-related downtimes. Furthermore, 41 percent of IT projects fail to
deliver the expected business value and return on investment (ROI).**

    IBM Offers HP Business Partners a Comprehensive Quality Management Suite

    Unlike HP, which offers business partners simple, siloed tools geared
strictly towards testing professionals, the IBM Rational Quality
Management Portfolio ensures the entire workforce has a stake in
delivering high quality software -- from the CIO to the developer, tester
or project manager. As part of this initiative, IBM is releasing several
products built on the Jazz platform, an extensive partner program and
services to migrate customers from HP to IBM.

    Companies are increasingly recognizing the value of IBM's software
strategy and portfolio and are quickly signing up to reap the benefits of
IBM's partner program. In fact, over 300 partners are reselling IBM
Quality Management products, an increase of over 200% since last year.

    For instance, TietoEnator, a European systems integrator, is partnering
with IBM to help customers manage and run their business better.

    "With increased integration and greater version control capabilities, it
is clear that Rational is offering one of the most highly comprehensive
quality management portfolios in the marketplace," said Peer Eland,
Principal &amp; Team Leader, Test and QA Services, TietoEnator. "By providing
IBM Rational Quality Manager built on the open Jazz platform, IBM offers
IT organizations a wider variety of options to choose from when
implementing quality management needs."

    Additionally, several companies are embracing IBM's Jazz-based offerings
through the Ready for IBM Rational software integrations that expand
Rational's quality management software beyond the competition. IBM
Business Partners such as WebLayers, Surgient, VMLogix, CM-Logic, Device
Anywhere and Sogeti are already taking advantage of IBM's open platform
and plan to deliver new product integrations to market.

    Current HP customers and business partners who are looking to migrate to a
complete portfolio can take advantage of IBM's 25% discount on its quality
management software. This promotion, which can save clients more than US
$5,000 in software license charges, is available for a limited time. For
more information, please visit:
http://www-01.ibm.com/software/rational/migratetoibm/hp.

    New Software Helps Customers Improve Workforce Collaboration, Embrace Web
2.0

    At the core of IBM's Rational Quality Management Portfolio is IBM Rational
Quality Manager, a new, collaborative "hub" designed to unify IT
professionals with key business stakeholders within an organization. IBM
Rational Quality Manager ensures it is no longer the sole responsibility
of the software developer to find bugs and deliver a high quality product
to market. By ensuring all relevant members of the workforce are in-sync
and have access to data in real-time, a company can more easily make
informed decisions, better assign and utilize their resources, and react
quickly to changes in the marketplace at a lower cost. Based on IBM's
open, Jazz technology platform, Rational Quality Manager is able to
provide this collaboration by using a Web-based centralized test
management environment. IBM's open, Jazz technology platform helps
Rational Quality Manager users collaborate in a Web-based centralized
test management environment.

    With a dynamic, Web 2.0 interface, Rational Quality Manager is helping
employees within an organization collaborate across business roles and
beyond geographic boundaries. For example, a CIO can use Rational Quality
Manager's dashboard to monitor the aspects of the software delivery
process that are contributing to the development of a product. As a
result of being informed in real-time, the CIO can make immediate
decisions that are in line with the needs of the business, and deliver a
high quality product to the marketplace on time and ahead of the
competition.

    For instance, if a consumer electronics company has a target date for
launching a new device, but just prior to the release they discover the
software that runs it is bug-ridden, they lose valuable money and
competitive edge by having to delay product sales. With the help of
Rational Quality Manager, decision makers could have been alerted earlier
on that there were potential hindrances, and they could have ensured IT
professionals fixed those defects immediately, reducing delays and lost
revenue.

    Also being introduced today, IBM Rational Test Lab Manager is a Web-based
quality solution that helps companies reduce cost and increase energy
savings by automating the testing process and ensuring an organization is
using its lab resources effectively and efficiently. Up until this point,
lab testing was treated as a manual task. In fact, organizations spend
nearly 40% of their time configuring machines to make them ready for
testing.*** By using Rational Test Lab Manager, an organization can save
time and energy by automating these processes and reducing the amount of
hardware used. As a result, customers will now have the ability to
reprioritize these resources to other areas of their business.

    In related news, IBM is launching several other new releases of products
within its Quality Management Portfolio including: IBM Rational
Application Performance Analyzer, IBM Rational Functional Tester, IBM
Rational Quality Manager Express, IBM Rational Performance Tester, IBM
Rational Service Tester for SOA Quality, IBM Rational Test RealTime, IBM
Rational AppScan Tester Edition, IBM Rational RequisitePro, IBM Rational
Measured Capability Improvement Framework Assessments, Telelogic Rhapsody
TestConductor, and IBM Rational Requirements Composer, which is expected
later this year.

    "These new offerings provide invaluable capabilities to help customers
significantly lower costs and risks in a way that no other competitor in
the industry can," said Dr. Daniel Sabbah, general manager, IBM Rational
Software. "Based on an open and highly adaptable, web-based
infrastructure, organizations can now continuously improve the results of
their software investments by automating quality assurance throughout the
application delivery process, and by improving collaboration across all
relevant stakeholders within their organization."

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 25 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) plans to
sell $5 billion of new bonds on Tuesday, the first test case of
new debt guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The debt sale, boosted from initial talk of $2 billion to
$3 billion, is guaranteed under the FDIC's so-called Temporary
Liquidity Guarantee Program, and investors are watching the
deal as an indicator of demand for bonds under the new
program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The debt is expected to price at 220 basis points over
Treasuries later on Tuesday, a market source familiar with the
sale said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman is expected to be the first firm to tap the FDIC's
program that was put in place to help fill a financing gap for
banks shut out of the corporate bond market, due to high
borrowing costs and tight credit conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investment-grade bonds, for example, recently traded at
double-digit yields, while high-yield bond traded at more than
20 percent, a sign of what investors are demanding to take on
the risk of holding those securities. For more details, click

&lt;p&gt;Nov 25 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities widened its 2009
loss estimates for General Motors Corp (GM.N) on lower
international earnings and likely higher interest costs from
government debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan forecasts a loss of $25.25 a share for the
automaker for 2009, compared with its prior loss view of $22

government-dictated product plans," analyst Himanshu Patel said
in a note, adding that the U.S. government's "focus on forcing

&lt;p&gt;  MARKHAM, ONTARIO AND WINNIPEG, MANITOBA, Nov 25
(MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and the Province of Manitoba have successfully tested a
new system which makes it possible to digitally trace the journey food
takes before it ends up in consumers' shopping carts. Through the
project, Manitoba has taken the first step in implementing a provincial
traceability program.

    The project tracked data about product movement, animal history and
characteristics, processing history and transportation data throughout
the complete value chain.

    IBM provided business consulting and project management services, working
with the Province of Manitoba and more than 16 supply chain partners,
including beef and pork producers, animal feed ingredient producers, feed
manufacturers, farmers, processing plants, truckers and a retail grocery
chain.

    The wide scope of the Manitoba project was essential. The average dinner
has been through a complex supply chain by the time it reaches a
consumer's table. Dozens of companies are involved in the production of
just a single rib eye steak. Consumer product recalls - from spinach and
chocolate to peanut butter - illustrate the importance of access to
timely information, when needed, at any point along the supply chain, for
safety and quality assurance reasons.

    Using Global Traceability Network (GTNet) software from IBM business
partner TraceTracker, Manitoba's project demonstrated it is possible to
securely and accurately gather and crunch data about a piece of meat from
a variety of sources and share that information, at any step in the
process. As a web platform, the GTNet allows trading partners to exchange
critical product information so they can communicate key messages to
customers and consumers.

    "As the agricultural industry continues to grow in Manitoba, so does the
need for a traceability system that keeps track of all products from farm
to fork," said Manitoba Agriculture, Food and Rural Initiatives Minister
Rosann Wowchuk. "Now that the proof of concept has been completed, we can
look at implementing a traceability program that will help to assure the
quality and safety of all consumer goods and also ensure that consumers -
locally and across the country - feel confident in the products they
consume."

    Ultimately, the system also can be used to provide messaging that will
help re-establish and reinforce consumers' confidence in the food
products they're buying. In fact, IBM surveyed more than 1,600 consumers
in 2007 and found nearly 70 per cent expressed a low overall level of
trust in the claims 'branded food products' make about their
environmental impact and health benefits. Almost half of consumers were
concerned about safety, and nearly two out of every five said they buy
different brands today because of these concerns.

    "Traceability that can safeguard the food supply and address compliance
and supply chain efficiencies and product differentiation has huge
implications for both consumers and food producers alike," says Susan
Wilkinson, IBM Global Business Services traceability solutions executive
and contributing author of the IBM Institute for Business Value study
"Establishing Trust Through Traceability". "This successful test presents
all participants with a number of avenues for innovation. One example is
an organic food producer could offer consumers the equivalent of a
'digital product passport' to validate the authenticity of their
statement the product is produced naturally."

    The completed project has provided Manitoba with a hands-on experience in
food traceability and a better understanding of the complex value chain
involved in delivering safe food to consumers.

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - No.1 computer services provider IBM Corp said India remains one of its fastest growing markets and it expects to maintain double-digit revenue growth in the region despite growing domestic competition, a company official said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are looking at maintaining the double-digit (revenue) growth we are continuing to see on an average basis," Sandip Patel, managing partner of IBM's global business services in India and South Asia, said at the Reuters India Investment Summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armonk, New York-headquartered IBM's revenue from India, where it has been present since 1992, grew 43 percent to about $1 billion in 2007. But growth has been slowing in the past few quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue grew 43 percent in the first quarter of the 2008 financial year, then slowed to 36 percent in the second quarter and about 24 percent in the third quarter ended September 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growth potential offered by India, Asia's third-largest economy, has led to increased competition from Indian IT companies, Patel said at the summit, held at the Reuters office in Bangalore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India's export-driven software services firms like Infosys Technologies and Satyam Computer Services are also vying for a bigger piece of the domestic market, as demand from their key U.S. and European markets slows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The pure play firms are starting to selectively look at clients in India and grow in the domestic business," said Patel, who has been working with IBM for the past 18 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But pricing pressure is no worse than what it has always been, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM India recently struck a deal with a company in the steel sector and said it was consciously exploring contracts in small- and medium-sized businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We just went live with one of our clients and we will be announcing that (the deal) pretty soon," Patel said but declined to give specific details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM India's deal pipeline was fairly consistent and that it had not seen any decline in contracts, Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides IBM, global majors such as Accenture, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard Co and Microsoft are also in the fray in the fast growing emerging markets as the U.S. giants face a decline in demand at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support growth, IBM India continues to hire and has not seen a slowdown in attrition despite talk that the global crisis has led to job security fears and reduced job-hopping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, IBM has been growing its ranks by about 38 percent in India for the last two calendar years. IBM ended 2007 with a headcount of about 73,000 employees, making it IBM's second-largest operation after the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Amitha Rajan and Purwa Naveen Raman; Editing by Pratish Narayanan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Aug 13 (Reuters) - Tribune Co reported a quarterly loss and a 6 percent drop in revenue on Wednesday as newspaper advertising revenue fell, while Chief Executive and billionaire real estate magnate Sam Zell said he remains optimistic about the company's future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The privately held publisher reported a loss of $3.8 billion from continuing operations, which included a writedown on the company's newspaper assets. The loss was due to a $3.8 billion writedown, most of which was for newspapers it acquired in 2000 when it bought Times Mirror, publisher of the Los Angeles Times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In last year's second quarter, Tribune reported income from continuing operations of $35 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Revenue fell 6 percent to $1.1 billion. Publishing advertising revenue fell 15 percent, and classified ad revenue fell 26 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Robert MacMillan; editing by John Wallace) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((robert.macmillan@thomsonreuters.com; +1 415 677 3939; Reuters Messaging: robert.macmillan.reuters.com@reuters.net))  Click here to see Reuters MediaFile blog &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Multimedia versions of Reuters Top News are now available for:  * 3000 Xtra: visit topnews.session.rservices.com      * BridgeStation: view story .134                              For more information on Top News: topnews.reuters.com)) Keywords: TRIBUNE/RESULTS  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2008.

&lt;p&gt;QUITO (Reuters) - An environmental expert told a court in Ecuador that oil company Chevron Corp should pay $27 billion in compensation for environmental damage in the country, the company said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron said in a statement that it rejected geologist Richard Cabrera's revised damage estimate by saying his work "contains fabricated and erroneous evidence." In April, Cabrera recommended to the court that the U.S. oil company should pay up to $16 billion in damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, which peasants and Indians in Ecuador brought in the early 1990s, contends that Texaco, which Chevron bought in 2001, polluted the jungle and damaged their health by dumping 18 billion gallons (68 billion liters) of contaminated water from 1972 to 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron questioned Cabrera's independence and charges the plaintiffs of helping him produce his damage assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cabrera's work was monitored, supported, and conducted by the plaintiffs. They paid more than $200,000 to fund his 'independent' findings," Chevron said in the statement. "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of plaintiffs' attorneys Steven Donziger denied helping Cabrera produce the report and said Chevron is trying to undermine the expert's findings to reject any eventual negative court ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The party that asks for the technical work has to pay for it. Chevron partially payed for Cabrera's work in a previous part of the case," Donziger told Reuters. "We had to fund his (Cabrera) budget because we were the only ones asking for the overall assessment. Chevron is again trying to undermine the court."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has argued that it was released from any liability because it paid $40 million for an environmental cleanup in the 1990s, and blames state oil company Petroecuador for much of the pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiff said they expect a final ruling on the case in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alonso Soto; Editing By Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - They did the tango, the samba and the quickstep, and when the music stopped Brooke Burke and Derek Hough won U.S. television contest "Dancing With the Stars," waltzing away with the coveted mirror ball trophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their victory on Tuesday night capped a stunning season for Burke, the 37-year-old former host of E! television show "Wild On," and her professional dancing partner Hough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair came in first place in eight episodes of the show and topped the season of one of U.S. TV's most popular shows with a perfect score of 30 on the final night and 88 points out of 90 for their last three dances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dancing a Viennese waltz, Burke and Hough beat former 'NSync singer Lance Bass, 29, and his dancing pro Lacey Schwimmer, as well as one-time professional football player Warren Sapp, 35, and his partner Kym Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unbelievable," was all that Burke could utter upon finally winning the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hough, who suffered from a sore back in a season filled with injuries to other competitors, also seemed overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The journey's been so long. It's been tough. It's been wonderful. It's been everything I could ever hope for," Hough said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sapp, who finished No. 2, had become an audience favorite for his showmanship, but his lack of skilled footwork hurt his chances with the show's judges. He and Johnson did the hustle in their last dance on Tuesday and earned a total 80 out of 90 in the final round of dances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finishing third was Bass who struggled early in the season but improved throughout. He had gained momentum going into Tuesday's finale by becoming the only contestant to beat Burke. But a final jitterbug earned Bass a total 81 of 90 for the last three dances and was not enough to top Burke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winners are decided by a combination of judges' scores and audience voting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dancing with the Stars," on the ABC broadcast network, is among the most popular U.S. TV shows and while ratings slipped slightly in its seventh season, the program still drew around 20 million viewers a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with the dancing, Tuesday's finale was filled with appearances from singers Alicia Keys and Miley Cyrus and former contestants such as 82 year-old Cloris Leachman, who delighted audiences this season with her sense of humor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other former contestants who danced in the finale included actor Cody Linley, daytime TV star Susan Lucci and comedian Jeffrey Ross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABC is a unit of The Walt Disney Co..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bob Tourtellotte, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith)&lt;/p&gt;

Despite Oppenheimer's reiteration of General Electric Company (NYSE: GE) at

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings downgrades and assigns Distressed Recovery (DR) ratings and Rating
Outlooks to the following classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage
Securities Corp., Series 2005-CIBC12 as follows: 

--$24.4 million class G to 'BBB-' from 'BBB'; Outlook Stable; 

--$29.8 million class H to 'BB' from 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable; 

--$8.1 million class J to 'BB-' from 'BB+'; Outlook Stable;

--$8.1 million class N to 'CC/DR4' from 'B-'; 

--$5.4 million class P to 'C/DR6' from 'CCC/DR1'; 

--$50 million class UHP to 'B-' from 'BB'; Outlook Stable. 

In addition, Fitch affirms the following classes: 

--$152.4 million class A-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$163.6 million class A-3A1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$122.9 million class A-3A2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$200 million class A-3B at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$649.3 million class A-4 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$137.4 million class A-SB at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$216.7 million class A-M at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$162.5 million class A-J at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest only class X-1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest only class X-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$43.3 million class B at 'AA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$19 million class C at 'AA-'; Outlook Stable; 

--$32.5 million class D at 'A'; Outlook Stable; 

--$27.1 million class E at 'A-'; Outlook Stable; 

--$24.4 million class F at 'BBB+'; Outlook Stable. 

The $27.1 million class NR is not rated by Fitch. Class A-1 has paid in full. 

The downgrades and assignments of the DR ratings reflect the increased loss
expectations on the specially serviced loans since Fitch's last rating action.
The Rating Outlooks reflect the likely direction of any rating changes over the
next one to two years. 

The downgrade of class UHP is due to a sustainable increase in ground rent
expense for the Universal Hotel Portfolio (4.7%). The Universal Hotel Portfolio
consists of three hotels in Orlando, FL, with a total of 2,400 keys. The $100
million A-note is pooled and held in the trust. The $50 million B-note,
non-pooled but in the trust, collateralizes class UHP. Expenses at the
properties have increased substantially since issuance, mainly driven by an
increase in ground rent. Operating performance at the properties is in line with
issuance. The trailing twelve month combined occupancy for the hotels as of
September 2008 was 78.1%, compared to 81.9% at issuance. Average daily rate and
revenue per available room for the same period were $228 and $178 compared to
issuance at $208 and $171, respectively. 

As of the November 2008 distribution date, the transaction has paid down 4.1% to
$2.1 billion from $2.2 billion at issuance. Four loans, 2.9% of the pool, have
defeased. 

Currently, Fitch has identified 20 Loans of Concern (7.3%), including three
specially serviced assets (1.5%). Ten additional loans (4.2%) have been
identified as Loans of Concern since Fitch's last rating action. 

The largest specially serviced loan (0.7%) is secured by a 34,938 square foot
(sf) retail property in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. The asset has been real
estate owned (REO) since August 2008. The property suffered from a deteriorating
retail environment stemming from a reduction in vacation travel. The most recent
appraisal value indicates significant losses upon disposition. 

The second largest specially serviced loan is collateralized by an 89,080 sf
suburban office building in New London, CT (0.4%) that transferred in February
2007. Current occupancy at the property is 60% and the loan is 90+ days
delinquent. The servicer is working to stabilize the asset and is pursuing a
judicial foreclosure. 

The third specially serviced loan (0.4%) is an REO office property located in
Buffalo, NY, that transferred in September 2007 due to monetary default. Losses
are expected on all three assets. 

Two loans, 4250 North Fairfax Drive (2.2%) and 450 Roxbury Drive (1.2%) maintain
investment grade shadow-ratings. Watertower Place at Celebration has paid in
full. Fitch no longer considers Universal Hotel Portfolio to have
characteristics consistent with an investment grade shadow rating due to the
sustainable increase in expenses since issuance. 

The largest shadow rated loan, 4250 North Fairfax Drive, is an office property
located in Arlington, VA, that reported first quarter 2008 occupancy of 100%, up
from issuance occupancy of 98.6% and an increase in NOI of 26% since issuance.
The second loan, 450 Roxbury Drive, is a medical office property in Los Angeles,
CA. Occupancy as of YE 2007 was 100%, an increase from the issuance occupancy of
88.4%. 

None of the non-defeased loans in the pool are scheduled to mature in 2008 or
2009 and 10 non-defeased loans (8.1%) are scheduled to mature in 2010.

methodologies are available from this site, at all times. Fitch's code of

--$44.2 million class D at 'A'; Outlook Stable; 

--$34 million class E at 'A-'; Outlook Stable. 

Fitch does not rate the $37.1 million class NR. 

The downgrades are due to the transfer of a new loan (0.4%) to special servicing
since Fitch's last review and an increase in the projected losses on the six
other specially serviced loans (1.9%). Projected losses would be fully absorbed
by the non-rated class NR; however, the losses would significantly impact the
credit enhancement to classes F through P. 

As of the November 2008 distribution date, the transaction has paid down by 3.0%
to $2.64 billion from $2.72 billion at issuance. Classes H through M have been
assigned Negative Outlooks based on an assumption of defaults and losses on the
Fitch loans of concern. The Rating Outlooks reflect the likely direction of any
rating changes over the next one to two years. 

In total, 25 loans are considered Fitch loans of concern (18.9%) due to
declining performance, including the seven specially serviced loans. 

Three of the specially serviced loans (1.3%), including the largest (0.7%), are
all secured by student-oriented multifamily properties located in Tallahassee,
Florida. All of the loans have the same sponsor. The collateral consists of
eight different properties with a total of 1,106 units. The properties have
suffered from declines in occupancy and are all currently real estate owned
(REO). Losses are expected. 

The second largest specially serviced loan (0.4%) is secured by a 40,000 square
foot (sf) retail property in Brooklyn, New York. The property's sole tenant is
Linens N' Things. The loan transferred to special servicing on Oct. 27, 2008 as
a result of the Linens N' Things bankruptcy filing. The servicer is currently
exploring workout options. 

The largest loan of concern, The DRA - CRT Office Portfolio (6.9%), is the
largest loan in the transaction. It is secured by sixteen office buildings with
a total of 1.48 million sf. The buildings are located within four different
office parks in four different states. The loan has exhibited diminished
performance since issuance. The loan's debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and
occupancy at issuance were 1.49 times (x) and 95.6%. As of year-end (YE) 2007,
the servicer-reported DSCR had fallen to 0.98x and occupancy was 84.7%. The
decline in DSCR and occupancy are both due to turnover of tenants. The loan
matures on Oct. 1, 2010 and there are no extension options. Fitch will continue
to monitor the loan. 

The transaction has minimal near-term maturity risk as none of the loans mature
in 2008 or 2009. Eleven loans, 14.9% of the pool, mature in 2010. The weighted
average coupon for the entire pool is 5.38% and the range is 4.87% to 6.29%.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has assigned 'AAA/F1+' ratings to the senior debt issued by
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (Goldman Sachs) under the revised FDIC Temporary
Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP). An estimated $35 billion of Goldman Sachs'
debt is eligible for issuance under the guarantee. Senior debt issued under the
TLGP that matures before June 30, 2012 will receive the AAA/F1+ rating. Senior
debt not under TLGP or maturing after June 30, 2012 will be assigned ratings
consistent with Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs). Goldman Sachs' long-term IDR is
currently rated 'AA-' by Fitch. 

The TLGP represents one of the key programs put forth by the US government to
help restore stability to credit markets and funding for the domestic banking
industry. The final rule approved Nov. 21, 2008 reflects key enhancements and
revisions made to the program. These debt obligations carry the full faith and
credit of the US government. The guarantee is expected to provide an effective
mechanism to provide timely and full repayment in the event of non-payment on
the part of the original issuing entity. 

Fitch has assigned the following ratings to FDIC's TLGP debt issued by Goldman
Sachs: 

--Long-term FDIC guaranteed debt 'AAA'; 

--Short-term FDIC guaranteed debt 'F1+'. 

Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on
the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com. Published ratings, criteria and
methodologies are available from this site, at all times. Fitch's code of
conduct, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, affiliate firewall, compliance

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Nov 26 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said Tuesday morning
flaring at its 260,000-barrel-per-day Los Angeles-area refinery in El
Segundo, California, had no material impact on production at the refinery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The flaring was due to a 40-minute malfunction of refinery equipment,
Chevron spokesman Rod Spackman said in the statement issued Tuesday
evening.

&lt;p&gt;Report Cites Toxic Dumping, Burma Pipeline, and Drug Bribery Scandal Make
Chevron Stand Out for All the Wrong Reasons
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
Chevron has been named one of the top ten worst corporations in the world for
its refusal to take responsibility for dumping billions of gallons of toxic
waste into the Amazon and its close relationship to the brutal Burmese military
regime, among other human rights and corporate governance problems. 

Multinational Monitor magazine, published in the nation&#8217;s capital, has featured
&#8220;The Top Ten Worst Corporations&#8221; annually since 1992. According to Richard
Weissman, the editor of Multinational Monitor, to get on the list, a company
must excel at &#8220;corporate crime, negligence and dastardly behavior.&#8221; 

The dishonor comes at a sensitive time for Chevron, which is spending tens of
millions of dollars on a national advertising campaign to tout a &#8220;green&#8221; image
that is increasingly at odds with the company&#8217;s on-the-ground practices. The
company is also on trial in federal court in San Francisco for paying Nigerian
soldiers who killed two local protestors who had occupied a Chevron oil
platform. 

Citing Chevron as a big &#8220;winner&#8221; on the notorious list, Weissman noted the oil
giant&#8217;s failure to deal with legacy issues created by its purchase in 2001 of
Texaco (which created the environmental catastrophe in Ecuador) and purchase in
2005 of Unocal (which was a shareholder in the pipeline project in Burma). In
reference to Texaco and Unocal, Weissman wrote: 

&#8220;[Chevron] was happy to absorb their revenue streams. It has been less willing
to take responsibility for ecological and human rights abuses perpetrated by
these companies.&#8221; 

Noting Chevron&#8217;s close relationship with the repressive military regime in
Burma, the report blasted the company for sitting &#8220;idly by&#8221; while the Burmese
army &#8220;violently suppressed&#8221; political protests led by Buddhist monks. Chevron
runs a natural gas pipeline in that country that generates $1 billion annually
for the clique of ruling generals. 

The report also highlighted Chevron&#8217;s &#8220;culture of ethical failure &#8230; and
substance abuse and promiscuity&#8221; unveiled in a recent Department of Interior
report. Chevron employees were found to have given cocaine and sex to federal
workers for a greater share of royalties generated by oil and gas drilling in
Alaska. 

Chevron faces a lawsuit in Ecuador over what experts call the &#8220;Amazon
Chernobyl.&#8221; Texaco is accused of dumping billions of gallons of toxic waste into
Amazon waterways when it operated an oil concession from 1964 to 1990,
decimating six indigenous groups and causing an outbreak of cancer and
miscarriages. 

Tens of thousands of rainforest dwellers initially filed suit against the
company in 1993 in the US, but the case shifted to Ecuador after Texaco praised
Ecuador&#8217;s court system as better able to handle the dispute. Now that the
evidence is in and Chevron faces a $16.3 billion adverse judgment, the company&#8217;s
lawyers now argue that the courts in Ecuador suddenly have become unfair. 

The report wrote: &#8220;Having argued vociferously that Ecuadorian courts were fair
and impartial, Chevron is now unhappy with how the litigation has proceeded in
that country. So unhappy, in fact, that it is lobbying the Office of the U.S.
Trade Representative to impose trade sanctions on Ecuador if the Ecuadorian
government does not make the case go away.&#8221; 

The report also noted a comment by an unnamed Chevron lobbyist to Newsweek who,
in reference to the Ecuador lawsuit, said: &#8220;We can&#8217;t let little countries screw
around with big companies like this &#8211; companies that have made big investments
around the world.&#8221; 

Although not mentioned in the report, Chevron is now facing added criticism for
hiring William J. Haynes as deputy general counsel. As the chief lawyer at the
Pentagon under Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Haynes singed off on water
boarding and other harsh interrogation techniques and is now the subject of a
possible prosecution in Germany as an international war criminal. 

Haynes was hired by Charles James, Chevron&#8217;s General Counsel and also a former
Bush Administration official. James is considered the architect of Chevron&#8217;s
legal response to its disastrous human rights problems.

environment and secure social justice through organizing, advocacy, and

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
It's been a rough morning for J.P. Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM). First, Credit
Suisse slashed its price target on the shares from $55 to $47.50, but still
reiterated its rating of "outperform." Then, Oppenheimer's Meredith Whitney cuts
her full-year 2008 earnings target for JPM from $1.61 per share to $1.28 per
share. As a result, the shares of JPM are down more than 2% this morning, adding
to their year-to-date loss of more than 31%.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN, Ireland--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/ec7b53/game_console_vendo) has
announced the addition of the "Game Console Vendors to PayTV Operators: You've
Been Served!" report to their offering. 

This report predicts that console-affiliated media portals such as Microsoft's
Xbox LIVE and Sony's PlayStation Network will soon become formidable competitors
to incumbent PayTV services. Leveraging broadband-enabled game consoles as
Over-the-Top video platforms &#8211; thus bypassing cable and satellite TV operators &#8211;
these companies will offer a compelling alternative to traditional TV
programming by providing a more immersive, interactive video experience. 

"Today's launch of Microsoft's Experience and the Xbox LIVE Netflix streaming
video service is a perfect example of how potent these services will soon
become," notes Michael Greeson, president and co-author of this new report.
"There is little doubt these services are finally ready for primetime." 

This report points to several facts which portend of how powerful these
offerings will be: 

- Even before today's launch of Experience, Microsoft's Xbox LIVE had amassed
some 15,000 movies (1,000 of which are HD) and some 13,000 TV shows for
download-to-own. Xbox LIVE was the first online video portal to offer HD
downloads for TV viewing - The Netflix partnership adds 12,000 movies and TV
programs to the mix, all for free streaming to Netflix subscribers. This enables
Xbox 360 users to access on-demand movies and TV shows within the Xbox
Experience social environment with a click of their remote. - Sony's PlayStation
Network has collected close to 1,000 movies and hundreds of TV programs for
download-to-own. As well, it has announced plans to expand dramatically its
video library in the next few months in order to compete with Xbox LIVE. -
Sony's CEO Howard Stringer noted, "Sony's unique position in electronics and
entertainment will enable us to provide specialized offerings for Sony customers
directly to their televisions outside conventional distributors and without the
need for any set-top box." - Even Nintendo, staunchly dedicated to pure gaming
experiences, is working with Fujisoft to introduce 'Everybody's Theater Channel'
to Japanese Wii users in December 2008. 

Console Vendors and OTT Video Delivery &#8211; Let the Games Begin!, this latest
analysis of the Over-the-Top video space, discusses the evolution of
console-affiliated media portals within the context of each vendor's strategic
imperatives; offers a comparative analysis of current and likely portal video
offerings; provides updated global forecasts for broadband-capable and
broadband-enabled game consoles through 2012; and forecasts consumer demand for
this category of Over-the-Top video services. 

Welcome to the age of quantum media, a time in which established media
production, aggregation, distribution, and consumption is undergoing rapid
disaggregation; a time in which the established media value chain seems to be
coming apart at the seams. 

In the quantum age, cable and satellite operators are no longer the only game in
town. Their longstanding lock on the home is set to be contested as a new wave
of competitors emerge, many using the open Internet to bypass incumbent PayTV
control points and deliver video programming directly to consumers. TDG long ago
coined this as 'Over-the-Top' or 'OTT' video delivery, and of the various
platforms capable of enabling OTT video, today's game consoles are among the
most potent. These devices are uniquely positioned to lead the OTT charge: they
are currently used by more than 90 million households worldwide; they are
video-friendly, easily connected to the Internet, connected to the living room
TV, and favored by younger consumers with little loyalty to a broadcast network
or their local cable company. 

This report focuses on the emergence and impact of OTT broadband video via
broadband-enabled game consoles and console-affiliated media portals, in
particular Microsoft's Xbox 360/LIVE/Experience, Sony's PS3/PlayStation
Network/Home, and Nintendo's Wii/Wii Channels. Using each company's strategic
position as a backdrop, this report offers a comparative analysis of current and
likely portal video offerings; provides updated global forecasts for
broadband-capable and broadband-enabled game consoles thru 2012; and forecasts
consumer demand for this category of Over-the-Top video services. It is truly a
unique report, going well beyond simply "counting the consoles" by revealing the
new measure of success for console vendors: Internet attach rates and media
sell-thru (specifically video).

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Nov 26 (Reuters) - Arsenal's new chief executive,
Ivan Gazidis, may have worked in U.S. soccer for the past 14
years but he grew up on the English game and will not try to
make a "Disneyfied version" of the north London club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "This is an Englishman who grew up with the game, who has a
deep understanding of Arsenal football club," Gazidis, who lived
in England from the age of four, told the Premier League side's
TV station after his appointment was announced on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's essential if Arsenal is going to be successful that
its traditions be respected. This is not going to be an American
coming with no understanding of Arsenal looking to make it into
a Disneyfied version of Arsenal Football Club."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazidis, who said Arsenal's self-sustaining business model
was key to the club's future, will be heavily involved on the
financial side of any transfer dealings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although born in South Africa, Gazidis grew up in England
and studied law at Oxford University. He was twice given an
Oxford award ("Blue") for playing against Cambridge University
at Wembley Stadium in 1984 and 1985.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For six years, he worked in London as a lawyer, living a few
hundred yards from Arsenal's old stadium Highbury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TRANSFER DEALINGS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 1994 he moved to the United States to help build the
brand new Major League Soccer (MLS), which was developed after
the 1994 World Cup in the U.S. and in which England midfielder
David Beckham now plays for the LA Galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazidis, 44, has worked there ever since, rising to his
current position as MLS deputy commissioner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is expected to get heavily involved in transfers, having
been responsible for all signings in the past 13 years in the
MLS, where players are contracted centrally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chairman Peter Hill-Wood told Arsenal TV "a man with
football experience is very important. He (Gazidis) certainly
fills that gap very well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hill-Wood added that the new CEO, who starts his new job in
January, "will get on very well with (manager) Arsene (Wenger)
and will handle all the financial side, technical side of player
signing".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazidis said he had "tremendous times" in the MLS but was
glad to leave it growing and attracting new revenue streams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This was not a question of being unhappy with where I was,
it was a question of receiving an offer that was too exciting,
too good to turn down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The great thing about Arsenal, and one of the things that
really makes it unique, is it has been run to sustain itself.
It's not dependent on an outside investor to continue to pump
money in year after year," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Ken Ferris)

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - No.1 computer services provider IBM Corp (IBM.N) said India remains one of its fastest growing markets and it expects to maintain double-digit revenue growth in the region despite growing domestic competition, a company official said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are looking at maintaining the double-digit (revenue) growth we are continuing to see on an average basis," Sandip Patel, managing partner of IBM's global business services in India and South Asia, said at the Reuters India Investment Summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armonk, New York-headquartered IBM's revenue from India, where it has been present since 1992, grew 43 percent to about $1 billion in 2007. But growth has been slowing in the past few quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue grew 43 percent in the first quarter of the 2008 financial year, then slowed to 36 percent in the second quarter and about 24 percent in the third quarter ended September 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growth potential offered by India, Asia's third-largest economy, has led to increased competition from Indian IT companies, Patel said at the summit, held at the Reuters office in Bangalore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India's export-driven software services firms like Infosys Technologies (INFY.BO) and Satyam Computer Services SATY.BO are also vying for a bigger piece of the domestic market, as demand from their key U.S. and European markets slows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The pure play firms are starting to selectively look at clients in India and grow in the domestic business," said Patel, who has been working with IBM for the past 18 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But pricing pressure is no worse than what it has always been, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM India recently struck a deal with a company in the steel sector and said it was consciously exploring contracts in small- and medium-sized businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We just went live with one of our clients and we will be announcing that (the deal) pretty soon," Patel said but declined to give specific details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM India's deal pipeline was fairly consistent and that it had not seen any decline in contracts, Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides IBM, global majors such as Accenture (ACN.N), Sun Microsystems JAVA.O, Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) are also in the fray in the fast growing emerging markets as the U.S. giants face a decline in demand at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support growth, IBM India continues to hire and has not seen a slowdown in attrition despite talk that the global crisis has led to job security fears and reduced job-hopping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, IBM has been growing its ranks by about 38 percent in India for the last two calendar years. IBM ended 2007 with a headcount of about 73,000 employees, making it IBM's second-largest operation after the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Amitha Rajan and Purwa Naveen Raman; Editing by Pratish Narayanan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Nov 26 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities cut its price
target on five Nordic banks, including Nordea Bank (NDA.ST),
and lowered its 2009 and 2010 earnings forecast for the sector
by 13 percent.

 "The cuts relate mainly to lower loan growth across the
board as the recession starts to bite, lower liability margins
on the back of sharper falls in interest rates and higher loan
losses, mainly in the corporate division," analyst Nana
Francois wrote in a note.

 Capital position remains tight for the banks, the analyst
said, adding that the biggest capital deficits lie in SEB
(SEBa.ST) and DNB Nor DNBNOR.OL.

 Francois, who upgraded Danske Bank (DANSKE.CO) to "neutral"
from "underweight," on valuation, said SEB was the least
preferred stock, while Nordea remained the better option with
an absence of concentrated risks.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Nov 25 (Reuters Life) - They did the tango,
the samba and the quickstep, and when the music stopped Brooke
Burke and Derek Hough won U.S. television contest "Dancing With
the Stars," waltzing away with the coveted mirror ball trophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Their victory on Tuesday night capped a stunning season for
Burke, the 37-year-old former host of E! television show "Wild
On," and her professional dancing partner Hough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pair came in first place in eight episodes of the show
and topped the season of one of U.S. TV's most popular shows
with a perfect score of 30 on the final night and 88 points out
of 90 for their last three dances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dancing a Viennese waltz, Burke and Hough beat former
'NSync singer Lance Bass, 29, and his dancing pro Lacey
Schwimmer, as well as one-time professional football player
Warren Sapp, 35, and his partner Kym Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Unbelievable," was all that Burke could utter upon finally
winning the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hough, who suffered from a sore back in a season filled
with injuries to other competitors, also seemed overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The journey's been so long. It's been tough. It's been
wonderful. It's been everything I could ever hope for," Hough
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sapp, who finished No. 2, had become an audience favorite
for his showmanship, but his lack of skilled footwork hurt his
chances with the show's judges. He and Johnson did the hustle
in their last dance on Tuesday and earned a total 80 out of 90
in the final round of dances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finishing third was Bass who struggled early in the season
but improved throughout. He had gained momentum going into
Tuesday's finale by becoming the only contestant to beat Burke.
But a final jitterbug earned Bass a total 81 of 90 for the last
three dances and was not enough to top Burke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Winners are decided by a combination of judges' scores and
audience voting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Dancing with the Stars," on the ABC broadcast network, is
among the most popular U.S. TV shows and while ratings slipped
slightly in its seventh season, the program still drew around
20 million viewers a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Along with the dancing, Tuesday's finale was filled with
appearances from singers Alicia Keys and Miley Cyrus and former
contestants such as 82 year-old Cloris Leachman, who delighted
audiences this season with her sense of humor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other former contestants who danced in the finale included
actor Cody Linley, daytime TV star Susan Lucci and comedian
Jeffrey Ross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ABC is a unit of The Walt Disney Co. (DIS.N).

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted SELZENTRY&#8482; (maraviroc)
full (traditional) approval for use in treatment-experienced adults with
CCR5-tropic HIV-1 in combination with other antiretrovirals. SELZENTRY was
originally granted accelerated conditional approval in August 2007 based on
24-week data from pivotal Phase 3 studies. SELZENTRY now becomes the latest
fully approved treatment for HIV. 

&#8220;New, effective and well-tolerated treatment options are critical for
treatment-experienced persons living with HIV infection,&#8221; said W. David Hardy,
MD, Chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
and Associate Professor of Medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine,
University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). &#8220;Selzentry, the first oral entry
inhibitor, has proven to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for
treatment-experienced patients whose HIV has become resistant to other
treatments, but remains susceptible to this new class of medications.&#8221; 

The full approval of SELZENTRY is based on 48-week data from the MOTIVATE
(Maraviroc Plus Optimized Therapy in Viremic Antiretrovial Treatment Experienced
Patients) studies. The studies compared the safety and effectiveness of
SELZENTRY plus optimized background therapy to placebo plus optimized background
therapy in treatment-experienced CCR5-tropic HIV-1 patients. 

Accelerated conditional approval is granted to medicines that provide a
meaningful therapeutic advantage over existing treatments for serious or
life-threatening diseases. FDA grants full approval status once it is satisfied
with longer-term safety and efficacy data. Once full approval is granted,
restrictions on promotion and/or distribution that apply to conditionally
approved medicines are removed. 

&#8220;SELZENTRY has been on a long journey, from its initial discovery by Pfizer
scientists in 2000 to this full FDA approval,&#8221; said Dr. Howard Mayer, Pfizer&#8217;s
executive director, and development team leader for HIV/AIDS. &#8220;We are extremely
excited with this important milestone in SELZENTRY&#8217;s lifecycle and the potential
improvement it may bring to treatment-experienced people living with HIV/AIDS.&#8221; 

Results at Week 48 from the MOTIVATE studies were recently published in the
October 2, 2008 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine. 

About SELZENTRY

SELZENTRY is part of a new class of drugs called CCR5 antagonists, providing a
new approach to HIV treatment. A diagnostic test confirms whether a patient is
infected with CCR5-tropic HIV-1, which is also known as &#8220;R5 virus&#8221;. SELZENTRY
blocks viral entry into CD4 T-cells that express the CCR5 co-receptor, stopping
the R5 virus on the outside surface of the cells before it enters, rather than
fighting the virus inside the cell, as do all other classes of oral HIV
medicines. 

Data Supporting SELZENTRY Full Approval

The full approval is based on 48-week data which showed that a greater log
reduction in viral load from baseline was seen in patients receiving SELZENTRY
plus optimized background therapy, compared to those patients receiving placebo
plus optimized background therapy (MOTIVATE 1 and 2 pooled data = &#8211;1.68 log10
copies and &#8211;1.84 log10 copies/mL for SELZENTRY once-daily and twice-daily,
respectively, compared with &#8211;0.79 log10 copies/mL for placebo). 

More than twice as many patients receiving SELZENTRY plus optimized background
therapy over 48-weeks achieved undetectable viral loads (&lt;50 copies/mL HIV RNA)
compared with those receiving placebo plus optimized background therapy in
treatment-experienced CCR5-tropic HIV-1-infected patients (MOTIVATE 1 and 2
pooled data = 43 percent and 46 percent for SELZENTRY once-daily and
twice-daily, respectively, compared with 17 percent for placebo). 

Patients treated with SELZENTRY plus optimized background therapy achieved a
significantly higher increase in CD4 cells than those receiving placebo plus
optimized background therapy (MOTIVATE 1 and 2 pooled data = +116 and +124
cells/mm3 for SELZENTRY once-daily and twice-daily, respectively, vs. +61
cells/mm3 for placebo). 

Results analyzed at 48-weeks showed no clinically relevant differences in the
safety profile between the study treatment groups and remained consistent with
24-week results. The most common adverse events included upper respiratory tract
infections, cough, pyrexia, rash, and dizziness.

Indication

SELZENTRY, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, is indicated for
treatment-experienced adult patients infected with only CCR5-tropic HIV-1, who
have evidence of viral replication and HIV-1 strains resistant to multiple
antiretroviral agents. 

This indication is based on analyses of plasma HIV-1 RNA levels in two
controlled studies of SELZENTRY of 48 weeks duration. Both studies were
conducted in clinically advanced, 3-class antiretroviral (NRTI, NNRTI, PI, or
enfuvirtide) treatment-experienced adults with evidence of HIV-1 replication
despite ongoing antiretroviral therapy. 

The following points should be considered when initiating therapy with
SELZENTRY: (1) tropism testing is required for the appropriate use of SELZENTRY;
(2) use of SELZENTRY is not recommended in patients with dual/mixed or
CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 as efficacy was not demonstrated in a Phase 2 study of this
patient group; and (3) the safety and efficacy of SELZENTRY have not been
established in treatment-naive adult patients or pediatric patients. 

For more information on the approved U.S. label, including a boxed warning,
please see full prescribing information available at www.SELZENTRY.com.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) has broken off talks
with Panasonic Corp (6752.T) for now on selling its stake in
Sanyo Electric 6764.T after the electronics maker made an
offer below Sanyo's current stock price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Panasonic, the world's largest maker of plasma TVs, said
this month that it wanted to buy smaller rival Sanyo but had
not set a price with Goldman and Sanyo's two other main
shareholders [nT305137]. The deal would boost Panasonic's
competitiveness in rechargeable batteries and solar power
equipment as demand grows rapidly for greener energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have reached the decision that there is no use in
carrying out negotiations based on the current offer," Goldman
Sachs spokeswoman Hiroko Matsumoto said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in a sign the talks may yet be revived, Matsumoto said
the next step was up to Panasonic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mizuho Investors Securities analyst Nobuo Kurahashi said
that Panasonic, which has $10 billion in cash and cash
equivalents in its pocket, was unlikely to give up on Sanyo
because of initial snags and that it may come up with a better
offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a rare opportunity for Panasonic to gain a new
growth driver," Kurahashi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "And cash is the strongest asset in the current business
environment. For Panasonic, the time must looks ripe to take
advantage of its cash pile."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sach's Matsumoto declined to disclose the details
of Panasonic's offer, but company and financial sources close
to the matter said it had offered 120 yen per Sanyo share,
valuing the company at $7.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Panasonic spokesman Akira Kadota declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Panasonic, formerly known as Matsushita Electric,
were down 2.7 percent at 1,360 yen on Wednesday afternoon,
underperforming the Tokyo stock market's electrical machinery
index .IELEC.T, which fell 1.4 percent. Sanyo was down 1.9
percent at 153 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To acquire Sanyo, Panasonic has to buy out its top three
shareholders, Daiwa Securities SMBC, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Co
and Goldman Sachs, which bailed out the company in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The three firms hold almost 430 million preferred shares in
Sanyo, each of which can be exchanged for 10 common shares. If
converted, they would hold a combined 70 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Restrictions on converting and selling the stock will be
lifted in March, giving the three major shareholders a possible
exit on their investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper said on Tuesday that
Panasonic was offering 120 yen a share because of an expected
dilution in Sanyo's per-share value after the conversion of
preferred shares, but Goldman aims to sell its stake for about
250 yen a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That price would put Sanyo's market capitalisation at 1.54
trillion yen ($16 billion) if the preferred shares were
converted, making it more than twice as valuable as its bigger
and more profitable rival, Sharp Corp (6753.T).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sanyo is the world's biggest maker of lithium-ion
batteries, which are widely used in mobile phones, laptop
computers and portable music players, and the seventh-largest
in solar cells behind Sharp, Germany's Q-Cells QCEG.DE and
others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Panasonic and Sanyo combined would be well-positioned to
benefit from a shift in the auto industry to hybrid and
electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sanyo supplies nickel metal hydride batteries to Ford Motor
Co (F.N) and Honda Motor Co Ltd (7267.T) and develops
lithium-ion batteries for cars with Volkswagen AG (VOWG.DE),
while Panasonic runs a car battery venture with Toyota Motor
Corp (7203.T).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among Sanyo's main shareholders, Daiwa Securities SMBC is a
joint venture between Daiwa Securities Group (8601.T) and
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG) (8316.T), while Sumitomo
Mitsui Banking Corp is Sanyo's main bank and part of SMFG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Kiyoshi Takenaka and Yumiko Nishitani;

&lt;p&gt;EADS PHENIX Program Brings New Approach to Global Product Development: 3D
Collaborative Design and Manufacturing Solutions PlayKey Role
V&#201;LIZY, France &amp; ARMONK, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
Regulatory News: 

IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Dassault Syst&#232;mes (DS) (Paris:DSY) (NASDAQ:DASTY), a world
leader in 3D and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solutions, today announced
EADS&#8217; commitment to IBM and Dassault Syst&#232;mes&#8217; product lifecycle management
(PLM), for 3D collaborative design and manufacturing applications and services.
EADS, a global leader in aerospace, defense and related services, is
streamlining product design and manufacturing processes through the use of
collaboration tools to make key product information more easily accessible to
suppliers and partners worldwide. 

Aerospace and defense companies face new global manufacturing challenges as they
extend their network of partners and suppliers around the globe. Original
equipment manufacturers (OEMs) like EADS are developing more sophisticated
products that rely on deeper integration between the mechanical, electrical and
software components of product development. For example, components of an
aircraft are made in different locations, making an OEM&#8217;s ability to share
reliable data and design plans with global suppliers key. 

To address these challenges, European Aeronautic Defence &amp; Space Co., or EADS,
launched a worldwide program named PHENIX, which stands for PLM Harmonization
ENhanced Integration and eXcellence. Partnering with IBM and Dassault Syst&#232;mes,
EADS&#8217; goal is to integrate Dassault Syst&#232;mes&#8217; tools such as product design
(CATIA), digital manufacturing (DELMIA) and collaborative solutions (ENOVIA-VPM)
into EADS&#8217; PLM processes as key enablers for excellence and harmonization. 

The IBM Dassault Syst&#232;mes applications are currently deployed across EADS, a
company known for its Airbus commercial aircraft, special mission and military
aircraft, satellite launchers and space services and platforms for missile
systems. These applications contribute strongly to support engineering and
manufacturing industrial processes from end-to-end. 

With its PLM platform, EADS is addressing key industry challenges by:

* Deploying a&#8216;3D Master Reference,&#8217; digital mock-up approach to help streamline
industrial product development programs by increasing collaboration across
multiple divisions and tapping into the collective knowledge of international
teams. 
* Turning complex 3D design and manufacturing processes into tested and
repeatable models to achieve optimal results in manufacturing through the
integration of 3D and simulation technologies. 
* Predicting product behaviors using virtual group validation and resolution
techniques that support speedy decision-making and help shrink product design
cycle times. 
* Creating an easy flow of key design and data information to promote the
correct interpretation of product definitions, reducing costly design mistakes
in the early stages of product development.

&#8220;We&#8217;re leveraging a long standing relationship with IBM and Dassault Syst&#232;mes,
to create harmony in PLM practices across 3D design and manufacturing teams at
EADS,&#8221; said Jean Botti, EADS Chief Technical Officer. &#8220;An increased focus on
sharing a 3D master definition and collaborating across our divisions will
reinforce our globally integrated approach to product development. IBM and
Dassault Syst&#232;mes bring indisputable value to the transformation process
underway with our PHENIX program. This is in synergy with the recent EADS choice
of another key PLM building block of the global PHENIX solution.&#8221; 

&#8220;We share IBM and Dassault Syst&#232;mes&#8217; PLM vision of using 3D technologies to
effectively communicate and collaborate on new product development,&#8221; said
Jean-Yves Mondon, EADS vice-president and head of the PHENIX program. 

&#8220;This collaboration reflects the strength of our long-term partnership with
EADS,&#8221; said Etienne Droit, executive vice president, Dassault Syst&#232;mes. &#8220;New PLM
technologies from Dassault Syst&#232;mes, such as PLM 2.0 and DS V6 solutions, will
offer EADS the capacity to extend the strategic value it has placed on
collaborative innovation. With new online product creation and life-like
simulation tools, companies will simplify PLM platforms and reduce technology
costs.&#8221; 

&#8220;IBM has the expertise and resources to help companies become more globally
integrated, said Albert Bunshaft, vice president, IBM Product Lifecycle
Management Solutions. &#8220;As EADS gives partners and suppliers more responsibility
for deploying products in new markets and consumer tastes become very local to a
region of the world, the use of defined PLM business practices will become
paramount for managing on-going market change.&#8221; 

IBM and Dassault Syst&#232;mes have experience in translating complex 3D design and
manufacturing processes into tested and repeatable models for successful product
development and manufacturing. Whether it is building the largest passenger
aircraft in the world or delivering technology used in the International Space
Program, IBM and Dassault Syst&#232;mes are teaming up to contribute to the
transformation of PLM processes into initiatives for product excellence around
the globe.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs has broken off talks with Panasonic Corp for now on selling its stake in Sanyo Electric after the electronics maker made an offer below Sanyo's current stock price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panasonic, the world's largest maker of plasma TVs, said this month that it wanted to buy smaller rival Sanyo but had not set a price with Goldman and Sanyo's two other main shareholders. The deal would boost Panasonic's competitiveness in rechargeable batteries and solar power equipment as demand grows rapidly for greener energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have reached the decision that there is no use in carrying out negotiations based on the current offer," Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Hiroko Matsumoto said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in a sign the talks may yet be revived, Matsumoto said the next step was up to Panasonic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mizuho Investors Securities analyst Nobuo Kurahashi said that Panasonic, which has $10 billion in cash and cash equivalents in its pocket, was unlikely to give up on Sanyo because of initial snags and that it may come up with a better offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a rare opportunity for Panasonic to gain a new growth driver," Kurahashi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And cash is the strongest asset in the current business environment. For Panasonic, the time must looks ripe to take advantage of its cash pile."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sach's Matsumoto declined to disclose the details of Panasonic's offer, but company and financial sources close to the matter said it had offered 120 yen per Sanyo share, valuing the company at $7.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panasonic spokesman Akira Kadota declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Panasonic, formerly known as Matsushita Electric, were down 2.7 percent at 1,360 yen on Wednesday afternoon, underperforming the Tokyo stock market's electrical machinery index, which fell 1.4 percent. Sanyo was down 1.9 percent at 153 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To acquire Sanyo, Panasonic has to buy out its top three shareholders, Daiwa Securities SMBC, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Co and Goldman Sachs, which bailed out the company in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three firms hold almost 430 million preferred shares in Sanyo, each of which can be exchanged for 10 common shares. If converted, they would hold a combined 70 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restrictions on converting and selling the stock will be lifted in March, giving the three major shareholders a possible exit on their investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper said on Tuesday that Panasonic was offering 120 yen a share because of an expected dilution in Sanyo's per-share value after the conversion of preferred shares, but Goldman aims to sell its stake for about 250 yen a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That price would put Sanyo's market capitalization at 1.54 trillion yen ($16 billion) if the preferred shares were converted, making it more than twice as valuable as its bigger and more profitable rival, Sharp Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanyo is the world's biggest maker of lithium-ion batteries, which are widely used in mobile phones, laptop computers and portable music players, and the seventh-largest in solar cells behind Sharp, Germany's Q-Cells and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panasonic and Sanyo combined would be well-positioned to benefit from a shift in the auto industry to hybrid and electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanyo supplies nickel metal hydride batteries to Ford Motor Co and Honda Motor Co Ltd and develops lithium-ion batteries for cars with Volkswagen AG, while Panasonic runs a car battery venture with Toyota Motor Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among Sanyo's main shareholders, Daiwa Securities SMBC is a joint venture between Daiwa Securities Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG), while Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp is Sanyo's main bank and part of SMFG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Kiyoshi Takenaka and Yumiko Nishitani; Editing by Hugh Lawson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GSC Game World releases patch for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Clear Sky to boost performance
and enhance visual impact; Unigine launches DirectX 10.1 &#8220;Tropics&#8221; demo of its
powerful 3D game engine; Microsoft unveils DirectX 10.1 API in Windows 7 WDM

Only AMD offers a full DirectX 10.1-compatible lineup with the ATI Radeon&#8482; HD
4000 and ATI Radeon&#8482; HD 3000 Series of graphics cards


SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Today, Microsoft&#174; DirectX&#174; 10.1 graphics leader AMD (NYSE: AMD) announced
expanded support for DirectX 10.1 from a number of developers, demonstrating
growing momentum for the most advanced Microsoft graphics API Layer to date. GSC
Game World released a DirectX 10.1 patch for their newest game title,
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Clear Sky, bringing with it frame rate improvements of up to 10
percent while at the same time enhancing the visual experience of the game1. On
the heels of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Clear Sky announcement, game engine developer
Unigine Corp. announced the availability of Tropics, a downloadable
demonstration of its Unigine game engine that showcases the ability to deliver
photorealistic virtual environments utilizing the power of DirectX 10.1. Lastly,
Microsoft announced at the Professional Developers Conference the use of the
DirectX 10.1 API in the Windows&#174; 7 Windows Desktop Manager. 

In S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Clear Sky, benchmarks of DirectX 10.1 performance versus
DirectX 10 have demonstrated frame rate improvements of as much as 10 percent,
while delivering an improved visual experience. 

&#8220;With S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl, we set a very high standard for
visual realism, and our efforts were rewarded with over two million copies
sold,&#8221; said GSC Game World CEO Sergiy Grygorovych. &#8220;By using DirectX 10.1, we
once again raise the bar with S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Clear Sky, delivering to fans of
the first person shooter genre an exhilarating exploration of a post-apocalyptic
world.&#8221; 

Unigine Corp., developers of Unigine cross-platform middleware for virtual 3D
worlds, rolled out a DirectX 10.1 implementation in their recently announced
Tropics demonstration. Using the Unigine 3D engine, Tropics delivers a stunning
virtual island paradise. By drawing upon DirectX 10.1, Unigine has been able to
take a step closer to their goal of delivering photo realistic virtual worlds. 

"The new Tropics Demo 1.1, based on the latest Unigine technologies, pushes
visual realism to new heights,&#8221; said Denis Shergin, CEO, Unigine Corp. &#8220;Our
recent collaboration with the AMD team means that we&#8217;ve been able to quickly and
easily add some of the killer features of DirectX 10.1 to enhance performance
and raise image quality. That&#8217;s given us our first-ever chance to get perfect
anti-aliasing on foliage, something that has been on our wish list for a long
time. It has been a huge pleasure to see AMD&#8217;s ATI Radeon&#8482; HD 4000 series arrive
this year, as the entire line showcases the benefits of our new DirectX 10.1
technology." 

Adding further momentum to DirectX 10.1, Microsoft used their Professional
Developers Conference to announce the use of the DirectX 10.1 API in the Windows
Desktop Manager of their next operating system, Windows 7. 

&#8220;Game developers are realizing that supporting DirectX 10.1 is an investment in
their future,&#8221; said Rick Bergman, senior vice president and general manager,
Graphics Products Group, AMD. &#8220;Microsoft has announced that the forthcoming
DirectX 11 API in Windows 7 will be a superset of DirectX 10.1, making it a
stepping stone in preparing for Windows 7.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE Nov 28 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs on Friday cut
its rating on Singapore oil rigbuilders Keppel Corp (KPLM.SI)
and Sembcorp Marine (SCMN.SI) to "sell" from "hold", following
Keppel's announcement on Thursday that customers may cancel
three orders worth $871 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We believe the latest headwind could be a major setback
for investors attracted to the sector's relatively defensive
earnings, previously backed by a perceived secured order
backlog. This may no longer be the case," Goldman said in a
report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman set a target price of S$3.40 for Keppel, below
Thursday's last traded price of S$4.80, while its target for
Sembcorp Marine is S$1.00 against the closing price of S$1.77.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Kevin Lim; Editing by Kim Coghill)

&lt;p&gt;QUITO (Reuters) - An environmental expert told a court in Ecuador that oil company Chevron Corp should pay $27 billion in compensation for environmental damage in the country, the company said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron said in a statement that it rejected geologist Richard Cabrera's revised damage estimate by saying his work "contains fabricated and erroneous evidence." In April, Cabrera recommended to the court that the U.S. oil company should pay up to $16 billion in damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, which peasants and Indians in Ecuador brought in the early 1990s, contends that Texaco, which Chevron bought in 2001, polluted the jungle and damaged their health by dumping 18 billion gallons (68 billion liters) of contaminated water from 1972 to 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron questioned Cabrera's independence and charges the plaintiffs of helping him produce his damage assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cabrera's work was monitored, supported, and conducted by the plaintiffs. They paid more than $200,000 to fund his 'independent' findings," Chevron said in the statement. "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of plaintiffs' attorneys Steven Donziger denied helping Cabrera produce the report and said Chevron is trying to undermine the expert's findings to reject any eventual negative court ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The party that asks for the technical work has to pay for it. Chevron partially payed for Cabrera's work in a previous part of the case," Donziger told Reuters. "We had to fund his (Cabrera) budget because we were the only ones asking for the overall assessment. Chevron is again trying to undermine the court."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has argued that it was released from any liability because it paid $40 million for an environmental cleanup in the 1990s, and blames state oil company Petroecuador for much of the pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiff said they expect a final ruling on the case in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alonso Soto; Editing By Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), which
bought the banking operations of Washington Mutual Inc
[WAMUQ.PK] in September, said on Friday it would retain most of
the giant thrift's branch banking staff, but planned
substantial job cuts at its former headquarters and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan expects to retain the employees who worked at
Washington Mutual (WaMu) branches, upwards of 20,000 staff,
spokesman Tom Kelly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The combined company has about 5,400 branches, and JPMorgan
has said it will close no more than 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said it remained on track to tell all former
Washington Mutual employees by Monday whether they would have
jobs and for how long, but overall numbers were not available.
Washington Mutual had 43,198 employees as of June, according to
a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan will retain about 2,000 California-based WaMu
staff in roles such as mortgages and wealth management, Kelly
said. Some 1,600 WaMu staff who worked in back office positions
handling credit cards and other consumer banking businesses in
the same state were told their jobs would be eliminated by
March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan had no branches in California, where WaMu had a
large presence and about 9000 branch staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Substantial job cuts were also expected in WaMu's Seattle
headquarters where much of the work done could be absorbed by
JPMorgan's existing operations, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan bought Washington Mutual's banking business on
Sept 25 for $1.9 billion, as the government closed the thrift

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) on
Friday won a charter from New York State's banking department,
a key step in the Wall Street bank's effort to change its
investment banking model and gather deposits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The new bank will be called Goldman Sachs Bank USA, and
include Goldman Sachs Capital Markets LP, Goldman Sachs Credit
Partners LP and Goldman Sachs Mortgage Co, the banking
department said. Goldman will merge its Utah-based industrial
loan company into its New York-chartered trust company. Goldman
Sachs Bank will be based in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman spokeswoman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The approval came two months after the Federal Reserve
designated Goldman and rival Morgan Stanley (MS.N) as bank
holding companies. That change gives them access to more
low-cost funding and the $700 billion federal bank bailout, but
requires greater regulatory scrutiny and reduced risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In seeking a state charter, Goldman diverged from Morgan
Stanley and other lenders that have sought national charters,
which would make it easier to expand into many states. JPMorgan
Chase  Co (JPM.N) Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Bank of America Corp
(BAC.N) also have national charters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's pursuit of a state charter suggests the company
will continue to focus on investment banking, trading and
wealthier clients, and not soon build a nationwide retail
banking business. Morgan Stanley, in contrast, has said it will
pursue "opportunistic" bank acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A state charter nevertheless permits Goldman to open
branches in states with "reciprocal" agreements, an arrangement
now spanning roughly 25 states. New York-chartered banks may
also operate branches in neighboring Connecticut, New Jersey
and Pennsylvania, while remaining subject to New York laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other lenders with New York charters include Bank of New
York Mellon Corp (BK.N) and MT Bank Corp (MTB.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's decision to seek a state banking charter
"reflects confidence in New York as a financial center and in
its banking department as an effective regulator," State
Banking Superintendent Richard Neiman said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman and Morgan Stanley changed their banking model
following the collapses of Bear Stearns Cos and Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK and Merrill Lynch  Co's MER.N
agreement to be acquired by Bank of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many investors worried about the sustainability of the Wall
Street banking model, especially if customers or trading
partners were to flee to lenders with more stable funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman in September won a $5 billion infusion from Warren
Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N), four days
after Goldman obtained bank holding company status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Goldman closed Friday up $2.49 at $78.99. They
have fallen 63 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan expects to retain the employees who worked at Washington Mutual (WaMu) branches, upwards of 20,000 staff, as well as 2,000 employees in other roles such as mortgages and wealth management, spokesman Tom Kelly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combined company has about 5,400 branches and JPMorgan has said it will close no more than 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it remained on track to tell all former Washington Mutual employees by Monday whether they would have jobs and for how long, but overall numbers were not available.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Nov 28 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that the French Autorite des marches
financiers (AMF) published the provisional results of IBM's tender offers
in France and the United States for ILOG (NASDAQ: ILOG) (PARIS: ILO).
These results indicate that, as of the expiration of the tender offers on
November 24, 2008, 19,664,945 ordinary shares had been tendered into the
tender offers (including ordinary shares represented by ADSs). In
addition, 32,000 warrants (no 1) issued by ILOG in 2003, 16,000 warrants
(no 2) issued by ILOG in 2003, 46,000 warrants issued by ILOG in 2004,
48,000 warrants issued by ILOG in 2005, 64,000 warrants issued by ILOG in
2006, and 48,000 warrants issued by ILOG in 2007 were tendered in the
tender offers.

    These results indicate that 19,664,945 ordinary shares representing 95.37%
of the voting rights and the share capital of ILOG, on an issued and
outstanding basis as of November 24, 2008, have been tendered into the
tender offers. On a fully diluted basis, securities representing 87.26% of
the voting rights and the share capital of ILOG have been tendered.
Therefore, the minimum tender condition has been satisfied and IBM's
tender offers were successful.

    IBM expects that the AMF will announce the final results of the tender
offers on December 1, 2008. IBM expects that the settlement of the tender
offers and the payment of the cash consideration in respect of the
tendered ordinary shares will occur on December 5, 2008.

    Assuming the final results confirm these provisional results, the tender
offers will be reopened for a subsequent offering period of ten French
trading days. IBM expects to publish the timetable for the subsequent
offering period for both tender offers on December 1, 2008, after the
timetable for the subsequent offering period in France has been set by the
AMF.

&lt;p&gt; (adds detail, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KARACHI/HONG KONG Nov 28 (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) said
on Friday that it was suspending its equities operations in
Pakistan, where share trading has been on hold since August 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said it would maintain its seat on the Karachi bourse and
continue to serve clients through third-party brokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. bank said some of its roughly 10 or 12 equities
staff would be redeployed within the firm, and that its
eight-person treasury services business in the country would

business in Pakistan, but at the same time reduce its presence
in equities, while keeping its seat on the Karachi stock
exchange," bank spokesman Ray Bashford told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trading has dried up since the KSE board imposed an
artificial floor on the 100-share benchmark on Aug. 28 to stop a
collapse in share prices that could have sent some investment
firms to the wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This has resulted in pay cuts and job losses as no income is
being generated at these firms, dealers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have had a 25 percent pay cut," said Shuja Rizvi,
director of broking operations at Capital One Equities Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many dealers fear they may be unemployed if the floor is not
removed soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mark Mobius, executive chairman of Templeton Asset
Management, in late September criticised Pakistan for protecting
share prices, adding it creates a huge risk for investors who
need liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The exchange's board of directors met on Thursday to discuss
the removal of the floor but did not reach a decision, a
director told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The KSE-index .KSE ended flat on Friday at 9,187.10
points, just 43 points above its floor. No shares were traded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sahar Ahmed and Tony Munroe)

Here are highlights from Wednesday&#8217;s Analyst Blog:

LSI Corp. in Competitive Market

LSI Corporation (NYSE: LSI) designs, manufactures and markets
application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and other standard products.
Although there can be significant upfront costs in designing an ASIC, it can be
manufactured in volume after one is produced, and, therefore, the overall cost
per chip can be relatively reduced. 

The company has challenges ahead. For one, LSI Corporation competes against
larger and better-capitalized companies in its ASIC business. Firms such as IBM
Corp. (NYSE: IBM) have been taking market share in high-end ASICs, hurting both
LSI's top-line and bottom-line. Second, firms such as Altera Corporation
(Nasdaq: ALTR) and Xilinx, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) have been successful at offering
FPGAs [field-programmable gate arrays] as a substitute technology for ASICs. 

Transocean Outlook Stays Bullish

Houston, Texas-based Transocean, Inc. (NYSE: RIG), having the very appropriate
NYSE ticker of RIG, is the world's largest offshore drilling contractor. The
company owned, had partial ownership interests in, or operated 137 mobile
offshore drilling rigs. 

We are maintaining our Buy recommendation on Transocean shares following the
company's solid operational results in the recent quarter. The company reported
strong revenue and earnings growth, driven by the acquisition of GlobalSantaFe
and higher average dayrates. Revenue more than doubled, soaring to $3.2 billion,
while net income topped $1.1 billion.

&lt;p&gt; (Refiles to read Microsoft Corp, not Inc, in paragraph 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Nov 30 (Reuters) - A report in the Sunday Times
that Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is in talks with Yahoo Inc
(YHOO.O) to buy the U.S internet company's online search
business for $20 billion is "total fiction," according to a
key executive cited by an influential U.S. blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Sunday Times, which did not cite its sources, said the
proposal under discussion involves a complex transaction that
would see the U.S. software giant support a new management
team to take control of Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The team would be led by ex-AOL Chairman and CEO Jonathan
Miller and former Fox Interactive Media President Ross
Levinsohn, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the AllThingsDigital blog, affiliated with the Wall
Street Journal, quoted Levinsohn as saying the report was
"total fiction." Top sources at Yahoo and Microsoft also
scoffed at the report, the blog said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo spokesman Brad Williams said: "We don't comment on
rumours, and all this is is a rumour."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Microsoft spokeswoman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft withdrew its $47.5 billion buyout offer for
Yahoo in May after Yahoo Chief Executive Jerry Yang and his
board rejected the bid as too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bid speculation was sparked again earlier this month when
Yang announced he was stepping down. Microsoft CEO Steve
Ballmer ruled a bid out at the time, but said he was "open" to
talks on a deal for Yahoo's search business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Activist investor Carl Icahn -- who sits on Yahoo's board
and increased his stake in the company to 5.4 percent last
week -- reiterated he favored the sale of the search business,
according to an interview in the Dec. 1 edition of Barron's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft has said publicly that they are not interested
in buying the whole company, and I believe them. But they are
interested in doing a deal on search, and we should pursue
that," Icahn was quoted by Barron's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this year, Icahn threatened to launch a proxy
fight against Yahoo and oust Yang in an effort to push the
company to accept Microsoft's offer. He later struck a deal
with Yahoo and joined its board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn began amassing Yahoo shares during the company's
merger talks with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Sunday Times said senior directors at Microsoft and
Yahoo are understood to have agreed on the broad terms of the
deal, but there is no guarantee it will succeed.

&lt;p&gt;GAZA Nov 30 (Reuters) - Hundreds of supporters of the Hamas Islamist group protested outside the Gaza Strip's border crossing with Egypt on Sunday to demand Saudi Arabia grant them permission to take part in the annual haj pilgrimage to Mecca. The Saudis have granted visas to some 3,000 Gazans who registered for the haj through the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and headed by President Mahmoud Abbas, leader of the secular Fatah faction. But when the pilgrims approached the Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt on Saturday, Hamas security forces turned them way. A Hamas source said the group would allow those registered with the Palestinian Authority to pass through Rafah only if Saudi Arabia also granted visas to some 3,000 pilgrims who signed up for the haj with Gaza's Hamas-led government. We should all go or no one should go, demanded protester Masoud Abu Oamr, a 45-year-old merchant who says he registered for the haj with Hamas. Protesters sang, Oh God, We answered your call, a chant used during the haj in which Muslims retrace the footsteps of the Prophet Mohammad. Pilgrims from Gaza hoped to arrive in the next few days. Tensions between the rival factions have been on the rise since Hamas boycotted reconciliation talks in Cairo earlier this month, irritating Egypt and Saudi Arabia. A Hamas lawmaker in the Gaza Strip, Atef Adwan, drew a hostile response from Abbas aides after being quoted as saying the denial of visas to Hamas supporters could stir opposition within Saudi Arabia to the regime. Making such threats against Saudi Arabia reflects the extent of their isolation, senior Abbas aide and Fatah official Ahmad Abdel-Rahman said of Hamas. Adwan later issued a statement saying he was misquoted. He said he made no comments hostile to Saudi Arabia, a powerhouse Hamas is reluctant to alienate. A Saudi foreign ministry official responded to Adwan's reported remarks. Saudi Arabia looks at all Palestinians as equals and has granted thousands from all over the occupied territories, including the Gaza Strip, entry visas to perform haj, the official was quoted by the Saudi state news agency as saying. They (visas) were delivered to the Palestinian Authority, the report said. All of the kingdom's entry points are ready to welcome them and facilitate for them performing the ritual.
