&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co. unveiled a program on Tuesday to let preteens create personal mini Web sites like MySpace's very popular social networking site for older teens and young adults, with parental controls it hopes will create a safe haven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Disney feature, called Disney Xtreme Digital, or Disney XD, is aimed at kids under 14, with parents getting control over Internet activities, Paul Yanover, executive vice president and managing director of Disney Online, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A chat feature requires parental approval for kids to go beyond trading canned messages designed to prevent users from revealing personal information, or from using profanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kids can gather games, videos and music files from Disney's promotions-rich Web site and place them on a page that they decorate with a selection of motifs from the company's rich character library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yanover said the feature limits kids to using Disney content on their Web sites, and would allow parents to monitor interaction. At the same time, Disney can protect its image on the freewheeling Web, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a weaving together of entertainment and promotion and marketing," he added. "It's difficult to say where one ends and the other begins."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feature is meant for use on high-speed Internet. The approximately 30 million U.S. broadband households already make up about 90 percent of visitors to Disney.com, Yanover said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kids earn points for every activity they participate in on Disney XD, and can use the points to purchase items such as virtual stickers or Rube Goldberg-type machines like bubble makers for their pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to create a community of kid marketers for Disney, as kids visit each other's sites and talk up Disney TV shows, characters, and products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want tons of kids immersed in my brands and franchises. What better marketer do I have than a kid?" Yanover said. "It's really about building a kid community ... (that) extends beyond individual Disney products, Web sites and titles."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company unveiled the feature at a New York event featuring 'tween heartthrob Corbin Bleu, star of the popular Disney Channel movies "High School Musical" and "Jump In", whose new album debuted on the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MySpace is owned by News Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N), the world's largest technology services company, is cutting 1,315 services-related jobs in the United States, a union trying to organize IBM workers said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cuts affect employees in a variety of areas including computer server systems operations, technology integration and management and financial services, said the Alliance at IBM, a union group affiliated with the Communications Workers of America, on its Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Union representatives were not immediately available for comment. International Business Machines Corp. had 355,766 employees worldwide at the end of 2006, according to its annual report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM spokesman John Bukovinsky said he could not confirm the number of job cuts. He said such cuts "should not be a surprise" as the company indicated after its latest earnings report on April 17 that it planned to cut costs in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bukovinsky said the company does not anticipate a charge against earnings for the job cuts, which he characterized as normal for a services business that is dependent on the changing demands of clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're putting in place a series of actions to address our U.S. cost base, including a basic focus on resource and cost management disciplines and rebalancing of resources as we execute our global resource strategy," Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a conference call with analysts on April 17, according to a transcript of the call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loughridge said in April that IBM's first quarter was "noticeably weaker" in the United States, especially in the industrial, financial services and communications industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The job cuts follow an IBM announcement on Monday that it planned to hire 500 people at a new customer call center in Daleville, Indiana, through 2010. The $2.9 million project is in addition to other IBM plans to hire another 500 employees in Indiana in the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 1 (Reuters) - Patients taking Pfizer Inc's
(PFE.N) Lyrica experienced a significant reduction in pain from
the chronic condition fibromyalgia, compared with those taking
a placebo in a clinical trial, the drugmaker said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said it submitted data from the study to U.S. health
regulators in an effort to broaden the fast-growing drug's
approved uses to include treatment of fibromyalgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are currently no medications specifically approved
for fibromyalgia, a sometimes debilitating disorder with
symptoms that can include intense pain, fatigue, stiffness and
depression. Its cause is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lyrica, which is currently approved to treat neuropathic
pain and epilepsy seizures, saw sales more than double in the
first quarter to $395 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said the results from the 14-week, 745-patient study
equate to a patient's severe pain being reduced to a moderate
to mild pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The study tested Lyrica at three doses -- 600 milligrams a
day, 450 mg and 300 mg -- against a placebo and had patients
measure their pain on a scale of zero to 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thirty percent of patients taking the 600 mg dose of Lyrica
said their pain was reduced by half or better compared with 27
percent at 450 mg and 24 percent at the lowest dose. Of those
taking a placebo, 15 percent reported pain reduction of 50
percent or greater, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Data from the study were presented at the American Academy
of Neurology annual meeting in Boston.

&lt;p&gt;Significantly more patients treated with Pfizer's Lyrica reduced their pain by 50% or more compared with placebo, according to study results presented today at the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting. Clinically, this outcome would equate to a patient with severe pain reporting a reduction to mild to moderate pain. The study found that patients receiving 600mg a day of Lyrica reduced their pain by 2.05 on the pain scale; 2.03 for patients taking 450mg a day; 1.75 for patients taking 300mg a day, and 1.04 for patients taking placebo. The results of these data were submitted to the FDA as part of a supplemental New Drug Application for Lyrica for the treatment of fibromyalgia. Pfizer also intends to pursue a fibromyalgia indication in other major mkts worldwide.

(MSFT.O), the world's largest software maker, is a contender to buy Internet advertising firm 24/7 Real Media Inc. TFSM.O for as much as $1 billion, the New York Post reported on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares in 24/7 Real Media surged more than 28 percent in premarket trading to $12.75 from a close of $9.95 on Monday following the Post report, which cited unnamed sources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    24/7 Real Media and Microsoft could not immediately be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The newspaper reported last month that WPP Group Plc (WPP.L), the world's second-largest advertising company, was also a suitor for 24/7 Real Media. At the time, analysts had estimated the company could be valued as high as $600 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Online advertising companies have become a new focus for takeover activity since Web search leader Google Inc. (GOOG.O) announced a $3.1 billion deal to purchase Internet marketer DoubleClick Inc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Rival Yahoo Inc. (YHOO.O) said this week it would buy the remaining 80 percent it doesn't own in Right Media Inc. for about $680 million. Right Media provides direct marketing advertising to social networks and other large online audiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Paritosh Bansal and Michele Gershberg, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - Procter  Gamble Co. (PG.N) posted a 13.6 percent rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday, driven by developing markets, and raised the low end of its full-year profit forecast due to the growth in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The profit only met, rather than exceeded, expectations, and shares of PG fell 0.8 percent in early electronic trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our initial take is that there is big headline risk for PG this morning since the company did not beat estimates and raise guidance," said Bear Stearns analyst Justin Hott, who rates the shares "outperform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have seen big beats so far this quarter, but not this time from PG," Hott said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profit rose to $2.51 billion, or 74 cents per share, in the fiscal third quarter ended in March, from $2.21 billion, or 63 cents per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The maker of Gillette razors and Pampers diapers said in March that it expected to earn 72 cents to 74 cents per share. Analysts, on average, expected 74 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales rose 8.4 percent to $18.69 billion, exceeding analysts' average forecast of $18.59 billion.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     (Corrects to UPDATE 2 from UPDATE 1) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     (Adds Teva declining comment, details on Lipitor battle) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Ransdell Pierson &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) said on Monday the Federal Court of Appeal of Canada has blocked generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. TEVA.O from launching a copycat form of its Celebrex arthritis drug in the country until 2014. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer said the court, in its ruling, reversed a lower court ruling that would have permitted Teva's Novopharm affiliate to launch its form of Celebrex in Canada. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The patent concerned the chemical composition of Celebrex, Pfizer spokesman Bryant Haskins said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Celebrex had global first-quarter sales of $598 million, making it one of Pfizer's top products. The world's largest drugmaker declined to provide Canadian sales of the medicine, saying it generally does not break out revenue from its drugs in individual overseas markets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Haskins said government agency Health Canada earlier  indicated that, on Tuesday, it would "de-list," meaning invalidate, a separate patent protecting Celebrex. That patent concerns how Celebrex is used, Haskins said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "But with today's court decision, Celebrex will be protected in Canada until 2014 no matter what Health Canada does," Haskins said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A spokesman for Israel-based Teva declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer in December won an important round in another patent battle with Teva, when a Canadian federal court prevented the Novopharm affiliate from launching a generic version of Pfizer's Lipitor cholesterol fighter until a patent expires in July 2010. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Teva, the world's biggest maker of generic medicines, has appealed the Lipitor decision -- which had been rendered by the Canadian Federal Court in Toronto. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Far more is at stake in the Lipitor patent battle because the cholesterol drug -- with annual sales of about $13 billion &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- is a far bigger product than Celebrex. -- is a far bigger product than Celebrex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; editing by Andre Grenon; Reuters Messaging: ransdell.pierson.reuters.com@reuters.net; 646-223-6034; ransdell.pierson@reuters.com)) Keywords: PFIZER TEVA/CELEBREX  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O), the world's largest software maker, is a contender to buy Internet advertising firm 24/7 Real Media Inc. TFSM.O for as much as $1 billion, the New York Post reported on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares in 24/7 Real Media surged more than 28 percent in premarket trading to $12.75 from a close of $9.95 on Monday following the Post report, which cited unnamed sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;24/7 Real Media and Microsoft could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newspaper reported last month that WPP Group Plc (WPP.L), the world's second-largest advertising company, was also a suitor for 24/7 Real Media. At the time, analysts had estimated the company could be valued as high as $600 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online advertising companies have become a new focus for takeover activity since Web search leader Google Inc. (GOOG.O) announced a $3.1 billion deal to purchase Internet marketer DoubleClick Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rival Yahoo Inc. (YHOO.O) said this week it would buy the remaining 80 percent it doesn't own in Right Media Inc. for about $680 million. Right Media provides direct marketing advertising to social networks and other large online audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of 24/7 Real Media Inc. TFSM.O jumped nearly 30 percent to a six-and-a-half-year high before the bell on Tuesday after the New York Post reported that Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) is considering a bid for the Internet advertising company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In consolidated electronic trading ahead of the Nasdaq market open, the stock was up $2.80 at $12.85 after closing Monday at $9.95.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's shares last traded that high in November 2000. At that time the stock was in the latter stages of a slide along with other Internet stocks that would ultimately erase more than 99 percent of its value, falling from more than $325 in January 2000 to 45 cents in September 2001.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Major information technology firms, including Oracle Corp. ORCL.O, IBM Corp. (IBM.N) and NEC Corp. (6701.T), will set up a consortium to sell servers and systems running the Linux operating system in Japan, a financial daily said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be the first time in the world that major IT firms join hands to market equipment running the free software, the Nikkei newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux is the most popular type of so-called open source software, which began as a grass-roots approach to program development, and where improvements are shared among programmers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cooperative nature of the Linux community has united its supporters against Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) and its Windows system, although Linux developers also compete among themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firms, spearheaded by Oracle Corp. Japan (4716.T), aim to launch the operation as early as in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 10 companies, including major server manufacturers such as Hitachi Ltd. (6501.T), Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ.N) and Dell Inc. DELL.O are expected to participate, as well as systems developers such as NTT Data Corp. (9613.T).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move is in response to a Japanese government procurement guideline that promotes the use of the open-source Linux operating system within the government starting in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central government has set aside 1.25 trillion yen ($10.40 billion) for spending on information systems in the fiscal 2007 budget, and the figure is expected to reach around 2 trillion yen when including local governments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would be around roughly 15 percent of IT spending for all of Japan, including private-sector corporations, the Nikkei said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government sees that excessive reliance on Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system will result in less freedom in systems development and other harmful effects because Windows' source code is not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, 78 percent of the servers in Japan run Microsoft Windows, while 14 percent run Linux, according to the Nikkei.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=120.17 Yen)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - An Alaska court denied a 
request from Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and its partners for a stay 
that would have allowed the group to hang on to oil and gas 
leases at the undeveloped Point Thomson field while they fight 
a state decision to take the leases back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The ruling, issued late Tuesday, is the latest development 
in a long-running dispute between the state and leaseholders at 
Point Thomson, a resource-rich but long-dormant area just west 
of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The state Department of Natural Resources in November 
revoked the leases at Point Thomson a year after state 
officials found operator Exxon Mobil and its partners -- BP 
(BP.L), Chevron (CVX.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) -- to be in 
default of development requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The unit holds 8 trillion to 9 trillion cubic feet of 
natural gas and about 300 million barrels of liquids in the 
form of natural gas condensates and crude oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The state hopes to put Point Thomson leases back on the 
auction block, where they can be sold to other companies and 
developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In her ruling, Superior Court Judge Sharon Gleason said the 
state had "persuasively demonstrated that it is in the public 
interest" for the Department of Natural Resources to continue 
with the lease termination process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gleason said the companies must pay the state a $20 million 
fine for violating lease terms or post a $25 million bond with 
the court while the appeals process continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tom Irwin, commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural 
Resources, said the ruling was a clear win for the state. 
"We're standing up for the state's right to protect its 
resources," Irwin said. "We want our resources to move to 
market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alaska oil and gas leases normally expire after five to 10 
years if there has been no commercial development. But the 
Point Thomson leases, some of which date back to the 1960s, 
received numerous extensions through the years based on the 
companies' promises to bring the field into production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobil, the majority owner of the disputed leases, and 
its partners argue that Point Thomson cannot be developed until 
a long-planned natural gas pipeline is built from the North 
Slope. The reservoir there is challenged by unusually 
high-pressure conditions, the companies have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in previous development plans, Exxon Mobil and the 
other companies pledged to produce Point Thomson liquids and 
send them to market through the existing trans-Alaska oil 
pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY May 2 (Reuters) - Hot women with potty mouths,
a kick-fighting hero, ghosts and a hapless comedian are
Televisa's prime time bets this year as the Mexican broadcaster
debuts four new series for young audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Using product placement and subjects like sex and drug
trafficking, Televisa hopes to raise its profile among
advertisers by luring in the coveted 18 to 44 demographic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In two weeks, the four new series -- of 13, half-hour
episodes each -- will air on Televisa's Channel 5, which has
national coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Additionally, Televisa will create side products, including
comic books, exclusive behind-the-scenes content for the
Internet, blogs, music and DVD sets based on the new series
that will be sold through other business units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jose Baston, corporate vice-president of Televisa (TV.N)
(TLVACPO.MX), told reporters on Wednesday that the new series
will be offered to its U.S. partner Univision Communications
Inc. (UVV.N) as part of the long-term programming deal they
both share, which expires in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the Internet content -- to be aired through a
newly created site -- will be blocked to all U.S.-based
visitors as the two companies have a pending legal fight
regarding Televisa's right to air its content online in the
United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa failed to buy out Univision last year after losing
a bidding war against a group of investors led by media mogul
Haim Saban. The Mexican company recently sold its stake in its
U.S. partner and got $1 billion for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa is also working on three other original series
that it may debut on pay television later this year, Baston
added. The company has a satellite television business, SKY,
and a cable company, Cablevision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Baston said Televisa will hold the rights to all new shows
and the idea is to sell them to other countries in Latin
America, or the United States, in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Breaking into the Anglo market is very difficult," Baston
said. "But we have U.S. companies looking at scripts," he added
without elaborating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOT PIZZA AND CAPOEIRA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Sexo y Otros Secretos" (Sex and Other Secrets) puts women
in the driver's seat. Five friends, including a single mom and
the young lover of a man who is already spoken for, try to
balance married life, or a lack of it, with family and jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Is it hot ... and hard?," asks one of the characters of a
cute, clueless pizza delivery boy about half her age as she
opens the door to pick up the order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show has a bit of "Sex and the City" and "Desperate
Housewives" and will likely become the most talked-about show
in a deeply Catholic, macho country where abortion and same-sex
marriages were just recently legalized in the capital city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa's "Miedos" (Fears) plays with elements from "The
Twilight Zone" and "CSI" by choosing gloomy, dark atmospheres
where corpses, ghosts and unusual plot twists will keep viewers
on tenterhooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In "El Pantera" (The Panther), the broadcaster rescues the
tradition of old-school heroes that use their wit and fists to
fight the bad guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The opening scenes of this series bring to mind "The Crow,"
as Pantera goes after Baboon, the drug dealer who brutally
killed his girlfriend, using capoeira, the acrobatic Brazilian
martial art he learned while serving time in jail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pantera widely addresses the problem of drug-trafficking,
which has plagued Mexico and led to the gory deaths of over 900
people in the last four months, according to media reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For comedy, Televisa picked "Y ahora ... que hago?" (Now
what?), using Adal Ramones, the broadcaster's best-known
funnyman, as the main character of the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Baston said all four series will be sandwiched between new
episodes of well-known U.S. hit shows, like "House,"
"Nip/Tuck," "Heroes" and "Law and Order." This will guarantee
the broadcaster, and advertisers, a solid audience for at least
two hours.

&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK (Hollywood Reporter) - For his second directorial 
effort, screenwriter Zak Penn ("X-Men: The Last Stand") uses an 
improvisational approach similar to his feature debut, 
"Incident at Loch Ness," with much more successful results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This ensemble comedy about a group of eccentric players 
competing in a multimillion-dollar poker match will inevitably 
be compared to the works of Christopher Guest, but what "The 
Grand" lacks in originality it more than makes up for with its 
high percentage of funny moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Penn, who co-wrote the script with Matt Bierman, has 
assembled a top-notch cast of comedic performers who seem to be 
having one hell of a time. Their enjoyment is infectious, and 
while some of the gags invariably go on for too long, for the 
most part the film is crisply paced and consistently 
uproarious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The central character is "One Eyed" Jack Faro (Woody 
Harrelson), who's lost the casino his grandfather left him 
because of his various addictions, not the least of which is to 
marriage. In order to gain it back from an addled real estate 
developer (Michael McKean), he enters a poker competition 
called "The Grand," the prize being $10 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To win, he must compete against a gallery of bizarre 
players, including Larry Schwartzman (David Cross), whose 
distraction techniques include wearing a burka; his sister, 
Lainie (Cheryl Hines), a profane Long Island housewife; LBJ 
"Deuce" Fairbanks (Dennis Farina), who longs for the good old 
days of breaking legs; Andy Andrews (Richard Kind), who 
garnered his spot at the table after winning an online game; 
Harold Melvin (Chris Parnell), a semi-autistic who lives with 
his elderly mother; "The German" (Werner Herzog), who needs to 
kill at least one animal a day; and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also on hand are such characters as Lainie's husband (Ray 
Romano), a "lightning survivor"; her father (sitcom star Gabe 
Kaplan, now a real-life player); and other competitors played 
in cameos by such figures as Hank Azaria, Jason Alexander and 
director Brett Ratner, among many others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Penn and Bierman have clearly allowed their performers to 
let loose, with mostly hilarious results. Their attempt to 
provide some emotional depth to the proceedings, with a subplot 
involving the dysfunctional Schwartzman family dynamics, is 
less successful, though it does little harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

fine for violating lease terms or post a $25 million bond with 
the court while the appeals process continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tom Irwin, commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural 
Resources, said the ruling was a clear win for the state. 
"We're standing up for the state's right to protect its 
resources," Irwin said. "We want our resources to move to 
market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alaska oil and gas leases normally expire after five to 10 
years if there has been no commercial development. But the 
Point Thomson leases, some of which date back to the 1960s, 
received numerous extensions through the years based on the 
companies' promises to bring the field into production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobil, the majority owner of the disputed leases, and 
its partners argue that Point Thomson cannot be developed until 
a long-planned natural gas pipeline is built from the North 
Slope. The reservoir there is challenged by unusually 
high-pressure conditions, the companies have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in previous development plans, Exxon Mobil and the 
other companies pledged to produce Point Thomson liquids and 
send them to market through the existing trans-Alaska oil 
pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Britain denied a report in a U.S. newspaper on Wednesday which said Washington had talked to London about tightening visa restrictions for British citizens of Pakistani origin traveling to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New York Times reported that the U.S. homeland security secretary, Michael Chertoff, who met British Home Secretary John Reid last month, had discussed changing rules that allow British citizens to travel to the United States without a visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He raised his concerns amid a wave of terrorism trials in Britain in which Britons of Pakistani origin have either been accused of or found guilty of planning or carrying out attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story said one proposal would be to require U.S. visas of all British citizens, a move which would affect millions of Britons who travel to the United States each year. Another proposal would require visas just for Britons of Pakistani origin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The New York Times story ... is incorrect," a British Foreign Office spokesman said. "It does not represent British government policy, nor would it be an acceptable proposal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(The Americans) are aware of our view that changes to the visa waiver program could cause economic damage to both our countries without materially enhancing the security controls over immigration," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security also said there were "inaccuracies" in the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We flatly reject the notion of profiling based upon ethnicity, religion, sex, age, what have you. Country of origin as well," the spokesman told BBC radio. "We are pleased with the visa waiver program but we have been on record with our desire to strengthen the visa waiver program."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Britain's Home Office (interior ministry) denied that Chertoff and Reid had discussed any particular group of people at their meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The suggestion that groups of British citizens of a particular background should be singled out was not made at the meeting and neither would it have been acceptable," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON May 2 (Reuters) - The EU's competition regulator
will wait for a judgment on its case against Microsoft before
issuing long-awaited guidelines on how it deals with firms
suspected of abusing market dominance, a top official indicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Philip Lowe, director general of the European Commission's
competition unit, did not mention Microsoft (MSFT.O) by name but
referred to "one major case" pending in EU courts that is making
the Commission careful in interpreting the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Commission should rightly be cautious in relation to
any interpretation it makes of the concepts of market power and
refusal to deal (with other firms), in particular in the light
of the present deliberation in the Court of First Instance," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Commission decided in 2004 that Microsoft broke EU law
by abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system to
muscle out rivals, fining the company 497 million euros ($678
million) and demanding changes to its business practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft appealed against that decision, leading to one of
the biggest cases the EU executive has pursued against companies
it says violate competition law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The guidelines will follow the law laid down by the decision
-- expected sometime this year -- of the European Union's
second-highest court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The discussion (of earlier drafts of the guidelines) has
been cited in a myriad of submissions by lawyers," Lowe told a
conference held by the British Institute of International and
Comparative Law on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He added that if the Commission produced a new draft it
would effectively be regarded as a form of "soft law" even
before becoming binding on the EU executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Commission guidelines on competition issues give companies
and their lawyers an idea of how the Commission treats cases,
interprets the law and calculates fines.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Canary Wharf and City comments, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Jeffrey Goldfarb&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON May 2 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM.N) has
entered exclusive talks with the City of London and property
developer Hammerson Plc (HMSO.L) to build new European
headquarters in the City, bucking a trend of banks moving east
to Canary Wharf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The proposed headquarters, to be located on property between
London Wall and Fore Street, would consolidate the UK investment
banking operations of the third-largest U.S. bank from several
London locations into one site with more than 1 million square
feet, the bank said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would house four trading floors, each one with about
72,000 square feet, making them the largest in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, founded in London in 1837, had also been
considering a site in Canary Wharf, where Barclays, Lehman
Brothers and Morgan Stanley, among others, have already
relocated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Both the City and Canary Wharf are fantastic places to do
business," a J.P. Morgan spokesman said. "This site is simply
our preferred choice based on our criteria."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank said it considered build quality, favourable
economics and location as its three main factors in selecting a
site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Canary Wharf made an extremely competitive offer to J.P.
Morgan, but it would appear that the City of London made an even
cheaper one," said a spokesman for Canary Wharf Group, owned by
Songbird Estates Plc SBDb.L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He added that Canary Wharf Group is in talks with a number
of other firms to develop on the same site that was being
considered by J.P. Morgan and in other parts of the docklands
area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Europe's biggest bank, HSBC (0005.HK), earlier this week
agreed on a 1.1 billion pound ($2.2 billion) sale-and-leaseback
of its London headquarters in Canary Wharf with Spanish property
firm Metrovacesa MVC.MC, a record for a single British
building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although the City -- or "square mile" -- has been synonymous
with London as a global financial centre, the defection by
prominent financial groups has divided the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This new building and J.P. Morgan's continued presence in
the City will reinforce London's pre-eminent position as
Europe's leading financial capital," said Michael Snyder,
chairman of the City of London Corp.'s policy committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan's proposed building will not house the company's
asset management and treasury and securities services
businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The exclusivity period will last for 90 days, during which
final terms will be agreed. Estimated costs for building the
site were not disclosed.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 1 (Reuters) - Patients taking Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) Lyrica experienced a significant reduction in pain from the chronic condition fibromyalgia, compared with those taking a placebo in a clinical trial, the drugmaker said on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer said it submitted data from the study to U.S. health regulators in an effort to broaden the fast-growing drug's approved uses to include treatment of fibromyalgia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    There are currently no medications specifically approved for fibromyalgia, a sometimes debilitating disorder with symptoms that can include intense pain, fatigue, stiffness and depression. Its cause is unknown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Lyrica, which is currently approved to treat neuropathic pain and epilepsy seizures, saw sales more than double in the first quarter to $395 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer said the results from the 14-week, 745-patient study equate to a patient's severe pain being reduced to a moderate to mild pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The study tested Lyrica at three doses -- 600 milligrams a day, 450 mg and 300 mg -- against a placebo and had patients measure their pain on a scale of zero to 10. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Thirty percent of patients taking the 600 mg dose of Lyrica said their pain was reduced by half or better compared with 27 percent at 450 mg and 24 percent at the lowest dose. Of those taking a placebo, 15 percent reported pain reduction of 50 percent or greater, Pfizer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Data from the study were presented at the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting in Boston. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Reuters Messaging: bill.berkrot.reuters.com@reuters.net phone 646 223-6030)) Keywords: PFIZER LYRICA/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY May 3 (Reuters) - Mexican stocks rose on
Thursday, driven by strong gains in Televisa, after the
broadcaster received an upgrade on its debt rating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Mexican peso MXN= MEX01 firmed 0.13 percent to
10.904 per dollar, and the government's peso-denominated bonds
strengthened on a drop in year-end inflation forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the stock market, the benchmark IPC index .MXX was up
0.37 percent at 29,368 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa's shares (TLVACPO.MX) rose 1.23 percent to 64
pesos, while its New York traded stock (TV.N) was up 1 percent
at $29.28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ratings agency Moody's raised its debt rating on Televisa's
foreign currency debt to Baa1 from Baa2, citing a "projected
stable operating performance as well as its strong cash
position."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dominant cell phone operator America Movil (AMXL.MX)
(AMX.N) rose 0.52 percent to 29.27 pesos, while its New York
traded shares were up 0.54 percent at $53.67.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, Mexican government bonds rose and the peso
firmed after a central bank poll showed a drop in year-end
inflation forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The benchmark 10-year government peso bond MX10YT=RR rose
0.315 point to bid 101.550 in price and yield 7.75 percent, a
drop in yield of 5 basis points. Bond yields move inversely to
price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The peso MXN= MEX01 firmed 0.13 percent to 10.904 per
dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A central bank poll released on Wednesday showed analysts
expect inflation to end the year at 3.65 percent, just below
the 3.68 percent seen in the bank's last monthly poll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The mood in the market seems to be better today," said a
bond trader in Mexico City. "Obviously the poll helps you
out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Inflation, which bond investors loath because it tends to
erodes the value of their bonds, has been near or above the
central bank's upper tolerance level of 4 percent yearly rate
since September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The central bank hiked the overnight rate by a quarter
point to 7.25 percent last Friday in a bid to slow inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The peso also got a boost from weekly jobless data in the
United States showing a stronger labor market than previously
expected, boosting optimism about the strength of the economy
in the United States, which buys most Mexican exports.

&lt;p&gt;Dutch investor group VEB, which appealed against an earlier court decision that ABN and Goldman Sachs were not liable for misleading investors, said in a statement that investor claims could run to hundreds of millions of euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A court found in December 2003 that World Online, which was the biggest Internet IPO at the time, had provided incomplete information during its 12 billion euros ($16.3 billion) flotation and ordered the company, which was bought by Italy's Tiscali (TIS.MI) in the same year of its listing, to pay damages to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dutch investor group VEB filed an appeal, claiming that ABN and Goldman Sachs were also liable. The appeals court ruled in favor of VEB on Thursday, it said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors were furious at World Online's chief executive at the time, Nina Brink, after it emerged that she sold a World Online stake of almost 10 percent before the flotation for a fraction of the price investors paid at the IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABN AMRO and Goldman Sachs were not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABN and the VEB were meeting in court on Thursday in a separate case involving the $21 billion sale of ABN's U.S. banking business LaSalle, with a ruling expected that could help determine whether ABN will be bought by Barclays BARC. or a consortium of three banks led by Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds market impact, more Exxon and government comments)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Yaw Yan Chong&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE May 3 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) has
shut a 115,000 barrels per day (bpd) crude oil unit at its
refinery offshore Singapore indefinitely, after a fire in an
associated unit killed two workers on Thursday, the company
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A larger 185,000-bpd crude distillation unit (CDU) at the
300,000-bpd refinery on Jurong Island continues to operate
normally, the company said, without giving further details. The
CDU is at the heart of the refining process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The smaller unit will "not be started up until it is safe
to do so", the U.S. oil giant said in a statement, giving no
timeframe for a resumption in operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A brief flash fire broke out in a cooling unit, called an
exchanger, that was undergoing maintenance. The CDU was
operating at the time of the accident, said an Exxon Mobil
spokeswoman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Singapore authorities said they had ordered the company to
halt some types of refining processes pending an investigation,
but it was not clear how this would affect core operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most Asian oil product prices strengthened at market close
despite weaker crude benchmarks, following news of the outage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The price difference of fuel oil to Dubai crude, for
example, jumped to a three-month high of $9.45 a barrel in
discount. The benchmark 95-octane gasoline grade rose to a
premium of $12.92 a barrel to Singapore spot quotes, up 90
cents from day-ago levels, and diesel prices closed at $80.60,
up 15 cents.
 An industry source familiar with operations at the Pulau Ayer
Chawan refinery, half of Exxon's Singapore refining complex,
had said earlier the CDU had been shut as a precautionary move
after the fire, which did not appear to have damaged the unit.
The source had also initially said that the CDU had restarted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon spokeswoman Eva Ho said all other secondary units
around the affected CDU are operating normally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traders said they were still waiting to get more
information before reacting and that there had been no reported
delays to loadings from Exxon's terminal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If they have to shut down the units for a long period, it
will affect the gasoline market, as regional supplies are tight
and demand from the United States is also strong," said Hwang
Gyu-won, analyst at Tong Yang Investment Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fire occurred at an "overhead exchanger of a
distillation column" early on Thursday, the Singapore Civil
Defence Force (SCDF) said. It affected an area of 1.5 metres (5
ft) by 4.0 metres and was brought under control within half an
hour, the SCDF said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The industry source said the unit cools oil that comes out
of the core CDUs and was being restarted after maintenance.
Some exchangers are also used to pre-heat feedstock for crude
units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; STOP-WORK ORDER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 36-year-old plant, which processes mainly sour Middle
East crude and sweet Asia Pacific grades, produces almost
enough fuel to meet the total demand of Vietnam. It is one-half
of Exxon Singapore's 605,000-bpd complex, the fourth-largest in
Asia and particularly important as it exports fuel across the
region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even without CDU damage, oil traders feared a potentially
extended closure at the plant as Singapore authorities
investigate the deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Singapore Ministry of Manpower has issued a partial
stop-work order relating to all blinding work at the plant,
which could be in place for weeks or months, a ministry
spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The order will be in place until we determine that it is

the CDU would not be affected by the order if no blinding works
are carried out in the unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blinding work prevents oil from flowing into the cooling

whether the CDU would be shut over the entire duration.

event of a fatality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ho said Exxon would continue to meet customer demand. Oil
companies are often able to maintain supply lines by drawing
down inventories or buying additional fuel from other parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two contract workers were killed in the fire and two were
injured, Exxon Mobil said in its statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Police said the two workers who were killed were
Singaporeans. The injured workers, who are from Bangladesh and
India, are in intensive care for burns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Exxon statement also clarified that the affected CDU
has a 115,000-bpd capacity, not 140,000 bpd as stated by an
industry source earlier.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds market impact, more Exxon and government comments) By Yaw Yan Chong SINGAPORE, May 3 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) has shut a 115,000 barrels per day (bpd) crude oil unit at its refinery offshore Singapore indefinitely, after a fire in an associated unit killed two workers on Thursday, the company said. A larger 185,000-bpd crude distillation unit (CDU) at the 300,000-bpd refinery on Jurong Island continues to operate normally, the company said, without giving further details. The CDU is at the heart of the refining process. The smaller unit will not be started up until it is safe to do so, the U.S. oil giant said in a statement, giving no timeframe for a resumption in operation. A brief flash fire broke out in a cooling unit, called an exchanger, that was undergoing maintenance. The CDU was operating at the time of the accident, said an Exxon Mobil spokeswoman. Singapore authorities said they had ordered the company to halt some types of refining processes pending an investigation, but it was not clear how this would affect core operations. Most Asian oil product prices strengthened at market close despite weaker crude benchmarks, following news of the outage. The price difference of fuel oil to Dubai crude, for example, jumped to a three-month high of $9.45 a barrel in discount. The benchmark 95-octane gasoline grade rose to a premium of $12.92 a barrel to Singapore spot quotes, up 90 cents from day-ago levels, and diesel prices closed at $80.60, up 15 cents.  An industry source familiar with operations at the Pulau Ayer Chawan refinery, half of Exxon's Singapore refining complex, had said earlier the CDU had been shut as a precautionary move after the fire, which did not appear to have damaged the unit. The source had also initially said that the CDU had restarted. Exxon spokeswoman Eva Ho said all other secondary units around the affected CDU are operating normally. Traders said they were still waiting to get more information before reacting and that there had been no reported delays to loadings from Exxon's terminal. If they have to shut down the units for a long period, it will affect the gasoline market, as regional supplies are tight and demand from the United States is also strong, said Hwang Gyu-won, analyst at Tong Yang Investment Bank. The fire occurred at an overhead exchanger of a distillation column early on Thursday, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said. It affected an area of 1.5 metres (5 ft) by 4.0 metres and was brought under control within half an hour, the SCDF said. The industry source said the unit cools oil that comes out of the core CDUs and was being restarted after maintenance. Some exchangers are also used to pre-heat feedstock for crude units. STOP-WORK ORDER The 36-year-old plant, which processes mainly sour Middle East crude and sweet Asia Pacific grades, produces almost enough fuel to meet the total demand of Vietnam. It is one-half of Exxon Singapore's 605,000-bpd complex, the fourth-largest in Asia and particularly important as it exports fuel across the region. Even without CDU damage, oil traders feared a potentially extended closure at the plant as Singapore authorities investigate the deaths. The Singapore Ministry of Manpower has issued a partial stop-work order relating to all blinding work at the plant, which could be in place for weeks or months, a ministry spokeswoman said. The order will be in place until we determine that it is safe for them to resume work, she told Reuters, adding that the CDU would not be affected by the order if no blinding works are carried out in the unit. Blinding work prevents oil from flowing into the cooling exchangers during maintenance, but it was not immediately clear whether the CDU would be shut over the entire duration.  Exxon spokeswoman Ho declined to comment on whether the stop-work order applied to the CDU. In Japan, refiners must shut for at least a week in the event of a fatality. Ho said Exxon would continue to meet customer demand. Oil companies are often able to maintain supply lines by drawing down inventories or buying additional fuel from other parties.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) said on Thursday it agreed to acquire European mobile phone advertising company ScreenTonic to gain a foothold in the rapidly growing business for placing ads on mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, did not disclose the financial terms of the deal.

Investors in the start-up include venture capital firm 3i (III.L) and I-Source Gestion, according to ScreenTonic's Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobile phone advertising is still a nascent industry compared to Web advertising, but it is an area being targeted by Microsoft and Web rivals Google Inc.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Cyntia Barrera Diaz &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY May 2 (Reuters) - Hot women with potty mouths, a kick-fighting hero, ghosts and a hapless comedian are Televisa's prime time bets this year as the Mexican broadcaster debuts four new series for young audiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Using product placement and subjects like sex and drug trafficking, Televisa hopes to raise its profile among advertisers by luring in the coveted 18 to 44 demographic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In two weeks, the four new series -- of 13, half-hour episodes each -- will air on Televisa's Channel 5, which has national coverage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Additionally, Televisa will create side products, including comic books, exclusive behind-the-scenes content for the Internet, blogs, music and DVD sets based on the new series that will be sold through other business units. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Jose Baston, corporate vice-president of Televisa (TV.N) (TLVACPO.MX), told reporters on Wednesday that the new series will be offered to its U.S. partner Univision Communications Inc. (UVV.N) as part of the long-term programming deal they both share, which expires in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    However, the Internet content -- to be aired through a newly created site -- will be blocked to all U.S.-based visitors as the two companies have a pending legal fight regarding Televisa's right to air its content online in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Televisa failed to buy out Univision last year after losing a bidding war against a group of investors led by media mogul Haim Saban. The Mexican company recently sold its stake in its U.S. partner and got $1 billion for it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Televisa is also working on three other original series that it may debut on pay television later this year, Baston added. The company has a satellite television business, SKY, and a cable company, Cablevision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Baston said Televisa will hold the rights to all new shows and the idea is to sell them to other countries in Latin America, or the United States, in the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Breaking into the Anglo market is very difficult," Baston said. "But we have U.S. companies looking at scripts," he added without elaborating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    HOT PIZZA AND CAPOEIRA &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Sexo y Otros Secretos" (Sex and Other Secrets) puts women in the driver's seat. Five friends, including a single mom and the young lover of a man who is already spoken for, try to balance married life, or a lack of it, with family and jobs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Is it hot ... and hard?," asks one of the characters of a cute, clueless pizza delivery boy about half her age as she opens the door to pick up the order. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The show has a bit of "Sex and the City" and "Desperate Housewives" and will likely become the most talked-about show in a deeply Catholic, macho country where abortion and same-sex marriages were just recently legalized in the capital city. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Televisa's "Miedos" (Fears) plays with elements from "The Twilight Zone" and "CSI" by choosing gloomy, dark atmospheres where corpses, ghosts and unusual plot twists will keep viewers on tenterhooks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In "El Pantera" (The Panther), the broadcaster rescues the tradition of old-school heroes that use their wit and fists to fight the bad guys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The opening scenes of this series bring to mind "The Crow," as Pantera goes after Baboon, the drug dealer who brutally killed his girlfriend, using capoeira, the acrobatic Brazilian martial art he learned while serving time in jail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pantera widely addresses the problem of drug-trafficking, which has plagued Mexico and led to the gory deaths of over 900 people in the last four months, according to media reports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For comedy, Televisa picked "Y ahora ... que hago?" (Now what?), using Adal Ramones, the broadcaster's best-known funnyman, as the main character of the show. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Baston said all four series will be sandwiched between new episodes of well-known U.S. hit shows, like "House," "Nip/Tuck," "Heroes" and "Law and Order." This will guarantee the broadcaster, and advertisers, a solid audience for at least two hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  ((Editing by Christian Wiessner; Mexico City newsroom 5255 5281 7161, cyntia.barrera.reuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: TELEVISA SHOWS/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - IBM has developed a way to make microchips run up to one-third faster or use 15 percent less power by using an exotic material that "self-assembles" in a similar way to a seashell or snowflake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The computer services and technology company said the new process allows the wiring on a chip to be insulated with vacuum, replacing the glass-like substances used for decades but which have become less effective as chips steadily shrink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the latest achievement for IBM researchers, who have announced a number of advances in recent months allowing chips to get smaller despite challenges posed by physical laws at those tiny dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is one of the biggest breakthroughs I've seen in the last decade," said John Kelly, International Business Machines Corp.'s (IBM.N) senior vice president of technology and intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The holy grail of insulators is to use vacuum ... and we've broken the code on how to do this," Kelly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technique works by coating a silicon wafer with a layer of a special polymer that when baked, naturally forms trillions of uniformly tiny holes just 20 nanometers, or millionth of a millimeter, across.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting pattern is used to create the copper wiring on top of a chip and the insulating gaps that let electricity flow smoothly. A similar process is seen in nature during the formation of snowflakes, tooth enamel and seashells, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The problem they needed to solve was how to create lots of deep little wells in the insulation area between the wires," said Nathan Brookwood, who runs Insight 64, an industry consultancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Typically, whenever they tried, they ended up making a chip that was like Swiss cheese and had no mechanical integrity," Brookwood said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly said that while IBM plans to use the process in its chips in 2009, it has already made prototypes based on existing designs and it could employ the technique sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM will also "selectively license" the technology to partners, Kelly said. IBM has research efforts with No. 2 computer processor maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD.N), Japan's Toshiba Corp. (6502.T), and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, IBM said it had found a way to stack the components of a chip on top of each other, making them faster and more energy efficient by cutting the distance an electrical signal needs to travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, the company said it had solved a long-standing obstacle in drastically cutting electricity leakage in chips. That announcement -- made alongside a similar but separate one by Intel Corp. (INTC.O) -- was hailed as the biggest advances in transistor technology in four decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. hopes to develop a version of a $3 Windows software suite to run on low-cost laptops that a Massachusetts foundation wants to send to the world's poorest children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software, designed for youngsters in developing nations, is being tested on prototypes of small green-and-white laptops developed by the One Laptop Per Child Foundation, Microsoft corporate vice president Will Poole said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The non-profit project plans to start mass production in September of the so-called "XO" machines. They were designed specifically by the foundation to run on the Linux operating system and other open-source programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux is the main rival to Microsoft's Windows operating system. If the machines run only Linux, Microsoft will lose out on an opportunity to eventually expose tens of millions of children worldwide to its Windows system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Laptop Per Child, founded by Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist Nicholas Negroponte, is selling them at $176 apiece to governments, which will then distribute them to poor children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some governments have urged Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, to equip those machines with Windows software instead of Linux and other programs developed by the foundation, Poole told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're coming to us and saying, 'Hey.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Shares of Yahoo Inc.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) hopes to develop a version of a $3 Windows software suite to run on low-cost laptops that a Massachusetts foundation wants to send to the world's poorest children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software, designed for youngsters in developing nations, is being tested on prototypes of small green-and-white laptops developed by the One Laptop Per Child Foundation, Microsoft corporate vice president Will Poole said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The non-profit project plans to start mass production in September of the so-called "XO" machines. They were designed specifically by the foundation to run on the Linux operating system and other open-source programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux is the main rival to Microsoft's Windows operating system. If the machines run only Linux, Microsoft will lose out on an opportunity to eventually expose tens of millions of children worldwide to its Windows system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Laptop Per Child, founded by Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist Nicholas Negroponte, is selling them at $176 apiece to governments, which will then distribute them to poor children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some governments have urged Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, to equip those machines with Windows software instead of Linux and other programs developed by the foundation, Poole told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're coming to us and saying, 'Hey.

companies as it continues to gain market share and grow three
to four times faster than Microsoft and Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google's first quarter revenue grew 63 percent compared
with a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google agreed to buy DoubleClick Inc. last month for $3.1

customer when Microsoft decided to create its own ad system,
has been undergoing a major transition in its Web search
advertising business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It unveiled an upgraded system, Panama, in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts widely expect Yahoo's revenue, largely from ad

&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK (Hollywood Reporter) - For his second directorial 
effort, screenwriter Zak Penn ("X-Men: The Last Stand") uses an 
improvisational approach similar to his feature debut, 
"Incident at Loch Ness," with much more successful results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This ensemble comedy about a group of eccentric players 
competing in a multimillion-dollar poker match will inevitably 
be compared to the works of Christopher Guest, but what "The 
Grand" lacks in originality it more than makes up for with its 
high percentage of funny moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Penn, who co-wrote the script with Matt Bierman, has 
assembled a top-notch cast of comedic performers who seem to be 
having one hell of a time. Their enjoyment is infectious, and 
while some of the gags invariably go on for too long, for the 
most part the film is crisply paced and consistently 
uproarious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The central character is "One Eyed" Jack Faro (Woody 
Harrelson), who's lost the casino his grandfather left him 
because of his various addictions, not the least of which is to 
marriage. In order to gain it back from an addled real estate 
developer (Michael McKean), he enters a poker competition 
called "The Grand," the prize being $10 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To win, he must compete against a gallery of bizarre 
players, including Larry Schwartzman (David Cross), whose 
distraction techniques include wearing a burka; his sister, 
Lainie (Cheryl Hines), a profane Long Island housewife; LBJ 
"Deuce" Fairbanks (Dennis Farina), who longs for the good old 
days of breaking legs; Andy Andrews (Richard Kind), who 
garnered his spot at the table after winning an online game; 
Harold Melvin (Chris Parnell), a semi-autistic who lives with 
his elderly mother; "The German" (Werner Herzog), who needs to 
kill at least one animal a day; and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also on hand are such characters as Lainie's husband (Ray 
Romano), a "lightning survivor"; her father (sitcom star Gabe 
Kaplan, now a real-life player); and other competitors played 
in cameos by such figures as Hank Azaria, Jason Alexander and 
director Brett Ratner, among many others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Penn and Bierman have clearly allowed their performers to 
let loose, with mostly hilarious results. Their attempt to 
provide some emotional depth to the proceedings, with a subplot

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts with impact on supply)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Yaw Yan Chong and Felicia Loo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE May 4 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) is
expected to restart a 115,000 barrels per day (bpd) crude unit
at its offshore Singapore refinery in two to three weeks, after
it was shut following a fire on Thursday, industry sources
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. major is not expected to face any supply crisis
that could force it to declare force majeure, which allows it
to legally suspend supply contracts due to unforeseen events.
But it may still tighten the oil product markets slightly over
the next month or so, traders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Refinery sources and analysts say the affected crude
distillation unit (CDU) on Jurong Island does not produce much
diesel or gasoline, as it focuses on producing petrochemical
feedstocks and lubricants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Refinery expert Victor Shum from Purvin  Gertz said
although supply fears linger, they may not be as intense as
first thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a big deal that the fire killed two people but in
terms of oil products, the impact is minimal. They could easily
make up the production volume," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The simple refining processing unit churns out less than
20,000 bpd of diesel, compared to 360,000 bpd exported from
Singapore overall; and below 10,000 bpd of gasoline, against
290,000 bpd of exports, Shum added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon has not yet been seen seeking products in the spot
market, indicating that it has enough inventories to meet its
short-term commitments and that it does not expect the shutdown
to last too long, traders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The decision to restart the unit, the smaller of two CDUs
at the Pulau Ayer Chawan (PAC) facility, was made by Exxon's
management as it is not affected by a "stop-work" order issued
by Singapore authorities, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The CDU should not be down for more than two to three
weeks. The decision to stop its operation is mainly
precautionary and to ensure that there is nothing wrong with
the unit," one source familiar with refinery operations told
Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The problem is more of a mechanical issue -- on
maintenance work done on an external unit -- rather than one
involving processes of the CDU."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NO SUPPLY CRISIS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Exxon spokeswoman, who said a day earlier that the unit
"will not be started up until it is safe to do so", declined on
Friday to comment on the restart date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Singapore's Ministry of Manpower issued a partial stop-work
order, after the flash fire at one of the plant's cooling
exchangers, which left two workers dead and two injured, a
spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The order applied only to all blinding work in the plant,
which stops oil from flowing into the exchangers and is
performed during maintenance, and not to other operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sources said it was unlikely that any blinding work
will be done on the CDU itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The larger 185,000-bpd CDU at the Pulau Ayer Chawan complex
is unaffected by the fire. The complex is one half of Exxon's
refining facility in Singapore, totalling 605,000 bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second refining complex on mainland Singapore is due
for a 45-day maintenance in mid-June. Sources said it was
unlikely that the outage would force Exxon to defer the
turnaround.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon spokeswoman Eva Ho declined to comment on the planned
turnaround and whether it would be delayed to compensate for
any output losses from the outage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the CDU outage could curtail Exxon's ability to
stock up ahead of the turnaround as the mainland refinery
supplies mainly oil products, while the offshore facility
supplies Exxon's petrochemical facility on Jurong Island and
lubricants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traders said if Exxon was short on products, it could buy
spot cargoes, but it has not yet done so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Put it this way, there hasn't been a crisis yet in terms
of supply," a Singapore-based middle distillate trader said.
"The feeling in the market is that they are quite relaxed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The supply risk could tweak trade flows within the Pacific
Basin, particularly for middle distillates, another trader
said.
 Jet fuel could be diverted from Exxon's Japan refinery to
Australia, instead of deliveries to the U.S. West Coast, even
as the market was just starting to firm on an open arbitrage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traders said the tight fuel oil market for May could be
squeezed further, as Exxon is one of Asia's top suppliers with
500,000-600,000 tonnes of marine and fuel oil cargoes monthly.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON May 4 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures rose on Friday
after reports that Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) had intensified its
pursuit of a deal to take over search engine Yahoo Inc. (YHOO.O)
and investors geared up for the April U.S. employment report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The New York Post said on its website Microsoft, the world's
largest software company, had asked Yahoo to re-enter formal
talks. The two have held informal deal talks over the years, but
the latest approach signalled a new urgency on Microsoft's part,
the Post said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's rumours doing the rounds that Microsoft might be
looking at Yahoo ... that's going to be the main focus today,"
said one trader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo shares were trading up over 13 percent at 23.60 in
European trading hours, while Microsoft shares shed 0.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; June Dow Jones futures DJM7 were up 0.2 percent, while SP
futures SPM7 were up 0.1 percent and Nasdaq 100 futures NDM7
gained 0.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The April non-farm payrolls report is due at 1230 GMT and
analysts expect to see a rise of 100,000, compared with the
180,000 rise in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thursday's data on the U.S. services sector, first-quarter
productivity and weekly jobless claims came in strong enough to
push the Standard  Poor's 500 .SPX above 1,500 for the first
time since September 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI closed at a record
high for the third day in a row on Thursday, driven by gains in
Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ.N) on news the telecoms company
would take video and Internet customers from rival Cablevision
Systems (CVC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow ended up 29.50 points, or 0.2 percent, at 13,241.38
points, while the SP gained 6.47 points, or 0.4 percent, at
1,502.39. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 7.62 points,
or 0.3 percent, at 2,565.46.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blue chip shares might get a boost from Starbucks Corp.
(SBUX.O), which rallied after the bell on Thursday after the
coffee shop chain reported quarterly results that met
expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nabor Industries Inc. (NBR.N), the world's largest
land-based oil and gas driller, also rose in late trade after
reporting earnings that beat analysts' expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Corporate earnings due later in the session included
releases from Eastman Kodak Co. EK.N, forest products company
Weyerhaeuser Co. (WY.N), power company Public Service Enterprise
Group Inc. (PEG.N), Texas power and gas utility Centerpoint
Energy Inc. (CNP.N) and Apartment Investment and Management Co.
(AIV.N), one of the largest U.S. apartment landlords.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Shares of Yahoo Inc. (YHOO.O) 
soared as much as 19 percent to their highest level in nearly a 
year on Friday after two newspaper reports said the company and 
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) were in preliminary merger talks to 
take on common foe Google Inc. (GOOG.O)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; But the stock pulled back after contradictory reports said 
the two companies may work out a joint venture or another form 
of cooperation that would stop short of a full merger. A source 
close to the situation confirmed that any talks had cooled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street Journal initially said on Friday that the 
two companies had engaged in merger talks in recent months, but 
it said later that those talks were no longer active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York Post reported that Microsoft had made an offer 
to buy Yahoo a few months ago, but Yahoo spurned the advances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The paper, which put a price tag of $50 billion on a Yahoo 
takeover, said discussions continue between the two companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo's market value shot to $45 billion from $38 billion 
before the report. Microsoft is valued at a little more than 
$300 billion. Both companies declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's been talked about for a long time, ever since Google 
came into the picture. I can't imagine a more perfect deal," 
said Peter Lobravico, vice president of risk arbitrage 
sales/trading at brokerage Wall Street Access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In regular trading, Yahoo's stock rose nearly 10 percent to 
$30.98 on Nasdaq. Microsoft shares fell 1.3 percent to $30.56.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In extended trade, Yahoo shares fell to $30.57 and 
Microsoft rose to $30.58.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investment bank Goldman Sachs is advising on the process, 
the New York Post said. The bank declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One banking source said that investment banks had been 
pitching Microsoft on the idea of buying Yahoo for months.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THREAT FROM GOOGLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts often dismiss a takeover of Yahoo by Microsoft 
since the two companies have such different cultures and 
Microsoft usually prefers to buy small companies with 
interesting technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both companies are facing a serious threat from Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Web search leader is extending its lead on both 
companies as it continues to gain market share and grow three 
to four times faster than Microsoft and Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google's first quarter revenue grew 63 percent compared 
with a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google agreed to buy DoubleClick Inc. last month for $3.1 
billion, accelerating a push into display advertising market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company beat out Microsoft and Yahoo to win the deal, 
sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo CEO Terry Semel is scheduled to be in Seattle next 
week to speak at a Microsoft conference on online advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He will deliver a speech and then answer questions on stage 
from Joanne Bradford, Microsoft's chief media officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Microsoft decides to buy Yahoo, it would be the largest 
acquisition the company has ever undertaken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Up to now, its biggest purchase was a $1.33 billion deal in 
2002 to acquire Navision, a maker of business software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft investors said a deal looked to be a negative for 
the world's largest software maker at first glance, because it 
would be an admission that its recent investments in online 
services were a failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It might strike me as an act of desperation," said Todd 
Lowenstein, a co-portfolio manager for HighMark Capital 
Management's Value Momentum Fund. "Trying to go toe-to-toe with 
Google in search is not the best use of resources."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SUB-PAR GROWTH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo's revenue growth, which had been upward of 30 percent 
in recent years, tumbled in the first quarter to just 7 percent 
-- performance described by Goldman Sachs as "sub-par" growth 
for any big Internet stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo, which lost Microsoft as a key Web search advertising 
customer when Microsoft decided to create its own ad system, 
has been undergoing a major transition in its Web search 
advertising business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It unveiled an upgraded system, Panama, in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts widely expect Yahoo's revenue, largely from ad 
sales, to rebound to around 20 percent growth levels in the 
second half of 2007 -- similar to the growth rates of 
Microsoft's own online advertising business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Paritosh Bansal, Megan Davies and

&lt;p&gt;        (Adds man climbing down, UNHCR comment)          KHARTOUM, May 6 (Reuters) - An Iraqi man climbed a tall telecommunications antenna in Sudan and stayed there for 13 hours on Sunday to protest the U.N. refugee agency's refusal to send him to Canada.          Hesham Faleh, 20, climbed the 30-metre (98 foot) antenna at 3 a.m. (2400 GMT) carrying a Canadian flag, a bottle of water and a hat to protect him from Khartoum's scorching sun, his wife said.          He stepped down after more than 13 hours and turned himself over to Sudanese police, witnesses said.          Samira Youssef, 20, said her husband had fled Iraq after the fall of Baghdad in 2003. She said he has applied to be resettled in Canada through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) agency in Sudan.          On April 30, I got my rejection letter, said Youssef, an Eritrean refugee. And he got his on May 3. It was a shock for him, she added.          Youssef earlier told Reuters Faleh had climbed the antenna to attract attention to his problem.          Scores of onlookers gathered near the UNHCR offices to watch Faleh. At one point he took off his shirt and wrapped a blue rope around his neck, a Reuters photograph showed, in an apparent threat to hang himself.          Chrysantus Ache, the UNHCR representative in Sudan, said Faleh did not have a refugee status.          The United Nations says around 2 million Iraqis have been displaced inside the country since the invasion, while the others are being sheltered in neighbouring countries, mainly Syria and Jordan.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Wall Street expects second- quarter 
profits at The Walt Disney Co. to be about even with a year 
earlier, driven by movies such as "Wild Hogs" and strong ABC 
television advertising sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Total earnings are expected to rise, but the infusion of 
new shares from Disney's $7.4 billion all-stock acquisition of 
Pixar Animation Studio last April will dilute earnings per 
share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prime time television ratings this season are down at major 
networks, but several analysts have raised estimates for 
Disney's adjusted profit on the strong advertising sales, with 
the Wall Street consensus at 37 cents per share, in line with a 
year ago, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's movie studio has cut costs and recent moderate- 
budget movies have done well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deutsche Bank analyst Doug Mitchelson saw strong momentum 
across all Disney businesses and raised his second-quarter 
profit forecast thanks to buddy movie "Wild Hogs," which has 
taken in about $215.5 million worldwide, and on ABC prices in 
the spot buying, or scatter market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other analysts also mentioned the success of the relatively 
low-cost "Bridge to Terabithia" and a smaller film slate, as 
well as lower overhead from last summer's restructuring as 
possible reasons for wider margins at Walt Disney Studios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mitchelson also forecast that Pixar would reduce Disney 
earnings per share by 3 percent in the quarter due to the 
larger number of shares outstanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He reaffirmed a "buy" rating on Disney shares and a price 
target of $42, saying the company has shown its "terrific 
content cycle has legs (and) its favorable asset mix implies 
above-average growth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Disney spokesman declined to comment on earnings ahead of 
the company's announcements of its results, scheduled for 
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sanders Morris Harris analyst David Miller also inched up 
his earnings forecast for Disney in March, responding to what 
he described as "stronger-than-expected pricing strength in the 
network scatter market" at ABC prime time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ABC also appeared to be profiting from a bonanza in movie 
advertising for a summer's worth of blockbuster films, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miller said the company faces "very tough" year-over-year 
comparisons in the some or all of its business for the next 
five quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CIBC World Markets analyst Jason Helfstein also noted that 
Disney faces difficult comparisons at its broadcast, movie 
studio and parks divisions. He described the broadcast division 
as "the wild card" for the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is unclear whether weaker network ratings will impact 
this quarter's results, or (the third quarter)," Helfstein 
wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors may also be watching for the impact of a ticket 
price increase at theme parks and the effect of the Year of a 
Million Dreams promotion at Disney's theme parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs analyst Anthony Noto expects double digit 
segment operating income growth at all of Disney's businesses 
except Media Networks, which should see high single digit 
growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Noto, who has a buy rating on Disney, said Media Networks 
would be positively affected by the lack of Super Bowl and ESPN 
Mobile investments, as well as the start of its new TV deal 
with NASCAR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney shares were trading up 0.9 percent, or 32 cents, at 
$36.17 on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. said on Monday Dell Inc. had joined a business collaboration it had with Novell Inc. to allow open-source Linux software to work with Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move makes Dell the first major systems provider to join the Microsoft-Novell collaboration, which consists of a broad set of business and technological agreements to make their products work together better to serve corporate customers using both Linux and Windows computer servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the latest agreement, Dell will purchase Suse Linux Enterprise Server certificates, Microsoft said.

&lt;p&gt; (Corrects third paragraph to show $100 EPS target is for 2008,
not 2007)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 7 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs on Monday raised
its year-end target levels for the Standard  Poor's 500 index
.SPX by 3.2 percent because of the stronger-than-expected
pace of first-quarter corporate earnings growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Abby Joseph Cohen, Goldman's chief investment strategist,
also raised her target level for the Dow Jones industrial
average .DJI to 14,000 from 13,500, an increase of 3.7
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Supporting the raised forecast is the pace of corporate
profit growth, she said in a note to clients. Cohen raised her
target for aggregate SP earnings per share for the year to $93
from $92. For 2008, earnings should rise 7.5 percent from
year-end 2007 levels to $100 per share, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Profits are off to a stronger-than-expected start in
2007," Cohen said in her note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Late Monday morning, the SP 500 was up 0.21 percent at
1,508.79 and the Dow was up 0.20 percent at 13,290.68.

&lt;p&gt;  (Adds new ransom demand in paragraph 15) By Tom Ashby LAGOS, May 7 (Reuters) - Villagers with sticks and machetes staged a protest at a major U.S-operated oil production facility in Nigeria on Monday, forcing it to halt 42,000 barrels a day output, authorities said. It was the latest in a string of attacks on Western oil industry targets in the world's eighth largest exporter, which has curbed Nigerian output by a quarter and helped fuel a global oil price rally. The protest at the gates of Chevron's (CVX.N) Abiteye flow station in the western Niger Delta, which feeds the 160,000 barrel per day (bpd) Escravos export terminal, was triggered by alleged delays in compensation for an oil spill. There is a community protest. They are carrying sticks and machetes, but the place is full of government security forces who were drafted in over the weekend. The company has not lost control of the facility, a security source said. Chevron said 42,000 bpd in oil output was hit by the protest. Talks have already begun and the company expects the crisis to be resolved quickly, said spokesman Femi Odumabo. Community leaders and elders are very supportive of Chevron and they are intervening. I think it will be brought to a close today or tomorrow, he said. Spills are one source of constant friction between oil companies and communities in the Niger Delta, a vast wetlands region which is home to all of Nigeria's crude. Companies blame spills on criminal gangs illegally tapping oil from their pipelines, while communities blame the companies and often demand substantial compensation. Before Monday's dispute, unrest and militant attacks on oil facilities in other parts of the delta had already shut 652,000 bpd, or a quarter of the OPEC member nation's total capacity. London Brent crude oil futures were 78 cents lower at $64.53 a barrel. KIDNAPPINGS Kidnappings of foreign workers have also surged recently, with 28 foreigners abducted in six incidents in the last seven days alone. Eight have been released. Violence in the remote region of swamps and mangrove-lined creeks is fuelled by resentment against an industry that has extracted billions of dollars in five decades but left the majority in poverty without access to basic services such as electricity, water, schools and hospitals. The situation is compounded by endemic corruption in government, abuses by security forces and gang fighting linked to a lucrative trade in stolen crude oil. Militants fighting for more autonomy in the Niger Delta have also staged attacks and kidnapped foreigners, but most abductions are motivated by cash. Viktor Goncharov, counsellor at Russia's embassy in Nigeria, said kidnappers who seized a Belarussian woman had demanded $1.2 million for her release, according to Russian news reports. The Philippine government warned families of eight Filipinos and three South Koreans abducted last week against holding direct negotiations with their abductors. Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Esteban Conejos met families after one woman got a mobile phone call from her husband asking her to raise $1 million ransom for their safe release.

&lt;p&gt;SEOUL (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) said on Monday it has agreed to acquire a South Korean asset management firm, majority owned by Australia's Macquarie Bank MBL.AX, marking its first entry into the country's retail fund business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal, whose value was not disclosed, underscores growing interest from global financial services firms in the country's $250 billion asset management sector as retail assets are flowing into investment products from bank deposits for higher returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asset management is one of key financial services which South Korea wants to open up to foreign competition as part of efforts to build the country's financial clout in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This acquisition is a significant milestone for GSAM (Goldman Sachs Asset Management) in Korea, a growing financial hub with significant market potential, said Stephen Fitzgerald, head of GSAM International, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Through this acquisition, GSAM will establish a meaningful presence in Korea."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the deal, Goldman is buying 100 percent of Macquarie-IMM Investment Management, 65 percent owned by Macquarie and 35 percent by South Korea's investment firm IMM  Co. The fund manager has about 10 trillion won ($10.78 billion) in assets under management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the managed assets, the value of the acquisition is estimated at 120 billion-180 billion won, taking into account the valuations of the 2006 deals by Swiss investment banks UBS AG (UBSN.VX) and Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS agreed to pay up to $190 million for 51 percent of Hana Financial Group's (086790.KS) fund management unit that has 19.6 trillion won under management, while Credit Suisse paid $56 million for 30 percent of Woori Financial Group's (053000.KS) fund management arm that oversaw 14.2 trillion won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement comes after Reuters said on April 25 that the U.S. investment bank was finalizing talks to buy the asset manager, quoting two sources familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is expected to close later this year, subject to regulatory approval, Goldman said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATTRACTIVE OFFER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macquarie, the biggest foreign investment bank in South Korea, said Goldman's offer was too good to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were approached by Goldman," Macquarie spokesman John Larkin said. "The offer was quite attractive ... so we decided to accept the offer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 14 fund management firms controlled by foreign companies, Macquarie-IMM is a small-sized player with a pre-tax profit of 3.7 billion won in the nine months to December 2006, with a capital of 13 billion won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macquarie runs another asset management unit, Macquarie Shinhan Infrastructure Asset Management, with South Korea's No. 2 lender, Shinhan Financial Group (055550.KS). The joint venture is ranked the biggest foreign player by assets in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In South Korea, Goldman has been focused on businesses with corporate customers and private equity investment, including its 9 percent stake in Hana Financial, the country's No. 4 financial services group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facing stiff competition from strategic domestic rivals in private equity deals, foreign banks are turning to serving retail customers, targeting 1,500 trillion won in individual financial assets. According to the Bank of Korea, half of those funds have been put in deposits at end-2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement also comes ahead of the regulatory Financial Supervisory Service's review on Friday of JPMorgan's (JPM.N) final application to open the 50th asset management unit in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=927.3 Won)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian headmaster said on Monday a court has fined him half his monthly wage for using pirated copies of Microsoft (MSFT.O) software at his school in a case President Vladimir Putin has called "utter nonsense."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said Alexander Ponosov had violated Microsoft's property rights by allowing pupils to use 12 computers with unlicensed copies of Microsoft Windows and Office software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ponosov, a headmaster in a remote school in the Perm region of the Ural mountains, said he did not know the computers had fake licenses when they were delivered by a sub-contractor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia has been urged to crack down on the widespread availability of cheap pirated software, films and music as it prepares to enter the World Trade Organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illegal copies of Microsoft's Windows XP operating system are on sale for about $6 at Moscow markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian state television has portrayed Alexander Ponosov as a hero in a David-and-Goliath battle against the legal system and international corporations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today the court brought in a guilty verdict - they ordered me to pay a fine of 5,000 roubles ($194.4)," Ponosov told Reuters by telephone from the Perm region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I consider myself not guilty and I will file an appeal," he said, adding that he had not paid the fine. He said he earned about 10,000 roubles a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putin has described the case as "utter nonsense" and former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev even asked Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates to intercede on the teacher's behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February a local court threw out the case because it considered the losses to Microsoft to be insignificant but Ponosov appealed as he said he had not been found innocent. Prosecutors also appealed and the case was sent back to court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court found Ponosov had brought losses of 266,000 roubles on Microsoft, RIA news agency said, citing the judge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's biggest software maker, said it was the Russian authorities who started the proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our interest is not in prosecuting schools or teachers, it is in helping students develop the technology skills they need in the 21st century," the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mr. Ponosov's case was initiated by Russian authorities under Russian law. Microsoft neither initiated nor has any plans to bring any action against Mr. Ponosov," Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ponosov said he was being made an example of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Someone is defending corporate interests, someone is interested in not finding me innocent as they think that if I am found innocent then others will think they can get away with breaching intellectual property rights," Ponosov said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOGOTA May 8 (Reuters) - Colombia's cultivation of coca leaf used to manufacture cocaine decreased 9 percent last year, a preliminary United Nations study has found, according to a security source familiar with the figures. The United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime, which conducts a yearly satellite study with Colombian officials, last year reported 86,000 hectares (212,500 acres) of coca leaf cultivation in Colombia for 2005. The preliminary measure with the satellite system by the United Nations established a reduction of 9 percent in the area cultivated up to Dec. 31, 2006, said the source, who asked not to be identified because official figures are programmed to be released in June. A spokesman for the U.N drugs office in Colombia would not comment on the figures. Colombia remains the world's top producer of cocaine despite more than $4 billion in U.S. funding for coca leaf eradication and military and counter-narcotics aid to fight leftist rebels and drug traffickers. President Alvaro Uribe credits U.S. aid with helping slash violence in Colombia and reducing coca leaf in areas once awash with the crop, which has helped stoke the fighting between guerrillas and illegal right-wing paramilitaries. But some U.S. Democrats in Congress are questioning the success of so-called Plan Colombia and are reviewing whether future aid to the Andean country should focus less on military financing and more on alternative programs to ween coca farmers off the lucrative crop. Uribe is also under fire at home and from rights groups over a scandal linking some of his lawmaker allies to paramilitary warlords who have now disarmed, but who are accused of some of the worst atrocities in the conflict. U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration director Karen Tandy said in Spain on Tuesday that aid to Colombia had not driven up the price of cocaine on U.S. streets. Higher prices would be one indication that less of the drug was coming into the market.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Red Hat Inc. (RHT.N) and IBM (IBM.N) formed a partnership to develop, sell and support Red Hat's Linux software for IBM's mainframe computers, people familiar with the arrangement said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement, which the companies plan to announce at a Red Hat users conference that begins on Wednesday, applies to Linux software for International Business Machine Corp.'s System z mainframe computer systems, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of Linux software that is currently used on System z is from Red Hat's main rival, Novell Inc. NOVL.O&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's partnership with Red Hat is an endorsement of advances that the software maker has made in adapting its technology for use by large institutions, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's potentially a huge credibility gain for Red Hat," said Trip Chowdhry, an analyst with Global Technology Research. "It shows that Red Hat is enterprise class."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM and Red Hat declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM and Novell have long worked together on developing, selling and servicing Novell's SUSE version of the Linux operating system for use on IBM's System z computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IBM, Red Hat tie-up creates a similar cooperation. They form a joint engineering team to expand the capabilities of the Linux software, including enhancing security on the mainframe computers, according to the people familiar with their plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mainframes are used to run computer systems that are critical to the functioning and security of banks, stock exchanges, government agencies, and other large institutions that crunch large amounts of data, which is often sensitive in nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red Hat and Novell are urging businesses to adopt their versions of Linux across their entire computer networks - from desktop computers to servers and mainframe computers. They say that doing so will save their staff the trouble of having to learn to work with more than one set of computer code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red Hat already works closely with IBM to market its software on the computer maker's smaller systems. But until now Novell has enjoyed preferred status when it comes to selling software for IBM's mainframe computers, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Novell has been the de facto choice on IBM's System z mainframes," said Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux is the most popular type of so-called open-source software, a movement begun as a grass-roots approach to development of computer programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Varying versions of the operating system are available from dozens of sources. While they're all based on the same core code, which is known as the Linux kernel, most are not compatible with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Novell introduced a desktop version of SUSE Linux at the same time as it launched upgrades to packages for more powerful computers. It also released software to make it easier for a company's IT staff to make all of those computers work together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our 'desktop to data center' strategy and solutions for Linux in the enterprise have resonated well with clients," said Novell Senior Vice President Roger Levy. "We are not surprised to see Red Hat attempt to adopt our positioning and challenge our success in the enterprise."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co. (DIS.N) on Tuesday posted a net profit ahead of Wall Street targets thanks to strong performances from ESPN and movies like "Wild Hogs," but revenue lagged estimates and its shares fell 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lower costs at the studio, which cut jobs last summer and produced fewer films, and television network ABC, which had the expensive-to-produce Super Bowl last year, helped the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney reported a net profit of $931 million, or 44 cents per share, compared with $733 million, or 37 cents per share, in last year's second quarter. Revenue rose to $8.07 billion from $8.03 billion a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts, on average, had expected net earnings of 36 cents per share and revenue of $8.1 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanders Morris Harris analyst David Miller said the No. 3 U.S. entertainment company appeared to make up for the flat revenue at the operating income level by containing costs, particularly in movie making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The studio was flush, especially since they didn't have a lot of product in the March quarter," Miller said. "For the media networks, the operating income was outstanding."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swing factors for the studio this quarter include the box office performances of "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" and "Ratatouille."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profit rose in all four Disney divisions last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studio revenue was down 13 percent from last year, when the company had more theatrical releases and benefited from the international theatrical releases of "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" and "Chicken Little."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But operating profit at the division improved by 60 percent as moderately budgeted films like middle-aged motorbike comedy "Wild Hogs" and fantasy adventure "Bridge to Terabithia" did well at worldwide box offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenues for Media, the largest contributor to Disney operating income, were flat in the quarter from last year's second quarter, when the ABC network benefited from advertising revenue from the Super Bowl and some college football games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet with costs also down due to the absence of all the football, and growth at sports network ESPN and international Disney Channels, segment operating income grew 21 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABC benefited from higher prices for spot advertising, which helped overcome the effect of lower ratings. Prices for spot ad sales are running double-digit percentages ahead of last year's third quarter, Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger told analysts the current television advertising market looks strong, which should contribute to successful upfront sales later this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CARS" MERCHANDISE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consumer products division posted 14 percent revenue growth for the quarter and a 20 percent rise in operating income due to growth in royalties from "Cars" merchandise and other products. Disney's video game studio also contributed more revenue thanks to publishing more company-owned titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parks and resorts division saw revenue grow 9 percent while operating income grew 19 percent due to higher ticket prices and average room rates as well as higher guest spending. All parks but Hong Kong Disneyland saw growth.

&lt;p&gt; (Updates share price, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Gina Keating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES May 8 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co. (DIS.N) on
Tuesday posted a net profit ahead of Wall Street targets thanks
to strong performances from ESPN and movies like "Wild Hogs,"
but revenue lagged estimates and its shares fell 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lower costs at the studio, which cut jobs last summer and
produced fewer films, and television network ABC, which had the
expensive-to-produce Super Bowl last year, helped the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney reported a net profit of $931 million, or 44 cents
per share, compared with $733 million, or 37 cents per share,
in last year's second quarter. Revenue rose to $8.07 billion
from $8.03 billion a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts, on average, had expected net earnings of 36 cents
per share and revenue of $8.1 billion, according to Reuters
Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sanders Morris Harris analyst David Miller said the No. 3
U.S. entertainment company appeared to make up for the flat
revenue at the operating income level by containing costs,
particularly in movie making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The studio was flush, especially since they didn't have a
lot of product in the March quarter," Miller said. "For the
media networks, the operating income was outstanding."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Swing factors for the studio this quarter include the box
office performances of "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's
End" and "Ratatouille."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Profit rose in all four Disney divisions last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Studio revenue was down 13 percent from last year, when the
company had more theatrical releases and benefited from the
international theatrical releases of "The Chronicles of Narnia:
The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" and "Chicken Little."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But operating profit at the division improved by 60 percent
as moderately budgeted films like middle-aged motorbike comedy
"Wild Hogs" and fantasy adventure "Bridge to Terabithia" did
well at worldwide box offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenues for Media, the largest contributor to Disney
operating income, were flat in the quarter from last year's
second quarter, when the ABC network benefited from advertising
revenue from the Super Bowl and some college football games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet with costs also down due to the absence of all the
football, and growth at sports network ESPN and international
Disney Channels, segment operating income grew 21 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ABC benefited from higher prices for spot advertising,
which helped overcome the effect of lower ratings. Prices for
spot ad sales are running double-digit percentages ahead of
last year's third quarter, Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger told analysts the current
television advertising market looks strong, which should
contribute to successful upfront sales later this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "CARS" MERCHANDISE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The consumer products division posted 14 percent revenue
growth for the quarter and a 20 percent rise in operating
income due to growth in royalties from "Cars" merchandise and
other products. Disney's video game studio also contributed
more revenue thanks to publishing more company-owned titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The parks and resorts division saw revenue grow 9 percent
while operating income grew 19 percent due to higher ticket
prices and average room rates as well as higher guest spending.
All parks but Hong Kong Disneyland saw growth. The Walt Disney
World Resort set an Easter attendance record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs said domestic parks room reservations for the rest
of the year were slightly ahead of the year before, with
greater strength in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs said even with the latest "Pirates" movie coming
out, the studio division faces tough comparisons in the current
quarter versus last year, when Disney released the "Narnia"
DVD, one of the year's top DVD releases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prudential Equity Group analyst Katherine Styponias said in
a note she expects Disney profit growth to continue due to its
summer movie slate, strength at ESPN and ABC, and lower costs
at its studio division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney shares slipped $35.82 in after-hours trade after
closing on Tuesday at $36.55 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock was trading at a multiple of 17.8 times forecast
2008 earnings. Viacom Inc. VIAb.N was trading at 16 times
2008 earnings and Time Warner Inc. (TWX.N) at 18.6 times.

&lt;p&gt; (Updates with comment from Goldman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 8 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) has taken
a minority investment stake in Medley Global Advisors, the
influential financial markets consultancy said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hudson Street Services, a unit of Goldman, will act as a
sales agent for Medley, introducing its institutional clients
to the company's research on economics, financial markets and
regulatory policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's really a kind of outsourced sales team for us, and
the fact that it's Goldman is very attractive to us," said
Sassan Ghahramani, chief executive officer of MGA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ghahramani declined to specify the size of Goldman's stake,
which puts the investment bank together with current owners
Boston Ventures, Castanea Partners, and MGA management. Goldman
also said it would not disclose the size of the investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The investment bank set up Hudson Street in January, aiming
to take minority stakes in a number of "platform members" such
as MGA, and earning distribution fees for helping those members
find clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many of these clients are looking for content to boost
their own research divisions. Goldman is aiming to tie up with
10 to 12 partners and has already attracted content providers
Investars, ASSET4, Connotate and iSuppli, said Ed Canaday,
spokesman for Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Medley, which was established by its founder, Richard
Medley, a decade ago in New York City, keeps tight control over
the distribution of its research, aimed at investment banks,
asset managers and hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's closely followed research and secretive
nature have given it a cachet in financial markets that is
above and beyond the firm's relatively small size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Medley's Ghahramani said that the advisory firm was also
boosting its research in energy and emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MGA has hired Michael Schetzel, a former strategist for the
hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, and Gustavo Rangel from
Barclays Capital's emerging markets group to strengthen its
coverage, the company said in a statement.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By David Lawsky &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS May 8 (Reuters) - A former U.S. justice official who tried to break up Microsoft (MSFT.O) seven years ago has urged the European Commission to tread cautiously if it tries to do the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    European Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes, frustrated by what she sees as its defiance of the law, recently raised the question of whether the U.S. software giant should be broken up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But one of the American architects of a previous break-up bid says Europeans should proceed cautiously, if at all. So far there are no indications that could happen, and experts consider it unlikely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The European Commission, Europe's top antitrust regulator, has never broken up a company for abusing its market dominance, although it has required major divestments by firms seeking permission to merge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The former U.S. official and other legal experts say the EU executive could theoretically impose such a solution on Microsoft as the price of doing business in Europe.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But that does not necessarily make it the right move to address Europe's antitrust concerns, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "At some point piling on and bringing redundant proceedings is not in the interest of sound law enforcement," said the former official, who asked not to be identified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In addition, the remedy must be tailored to the problem. The former official, who served under President Bill Clinton before 2001, said the Justice Department's approach "wasn't designed to diminish market power" but to restructure the company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In other words, the aim was not to punish Microsoft but to fix the problem of lack of competition. Microsoft, of course, did not see it that way and opposed a break-up, which was abandoned under President George W. Bush in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Justice Department consultants who backed a break-up argued that shareholder value would remain stable but Microsoft would be unlikely to act in an anti-competitive manner again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Their analyses are still available on the Justice Department Website, at www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/f219100/219130.htm and www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/f219100/219129.htm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The problem of changing Microsoft's behaviour is at the heart of Kroes's concerns. Unlike the United States, which fined Microsoft nothing, the EU has fined the company 781 million euros ($1.063 billion) with the prospect of more to come. But it has not helped. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We have never before encountered a company that has refused to comply with a Commission decision", she said on April 20. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For that reason, Kroes raised the possibility of a "structural remedy" -- antitrust jargon for a break-up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft says it has "done everything humanly possible to comply" with the Commission's decision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Kroes said that she had the authority to act, but has given no indication she will do so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Commission's authority over Microsoft is under challenge in the European Union courts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft has appealed against the European Commission's 2004 decision to fine it and make it change its business practices, and the EU Court of First Instance in Luxembourg is due to rule on the case later this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In the United States, a lower court judge ordered the Microsoft split in 2000 but this was overturned on appeal the following year, partly because he failed to conduct hearings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately allowed the most serious charges in America to stick, even if the remedy did not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Paul Bolding; Reuters messaging david.lawsky.reuters.com@reuters.net; e-mail david.lawsky@reuters.com; +322-287-6811.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - U.S. computer firm IBM (IBM.N) on Tuesday was further shedding its stake in number-three global PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd. (0992.HK), selling up to $85 million worth of shares at a discount of 4-6.7 percent to the stock's Tuesday close, according to a term sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. company was selling 223 million Lenovo shares, or roughly one-third of its remaining holding, at a range of HK$2.92-HK$3.00 each in a deal handled by Citigroup (C.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo shares dipped 0.32 percent on Tuesday to close at HK$3.13 each before the share sale hit the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday's share sale follows a similar move in February, when IBM, Lenovo's second largest shareholder after the Chinese government, raised US$123 million by selling 300 million shares at HK$3.20 each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM held about 7.4 percent of Lenovo before Tuesday's sale. It acquired its Lenovo stake at HK$2.675 a share when the Chinese firm bought IBM's ailing PC arm for US$1.25 billion in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under that deal, IBM hade been entitled to sell a third of its shares every year between May 2006 and May 2008. But it struck a deal last year that allowed it to exit its holding by November 2007 -- six months earlier than previously agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Lenovo have dipped by 3 percent over the last three months and are up by 10 percent in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(US$=HK$7.8)&lt;/p&gt;

Tuesday it had yet to restore 42,000 barrels per day of Nigerian
oil output shut by a community protest and remained in talks to
resolve the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "For safety reasons, we are still shut in this morning. We
are yet to understand all the issues, but we are having very
progressive discussions with the communities," spokesman Michael
Barrett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Villagers with sticks and machetes staged the protest at
Chevron's (CVX.N) Abiteye flow station in the western Niger
Delta on Monday, forcing the company to halt 42,000 bpd of
output.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, comments, updates index prices) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 7 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs on Monday raised its year-end target levels for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index .SPX by 3.2 percent because of the stronger-than-expected pace of first-quarter corporate earnings growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Abby Joseph Cohen, Goldman's chief investment strategist, said she now expects the S to finish the year at 1,600, up from a previous target of 1,550. That suggests that the S, the U.S. stock index most widely followed by equity market professionals, will notch a gain of 12.8 percent in 2007 after ending 2006 at 1,418.3. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The S, which rose 13.62 percent in 2006, is up 6.4 percent year to date. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Cohen, who said chances for recession is low through 2008, also raised her target level for the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI to 14,000 from 13,500, an increase of 3.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The pace of corporate profit growth supports the raised forecast, she said in a note to clients. Cohen raised her target for aggregate S earnings per share for the year to $93 from $92. For 2008, earnings should rise 7.5 percent from year-end 2007 levels to $100 per share, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We believe that recession is unlikely during the forecast horizon that extends through year-end 2008, and this bodes well for equities," Cohen said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Strength in exports, linked to improved economic conditions among senior trade partners, works to the benefit of the companies in the S 500, many of which have substantial multinational operations," Cohen said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Late Monday morning, the S 500 was up 0.26 percent at 1,509.51 and the Dow was up 0.30 percent at 13,304.52. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Dan Burns, Wall Street Newsdesk, Editing by Tom Hals, 646 223-6110)) Keywords: USA STOCKS/GOLDMAN  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

part of a defunct United Nations program, the New York Times

"regarding the oil-for-food program generally, Chevron purchased
Iraqi crude oil principally for use in its U.S. refineries, and
the United Nations approved the initial sale of all cargoes
ultimately purchased by Chevron."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper cited the spokesman as saying that Chevron had
cooperated with inquiries into the program would continue to do
so.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds Macquarie comment, background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Kim Yeon-hee &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SEOUL, May 7 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) said on Monday it has agreed to acquire a South Korean asset management firm, majority owned by Australia's Macquarie Bank MBL.AX, marking its first entry into the country's retail fund business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The deal, whose value was not disclosed, underscores growing interest from global financial services firms in the country's $250 billion asset management sector as retail assets are flowing into investment products from bank deposits for higher returns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Asset management is one of key financial services which South Korea wants to open up to foreign competition as part of efforts to build the country's financial clout in Asia.  "This acquisition is a significant milestone for GSAM &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Goldman Sachs Asset Management) in Korea, a growing financial hub with significant market potential, said Stephen Fitzgerald, head of GSAM International, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Through this acquisition, GSAM will establish a meaningful presence in Korea." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Under the deal, Goldman is buying 100 percent of Macquarie-IMM Investment Management, 65 percent owned by Macquarie and 35 percent by South Korea's investment firm IMM &amp; Co. The fund manager has about 10 trillion won ($10.78 billion) in assets under management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Based on the managed assets, the value of the acquisition is estimated at 120 billion-180 billion won, taking into account the valuations of the 2006 deals by Swiss investment banks UBS AG (UBSN.VX) and Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) in South Korea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    UBS agreed to pay up to $190 million for 51 percent of Hana Financial Group's (086790.KS) fund management unit that has 19.6 trillion won under management, while Credit Suisse paid $56 million for 30 percent of Woori Financial Group's (053000.KS) fund management arm that oversaw 14.2 trillion won. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The announcement comes after Reuters said on April 25 that the U.S. investment bank was finalising talks to buy the asset manager, quoting two sources familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The deal is expected to close later this year, subject to regulatory approval, Goldman said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ATTRACTIVE OFFER &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Macquarie, the biggest foreign investment bank in South Korea, said Goldman's offer was too good to ignore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We were approached by Goldman," Macquarie spokesman John Larkin said. "The offer was quite attractive ... so we decided to accept the offer." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Among 14 fund management firms controlled by foreign companies, Macquarie-IMM is a small-sized player with a pre-tax profit of 3.7 billion won in the nine months to December 2006, with a capital of 13 billion won. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Macquarie runs another asset management unit, Macquarie Shinhan Infrastructure Asset Management, with South Korea's No. 2 lender, Shinhan Financial Group (055550.KS). The joint venture is ranked the biggest foreign player by assets in the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In South Korea, Goldman has been focused on businesses with corporate customers and private equity investment, including its 9 percent stake in Hana Financial, the country's No. 4 financial services group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Facing stiff competition from strategic domestic rivals in private equity deals, foreign banks are turning to serving retail customers, targeting 1,500 trillion won in individual financial assets. According to the Bank of Korea, half of those funds have been put in deposits at end-2006. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The announcement also comes ahead of the regulatory Financial Supervisory Service's review on Friday of JPMorgan's (JPM.N) final application to open the 50th asset management unit in South Korea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=927.3 Won) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Sei Chong &amp; Jean Yoon; yeonhee.kim@reuters.com; Reuters Messaging: yeonhee.kim.reuters.com@reuters.net;+82-2-3704-5646)) Keywords: GOLDMAN MACQUARIE/  .

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Gina Keating &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES May 7 (Reuters) - Wall Street expects second- quarter profits at The Walt Disney Co. (DIS.N) to be about even with a year earlier, driven by movies such as "Wild Hogs" and strong ABC television advertising sales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Total earnings are expected to rise, but the infusion of new shares from Disney's $7.4 billion all-stock acquisition of Pixar Animation Studio last April will dilute earnings per share. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Prime time television ratings this season are down at major networks, but several analysts have raised estimates for Disney's adjusted profit on the strong advertising sales, with the Wall Street consensus at 37 cents per share, in line with a year ago, according to Reuters Estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Disney's movie studio has cut costs and recent moderate- budget movies have done well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Deutsche Bank analyst Doug Mitchelson saw strong momentum across all Disney businesses and raised his second-quarter profit forecast thanks to buddy movie "Wild Hogs," which has taken in about $215.5 million worldwide, and on ABC prices in the spot buying, or scatter market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Other analysts also mentioned the success of the relatively low-cost "Bridge to Terabithia" and a smaller film slate, as well as lower overhead from last summer's restructuring as possible reasons for wider margins at Walt Disney Studios. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Mitchelson also forecast that Pixar would reduce Disney earnings per share by 3 percent in the quarter due to the larger number of shares outstanding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He reaffirmed a "buy" rating on Disney shares and a price target of $42, saying the company has shown its "terrific content cycle has legs (and) its favorable asset mix implies above-average growth." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A Disney spokesman declined to comment on earnings ahead of the company's announcements of its results, scheduled for Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Sanders Morris Harris analyst David Miller also inched up his earnings forecast for Disney in March, responding to what he described as "stronger-than-expected pricing strength in the network scatter market" at ABC prime time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ABC also appeared to be profiting from a bonanza in movie advertising for a summer's worth of blockbuster films, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Miller said the company faces "very tough" year-over-year comparisons in the some or all of its business for the next five quarters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    CIBC World Markets analyst Jason Helfstein also noted that Disney faces difficult comparisons at its broadcast, movie studio and parks divisions. He described the broadcast division as "the wild card" for the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It is unclear whether weaker network ratings will impact this quarter's results, or (the third quarter)," Helfstein wrote in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Investors may also be watching for the impact of a ticket price increase at theme parks and the effect of the Year of a Million Dreams promotion at Disney's theme parks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman Sachs analyst Anthony Noto expects double digit segment operating income growth at all of Disney's businesses except Media Networks, which should see high single digit growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Noto, who has a buy rating on Disney, said Media Networks would be positively affected by the lack of Super Bowl and ESPN Mobile investments, as well as the start of its new TV deal with NASCAR. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Disney shares were trading up 0.9 percent, or 32 cents, at $36.17 on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;((Reporting by Gina Keating, editing by Andre Grenon; Reuters Messaging: gina.keating.reuters.com@reuters.net +1 213 955 6776)) Keywords: DISNEY EARNINGS/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) looked at possible acquisitions to gain a foothold in the market for so-called business intelligence software, but decided to build its own business and compete on price against industry leaders, the company's business division president said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of an acquisition, Microsoft is banking on the popularity of its SQL Server database management software and its Office suite of applications to win over customers looking for software to help companies track business performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've never been opposed to the idea of looking at players in the industry. We've looked, to be quite honest," Jeff Raikes, president of Microsoft's business division, said in an interview. "We just thought organic development would get us to the real solution faster."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's business software competitors, Oracle Corp. ORCL.O and SAP AG (SAPG.DE), have recently announced acquisitions within the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAP said on Tuesday it would buy privately held OutlookSoft Corp., a company that helps chief financial officers budget and forecast. A source familiar with the acquisition said SAP paid about $500 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, Oracle said it would pay $3.3 billion to buy Hyperion Solutions Corp, which competes with Business Objects BOBJ.OBOBJ.PA and Cognos CSN.TO in the market for software that helps companies sift through data to detect trends and other information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's vision is for SQL Server software to help companies sort through databases while Office applications like Excel spreadsheets or SharePoint collaboration software would help workers find trends in data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is testing a new product called PerformancePoint Server 2007, which adds programs like budgeting, forecasting, performance management to Office applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The product is expected to be ready for launch in the second half of 2007. Microsoft said it would also unveil a new version of SQL Server software in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raikes said Microsoft business intelligence products would cost much less than competing software, meaning companies could afford to let more people get access to the software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The cost of our solutions will be a quarter of the traditional solutions," said Raikes, who delivered a speech at the company's first business intelligence conference. "The economics are going to get transformed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it sees sales for the entire business intelligence marketing shrinking even as more people use the software, because its products will be so discounted compared to existing offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SANTA CLARA, California (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. sees mergers as a way to fill gaps or enter new markets, mostly via small deals, but larger deals are also "conceivable," Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have not, by default, opted for acquisitions as part of our strategy ... but we don't count them out either," he said. "In general, though (we focus on) smaller deals, we are open to large acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the Software 2007 conference in Silicon Valley, Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT.O) leader said the world's biggest software company remains focused on organic growth and sees acquisitions typically as a way to fill holes in its business strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an onstage interview with Software 2007 conference organizer M.R. Rangaswami, Ballmer declined to comment directly on whether he was interested in acquisitions in the $40 billion to $50 billion range -- a reference to a possible deal to acquire Yahoo Inc. (YHOO.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question was a backhanded reference to news reports last Friday that Microsoft has once again approached Yahoo for a potential merger or partnership deal to help the companies better compete with rival Google Inc. (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anything is conceivable," Ballmer replied, noting that he would decline to comment specifically on any potential deal-making as a matter of policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Typically we do not do large (deals) relative to our overall size," Ballmer said. (We do deals) to fit into what we are doing or as platforms to us into whole new businesses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last 12 months, the Redmond, Washington-based company acquired 15 to 20 companies, Ballmer told an audience of several hundred business software executives. He pointed to the 2000 acquisition of Great Plains Software, which propelled Microsoft into the business planning software market, as an example of using a merger to thrust itself into a new market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think you should expect that most of our growth should come from buying large companies and taking costs out," Ballmer said, adding that such cost-reduction strategies are useful in slow-growing, more mature industries, but not software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, comment, byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Cyntia Barrera Diaz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY May 9 (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster Televisa
said on Wednesday its cable unit, Cablevision, has obtained a
concession to operate fixed-line telephone services, a first
for a national television company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Cablevision expects to start fixed-line phone services in
the third quarter of 2007," Televisa (TV.N)(TLVACPO.MX) said in
a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cablevision, which only has coverage in the Mexico City
area, has over one-half million subscribers. It will use its
existing broadband network, which offers cable television and
Internet access, to deliver phone services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Phone service through broad band networks could be a
lucrative venture for Televisa, some experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is a business that usually has high profitability
margins. It starts as a small enterprise, but since it has no
additional high costs, the company's profitability can improve
dramatically," said analyst Martin Lara at Santander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cablevision will tap the market of Telefonos de Mexico
(Telmex), but analysts believe it will not represent a serious
threat to the leading fixed-line telephone service provider in
the near or mid term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Telmex TMX.NTELMEXL.MX ended March with slightly over
18 million fixed lines in Mexico. The company, owned by Carlos
Slim, the world's second-richest man, launched in February a
platform that offers television via the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa wants to stretch its reach in the so-called
"triple play" market -- which comprises Internet, video and
phone services in single broad band connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has an option to purchase a 49 percent stake in
Cablemas, one of Mexico's largest cable operators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In February, the country's competition watchdog set several
conditions for Televisa to meet if it wanted to buy another
stake in Monterrey-based cable company Television
Internacional, or TVI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government hopes that a growing number of "triple play"
providers will improve media competition in Mexico, leading to
lower prices and better services for customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More than half of Mexico's 103 million people lack access
to basic phone services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa shares rose 0.51 percent to close at 62.76 pesos
on Wednesday and its New York-traded shares gained 1.43 percent
to $29.11.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comment, details.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSTON May 9 (Reuters) - Red Hat Inc. (RHT.N) said on Wednesday it formed a partnership with IBM (IBM.N) to develop and sell software for mainframe computers, in what analysts said was a blow to chief rival Novell Inc. NOVL.O &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The agreement covers versions of Red Hat's Linux operating system, which computing giant International Business Machines Corp. has agreed to promote for use on System z, its most powerful line of business computers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "This is a competitive win for Red Hat," said Trip Chowdhry, an analyst with Global Equities Research. "It shows that Red Hat is getting closer to IBM." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For several years, IBM has had a similar arrangement with Novell, which provides the vast majority of Linux software currently used on IBM's mainframe computers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts say the absence of such a relationship with Red Hat has meant that, until now, Novell's SUSE Linux has been the de facto choice of IBM customers wanting to run their mainframe computers on the Linux operating system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    They say the vast majority of IBM's System z Linux clients use Novell's software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Now there are some deals that Novell is not going to get because Red Hat is going to get them instead," said Jefferies &amp; Co. analyst Katherine Egbert." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Red Hat and IBM say their engineers will join forces to identify and address areas where they can make their products more attractive to specific types of clients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    One area where that might make a difference is with government agencies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM and Red Hat say they have already assembled a team of engineers that have worked together to develop technology that ensures classified data is only made accessible to people with proper security clearances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Linux is the most popular type of open-source software, a movement begun as a grass-roots approach to developing computer programs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Varying versions of the operating system are available from dozens of sources. While they are all based on the same core code, which is known as the Linux kernel, most are not compatible with each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    People familiar with the new Red Hat-IBM partnership told Reuters on Tuesday the companies would announce a deal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    When asked for comment on Tuesday, Novell Senior Vice President Roger Levy said: "Our 'desktop to data center' strategy and solutions for Linux in the enterprise have resonated well with clients ...

&lt;p&gt;WARSAW (Reuters) - Polish officials have almost finished negotiations with the United States on dropping a visa requirement for Poles, a top adviser to President Lech Kaczynski said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Whether it is sooner or later, the visas for Poles to visit the United States will definitely be withdrawn," Elzbieta Jakubiak, Kaczynski's adviser for foreign affairs, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight ex-communist countries that joined the European Union in 2004 have long pressed Washington to include their citizens in a visa waiver program enjoyed by western European states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poland and the Czech Republic sent troops to Iraq and are considering hosting parts of a U.S. missile defense shield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jakubiak, who visited Washington this week, said Polish and U.S. officials were wrapping up talks on ending the visa regime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. President George Bush said in November he wanted to ease travel restrictions for citizens of central and eastern Europe.

&lt;p&gt;MANILA (Reuters) - U.S. energy company Chevron Corp. (CVX.N) has sold its liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) retail business unit in the Philippines to Petron Corp. (PCOR.PS), the two firms said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The transfer entails the integration and re-imaging of the LPG dealership network of Chevron into Petron's Gasul dealer network and rebranding of the LPG cylinders within a period of two years," Petron told the local stock exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petron officials declined to disclose how much they paid for the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petron, 40 percent owned each by the Philippine government and Saudi Aramco, accounts for 37 percent of the local retail LPG market, Virginia Ruivivar, the firm's public affairs manager, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron Philippines Inc. accounts for 8 percent of the local retail market for LPG, which is mostly used as cooking gas in the country, Ruivivar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Philippines consumed last year about 11 million barrels of LPG, including that used for cooking gas, for industrial uses and as motor fuel, an industry source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Randy Johnson, country chairman of Chevron Philippines, said his firm's divestment of its LPG business was part of its strategy to focus on its core business of marketing and distributing motor fuels and lubricants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron Philippines, formerly Caltex (Philippines) Inc., closed its 72,000-barrel-per-day refinery in the country in late 2003 and converted the facility into a storage depot for petroleum products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm has said its 49-year-old refinery was too small to compete in the Asian market and too outdated to produce cleaner fuels required under Philippine environmental laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petron is the country's biggest oil refiner with a rated capacity of 180,000 barrels of oil per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds comment from analysts and Novell, background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Jim Finkle &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    BOSTON, May 8 (Reuters) - Red Hat Inc. (RHT.N) and IBM (IBM.N) formed a partnership to develop, sell and support Red Hat's Linux software for IBM's mainframe computers, people familiar with the arrangement said on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The agreement, which the companies plan to announce at a Red Hat users conference that begins on Wednesday, applies to Linux software for International Business Machine Corp.'s System z mainframe computer systems, the sources said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The vast majority of Linux software that is currently used on System z is from Red Hat's main rival, Novell Inc. NOVL.O &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM's partnership with Red Hat is an endorsement of advances that the software maker has made in adapting its technology for use by large institutions, analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It's potentially a huge credibility gain for Red Hat," said Trip Chowdhry, an analyst with Global Technology Research. "It shows that Red Hat is enterprise class." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM and Red Hat declined comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM and Novell have long worked together on developing, selling and servicing Novell's SUSE version of the Linux operating system for use on IBM's System z computers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The IBM, Red Hat tie-up creates a similar cooperation. They form a joint engineering team to expand the capabilities of the Linux software, including enhancing security on the mainframe computers, according to the people familiar with their plans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Mainframes are used to run computer systems that are critical to the functioning and security of banks, stock exchanges, government agencies, and other large institutions that crunch large amounts of data, which is often sensitive in nature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Red Hat and Novell are urging businesses to adopt their versions of Linux across their entire computer networks - from desktop computers to servers and mainframe computers. They say that doing so will save their staff the trouble of having to learn to work with more than one set of computer code.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Red Hat already works closely with IBM to market its software on the computer maker's smaller systems. But until now Novell has enjoyed preferred status when it comes to selling software for IBM's mainframe computers, analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Novell has been the de facto choice on IBM's System z mainframes," said Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Linux is the most popular type of so-called open-source software, a movement begun as a grass-roots approach to development of computer programs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Varying versions of the operating system are available from dozens of sources. While they're all based on the same core code, which is known as the Linux kernel, most are not compatible with each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Last year, Novell introduced a desktop version of SUSE Linux at the same time as it launched upgrades to packages for more powerful computers. It also released software to make it easier for a company's IT staff to make all of those computers work together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Our 'desktop to data center' strategy and solutions for Linux in the enterprise have resonated well with clients," said Novell Senior Vice President Roger Levy. "We are not surprised to see Red Hat attempt to adopt our positioning and challenge our success in the enterprise." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Leslie Gevirtz; jim.finkle@reuters.com, Reuters messaging: jim.finkle.reuters.com@reuters.net, + 1 617 367 4164)) Keywords: REDHAT IBM/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds byline, details, share price, analyst comment) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Gina Keating &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    LOS ANGELES, May 8 (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co. (DIS.N) reported on Tuesday revenue below Wall Street targets even though net profit beat expectations as a result of strength across its business segments, especially its movie studio. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     The No. 3 U.S. entertainment company reported a net profit of $931 million, or 44 cents per share, compared with $733 million, or 37 cents per share, in last year's second quarter. Revenue rose to $8.07 billion from $8.03 billion a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts, on average, expected net earnings of 36 cents per share and revenue of $8.1 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    David Miller, analyst for Sanders Morris Harris, said the company missed his revenue estimate but "it looks like they made it up on operating income on stellar cost containment, especially in the studio." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Studio revenue was down 13 percent from last year, when the company had more theatrical releases and benefited from the international theatrical releases of "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" and "Chicken Little." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But profit rose 60 percent in the division. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Disney shares were down 1.3 percent at $36.07 in after-hours electronic trade after closing on Tuesday at $36.55 on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The stock was trading at a multiple of 17.8 times forecast 2008 earnings.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co. (DIS.N) on Tuesday posted a net profit ahead of Wall Street targets thanks to strong performances from ESPN and movies like "Wild Hogs," but revenue lagged estimates and its shares fell 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lower costs at the studio, which cut jobs last summer and produced fewer films, and television network ABC, which had the expensive-to-produce Super Bowl last year, helped the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney reported a net profit of $931 million, or 44 cents per share, compared with $733 million, or 37 cents per share, in last year's second quarter. Revenue rose to $8.07 billion from $8.03 billion a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts, on average, had expected net earnings of 36 cents per share and revenue of $8.1 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanders Morris Harris analyst David Miller said the No. 3 U.S. entertainment company appeared to make up for the flat revenue at the operating income level by containing costs, particularly in movie making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The studio was flush, especially since they didn't have a lot of product in the March quarter," Miller said. "For the media networks, the operating income was outstanding."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swing factors for the studio this quarter include the box office performances of "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" and "Ratatouille."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profit rose in all four Disney divisions last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studio revenue was down 13 percent from last year, when the company had more theatrical releases and benefited from the international theatrical releases of "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" and "Chicken Little."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But operating profit at the division improved by 60 percent as moderately budgeted films like middle-aged motorbike comedy "Wild Hogs" and fantasy adventure "Bridge to Terabithia" did well at worldwide box offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenues for Media, the largest contributor to Disney operating income, were flat in the quarter from last year's second quarter, when the ABC network benefited from advertising revenue from the Super Bowl and some college football games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet with costs also down due to the absence of all the football, and growth at sports network ESPN and international Disney Channels, segment operating income grew 21 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABC benefited from higher prices for spot advertising, which helped overcome the effect of lower ratings. Prices for spot ad sales are running double-digit percentages ahead of last year's third quarter, Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger told analysts the current television advertising market looks strong, which should contribute to successful upfront sales later this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CARS" MERCHANDISE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consumer products division posted 14 percent revenue growth for the quarter and a 20 percent rise in operating income due to growth in royalties from "Cars" merchandise and other products. Disney's video game studio also contributed more revenue thanks to publishing more company-owned titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parks and resorts division saw revenue grow 9 percent while operating income grew 19 percent due to higher ticket prices and average room rates as well as higher guest spending. All parks but Hong Kong Disneyland saw growth. The Walt Disney World Resort set an Easter attendance record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staggs said domestic parks room reservations for the rest of the year were slightly ahead of the year before, with greater strength in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staggs said even with the latest "Pirates" movie coming out, the studio division faces tough comparisons in the current quarter versus last year, when Disney released the "Narnia" DVD, one of the year's top DVD releases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prudential Equity Group analyst Katherine Styponias said in a note she expects Disney profit growth to continue due to its summer movie slate, strength at ESPN and ABC, and lower costs at its studio division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney shares slipped $35.82 in after-hours trade after closing on Tuesday at $36.55 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock was trading at a multiple of 17.8 times forecast 2008 earnings.

&lt;p&gt; (For more Reuters columns on deals, click [DEALTALK])&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By M.C. Govardhana Rangan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI May 11 (Reuters) - A year ago, Goldman Sachs'
(GS.N) presence in India consisted of one man in a hotel room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now, the Wall Street powerhouse's March 2006 move to split
from its local joint venture and go it alone is starting to pay
off, with Goldman winning a coveted mandate to underwrite a $5
billion share sale by ICICI Bank (ICBK.BO) (IBN.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman was also one of the sponsors of this week's $275
million global depositary receipt sale by Indiabulls Financial
Services IBUL.BO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rival bankers in the fast-growing but notoriously
low-margin market scoff that fees on the ICICI deal will be
less than 1.5 percent, but just about every bank was bidding
for the offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides, privately-run ICICI, which is a frequent visitor
to the public capital markets and has global ambitions, is one
of the most sought-after investment banking relationships in
India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And even if the deal pays just 1 percent, a $50 million
payday for banks led by Goldman and co-sponsor Merrill Lynch
MER.N looks attractive given that ICICI is expected to be a
relatively easy sell as investors clamour for exposure to
India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Post-expenses, it will end up at just 1 percent or so," a
person familiar with the transaction said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs spokesman Eddie Naylor declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before this week, Goldman Sachs didn't factor into the 2007
India equity capital markets league table compiled by Dealogic.
JPMorgan (JPM.N) is the top underwriter in the country this
year, followed by Merrill, HSBC (HSBA.L) and Morgan Stanley
(MS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Completion of the Indiabulls deal puts Goldman in 12th
place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ALL BY MYSELF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs separated last year from its joint venture
with Kotak Mahindra -- part of a trend that saw other western
investment banks leave their domestic partners and go it alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the same time, newcomers such as Lehman Brothers LEH.N
and Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) have crowded into the market,
adding to pressure on already-thin fee margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman will be aggressive, but I feel there will be
enough for everybody," said an investment banker in Mumbai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the split last year, Goldman's lone banker in India
was country head Brooks Entwistle. It now has 75 people in
India and has been ramping up activity after securing licences
in late December. Its plan is to offer a full range of services
in India, including asset management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Goldman's latest deal, dual-listed ICICI plans to raise
$5 billion in a simultaneous share sale in the United States
and in India. ICICI is expected to add local banks JM Financial
and Enam Financial Consultants Ltd. as co-bookrunners on the
deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors including Singapore state investment agency
Temasek [TEM.UL] and U.K fund manager Prudential (PRU.L) are
said in the market to be buying more than 10 percent of the
issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the ICICI mandate is a breakthrough for Goldman, the
firm is not a complete stranger to India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has handled overseas share sales by software firm
Infosys INFY.O and represented Hong Kong-based Hutchison
Telecommunications International Ltd. 2332.HKHTX.N in the
$11 billion sale this year of its Indian cellphone business to
Britain's Vodafone (VOD.L).

&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Say hello to Disney's 
little friend: "Scarface" mobile content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The franchise, which Walt Disney Co.'s Starwave Mobile unit 
licenses from NBC Universal, has emerged as one of the biggest 
draws in the wireless space, notching more than 2 million 
downloads in ringtones, voicetones, graphics and games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now Disney intends to build on that by minting a new slew 
of mobile extensions set to roll out throughout the second half 
of this year inspired by "Scarface," the 1983 gangster classic 
starring Al Pacino.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's such an iconic brand that can reach pretty broadly 
and continues to inspire us," said Larry Shapiro, executive vp 
and managing director of Starwave Mobile. "Thinking broadly 
about how to drive that story line to new story lines, and 
thinking about the content as part of a new entertainment 
platform, has made it successful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since launching in September, the suite of "Scarface" 
mobile products has broken the 2 million mark in aggregate 
sales, according to internal figures based on data supplied 
from all the major U.S. mobile carriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Who would have expected 24 years ago (that) 'Scarface' 
soundbites would lead to more than 186,000 voicetone 
purchases?" asked Paul Leakas of Nielsen Mobile, which is owned 
by the Nielsen Co., parent company of The Hollywood Reporter. 
"The success of 'Scarface' is a testament to mobile's evolving 
marketplace."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney and Universal Mobile Entertainment declined to break 
out revenue from "Scarface," but the 2 million purchases range 
from the $5.99 fee necessary to pay to play the game "Scarface: 
The Rise of Tony Montana" to the $1.99 that will get you one of 
an assortment of wallpaper images that features Pacino's 
menacing mug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Scarface" mobile content was in demand in 2006, with the 
franchise accounting for 1% of all mobile consumption and 15% 
of those consumers purchasing an action game, according to 
research firm M:Metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the mobile arena, the performance of the voicetone 
featuring the movie's famous line -- "Say hello to my little 
friend" -- has surpassed all others on the market, spending 18 
weeks topping Nielsen RingScan's weekly voicetone sales 
rankings and selling 110,000 tones since its sales began being 
tracked 31 weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taken together, the remix and reggaeton versions of "Say 
hello" make it more than twice as popular as the second-biggest 
selling voicetone, Disney's "Tigger" from "Winnie the Pooh," 
which sold slightly more than 48,000 to date, according to 
RingScan. Ranking third, at 48,000, is the "Angry Stewie" 
voicetone from Fox Mobile Entertainment's "Family Guy" -- a 
franchise that serves as one of that studio's most successful 
mobile properties, selling 232,000 voicetones overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To expand on the "Scarface" product line, Starwave Mobile 
and NBC Universal have collaborated again on a new casual game, 
a separate console-style game, made-for-mobile animated shorts 
based on the film and a total of 30 new voicetones and mobile 
images combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New features include "Scarface Casino," a casual game 
inspired by poker and card games where players strategize 
against one another, and "Scarface: MPR" (Money. Power. 
Respect.), a more immersive game that's task-driven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New voice and ringtones will incorporate music genres like 
hip-hop with additional prominent lines from the film layered 
over them, while a group of original wallpaper images and 
screensavers featuring money and gangster themes are being 
unveiled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the "Scarface" online mobile storefront already has 
an existing video section with short clips drawn from the film 
available, the new video shorts will be created with elements 
designed to view specifically over the mobile platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In terms of mobile, this franchise speaks to exactly the 
right audience -- college-age kids," said Jeremy Laws, senior 
vp at Universal Mobile Entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Laws and Starwave Mobile's Shapiro also attribute the 
successful mobile extension to the collaborative approach 
between Starwave and Universal and their mutual embracing of 
the brand's irreverent nature when it comes to creating 
innovative mobile content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leakas attributed part of the spike in growth to the 
release of the Vivendi Universal's video game in November, 
"Scarface: The World Is Yours," which sold more than 1 million 
copies. Additionally, "Scarface: Money. Power. Respect" was a 
big seller for Sony's PlayStation Portable system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "From the very beginning, we've factored in its edginess," 
Laws said. "We want to continue to build on what we have. 
'Scarface' is more than just a film -- it's a cultural 
phenomenon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska May 10 (Reuters) - An Alaska judge has
thrown out a lawsuit filed by Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) seeking
financial compensation from the state for the cancellation of
the leases on a major undeveloped oil and gas field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Alaska Department of Natural Resources moved to revoke
the leases for the giant Point Thomson field in November,
saying Exxon and its partners had waited too long to develop
the field which was discovered in the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alaska oil and gas leases normally expire after five to 10
years if a find is not developed, but Exxon and its partners
had won regular extensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; State officials had been pushing Exxon to begin production
of the liquids in Point Thomson to bolster Alaska's sagging oil
production, but the company argued in 2005 that putting the
natural gas-rich Point Thomson field into production before an
Alaska gas pipeline was built was not economically prudent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The state of Alaska is still trying to restart the stalled
process to build a pipeline to carry its gas resources to the
U.S. Midwest. A process to select an operator for the pipeline,
which is expected to cost more than $20 billion, is currently
being relaunched by the state government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Point Thomson holds between 8 trillion and 9 trillion cubic
feet of natural gas and about 300 million barrels of condensate
and oil, according to the Department of Natural Resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Further legal wrangling is expected as Exxon can still
appeal the dismissal of the lawsuit. Exxon and its partners in
the Point Thomson leases -- ConocoPhillips Corp. (COP.N),
Chevron Inc. (CVX.N) and BP Plc (BP.L) -- are also pursuing
other legal avenues to recover the field.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A potential human carcinogen has been found in batches of Pfizer Inc.'s AIDS drug Viracept, U.S. regulators said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS.N) has put most of its power generation assets up for sale, seeking bids for 14 of its 18 plants, according to a memorandum distributed Thursday to potential buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The memo, obtained by Reuters, says Goldman will sell interests in plants with combined net operating generation capacity of 2,566 megawatts, mostly in the United States. The bank is selling all of its interests in eight plants and all but 20 percent stakes in six plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman will retain 100 percent interest in four projects and hold on to its Charlotte, North Carolina-based power generation subsidiary, Cogentrix Energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York investment bank, which is one of the world's largest traders of electricity, began building up a portfolio of power plants in 2003. At the time distressed energy merchants such as Enron, Dynegy (DYN.N) and El Paso EP.N were shedding dozens of power plants -- some brand new -- to stay afloat, pushing down power plant prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman acquired Cogentrix in December 2003 for $2.4 billion in cash and assumed debt, gaining stakes in 26 power plants. The bank also acquired assets from El Paso and National Energy and Gas Transmission in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, Goldman has pared down its portfolio as power assets recovered in value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year Goldman sold East Coast Power, a 900-megawatt power station in New Jersey acquired from El Paso in 2003, to General Electric (GE.N) for a gain of $700 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Goldman is cashing out again. According to the memo, the bank seeks an all-cash offer and prefers to sell the plants to one buyer or investor group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial bids will be due by the middle of next month and final bids by the middle of August. The transaction is expected to be completed on November 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past Goldman said that owning power plants, in addition to providing an attractive investment opportunity, supported power trading, offering insights on prices and demand in different markets. But power markets have evolved, and owning physical assets is less critical for traders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plants, which burn coal and natural gas, have drawn fire from environment groups and stand in contrast to the bank's efforts to portray itself as an environmentally progressive company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Goldman's 2006 environmental initiative report, Cogentrix plants last year produced 20.8 million tons of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas widely blamed for contributing to global warming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, in the memo, says the Cogentrix plants are among the cleanest in the industry. Goldman said the plants up for sale use "scrubbing," co-generation and other technology to reduce emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman in March agreed to sell Horizon Energy, a wind-power unit which operated 559 megawatts and had 997-megawatt generating capacity under construction, to Energias de Portugal (EDP.LS) for $2.2 billion. That sale is expected to close in June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAKAR (Reuters) - Carried in the stomachs of human "mules", hidden in ship containers or packed by traffickers into planes, boats or jeeps, Colombian cocaine is criss-crossing the remote coasts and deserts of West Africa on its way to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a multi-million dollar deployment of logistics that is alarming U.S. and European counter-narcotics authorities, Latin American drug cartels are setting up air and sea supply routes and drugs stockpiles across the west of the African continent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.N. experts say recent cocaine seizures show this network extends from the teeming Atlantic ports of Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Guinea to Guinea-Bissau's mangrove-fringed islets and creeks and the Saharan dunes of Mauritania, Niger and Mali.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now we have big seizures, of several hundred kilograms, taking place in countries on the coast," Antonio Mazzitelli, representative for West Africa of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), said in an interview late on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined with the seizures, local police were reporting detentions and sightings of suspected Latin American drug traffickers, believed to be Colombians and Venezuelans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we are seeing is the presence in West Africa of Latin American criminal organizations that take care of receiving large shipments (of cocaine) and organizing their re-shipment towards the final markets," Mazzitelli said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The destination of the drugs was Europe, or new emerging narcotics markets, such as South Africa and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"New modus operandi are being developed," Mazzitelli said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence pointed to the cartels setting up logistics bases, including clandestine airstrips, ship moorages and even refueling depots in isolated, unsupervised corners of West Africa -- for example on the Bijagos islands off Guinea-Bissau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police have already closed down a fake fishing factory on one island that was being used as a front for drug trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When organized criminal networks move several hundred kilograms of cocaine, if not several tonnes of it, they move millions of dollars ... nor do they leave anything to chance," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABSENCE OF CONTROL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European and U.S. authorities are trying to piece together a coherent picture of the growing West African drugs connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How does it reach the final markets ... does it go out by plane, does it go out by (human) courier, by containers, by ships or through all of these means," Mazzitelli said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cited the seizure in Mauritania earlier this month of 600 kg of cocaine. The drugs were unloaded from a small plane which made an emergency landing at the northern port of Nouadhibou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several thousand miles away across the Sahara in Niger, the army recently intercepted another drugs convoy of vehicles guarded by heavily armed traffickers, indicating another route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the remote Mali-Burkina Faso border in March, police arrested five Nigerian women -- who pretended to be pregnant -- carry several dozen kg of cocaine concealed on their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some cocaine shipments had been found hidden in deliveries of marble or cotton, or inside walls of ship containers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mazzitelli said West Africa was an ideal staging post for Latin American cartels targeting Europe, not least because many local states could not control their vast territories and investigation and prosecution mechanisms were weak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guinea-Bissau, for example, had no proper prison. Some of the Latin Americans arrested so far had either simply walked free or been released on bail, after which they vanished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mazzitelli said some regional governments were slow to grasp the threat. "What they do not understand unfortunately is that the drug money can contaminate and corrupt their own societies, there is always a spillover effect," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Lenovo Group Ltd. (0992.HK) has signed a deal with Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) to buy Windows, Office and other software suites for its personal computers in a deal worth as much as $1.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement emulates one inked in 2006, worth $1.2 billion over one year, to pre-install Microsoft's Windows operating system software on Lenovo's computers, deemed a major step in China's efforts to combat piracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Beijing-based spokesman for China's largest PC maker said on Thursday that the framework agreement, encompassing this fiscal year, had been signed on Wednesday in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our projection is the price tag could be as much as $1.3 billion for this fiscal year," the spokesman said. "Last year's agreement was executed very well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both firms hoped to advance "one of the most important goals of international business: the protection of intellectual property," Lenovo senior vice president Chen Shaopeng, who attended the signing ceremony, said in a statement on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 2005, Lenovo became the first personal computer manufacturer to pre-install Windows on all of its product lines for the Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move followed a Chinese government decree that required all PCs made in China to have licensed operating software installed before leaving the factory, as part of Beijing's efforts to crack down on piracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details of the 2007 purchasing agreement would be finalised later, the Beijing-based spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo now sells pre-installed Microsoft software on computers sold in more than 65 countries around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Lenovo last month announced they would build a joint research and development innovation centre in China, marking Microsoft's first such endeavor with an OEM partner, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The centre will focus on technologies for the China market and concentrate on mobile devices and ways to build products on top of Microsoft's software, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo -- one of several Chinese companies trying to craft an international brand -- commands a dominant market share in Asia excluding Japan but faces fierce competition from Dell Inc. DELL.O and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N) elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese firm is now vying with Taiwan's Acer Inc. (2353.TW) for the mantle of world's third-largest PC manufacturer, tracking behind Hewlett-Packard and Dell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo has also been grappling with expenses arising from layoffs and corporate streamlining after its $1.25 billion purchase of IBM's (IBM.N) PC arm in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo's shares fell 0.7 percent to HK$2.91 on Thursday, broadly in line with the main market's .HSI 0.5 percent dip. The stock has gained more than 5 percent over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SANTA CLARA, California (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. sees mergers as a way to fill gaps or enter new markets, mostly via small deals, but larger deals are also "conceivable," Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have not, by default, opted for acquisitions as part of our strategy ... but we don't count them out either," he said. "In general, though (we focus on) smaller deals, we are open to large acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the Software 2007 conference in Silicon Valley, Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT.O) leader said the world's biggest software company remains focused on organic growth and sees acquisitions typically as a way to fill holes in its business strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an onstage interview with Software 2007 conference organizer M.R. Rangaswami, Ballmer declined to comment directly on whether he was interested in acquisitions in the $40 billion to $50 billion range -- a reference to a possible deal to acquire Yahoo Inc. (YHOO.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question was a backhanded reference to news reports last Friday that Microsoft has once again approached Yahoo for a potential merger or partnership deal to help the companies better compete with rival Google Inc. (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anything is conceivable," Ballmer replied, noting that he would decline to comment specifically on any potential deal-making as a matter of policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Typically we do not do large (deals) relative to our overall size," Ballmer said. (We do deals) to fit into what we are doing or as platforms to us into whole new businesses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last 12 months, the Redmond, Washington-based company acquired 15 to 20 companies, Ballmer told an audience of several hundred business software executives. He pointed to the 2000 acquisition of Great Plains Software, which propelled Microsoft into the business planning software market, as an example of using a merger to thrust itself into a new market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think you should expect that most of our growth should come from buying large companies and taking costs out," Ballmer said, adding that such cost-reduction strategies are useful in slow-growing, more mature industries, but not software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comment, details.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSTON May 9 (Reuters) - Red Hat Inc. (RHT.N) said on Wednesday it formed a partnership with IBM (IBM.N) to develop and sell software for mainframe computers, in what analysts said was a blow to chief rival Novell Inc. NOVL.O &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The agreement covers versions of Red Hat's Linux operating system, which computing giant International Business Machines Corp. has agreed to promote for use on System z, its most powerful line of business computers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "This is a competitive win for Red Hat," said Trip Chowdhry, an analyst with Global Equities Research. "It shows that Red Hat is getting closer to IBM." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For several years, IBM has had a similar arrangement with Novell, which provides the vast majority of Linux software currently used on IBM's mainframe computers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts say the absence of such a relationship with Red Hat has meant that, until now, Novell's SUSE Linux has been the de facto choice of IBM customers wanting to run their mainframe computers on the Linux operating system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    They say the vast majority of IBM's System z Linux clients use Novell's software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Now there are some deals that Novell is not going to get because Red Hat is going to get them instead," said Jefferies &amp; Co. analyst Katherine Egbert." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Red Hat and IBM say their engineers will join forces to identify and address areas where they can make their products more attractive to specific types of clients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    One area where that might make a difference is with government agencies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM and Red Hat say they have already assembled a team of engineers that have worked together to develop technology that ensures classified data is only made accessible to people with proper security clearances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Linux is the most popular type of open-source software, a movement begun as a grass-roots approach to developing computer programs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Varying versions of the operating system are available from dozens of sources. While they are all based on the same core code, which is known as the Linux kernel, most are not compatible with each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    People familiar with the new Red Hat-IBM partnership told Reuters on Tuesday the companies would announce a deal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    When asked for comment on Tuesday, Novell Senior Vice President Roger Levy said: "Our 'desktop to data center' strategy and solutions for Linux in the enterprise have resonated well with clients ... We are not surprised to see Red Hat attempt to adopt our positioning and challenge our success in the enterprise." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Red Hat shares were down 1 percent at $21.98 and IBM shares were up 0.7 percent at $104.01 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Novell shares fell 0.28 percent to $7.20 on the Nasdaq. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Jim Finkle; jim.finkle@reuters.com, editing by Andre Grenon; Reuters messaging: jim.finkle.reuters.com@reuters.net +1 617 367 4164)) Keywords: REDHAT IBM/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft MSFT.O. gave a sneak peak at its "Halo 3" game on Friday, presumably the final chapter of the fast-paced shooter trilogy that the software giant is banking on to help it fend off competition from Sony (6758.T) and Nintendo 7974.OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gamers at the invitation-only preview gave mixed reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The graphics can use some work ... They're not much different than the previous Halo," said Nicholas Puleo, editor of gaming news Web site Evilavatar.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They've got five, six months until release, so they'll add some polish ... When I compare it to other things in the platform, it's not standout."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft staged previews in New York and San Francisco on Friday in advance of the public test, or "beta," of the game, which goes live next Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A public beta is unusual for a console game, and the "Halo 3" one for Microsoft's Xbox 360 is being closely watched by gamers eager to know how the title looks and plays, and whether it will live up to the buzz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game once again puts players in control of "Master Chief," a futuristic soldier trying to save humanity from an alien coalition known as the Covenant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make things more realistic, game maker Bungie Studios made the movements in "Halo 3" more closely follow the laws of real-world physics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you're playing with physics, you want to draw a balance between fantasy and reality," Halo franchise writer Frank O'Connor told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dead bodies float. Grenades tossed in snow stay in place, while those thrown on harder surfaces skip and roll. Bullets ricochet off walls. And gamers' characters straying too close to grenades will be maimed by their shrapnel effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To get me as a player -- to be vested in real-time game-play -- the realism is critical," said Christopher Peragine. "Once it gets past the Beta, it's going to be a fantastic game."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first "Halo" helped the original Microsoft Xbox gain a foothold in the highly competitive video-game market, while its successor became one of the most successful games ever, with sales of $125 million -- roughly 2.5 million copies -- in its first 24 hours of availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The games have also driven adoption of the Xbox Live online gaming service, which offers some basic features for free but charges users about $50 a year for being able to play against other gamers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to being one of the year's hottest-selling games, the publicity surrounding "Halo 3" should also spur some consumers to run out and buy an Xbox 360, said Craig Davison, Microsoft's director of marketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a significant number of people just waiting for that one game," he said, "and this is the game."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Say hello to Disney's 
little friend: "Scarface" mobile content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The franchise, which Walt Disney Co.'s Starwave Mobile unit 
licenses from NBC Universal, has emerged as one of the biggest 
draws in the wireless space, notching more than 2 million 
downloads in ringtones, voicetones, graphics and games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now Disney intends to build on that by minting a new slew 
of mobile extensions set to roll out throughout the second half 
of this year inspired by "Scarface," the 1983 gangster classic 
starring Al Pacino.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's such an iconic brand that can reach pretty broadly 
and continues to inspire us," said Larry Shapiro, executive vp 
and managing director of Starwave Mobile. "Thinking broadly 
about how to drive that story line to new story lines, and 
thinking about the content as part of a new entertainment 
platform, has made it successful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since launching in September, the suite of "Scarface" 
mobile products has broken the 2 million mark in aggregate 
sales, according to internal figures based on data supplied 
from all the major U.S. mobile carriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Who would have expected 24 years ago (that) 'Scarface' 
soundbites would lead to more than 186,000 voicetone 
purchases?" asked Paul Leakas of Nielsen Mobile, which is owned 
by the Nielsen Co., parent company of The Hollywood Reporter. 
"The success of 'Scarface' is a testament to mobile's evolving 
marketplace."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney and Universal Mobile Entertainment declined to break 
out revenue from "Scarface," but the 2 million purchases range 
from the $5.99 fee necessary to pay to play the game "Scarface: 
The Rise of Tony Montana" to the $1.99 that will get you one of 
an assortment of wallpaper images that features Pacino's 
menacing mug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Scarface" mobile content was in demand in 2006, with the 
franchise accounting for 1% of all mobile consumption and 15% 
of those consumers purchasing an action game, according to 
research firm M:Metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the mobile arena, the performance of the voicetone 
featuring the movie's famous line -- "Say hello to my little 
friend" -- has surpassed all others on the market, spending 18 
weeks topping Nielsen RingScan's weekly voicetone sales 
rankings and selling 110,000 tones since its sales began being 
tracked 31 weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taken together, the remix and reggaeton versions of "Say 
hello" make it more than twice as popular as the second-biggest 
selling voicetone, Disney's "Tigger" from "Winnie the Pooh," 
which sold slightly more than 48,000 to date, according to 
RingScan. Ranking third, at 48,000, is the "Angry Stewie" 
voicetone from Fox Mobile Entertainment's "Family Guy" -- a 
franchise that serves as one of that studio's most successful 
mobile properties, selling 232,000 voicetones overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To expand on the "Scarface" product line, Starwave Mobile 
and NBC Universal have collaborated again on a new casual game, 
a separate console-style game, made-for-mobile animated shorts 
based on the film and a total of 30 new voicetones and mobile 
images combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New features include "Scarface Casino," a casual game 
inspired by poker and card games where players strategize 
against one another, and "Scarface: MPR" (Money. Power. 
Respect.), a more immersive game that's task-driven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New voice and ringtones will incorporate music genres like 
hip-hop with additional prominent lines from the film layered 
over them, while a group of original wallpaper images and 
screensavers featuring money and gangster themes are being 
unveiled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the "Scarface" online mobile storefront already has 
an existing video section with short clips drawn from the film 
available, the new video shorts will be created with elements 
designed to view specifically over the mobile platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In terms of mobile, this franchise speaks to exactly the 
right audience -- college-age kids," said Jeremy Laws, senior 
vp at Universal Mobile Entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Laws and Starwave Mobile's Shapiro also attribute the 
successful mobile extension to the collaborative approach 
between Starwave and Universal and their mutual embracing of 
the brand's irreverent nature when it comes to creating 
innovative mobile content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leakas attributed part of the spike in growth to the 
release of the Vivendi Universal's video game in November, 
"Scarface: The World Is Yours," which sold more than 1 million 
copies. Additionally, "Scarface: Money. Power. Respect" was a 
big seller for Sony's PlayStation Portable system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "From the very beginning, we've factored in its edginess," 
Laws said. "We want to continue to build on what we have.

&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Say hello to Disney's 
little friend: "Scarface" mobile content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The franchise, which Walt Disney Co.'s Starwave Mobile unit 
licenses from NBC Universal, has emerged as one of the biggest 
draws in the wireless space, notching more than 2 million 
downloads in ringtones, voicetones, graphics and games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now Disney intends to build on that by minting a new slew 
of mobile extensions set to roll out throughout the second half 
of this year inspired by "Scarface," the 1983 gangster classic 
starring Al Pacino.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's such an iconic brand that can reach pretty broadly 
and continues to inspire us," said Larry Shapiro, executive vp 
and managing director of Starwave Mobile. "Thinking broadly 
about how to drive that story line to new story lines, and 
thinking about the content as part of a new entertainment 
platform, has made it successful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since launching in September, the suite of "Scarface" 
mobile products has broken the 2 million mark in aggregate 
sales, according to internal figures based on data supplied 
from all the major U.S. mobile carriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Who would have expected 24 years ago (that) 'Scarface' 
soundbites would lead to more than 186,000 voicetone 
purchases?" asked Paul Leakas of Nielsen Mobile, which is owned 
by the Nielsen Co., parent company of The Hollywood Reporter. 
"The success of 'Scarface' is a testament to mobile's evolving 
marketplace."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney and Universal Mobile Entertainment declined to break 
out revenue from "Scarface," but the 2 million purchases range 
from the $5.99 fee necessary to pay to play the game "Scarface: 
The Rise of Tony Montana" to the $1.99 that will get you one of 
an assortment of wallpaper images that features Pacino's 
menacing mug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Scarface" mobile content was in demand in 2006, with the 
franchise accounting for 1% of all mobile consumption and 15% 
of those consumers purchasing an action game, according to 
research firm M:Metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the mobile arena, the performance of the voicetone 
featuring the movie's famous line -- "Say hello to my little 
friend" -- has surpassed all others on the market, spending 18 
weeks topping Nielsen RingScan's weekly voicetone sales 
rankings and selling 110,000 tones since its sales began being 
tracked 31 weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taken together, the remix and reggaeton versions of "Say 
hello" make it more than twice as popular as the second-biggest 
selling voicetone, Disney's "Tigger" from "Winnie the Pooh," 
which sold slightly more than 48,000 to date, according to 
RingScan. Ranking third, at 48,000, is the "Angry Stewie" 
voicetone from Fox Mobile Entertainment's "Family Guy" -- a 
franchise that serves as one of that studio's most successful 
mobile properties, selling 232,000 voicetones overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To expand on the "Scarface" product line, Starwave Mobile 
and NBC Universal have collaborated again on a new casual game, 
a separate console-style game, made-for-mobile animated shorts 
based on the film and a total of 30 new voicetones and mobile 
images combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New features include "Scarface Casino," a casual game 
inspired by poker and card games where players strategize 
against one another, and "Scarface: MPR" (Money. Power. 
Respect.), a more immersive game that's task-driven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New voice and ringtones will incorporate music genres like 
hip-hop with additional prominent lines from the film layered 
over them, while a group of original wallpaper images and 
screensavers featuring money and gangster themes are being 
unveiled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the "Scarface" online mobile storefront already has 
an existing video section with short clips drawn from the film 
available, the new video shorts will be created with elements 
designed to view specifically over the mobile platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In terms of mobile, this franchise speaks to exactly the 
right audience -- college-age kids," said Jeremy Laws, senior 
vp at Universal Mobile Entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Laws and Starwave Mobile's Shapiro also attribute the 
successful mobile extension to the collaborative approach 
between Starwave and Universal and their mutual embracing of 
the brand's irreverent nature when it comes to creating 
innovative mobile content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leakas attributed part of the spike in growth to the 
release of the Vivendi Universal's video game in November, 
"Scarface: The World Is Yours," which sold more than 1 million 
copies. Additionally, "Scarface: Money. Power. Respect" was a 
big seller for Sony's PlayStation Portable system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "From the very beginning, we've factored in its edginess," 
Laws said. "We want to continue to build on what we have. 
'Scarface' is more than just a film -- it's a cultural 
phenomenon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON May 11 (Reuters) - The United States revoked an&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;entry visa last July of Oleg Deripaska, a Russian billionaire&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;at the heart of a possible bid for DaimlerChrysler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AG'sDCXGn.DE Chrysler Group, a State Department official said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The official, who asked not to be named, declined to state&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;reasons for canceling the visa issued two years ago to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deripaska, who at 39 is reported to be Russia's second-richest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The U.S. government may review foreign bids for ownership&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;of U.S. companies for a number of reasons, including possible&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;national security implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Wall Street Journal has tied the entry ban to what it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;called concerns that Deripaska may have ties to organized crime&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;in Russia, citing unnamed U.S. law enforcement officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The newspaper also reported on Friday the entry ban was&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;tied to the veracity of his statements on the matter to the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Stephen Kodak, an FBI spokesman, said he could neither&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;confirm nor deny any contacts with Deripaska, in accordance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;with long-standing FBI policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Gonzo Gallegos, a State Department spokesman, said the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;department would not be issuing a formal statement on the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Deripaska received a U.S. multi-entry visa in 2005, the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;department official said. Lobbying on his behalf had been done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;by former Senate Republican leader and 1996 presidential&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;candidate Bob Dole and his Alston  Bird law partners, Senate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;records show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Alston  Bird was paid about $260,000 in 2005 for work on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Department of State visa policies and procedures" tied to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deripaska, according to disclosure forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Jonathan Winer, a Dole colleague who filed the disclosures,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;did not reply to repeated requests for comment on the visa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A company controlled by Deripaska, Basic Element, plans to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;buy a $1.54 billion stake in Magna International Inc. MGa.TO,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a diversified Canadian auto supplier, Magna said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Magna has teamed with Onex Corp. (OCX.TO), a Canadian&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;buyout firm, to make a bid for Chrysler Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Deripaska's pending cash infusion into Magna could help&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;fund such a bid. Analysts have called Magna the leading&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;potential buyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Chrysler, which once built tanks and tank engines, is no&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;longer a big U.S. defense contractor. In a research program&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;partly funded by the Pentagon that was begun in 2001 and is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;just wrapping up, Chrysler worked on a diesel-electric hybrid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;pickup truck that could supply power to troops in the field,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;said David Elshoff, a Chrysler spokesman in Auburn Hills,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Most deals submitted to the inter-agency Committee on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Investment in the United States are approved without&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;difficulty. But furors have erupted in recent years over the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;proposed acquisition of Unocal by the China National Offshore&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil Corp. and Dubai Ports World's acquisition of management&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;rights at a number of U.S. ports from Britain's PO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Chrysler, which has 25 plants in the United States,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;announced plans on Feb. 14 to cut 13,000 jobs amid industry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;projections of a flat or slightly weaker market this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;compared with 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A Deripaska spokesman in Moscow, Konstantin Panin, did not&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;return a telephone call seeking comment. A call to a spokesman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;for the Russian embassy also was not returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Deripaska was ranked Russia's second-richest man by Forbes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;magazine, behind Roman Abramovich. Deripaska built much of his&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;estimated $16.8 billion fortune in aluminum, emerging from&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia's "aluminum wars" of the 1990s with control of some of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the country's biggest smelters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He also masterminded the consolidation of Russia's aluminum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;sector, which was completed in March with the creation of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;United Company RUSAL. That new company, in which Deripaska is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the majority owner, produces an eighth of the world's supply of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the metal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Deripaska -- appointed in 2004 by President Vladimir Putin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;to represent Russia at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business Advisory Council -- owns Russia's No. 2 automaker Gaz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(GAZA.RTS), maker of the Volga saloon and the Gazelle minivan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    DaimlerChrysler was created in 1998 through the merger of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany's Daimler-Benz AG and U.S.-based Chrysler Corp. Its&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;divisions include the Mercedes Car Group, Chrysler Group and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Truck Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   (Adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON May 11 (Reuters) - U.S. oil company Chevron (CVX.N)
said on Friday it was evacuating hundreds of nonessential personnel from offshore operations in Nigeria due to security
concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron spokesman Michael Barrett said the evacuation would
not further impact the company's production in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are temporarily suspending some nonessential work
activity in offshore operations to ensure the safety and
security of our workforce," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The number of personnel impacted is going to be in the
hundreds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Militant attacks this month have prompted Chevron to cut
production by 42,000 barrels per day at its Escravos oilfields
and 15,000 bpd at its Pennington terminal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said it would regularly review the security
situation in Nigeria, but declined to say when the personnel
would return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The evacuation will affect some drilling rigs, construction
barges and support vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A surge in violence in Africa's largest oil producer has
led to the shutdown of more than 750,000 bpd, or around 25
percent of the country's production capacity.

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY May 11 (Reuters) - Mexican stocks rose on

&lt;p&gt; The IPC stock index .MXX, which set a record high earlier

&lt;p&gt;SEOUL/ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS AG, the world's largest wealth manager, and JPMorgan Chase  Co. announced deals in South Korea on Friday, becoming the latest foreign firms to enter the country's $250 billion fund management market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBS (UBSN.VX) is buying South Korea's No. 3 asset manager while U.S.-based investment bank JP Morgan (JPM.N) got the nod to set up an asset management firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deals came as ING Group (ING.AS) and Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU.N) are reportedly in talks to buy Landmark Asset Management from Morgan Stanley (MS.N), and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) said it would buy a South Korean asset management firm majority-owned by Macquarie Bank MBL.AX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expected enactment of the Capital Markets Integration Act in 2008, aimed at breaking down walls separating brokerages, futures trading and asset managing, is a key reason behind the rush of interest, analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The market's growth could be explosive once the act takes effect, creating a number of sophisticated investment products," said Ko Yong-uk, an analyst at Daewoo Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That will speed up the influx of more and more discretionary income, now tied up in real estate or bank accounts, into financial services products."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS said it finalized a deal to buy 51 percent of Daehan Investment Trust Management (DIMCO) from Hana Financial Group (086790.KS) for $194.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daehan, which oversees about $20 billion in assets, and trails Samsung Investment Trust Management and Mirae Asset Investment Management, will be known internationally as UBS Hana Asset Management Co.

It may get back up to $32.4 million in an earn-out provision clawback over the next three to five years, depending on how the business performs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acquisition follows a push by UBS over the past year into emerging markets. Last year it acquired Banco Pactual, one of Brazil's leading wealth managers, and is using this as a platform to extend its operations in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In China, UBS Securities Co. Ltd, a newly formed joint venture created from the restructuring of Beijing Securities, is now open for business after UBS won approval to invest $200 million in the company in return for a 20 percent stake and de facto management control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, the Financial Supervisory Service said it granted JPMorgan a license to establish a wholly-owned asset manager in South Korea, with an initial capital of 10 billion won ($10.8 million), making it the 15th foreign financial institution to enter the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bank of Korea estimates half of South Korea's 1,500 trillion won ($1,619 billion) in individual financial assets has been put in bank deposits as of the end of 2006, about three times the amount consumers put into investment products, including bonds and equities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Korea's mandatory corporate pension scheme, introduced in late 2005 and set to cover all local firms by 2010, requires companies to outsource a fixed portion of their employees' retirement money to an outside financial institution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could unleash as much as an additional $60 billion by 2010, analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major global financial forces including Macquarie Bank, Fidelity Investments and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) are among those running asset management arms in South Korea. Together, they have around 18 percent market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Rafael Nam)&lt;/p&gt;

Together, they have around 18 percent market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Rafael Nam and Andrew Hurst)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=926.2 Won)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEOUL May 11 (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank JPMorgan Chase

firm in South Korea, gaining a foothold in the country's
fast-growing $250 billion sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Financial Supervisory Service said on Friday it has
approved JPMorgan's plan to establish a 100-percent owned asset
manager in South Korea, making it the 15th foreign financial
institution to enter the potentially huge market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The asset management company will start with an initial
capital of 10 billion won ($10.80 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's entry is the latest example of foreign money
managers' accelerating efforts to grab a piece of South Korea's
retail assets, which are increasingly flowing into financial
products from traditional bank savings accounts or property
investment.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) expects the launch of its upcoming "Halo 3" video game to surpass that of "Halo 2", which pulled down $125 million in sales in its first 24 hours, an executive said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I definitely believe that 'Halo 3' is going to be bigger than "Halo 2". Retailers know what 'Halo 2' did and they are not going to want to be caught out of stock," Shane Kim, head of Microsoft Game Studios, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - It's the first public unveiling of Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT.O) alien-blasting action game "Halo 3", but Shane Kim is already looking ahead to a kinder, gentler face for its Xbox 360 console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The head of Microsoft Game Studios said on Friday that his division is working on two previously unannounced games aimed beyond the hardcore fans who relish the shooting, driving and sports games that make up the bulk of popular Xbox titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is to make the Xbox 360 more attractive to casual gamers, who have flocked to Nintendo Co. Ltd.'s 7974.OS Wii console and its innovative motion-sensing controller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a couple games that have not been announced," Kim told Reuters at a preview event in San Francisco for "Halo 3", the next installment in Microsoft's flagship franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I will tell you that they target a broader market. We think it's very important this holiday, and to winning this generation, to expand beyond our core audience," Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has had mixed success in the casual area. Last year, it launched "Viva Pinata", a colorful, quirky game in which players tend a garden and raise pinata animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The title won critical praise but sold poorly, which Kim said was due to the price of the Xbox 360 being too high to draw in casual players for that game alone. The Xbox sells in two versions: a $300 basic system and a $400 premium system with a hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact is that we are not at a mass-market price point," Kim said. "We have that work to do ... to make us more palatable to moms and stuff."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the other end of the market, Kim said a new "Elite" Xbox 360 that sells for $480 and comes with a larger hard drive and better support for high-definition graphics and video was selling well, despite concerns over the high price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are selling everything we can make. People want the black color, they want the bigger hard-drive capacity," Kim said. "And the price is great, especially when compared to the PS3 options."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim was referring to Sony Corp.'s (6758.T) PlayStation 3, whose high price of $600 for the premium version is believed to be hampering sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics have said price comparisons to Sony's machine are unfair since the PS3 includes a Blu-ray high-definition DVD player, while Xbox owners must shell out an extra $200 for a plug-in unit that supports the rival HD-DVD format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously, the big difference between us and Sony is that we've made it the consumer's choice," Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Say hello to Disney's 
little friend: "Scarface" mobile content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The franchise, which Walt Disney Co.'s Starwave Mobile unit 
licenses from NBC Universal, has emerged as one of the biggest 
draws in the wireless space, notching more than 2 million 
downloads in ringtones, voicetones, graphics and games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now Disney intends to build on that by minting a new slew 
of mobile extensions set to roll out throughout the second half 
of this year inspired by "Scarface," the 1983 gangster classic 
starring Al Pacino.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's such an iconic brand that can reach pretty broadly 
and continues to inspire us," said Larry Shapiro, executive vp 
and managing director of Starwave Mobile. "Thinking broadly 
about how to drive that story line to new story lines, and 
thinking about the content as part of a new entertainment 
platform, has made it successful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since launching in September, the suite of "Scarface" 
mobile products has broken the 2 million mark in aggregate 
sales, according to internal figures based on data supplied 
from all the major U.S. mobile carriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Who would have expected 24 years ago (that) 'Scarface' 
soundbites would lead to more than 186,000 voicetone 
purchases?" asked Paul Leakas of Nielsen Mobile, which is owned 
by the Nielsen Co., parent company of The Hollywood Reporter. 
"The success of 'Scarface' is a testament to mobile's evolving 
marketplace."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney and Universal Mobile Entertainment declined to break 
out revenue from "Scarface," but the 2 million purchases range 
from the $5.99 fee necessary to pay to play the game "Scarface: 
The Rise of Tony Montana" to the $1.99 that will get you one of 
an assortment of wallpaper images that features Pacino's 
menacing mug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Scarface" mobile content was in demand in 2006, with the 
franchise accounting for 1% of all mobile consumption and 15% 
of those consumers purchasing an action game, according to 
research firm M:Metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the mobile arena, the performance of the voicetone 
featuring the movie's famous line -- "Say hello to my little 
friend" -- has surpassed all others on the market, spending 18 
weeks topping Nielsen RingScan's weekly voicetone sales 
rankings and selling 110,000 tones since its sales began being 
tracked 31 weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taken together, the remix and reggaeton versions of "Say 
hello" make it more than twice as popular as the second-biggest 
selling voicetone, Disney's "Tigger" from "Winnie the Pooh," 
which sold slightly more than 48,000 to date, according to 
RingScan. Ranking third, at 48,000, is the "Angry Stewie" 
voicetone from Fox Mobile Entertainment's "Family Guy" -- a 
franchise that serves as one of that studio's most successful 
mobile properties, selling 232,000 voicetones overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To expand on the "Scarface" product line, Starwave Mobile 
and NBC Universal have collaborated again on a new casual game, 
a separate console-style game, made-for-mobile animated shorts 
based on the film and a total of 30 new voicetones and mobile 
images combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New features include "Scarface Casino," a casual game 
inspired by poker and card games where players strategize 
against one another, and "Scarface: MPR" (Money. Power. 
Respect.), a more immersive game that's task-driven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New voice and ringtones will incorporate music genres like 
hip-hop with additional prominent lines from the film layered 
over them, while a group of original wallpaper images and 
screensavers featuring money and gangster themes are being 
unveiled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the "Scarface" online mobile storefront already has 
an existing video section with short clips drawn from the film 
available, the new video shorts will be created with elements 
designed to view specifically over the mobile platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In terms of mobile, this franchise speaks to exactly the 
right audience -- college-age kids," said Jeremy Laws, senior 
vp at Universal Mobile Entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Laws and Starwave Mobile's Shapiro also attribute the 
successful mobile extension to the collaborative approach 
between Starwave and Universal and their mutual embracing of 
the brand's irreverent nature when it comes to creating 
innovative mobile content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leakas attributed part of the spike in growth to the 
release of the Vivendi Universal's video game in November, 
"Scarface: The World Is Yours," which sold more than 1 million 
copies. Additionally, "Scarface: Money. Power. Respect" was a 
big seller for Sony's PlayStation Portable system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "From the very beginning, we've factored in its edginess," 
Laws said. "We want to continue to build on what we have. 
'Scarface' is more than just a film -- it's a cultural 
phenomenon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Worried that a visa program for high-skilled foreign workers is being abused to displace higher paid Americans, two U.S. senators on Monday asked nine foreign-based companies to explain how they are using the work permits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senate Assistant Majority Leader Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, and Sen. Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in letters to the companies that they had received reports of fraud and abuse of the H-1B visa program that allows companies to bring highly skilled workers into the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"More and more it appears that companies are using H-1B visas to displace qualified, American workers," Grassley said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senators said some visas were being used to train foreign workers in the United States to perform jobs that were later transferred to India and other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High tech firms are pushing Congress to increase the number of H-1B visas as a part of a comprehensive immigration reform lawmakers are currently negotiating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They argue that they are short of qualified scientists and computer programmers. The senators said Congress needs a better idea of how the visas are being used before increasing the number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 65,000 H-1B visas are allotted each year. The nine foreign companies, most of them based in India, accounted for 20,000 of the visas available last year, the senators said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The reality is that too many H-1B visas are being used to facilitate the outsourcing of American jobs to other countries," Durbin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies the senators sent letters to were Infosys Technologies, Wipro Ltd., Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., Patni Computer Systems, I-Flex Solutions Inc., Satyam Computer Services Ltd., Larsen  Toubro Infotech Ltd., Tech Mahindra Americas Inc. and Mphasis Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They asked the companies for information on the number of visas they hold, wages, efforts to recruit qualified American workers, outsourcing of jobs to other countries and whether any U.S. workers have had their responsibilities outsourced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senators have introduced legislation aimed at protecting U.S. workers and limiting the ability of companies to use the visas to train workers with the aim of shifting jobs overseas. Aides said the measure would be offered as an amendment to comprehensive immigration legislation that the Senate could take up as early as this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LONDON May 14 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N), the world's largest drugmaker, locked horns with European drug wholesalers on Monday, accusing companies engaged in so-called "parallel trade" of fuelling trade in counterfeit medicines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Parallel trade is the legal practice in Europe whereby drugs are imported for resale into high-price countries, like Britain, from countries where prices are lower, like southern Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer, which has long campaigned against the trade, used a European Parliament symposium on bogus drugs in Brussels to call for a substantial review of the way medicines are supplied by numerous intermediaries in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Julian Mount, the group's vice president of European trade, said more than 140 million medicine packs were parallel traded across Europe each year and they could travel through as many as 30 pairs of hands before finally reaching the patient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer says middlemen companies were directly involved in a case last year when counterfeit versions of its top-selling cholesterol drug Lipitor were found in Britain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Heinz Kobelt, secretary general of the European Association of Euro-Pharmaceutical Companies, representing parallel traders, denied the charge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He argued there was no single reported case of a counterfeit medicine entering the legitimate supply chain in Europe via parallel trade and said suggestions to the contrary were part of a smear campaign by big drugmakers seeking to choke off the competitive trade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Ben Hirschler; editing by Paul Bolding; email: ben.hirschler@reuters.com; Reuters Messaging: ben.hirschler.reuters.com@reuters.net; +44 20 7542 5082))   Keywords: PFIZER EUROPE/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds background, paragraphs 4-6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON May 14 (Reuters) - U.S. oil company Chevron (CVX.N)
said on Monday it expected full production to resume at its
42,000-barrels per day Abiteye oilfield in Nigeria in the next
few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The field, which feeds into the Escravos export terminal,
was shutdown last week after community members seized control of
the facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The youths have left the Abiteye station on Sunday,"
company spokesman Michael Barrett said. "We have started the
process of restoring production. This will likely take several
days for full production to be restored."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A surge in violence last week also forced the company to
shut 15,000 bpd of output at its Funiwa oilfield, which is
connected to the Pennington export terminal.
 Chevron announced on Friday it had evacuated hundreds of
nonessential personnel from offshore operations in Nigeria due
to security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Including the shutdown of the Abiteye field, oil companies
have detailed about 752,000 bpd of shut-in Nigerian production
due to militant attacks and sabotage. That represents about 25
percent of the country's capacity of 3 million bpd.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO May 14 (Reuters) - Japan's EAccess Ltd. 9427.T said
on Monday it plans to sell some of its stake in its mobile phone
unit to Goldman Sachs (GS.N), in a move that would let the
parent company strengthen its balance sheet and boost its
dividend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The transaction would give bigger returns to Goldman, among
the first investors in the Japanese mobile venture, when the
unit goes public, currently expected around 2011-2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EAccess, among three companies granted new wireless licences
in 2005, has raised about $3 billion to help build a nationwide
network from scratch, by taking out loans and selling shares in
the mobile unit to investors including Goldman and Singapore's
Temasek TEM.UL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The share sale would turn the wireless unit EMobile from a
consolidated subsidiary of EAccess into an affiliate, reducing
the amount of the unit's losses the parent company would be
required to book in group earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Emobile also appointed Chief Financial Officer Eric Gan, 43,
as president and chief operating officer, having been managing
director of Goldman before founding the telecom operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Based on the new accounting relationship expected with its
wireless arm, EAccess on Monday also said it plans to raise its
annual dividend to 2,300 yen from the planned 1,800 yen for
2006/7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The operator forecast an unexpected 91 percent jump in
operating profit to 2 billion yen in the year started April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That compares with a mean forecast for a loss of 21.2
billion yen in 2007/8 based on 5 analysts surveyed by Reuters
Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs plans to pay 12 billion yen for 100,000 shares
in EMobile, lifting its stake to 35.7 percent from 29.8 percent.
EAccess's stake will fall to 37.6 percent from 43.5 percent.

 May 14 (Reuters) - HSBC raised its price target on four

environment, cost savings and contributions from non-domestic
operations.

 The brokerage raised its price target on Coca-Cola

"overweight" rating.

 HSBC also raised its price target on Pepsi Bottling Group
Inc. PBG.N to $36 from $35, PepsiAmericas Inc. PAS.N to $25
from $22 and Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co. CCH.N to $46
from $42. The brokerage reiterated its "neutral" rating on all

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) expects 
the launch of its upcoming "Halo 3" video game to surpass that 
of "Halo 2," which pulled down $125 million in sales in its 
first 24 hours, an executive said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "I definitely believe that 'Halo 3' is going to be bigger 
than "Halo 2." Retailers know what 'Halo 2' did and they are 
not going to want to be caught out of stock," Shane Kim, head 
of Microsoft Game Studios, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. introduced on Sunday phones, headsets and other devices to work with its software that aim to replace the traditional office phone and deliver e-mails, instant messages and phone calls over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's largest software company, said it worked with nine technology manufacturers including Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. and NEC Corp. to develop hardware to work with its unified communications strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of one system for phones and another for e-mails and instant messaging, Microsoft wants all communications to run over Internet networks on its Office Communicator program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft forecasts that the shift to Web-based phone systems will gain momentum during the next three years, eventually generating billions of dollars in new revenue for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new hardware products will be unveiled at this week's Microsoft Windows Hardware Engineering Conference in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new products include an Internet Protocol phone from NEC that connects to a computer's Universal Serial Bus and a Bluetooth headset that connects via wireless technology to the Office program made by LG-Nortel, a joint venture of LG Electronics Inc. and Nortel Networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other hardware manufacturers working with Microsoft are ASUS, Plantronics Inc., Polycom Inc., Tatung Co. Ltd. and Vitelix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) has sold 
nearly 40 million Windows Vista licenses in the first 100 days 
that the latest version of the operating system has been 
available, Chairman Bill Gates said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Gates said an accelerating consumer shift to digital 
lifestyles had helped make the operating system the 
fastest-selling in history, and that premium editions have 
accounted for 78 percent of Vista sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'm really thrilled at how this has come together," said 
Gates during a speech at Microsoft's Windows Hardware 
Engineering Conference 2007 in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Windows operating systems run on more than 95 percent of 
the world's computers and represent the Redmond, 
Washington-based company's biggest profit driver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Vista, which Microsoft introduced on January 30, also marks 
the first major operating system upgrade in more than five 
years from the world's biggest software maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gates said Windows Vista allows many niche-oriented PC 
functions to move into the mainstream, from Web cameras to 
various home remote-controlled items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gates also said that the company named its next-generation 
Windows Server software -- formerly known as "Longhorn" -- 
Windows Server 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Windows Server is the server operating system equivalent to 
the Vista PC operating system, with an emphasis on many of the 
same features, such as better security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, which controlled an estimated two-thirds of the 
global server software market in 2006, has said the product is 
on track to debut in the second half of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gates said Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 will 
provide a platform for hardware innovations and drive increased 
demand for a wide range of new PCs and devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He cited a study by research group IDC that projects there 
will be a $120 billion economic impact from product and 
services revolving around Windows Vista and Windows Server 
2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also said three new hardware manufacturers -- 
Gateway Inc. GTW.N, Lacie and Medion -- plan to build 
products for Windows Home Server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That software is aimed at helping families with multiple 
PCs easily centralize, share and protect digital content, such 
as pictures, music, documents and videos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares were up 7 cents at $30.94 in afternoon 
Nasdaq trading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Karey Wutkowski&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON May 15 (Reuters) - Billionaire investor George
Soros reported on Tuesday that he had more than doubled his
stake in Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT.O) common stock to 415,497
shares as of March 31 from a previously disclosed stake of
198,075 shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Soros reported in a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission that he had also taken a stake in the call
options of the world's largest software maker with 684,000
shares worth about $19.06 million as of March 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overall, Soros' stake in Microsoft increased to $30.6
million from $5.9 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also reported that he had cut or dropped his stakes in a
number of other technology-oriented companies as of the end of
the first quarter, including Oracle Corp. ORCL.O, Take-Two
Interactive Software Inc. (TTWO.O), and eBay Inc. (EBAY.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Soros dropped his stakes in eBay and Take-Two, in which he
had previously held 101,745 shares and 1.01 million shares,

99,000 shares from 808,000 shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also dropped his stakes in Goodyear Tire  Rubber Co.,
in which he had previously held 1.07 million shares, and in
Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc., in which he had held 814,100
shares as of Dec. 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A notable trend in his portfolio was the acquisition of
relatively small stakes in dozens of retailers and consumer
companies, many of which are mainstays at malls across the
United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new stakes included Bed Bath  Beyond Inc. (BBBY.O),
Blockbuster Inc. BBI.N, Big Lots Inc. (BIG.N), DSW Inc.
(DSW.N), Hot Topic Inc. HOTT.O, Men's Wearhouse Inc. (MW.N),

his holdings in Abercrombie  Fitch Co. (ANF.N) to 66,698
shares from 438,000 shares and reducing his holdings in
American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO.N) and Limited Brands Inc.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds comment from Eben Moglen, background, byline) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Daisuke Wakabayashi and Jim Finkle &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW YORK, May 15 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) made its broadest challenge to date against open-source software, including Windows rival Linux, claiming that such programs violate 235 Microsoft patents and saying it will seek license fees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The world's largest software maker said that various open-source packages violate patents it holds in areas related to graphical user interface, e-mail programs and other technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The real question is not whether there exist substantial patent infringement issues, but what to do about them," said Horacio Gutierrez, Microsoft vice president of intellectual property and licensing in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft sent the statement to reporters on Monday via e-mail, detailing a stance that it disclosed in an article that appeared in Fortune Magazine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Linux is the most popular type of open-source software, or computer programs that developers can download and modify as long as they share those changes with the public. The packages, which are often available for free, have gained in popularity over the past decade, taking market share away from Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    While dozens of versions of the Linux operating system are available for free download, Red Hat Inc. (RHT.N) and Novell Inc. NOVL.O develop and sell versions of Linux used to run servers and mainframe computers in corporate data centers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Last year Microsoft signed a marketing, technology and patent agreement with Novell, saying it wants to enter into similar pacts with other open-source software companies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    That agreement, which includes a clause that Microsoft will not sue Novell's Linux customers, incensed the community of open-source software developers, because they said Microsoft would use it to back claims that its intellectual property is being violated by code in Linux and other open source software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Eben Moglen, founding director of the Software Freedom Law Center, called on Microsoft to disclose the patent numbers of the 235 patents it believes are being infringed upon so that the free software community can evaluate its claims. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "They should name their patents," Moglen said. "They should put up or shut up." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Software Freedom Law Center is a nonprofit legal services organization that provides free legal aid to developers of open-source software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Officials with Red Hat couldn't be reached for comment.   A Novell spokesman issued a statement saying that his company does not "agree or admit" that Linux violates Microsoft patents, but that the agreement between the two companies "takes the patent issue off the table for those customers who are concerned about it." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In its statement on the issue, Microsoft played up its partnership with Novell, saying that customers worried about intellectual property claims should buy their Linux software from Novell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Red Hat shares fell 35 cents to $22.14 in afternoon Nasdaq trade. Novell shares rose 11 cents to $7.65 on the New York Stock Exchange and Microsoft shares rose 18 cents at $31.05 on the Nasdaq. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi and Jim Finkle, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (New throughout) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 15 (Reuters) - SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI.N), the seventh-largest U.S. bank, said on Tuesday it has begun to unload Coca-Cola Co. (KO.N) shares it has held since 1919, and has expanded a cost-cutting plan now expected to save $530 million a year, $130 million more than expected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Atlanta-based SunTrust said it has sold 4.5 million Coke shares, or 9 percent of its holdings, and has begun a "sharply focused evaluation" to ensure that its remaining stake is "rationalized." It expects to complete the review by year end. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SunTrust also said it plans to buy back $750 million to $1 billion of stock over the rest of 2007, funded in part by proceeds from the Coke sale. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Like many banks, SunTrust has struggled with heightened competition and a tough interest-rate environment, which has crimped margins. It expects to achieve the $530 million of annual cost savings in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The sale of Coke shares is likely to gain the most attention from Tuesday's announcement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SunTrust acquired its stake in the world's largest soft drink maker when a predecessor took Coca-Cola public. The number of shares has grown through dividend reinvestments and stock splits. SunTrust also keeps a copy of the original formula for Coca-Cola in a vault. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of SunTrust closed Monday at $87.86 on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Jonathan Stempel, editing by Dave Zimmerman; Reuters Messaging: jon.stempel.reuters.com@reuters.net, 646 223 6317)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Multimedia versions of Reuters Top News are now available for: * 3000 Xtra: visit topnews.session.rservices.com &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     * BridgeStation: view story .134 For more information on Top News: topnews.reuters.com)) Keywords: SUNTRUST/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;Gates said an accelerating consumer shift to digital lifestyles had helped make the operating system the fastest-selling in history, and that premium editions have accounted for 78 percent of Vista sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm really thrilled at how this has come together," said Gates during a speech at Microsoft's Windows Hardware Engineering Conference 2007 in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows operating systems run on more than 95 percent of the world's computers and represent the Redmond, Washington-based company's biggest profit driver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vista, which Microsoft introduced on January 30, also marks the first major operating system upgrade in more than five years from the world's biggest software maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates said Windows Vista allows many niche-oriented PC functions to move into the mainstream, from Web cameras to various home remote-controlled items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates also said that the company named its next-generation Windows Server software -- formerly known as "Longhorn" -- Windows Server 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Server is the server operating system equivalent to the Vista PC operating system, with an emphasis on many of the same features, such as better security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which controlled an estimated two-thirds of the global server software market in 2006, has said the product is on track to debut in the second half of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates said Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 will provide a platform for hardware innovations and drive increased demand for a wide range of new PCs and devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cited a study by research group IDC that projects there will be a $120 billion economic impact from product and services revolving around Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also said three new hardware manufacturers -- Gateway Inc. GTW.N, Lacie and Medion -- plan to build products for Windows Home Server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That software is aimed at helping families with multiple PCs easily centralize, share and protect digital content, such as pictures, music, documents and videos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares were up 7 cents at $30.94 in afternoon Nasdaq trading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON May 15 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp. (CVX.N) said a
compressor shutdown at its 260,000 barrel per day (bpd) Los
Angeles-area refinery in El Segundo, California, on Tuesday
morning triggered the plant's safety flare, according to a
notice filed with state pollution regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron also reported flaring at the El Segundo refinery to
the California Office of Emergency Services on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Chevron spokesman wasn't immediately available to discuss
refinery operations.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - A U.S. troop pullout from Iraq would leave the country as a potent launchpad for international terrorism and Washington would be forced to go back in within a couple of years, a leading al Qaeda expert said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rohan Gunaratna told a security conference at Lloyd's of London insurance market that Iraq, like Afghanistan in the 1990s, would become a "terrorist Disneyland" where al Qaeda could build up its strength unchallenged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If U.S., British and other coalition troops withdrew from Iraq in the next year, he said, "certainly the scale of attacks that would be mounted inside Iraq, and using Iraq as a launching pad to strike other Western countries -- countries in Europe, North America - would become such that after two or three years, the U.S. forces will have to go back to Iraq."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Singapore-based academic and writer said the epicenter of international terrorism had already switched from Afghanistan to Iraq. "In many ways, the terrorist threat has now shifted 1,500 miles closer to Europe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republican President George W. Bush is locked in a standoff with a Democratic-led Congress over funding for the war in Iraq, now in its fifth year, in which more than 3,400 American troops have been killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats are pushing for a time frame for withdrawal, something the White House opposes as sending the wrong message to U.S. forces, allies and enemies alike. Some Republicans are also questioning the war more publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain, the leading U.S. partner in Iraq, is scaling back its troops there, although the idea of an immediate pullout was rejected this week by Gordon Brown, the man expected to succeed Bush's close ally Tony Blair as prime minister next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addressing the same conference, a top British security official acknowledged home-grown Islamist militants had exploited the British troop presence in Afghanistan and Iraq for propaganda purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the official, Sir Richard Mottram, said any decision on withdrawal should be taken based on its impact on the two countries, not its effect on the views of radicals in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'd be very cautious about withdrawing from Afghanistan in circumstances where the field was left to the Taliban," said Mottram, Permanent Secretary for Intelligence, Security and Resilience at the Cabinet Office. He declined comment on Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former head of Britain's foreign intelligence service MI6 described Gunaratna's analysis as convincing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly al Qaeda are focusing on Iraq now, and focusing on some sort of propaganda victory over the United States," Sir Richard Dearlove told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whether that's an actual victory or not, if they can claim in the Muslim world that they've done well, then that puts us in a very difficult position. This is really an aspect of withdrawal that hasn't been properly considered. That's why I think we can't just let Iraq go its own way."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds background, details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 15 (Reuters) - Visa said on Tuesday it named
credit card industry veteran Joseph Saunders to be its chairman
and chief executive, overseeing preparations for a planned
initial public offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa, the world's largest credit card payment system, had
appointed Saunders to help Visa find a chief executive but in
the end decided that he was the best choice, Visa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "After a thorough CEO search effort, it became clear to us
that Visa already had the right candidate for the job," William
Campbell, chairman of Visa International's board, said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saunders, 61, was previously president of card services at
Washington Mutual Inc. (WM.N), which he joined after the bank
acquired his former employer, Providian Financial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa said in October that it planned an IPO to fund its
expansion and help pay legal costs, saying it expected the
process to take 12 to 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As part of the lead-up to the offering, the company plans
later this year to merge its U.S., Canadian and international
units to form Visa Inc., the entity that will go public and be
led by Saunders.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa is expected to name credit-card industry veteran Joseph Saunders to head the company as it prepares to go public next year, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa is expected to name Saunders as chief executive and chairman on Tuesday of what will eventually be known as Visa Inc., the Journal reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, Visa named Saunders as executive chairman to help restructure the company, including finding board members and naming a new chief executive at the world's largest credit card payment system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saunders was earlier president of card service at Washington Mutual Inc (WM.N).

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) said on Wednesday the growth opportunity for its Office software division is better than it was seven years ago, because the company is positioned to expand into new business areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional Office segments of spreadsheets and word processing may be slower-growing, but new businesses like Internet-based corporate phone systems and data-crunching applications offer new opportunities, said Jeff Raikes, president of Microsoft's business division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the Reuters Global Technology, Media and Telecoms Summit, Raikes said Microsoft is expanding into a broader segment of business desktop software, or what Microsoft calls information work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raikes, who heads up Microsoft's biggest unit, accounting for nearly a third of revenue, said its growth opportunities are "absolutely" better now than when he took over the business in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What you've seen is a focus on our part to expand into a broader portion of information work," said Raikes in a video conference with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked if those potential opportunities would boost the division's growth rate over the next few years, Raikes said it would boost growth in absolute terms but comparing to historical levels would be difficult since the $14 billion division is much bigger now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Windows division and its Office unit account for more than half of its sales and nearly all of its profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, Microsoft is using Office as a platform to build upon for other applications. The company's Dynamics line of business software and its upcoming business intelligence products incorporate Office applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tapping into people's familiarity with Excel spreadsheets, Outlook e-mail or Word documents, Microsoft aims to use Office as a front door into many new businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its push to deliver office phone calls over the Web on the PC, Microsoft aims to simplify how workers communicate with one another by integrating phone calls with its Office Outlook e-mail system and corporate instant messaging programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft released the new version of Office 2007 earlier this year. The company introduced the new Office at a time when rivals, including Google Inc. (GOOG.O), are offering word processing and spreadsheets online for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raikes said it has seen almost no business impact from those services in terms of customer adoption for Office 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My impression is that this will be one of the fastest adoption rates of any new release of Office," said Raikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Office Live web service, which now offers small businesses hosted e-mail and Web sites and collaboration software for free, or for a monthly fee depending on the level of service required, will be a platform upon which it can add more services, Raikes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're going to see us expand the capabilities of what we provide in the services area," said Raikes, speaking about Office Live. He did not elaborate on what services it may add in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raikes also said it can still expand sales in the traditional spreadsheets and word processing business by expansion into emerging markets and the reduction of piracy rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For summit blog: summitnotebook.reuters.com/)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK (Hollywood Reporter) - As its ABC and ESPN 
networks unveiled their fall lineups Tuesday, Walt Disney Co. 
announced mobile deals with Sprint-Nextel and Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; One makes Disney-ABC Television Group content available to 
Sprint-Nextel Corp. subscribers, and the other sees ESPN, with 
Verizon Communications, reviving a branded mobile service whose 
first iteration was axed late last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ABC move marks the first large-scale mobile programming 
effort by a major broadcast network. Previously, only 
full-length episodes of CBS' just-canceled "Jericho" were 
offered on Sprint phones, with Verizon presenting only short 
clips and a live option and with shows only available at 
specific times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ESPN arrangement is launching with advertising, while 
the ABC deal will add advertising in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Sprint partnership will make full-length episodes of 
ABC primetime series including "Desperate Housewives," "Grey's 
Anatomy," "Lost" and "Ugly Betty" and such ABC News programs as 
"Good Morning America," "World News With Charles Gibson," 
"Nightline" and "This Week With George Stephanopoulos" 
available on the carrier on an on-demand basis as well as on 
ABC Mobile, a new linear channel that, for now, will only be 
available on Sprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Disney Channel also has a linear channel on Sprint 
under the arrangement, and full-length episodes from the kids 
network including "Hannah Montana," "The Suite Life of Zack  
Cody," "Cory in the House" and "Kim Possible" will soon be 
offered on-demand as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All the Disney content on Sprint is available in a package 
costing $20 a month, with a Disney Channel-only option for $15 
per month. The on-demand shows will be available the day after 
their network airing, with the previous four episodes of the 
selected series included in the offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With Verizon, ESPN is relaunching its Mobile ESPN service, 
"retooled and rebranded" as ESPN MVP, as the company put it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will present content from the sports network, including 
"SportsCenter" and "Pardon the Interruption" video clips and 
highlights as well as options to manage and track fantasy 
teams, available at no extra cost to Verizon's VCast 
subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ESPN's first stab at mobile content was canceled in 
December, after running for a little more than a year, amid 
meager subscriber numbers and investors calling for the company 
to discontinue the service. That application was a mobile 
virtual network operator, a service that uses a cellular 
phone's network to deliver content to a subscriber base, rather 
than an add-on to an existing service, like the sports networks 
juggernaut's new offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. cell phone carriers need to experiment more with pricing and offerings of video and other advanced cell phones services to drive greater use, Walt Disney Co.(DIS.N) Internet Group President Steve Wadsworth said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are a content provider and we are trying to drive a really innovative experience for consumers," Wadsworth told the Reuters Global Technology, Media and Telecoms Summit via teleconference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today it's a pretty complicated and not a uniform process of getting content delivered through the various carriers," Wadsworth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney expects to see continued growth across several mobile categories in the United States, including ring tones, graphics, Web-based video games, and branded videos, such as live sports events that soon will be offered by ESPN, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has seen "robust" 20 percent to 30 percent growth in U.S. sales of such mobile content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But mobile content sales could grow faster if obstacles in accessing and delivering content could be overcome, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a need for much more standardization and streamlining of that process to get content from our brains, our creative development and software development, into a consumer's hands... I think that is probably one of the biggest issues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carriers have scores of different cell phone models, and the various companies work differently as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney would like carriers to experiment in pricing and advertising and encourage U.S. consumers, who are not used to personalizing their phones or using them to access information and entertainment, to buy more mobile content, Wadsworth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the end, they are setting the prices," he said of the carriers. "There has not been the robust experimenting with prices to drive (the growth) we want to see."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. carriers also have been slow to try using advertising on the mobile Web, he said, adding that Disney generally controls advertising on any of its own sites and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has been able to experiment more in foreign markets such as Japan, however, where it sells graphics and other items to personalize cell phones, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately Wadsworth said that a revamp of the Disney.com Web site intended to make it into more of an entertainment destination, was drawing much faster registrations of visitors, who also were spending more time on the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has new games and features, such as allowing kids to create their own Web pages as part of its Xtreme Digital, or XD, offerings. The company aims to create an online social environment that is safe for kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gina Keating in Los Angeles and Peter Henderson in New York)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO May 16 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp.'s
(MSFT.O) public test of its upcoming "Halo 3" video game got
off to a rocky start on Wednesday after many users found they
were unable to try out the science fiction-themed shooter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Owners of Microsoft's Xbox 360 console were supposed to be
able to participate in the public test, or beta, of the game by
downloading a code included with "Crackdown," another Xbox 360
game published by Microsoft in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The public test began on Wednesday, but many users reported
trouble downloading the code to join, prompting "Halo 3"
developer Bungie Studios to say it was working with Microsoft's
Xbox Live online gaming service to fix the trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said the problem was not due to "Crackdown" or
the beta itself, but declined to offer more details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We know that we have a lot of fans that have been waiting
for the beta for months, and even took time off of work to
start early today. We really appreciate their enthusiasm, and
we hope the small delay won't dampen everyone's enjoyment of
the game," the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Halo 3" is one of the most anticipated games of the year
and  Microsoft is counting on it to drive sales of the Xbox 360
and strengthen its position against Sony Corp.'s (6758.T)
PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Co. Ltd.'s 7974.OS Wii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Halo 2" racked up $125 million in sales in its first 24
hours of availability when it was released in 2004. The first
two "Halo" games have sold a combined 11 million units,
according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A counter on Bungie's site said more than 8,000 people were
playing "Halo 3" on Wednesday afternoon and that more than
51,000 people had played the game in the last 24 hours.

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats to additional subscribers)
 (Adds more holding details, portfolio value, byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Karey Wutkowski&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON May 15 (Reuters) - Billionaire investor George
Soros reported on Tuesday that he had more than doubled his
stake in Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT.O) common stock to 415,497
shares as of March 31 from a previously disclosed stake of
198,075 shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Soros reported in a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission that he had also taken a stake in the call
options of the world's largest software maker with 684,000
shares worth about $19.06 million as of March 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overall, Soros' stake in Microsoft increased to $30.6
million from $5.9 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also reported that he had cut or dropped his stakes in a
number of other technology-oriented companies as of the end of
the first quarter, including Oracle Corp. ORCL.O, Take-Two
Interactive Software Inc. (TTWO.O), and eBay Inc. (EBAY.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Soros dropped his stakes in eBay and Take-Two, in which he
had previously held 101,745 shares and 1.01 million shares,
respectively as of Dec. 31. He cut his stake in Oracle to
99,000 shares from 808,000 shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also dropped his stakes in Goodyear Tire  Rubber Co.,
in which he had previously held 1.07 million shares, and in

&lt;p&gt; (Adds more holding details, portfolio value, byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Karey Wutkowski&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON May 15 (Reuters) - Billionaire investor George
Soros reported on Tuesday that he had more than doubled his
stake in Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT.O) common stock to 415,497
shares as of March 31 from a previously disclosed stake of
198,075 shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Soros reported in a filing with the U.S. Securities and

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst quotes, more details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Charlie Zhu and George Chen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI May 16 (Reuters) - JPMorgan's (JPM.N) China asset
management venture said on Wednesday it had fired a senior fund
manager over an official probe into stock trades, as Beijing
cracks down on growing irregularities in the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have just been informed by regulatory authorities that
they have started a formal investigation of our employee Tang
Jian over investment irregularities," Shanghai-based China
International Fund Management Co. said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Through our cooperation with regulators in the probe, we
found Tang Jian is suspected of using insider information to
engage in illicit investment activities," the statement said,
quoting China International Chief Executive Mandy Wang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our company removed Tang Jian from all posts in the
company last night and dismissed him," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tang, a well-known Chinese fund manager who joined the
company in 2004, could not be reached for comment. He is the
first Chinese fund manager to be sacked over suspicion of
illicit stock trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China International said the dismissal would not affect the
performance of its funds. It has about 40 billion yuan ($5.2
billion) under management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beijing is stepping up its efforts against irregularities
in the stock market, which has set a string of record highs
this year as investors divert large amounts of bank savings
into stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CLAMP-DOWN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), the
country's top securities watchdog, said on Saturday it would
intensify efforts to clamp down on growing insider trading and
stock price manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The CSRC statement helped to push down China's main stock
index .SSEC by 3.64 percent on Tuesday. The index regained
its footing on Wednesday with a more than 2 percent rebound by
the close, before the news on Tang Jian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industry sources told Reuters that the CSRC had issued a
notice to fund houses early this week, warning fund managers
against illegal securities trading and urging mutual funds to
improve internal controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said the investigation could deal a blow to the
image of China's nascent mutual fund industry, which has grown
rapidly over the past year to around 1 trillion yuan ($130
billion) on a booming stock market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fund industry came under tight media scrutiny in 2000,
when the influential financial magazine Caijing reported on
fund managers meeting in saunas -- where, unclothed, they were
free from worry about wiretaps -- to plot price manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China International said it had also found Tang did not
report to the company about his family's investment activities,
in violation of company rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under Chinese regulations, fund managers are barred from
buying securities on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ban has drawn fire from Chinese fund managers, who say
the rule is unreasonable as they are not even allowed to hold
units issued by their own funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industry sources say many fund managers have actually
ignored the ban to invest in stocks through accounts opened
under friends' or family members' names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Everyone does it. It is an open secret in the industry.
Tang is just unlucky," said Ding Jian, an analyst at China
Jianyin Investment Securities.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (New throughout) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 15 (Reuters) - SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI.N), the seventh-largest U.S. bank, said on Tuesday it has begun to unload Coca-Cola Co. (KO.N) shares it has held since 1919, and has expanded a cost-cutting plan now expected to save $530 million a year, $130 million more than expected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Atlanta-based SunTrust said it has sold 4.5 million Coke shares, or 9 percent of its holdings, and has begun a "sharply focused evaluation" to ensure that its remaining stake is "rationalized." It expects to complete the review by year end. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SunTrust also said it plans to buy back $750 million to $1 billion of stock over the rest of 2007, funded in part by proceeds from the Coke sale. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Like many banks, SunTrust has struggled with heightened competition and a tough interest-rate environment, which has crimped margins. It expects to achieve the $530 million of annual cost savings in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The sale of Coke shares is likely to gain the most attention from Tuesday's announcement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SunTrust acquired its stake in the world's largest soft drink maker when a predecessor took Coca-Cola public. The number of shares has grown through dividend reinvestments and stock splits. SunTrust also keeps a copy of the original formula for Coca-Cola in a vault. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of SunTrust closed Monday at $87.86 on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Jonathan Stempel, editing by Dave Zimmerman; Reuters Messaging: jon.stempel.reuters.com@reuters.net, 646 223 6317)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Multimedia versions of Reuters Top News are now available for: * 3000 Xtra: visit topnews.session.rservices.com &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     * BridgeStation: view story .134 For more information on Top News: topnews.reuters.com)) Keywords: SUNTRUST/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. cell phone carriers need to 
experiment more with pricing and offerings of video and other 
advanced cell phones services to drive greater use, Walt Disney 
Co. Internet Group President Steve Wadsworth said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We are a content provider and we are trying to drive a 
really innovative experience for consumers," Wadsworth told the 
Reuters Global Technology, Media and Telecoms Summit via 
teleconference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Today it's a pretty complicated and not a uniform process 
of getting content delivered through the various carriers," 
Wadsworth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney expects to see continued growth across several 
mobile categories in the United States, including ring tones, 
graphics, Web-based video games, and branded videos, such as 
live sports events that soon will be offered by ESPN, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney has seen "robust" 20 percent to 30 percent growth in 
U.S. sales of such mobile content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But mobile content sales could grow faster if obstacles in 
accessing and delivering content could be overcome, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is a need for much more standardization and 
streamlining of that process to get content from our brains, 
our creative development and software development, into a 
consumer's hands... I think that is probably one of the biggest 
issues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carriers have scores of different cell phone models, and 
the various companies work differently as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney would like carriers to experiment in pricing and 
advertising and encourage U.S. consumers, who are not used to 
personalizing their phones or using them to access information 
and entertainment, to buy more mobile content, Wadsworth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In the end, they are setting the prices," he said of the 
carriers. "There has not been the robust experimenting with 
prices to drive (the growth) we want to see."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. carriers also have been slow to try using advertising 
on the mobile Web, he said, adding that Disney generally 
controls advertising on any of its own sites and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney has been able to experiment more in foreign markets 
such as Japan, however, where it sells graphics and other items 
to personalize cell phones, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately Wadsworth said that a revamp of the Disney.com 
Web site intended to make it into more of an entertainment 
destination, was drawing much faster registrations of visitors, 
who also were spending more time on the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney has new games and features, such as allowing kids to 
create their own Web pages as part of its Xtreme Digital, or 
XD, offerings. The company aims to create an online social 
environment that is safe for kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Gina Keating in Los Angeles and Peter

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. legislation to overhaul immigration would change the procedure for obtaining permanent U.S. residency, or a green card, and offer a new Z visa for workers who entered the country illegally, according to Bush administration officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) and Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO.O) agree that work communications -- whether it's e-mail, messaging or phone calls -- will eventually come together and be delivered over Web networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The debate begins when the two deep-pocketed technology leaders -- Microsoft in software and Cisco in networking equipment -- argue over whose products will be the platform for the multibillion-dollar transformation of the office phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is the newcomer, but it sees software playing the central role, while Cisco expects to cash in on years of experience making telecommunications equipment such as switches and routers. More recently, it has sold millions of Web-ready phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's going to become a battle," Gartner analyst Bob Hafner said, noting the competition between the two gets the most attention but that other companies like Alcatel-Lucent ALU.PA, Avaya (AV.N) and Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) are big companies with large investments in work communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at this week's Reuters Global Technology, Media and Telecoms Summit, executives from Cisco and Microsoft touted their own products to deliver "unified communications," which combines Voice over Internet Protocol phone calls, e-mail, instant messages and conferencing technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Frankly we don't think anyone stands a chance competing with us in this space," Cisco Chief Development Officer Charles Giancarlo said. "We basically invented Voice over IP so we basically know better than anyone else where it's headed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco has been acquiring various small, niche technology companies to build up its unified communications product line. Over the past year, it agreed to buy online video conferencing company WebEx Communications, messaging security company IronPort Systems and mobile software company Orative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is already paying dividends. For its fiscal third quarter ended April 28, revenue at its main routing segment rose 16 percent from a year ago, while its unified communications revenue increased by nearly 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rivalry deepened after Microsoft and Canadian network equipment maker Nortel Networks Corp. NT.TO announced a broad alliance in unified communications last year. They are set to sell more products together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco, while forging a partnership with Microsoft to offer its customers Office, has also been expanding its alliance with IBM (IBM.N) to develop unified communications applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said software will transform VoIP phone systems with click-to-call capabilities right from its Outlook e-mail system and a "presence" feature to see where you are and then decide whether to call, message or e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We actually think customers that spend a lot of money on Voice over IP today often times may be making a mistake," said Jeff Raikes, president of Microsoft's business division. "Just changing the underlying plumbing for how you do voice communications is not all that interesting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raikes said the power of combining voice, e-mail and messaging onto one communication system can be magnified when coupled with applications found in the Office software suite, which is used by 450 million people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also believes it can lower the overall costs of implementing and running an IP phone system by using its software instead of a total offering from traditional players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company plans to introduce its first product in this segment later this year with Office Communications Server 2007 and accompanying Communicator software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The reality is that Cisco has been doing this for the last few years," Gartner's Hafner said. "Microsoft has a compelling story to tell, but they don't have too many products to deliver."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds services profitability goal, share movement, byline) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Philipp Gollner &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) said on Thursday it sees software accounting for nearly half of total profit by 2010, up from about 40 percent last year, as the company shifts toward more-profitable businesses from lower-margin segments such as computer hardware. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    International Business Machines Corp., the world's largest technology services company, also expects "emerging country" revenue to double by 2010, Chief Executive Samuel Palmisano said at an investor briefing at the company's T.J. Watson Research Center in New York. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Palmisano also said efforts to improve profitability in IBM's services business, which accounts for about half of revenue, should boost profit margins in that business by 2 percentage points by 2010. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM of Armonk, New York, expects so-called virtualization, a fast-growing newer technology that lets large computers run several operating systems simultaneously, to produce an additional $1 billion in gross profit in the next three years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM shares were down 45 cents at $105.42 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is up 29 percent this year as the company has boosted profit, mainly driven by its higher-margin software businesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Philipp Gollner; Editing by Dave Zimmerman; Telephone: +1 415 677-2547, E-mail: philipp.gollner@reuters.com)) Keywords: IBM OUTLOOK/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp., the world's largest technology-services company, said earnings per share could surge to $11 per share in 2010 from earnings of $9.49 billion, or $6.11 per share, in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company expects share buybacks to add about $1.10 and wider profit margins to contribute about $1 to per-share earnings in the next three years, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge told investors and analysts at a briefing at the company's T.J.

Revenue growth could add 75 cents per share, Loughridge said, and another $1.20 per share could come from growth initiatives and acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM told analysts and investors it expects to improve profitability in the next three years by boosting software's proportion of total pretax profit to nearly half by 2010, up from about 40 percent last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM, led by Chief Executive Samuel Palmisano, has been shifting to more-profitable businesses such as software from lower-margin segments such as computer hardware. The company sold its personal computer business to Lenovo Group Ltd. (0992.HK) in 2005 and its hard disk-drive unit to Hitachi Ltd. (6501.T) in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM expects "emerging country" revenue to double by 2010, Palmisano said at the investor briefing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palmisano also said efforts to improve profitability in IBM's services business, which accounts for about half of revenue, should boost profit margins in that business by 2 percentage points by 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM expects so-called virtualization, a fast-growing newer technology that lets large computers run several operating systems simultaneously, to produce an additional $1 billion in gross profit in the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares closed down 56 cents at $105.31 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. The stock is up 29 percent this year as the company has boosted profit, mainly driven by its higher-margin software businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. cell phone carriers need to 
experiment more with pricing and offerings of video and other 
advanced cell phones services to drive greater use, Walt Disney 
Co. Internet Group President Steve Wadsworth said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We are a content provider and we are trying to drive a 
really innovative experience for consumers," Wadsworth told the 
Reuters Global Technology, Media and Telecoms Summit via 
teleconference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Today it's a pretty complicated and not a uniform process 
of getting content delivered through the various carriers," 
Wadsworth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney expects to see continued growth across several 
mobile categories in the United States, including ring tones, 
graphics, Web-based video games, and branded videos, such as 
live sports events that soon will be offered by ESPN, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney has seen "robust" 20 percent to 30 percent growth in 
U.S. sales of such mobile content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But mobile content sales could grow faster if obstacles in 
accessing and delivering content could be overcome, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is a need for much more standardization and 
streamlining of that process to get content from our brains, 
our creative development and software development, into a 
consumer's hands... I think that is probably one of the biggest 
issues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carriers have scores of different cell phone models, and 
the various companies work differently as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney would like carriers to experiment in pricing and 
advertising and encourage U.S. consumers, who are not used to 
personalizing their phones or using them to access information 
and entertainment, to buy more mobile content, Wadsworth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In the end, they are setting the prices," he said of the 
carriers. "There has not been the robust experimenting with 
prices to drive (the growth) we want to see."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. carriers also have been slow to try using advertising 
on the mobile Web, he said, adding that Disney generally 
controls advertising on any of its own sites and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney has been able to experiment more in foreign markets 
such as Japan, however, where it sells graphics and other items 
to personalize cell phones, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately Wadsworth said that a revamp of the Disney.com 
Web site intended to make it into more of an entertainment 
destination, was drawing much faster registrations of visitors, 
who also were spending more time on the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney has new games and features, such as allowing kids to 
create their own Web pages as part of its Xtreme Digital, or 
XD, offerings. The company aims to create an online social 
environment that is safe for kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Gina Keating in Los Angeles and Peter

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp.'s public test of its upcoming "Halo 3" video game got off to a rocky start on Wednesday after many users found they were unable to try out the science fiction-themed shooter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Owners of Microsoft's Xbox 360 console were supposed to be able to participate in the public test, or beta, of the game by downloading a code included with "Crackdown," another Xbox 360 game published by Microsoft in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public test began on Wednesday, but many users reported trouble downloading the code to join, prompting "Halo 3" developer Bungie Studios to say it was working with Microsoft's Xbox Live online gaming service to fix the trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said the problem was not due to "Crackdown" or the beta itself, but declined to offer more details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know that we have a lot of fans that have been waiting for the beta for months, and even took time off of work to start early today. We really appreciate their enthusiasm, and we hope the small delay won't dampen everyone's enjoyment of the game," the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Halo 3" is one of the most anticipated games of the year and Microsoft is counting on it to drive sales of the Xbox 360 and strengthen its position against Sony Corp.'s PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Co. Ltd.'s Wii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Halo 2" racked up $125 million in sales in its first 24 hours of availability when it was released in 2004. The first two "Halo" games have sold a combined 11 million units, according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A counter on Bungie's site said more than 8,000 people were playing "Halo 3" on Wednesday afternoon and that more than 51,000 people had played the game in the last 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A new bid for immigration reform, backed by the White House and a bipartisan group of U.S. senators, would provide up to 1.5 million unauthorized farm workers temporary visas and give experienced farm hands a special boost in seeking legalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The special provisions for immigrant farm workers are a nod to U.S. agriculture's reliance on undocumented immigrants, who make up an estimated 70 percent of the U.S. farm workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"More than any industry, the future of U.S. agriculture is tied to the outcome of the immigration debate," Sen Larry Craig, an Idaho Republican, said in a statement as lawmakers revealed details of how the immigration package would affect farm workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sheer size of that group, about 1.1 million strong at this time, makes immigration a bottom-line issue for many U.S. farmers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, said the separate farm worker provisions of the package ensure a steady workforce and provide "a way out of the shadows for those who have worked in agriculture" and will do so in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the fate of the overall plan, expected to be debated next week in the Senate, is uncertain as it comes under fire from members of both parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the proposal, workers would have to show they had worked on a farm a minimum number of days in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who meet certain requirements could apply to receive a green card in about 8 years' time, after the bottleneck clears of people already waiting for green cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They would, however, get a bump to the front of the line at that point with extra points in the plan's "merit" system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're happy the leaders in this process have recognized agriculture is unique. We're eager to get a program in place," even if the plan isn't ideal, said Craig Regelbrugge, a co-chair of the Agriculture Coalition for Immigration Reform, which includes farm and other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the plan was designed to retain experienced workers for U.S. farms. "This piece is open to those who have been toiling in the fields and feeding America," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal would also seek to streamline a program for future seasonal workers and set up a number of additional provisions. Workers from Mexico or Central America, for example, would be required to "touchback" or return home before getting their green card, and workers would have to prove they can speak English before receiving a green card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) said on Friday it will buy aQuantive Inc. AQNT.O for $6 billion, paying an 85 percent premium to snap up one of the last large independent companies in a consolidating Web advertising market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In announcing its biggest acquisition ever, Microsoft has made its most aggressive move to date in trying to narrow the gap with Google Inc. (GOOG.O) in the online advertising market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, said it would pay aQuantive shareholders $66.50 a share, a hefty premium to the previous day's closing share price of $35.87.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of aQuantive shot up to $63.76 in midday Nasdaq trade while Microsoft fell 0.84 percent to $30.72.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The all-cash deal tops a $10 billion consolidation spree across the online advertising market, sparked when Google agreed to buy DoubleClick Inc. for $3.1 billion last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There had to have been some desperation for Microsoft to pay the price that it did," said Morningstar analyst Toan Tran, adding that Microsoft's sense of urgency probably heightened after it lost out on DoubleClick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sometimes, I am worried that Microsoft has Google tunnel vision. It's so worried what Google is doing that it becomes way too reactionary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo Inc. (YHOO.O) followed the Google deal by snatching up the 80 percent of Right Media it did not already own for $680 million. On Thursday, WPP Group Plc (WPP.L) said it would acquire 24/7 Real Media Inc. TFSM.O for $649 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft of Redmond, Washington said it would acquire aQuantive, based in nearby Seattle, to expand its push into Internet advertising through aQuantive's tools for serving up online ads and tracking their impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This deal takes our advertising business to a new level, and we are committed to earn a bigger slice of that $40 billion pie that's growing," Kevin Johnson, president of Microsoft's platforms and services division, said on a conference call,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft expects the deal to close in its next fiscal year starting in July. It would add revenue and operating expense in fiscal 2008, but will not change the outlook for operating income or earnings per share next year, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the wave, French advertising giant Publicis (PUBP.PA) agreed to buy online ad agency Digitas in December for $1.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of ValueClick Inc.VCLK.O, the last sizable independent player in the online ad market, rose nearly 9 percent to $30.25 as investors speculated it could be bought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YAHOO DEAL LESS LIKELY?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, several newspapers reported that Microsoft was considering a deal worth an estimated $40 billion to $50 billion to acquire Yahoo. A source close to the situation subsequently said that any talks had cooled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aQuantive acquisition reduces the chances of a megadeal with Yahoo, the largest online media company, according to Stifel Nicolaus analyst Scott Devitt. "Microsoft may be more interested in piecemealing together the highest-quality franchises that replicate what Yahoo already has," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A possible deal for Yahoo was seen largely as a way to join forces to slow the growth of Google, which continues to gain market share. Google's revenue grew three times faster than both companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, said it still wants antitrust regulators to scrutinize Google's DoubleClick acquisition. Microsoft's deal, on the other hand, is a combination of complementary assets and therefore should not raise antitrust concerns, Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft beat other competitors for aQuantive, saying there are only a small number of companies with enough advertising assets to help it gain scale in a market that the company sees growing at about 20 percent a year until 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AQuantive, a company founded in 1997, helps advertisers target online ads through its Atlas technology unit and offers Web-site development services through its design agency Avenue A/Razorfish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also operates an online ad network that connects buyers and sellers and provides behavioral targeting for advertisers. Microsoft said the deal would allow it to strengthen ties with advertisers, ad agencies and Web site publishers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acquisition is the latest in a series of smaller deals Microsoft has been making to extend its capabilities in placing ads on everything from video games to mobile phones to its Internet Protocol television platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Microsoft bought Massive Inc., which places ads in video games, and earlier this month, it acquired ScreenTonic, a European mobile phone advertising company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Ritsuko Ando and Michele Gershberg)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (adds details, context, stock action, byline) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Eric Auchard &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW YORK, May 18 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) said on Friday it would buy aQuantive Inc. AQNT.O for about $6 billion, or $66.50 a share, an 85 percent premium to the online advertising company's closing price on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of aQuantive shot to $63.95 in pre-opening trade, following news of the deal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The all-cash deal tops a dramatic one-month consolidation spree across the online advertising market sparked when Google Inc. (GOOG.O) agreed to buy DoubleClick for $3.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Yahoo Inc.

ValueClick, the last sizable independent player in the online advertising market saw its shares jump as much as 12.5 percent in premarket trade to $31.36 from $27.88. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    AQuantive helps advertisers target online ads through its Atlas technology unit and offers Web-site development services through its design agency Avenue A/Razorfish. It also operates an online advertising network that connects buyers and sellers and provides behavioral targeting for advertisers of Web site users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft said the deal would allow it to strengthen ties with advertisers, ad agencies and Web site publishers by enhancing the underlying mix of software and services its MSN consumer Internet business unit can deliver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The acquisition also provides Microsoft increased depth in building a new generation of advertising in markets such as video-on-demand and Internet Protocol Television, as well as cross-platform ad delivery, which bridges traditional and new media formats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    (Additional reporting by Ritsuko Ando in New York) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Eric Auchard in San Francisco; Editing by Steve Orlofsky; +1 415 677 3919; e-mail: eric.auchard@reuters.com))   . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. gave over $2 million 
in 2006 to groups Greenpeace called global warming skeptics 
even as the oil company campaigned to improve its 
climate-unfriendly image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Nevertheless, Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded 
company, cut its donations to these groups by more than 40 
percent from 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company still funds about 40 "skeptic groups," 
according to the report from Greenpeace, but Exxon disputed 
that many of the organizations were "global warming deniers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The groups listed include: the American Enterprise 
Institute, the Cato Institute, the Heritage Foundation, and the 
National Black Chamber of Commerce. Many of them concern 
themselves with a wide range of issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this year, Exxon said it had stopped funding a 
handful of groups, including the Competitive Enterprise 
Institute, that have downplayed the risks of carbon dioxide 
emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon has argued that its position on global warming has 
been widely misunderstood and has taken part in industry talks 
on greenhouse gas emission regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe that climate change is a serious issue and that 
action is warranted now," said Exxon Mobil spokesman Dave 
Gardner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gardner said in a statement that the company supports 
numerous public policy organizations on a variety of topics 
that do not represent Exxon or speak on its behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The groups Greenpeace cites are a widely varied group and 
to classify them as 'climate deniers' is wrong," he said, 
adding most of the groups had taken no position on climate 
change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the Greenpeace report is already receiving scrutiny 
in Washington, where Rep. Brad Miller, a North Carolina 
Democrat, has joined the environmentalist group in calling for 
Exxon to release its plans for contributions during the current 
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The support of climate skeptics, many of whom have no real 
grounding in climate science, appears to be an effort to 
distort public discussion about global warming," Miller said. 
"So long as popular discussion could be about whether warming 
was occurring or not, so long as doubt was widespread, 
consensus for action could be postponed."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CLIMATE DENIERS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Margo Thorning, chief economist of the American Council for 
Capital Formation said she took "strong exception" with 
Greenpeace's classification of the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If Greenpeace would take the time to examine the testimony 
I've given over the years, we've always said that climate 
change is a problem," Thorning said of her group, which says on 
its Web site that it promotes economic and environmental 
policies that promote economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're not climate deniers, we're problem solvers," she 
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Harry Alford, president and CEO of the National Black 
Chamber of Commerce, said his group believes that there has 
been a change to the climate, but that the cause is still 
uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Whether its cyclical -- something that happens every few 
hundred years -- or whatever, I don't know. I don't believe 
anyone has the answer yet," said Alford, head of the group that 
says on its Web site it is dedicated to economically empowering 
African-American communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think where Greenpeace gets upset is that we don't agree 
with them. But so what? I think their position is pretty 
radical and one-sided," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Greenpeace said it included groups that either tried to 
mischaracterized the science behind global warming or "obstruct 
the policy debate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spokesman Kert Davies said these arguments "hinged on the 
fact that this (global warming) is not an urgent problem or has 
no basis. Ultimately, it always boils down to, 'There is no 
problem, so why would you destroy the economy to solve it."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil's spending on the groups was less than a third 
of the company's $6.5 million in contributions for policy 
research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company and its foundations donated a total of $138.6 
million to non-profit organizations and social projects 
worldwide in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to the Greenpeace report, Exxon's spending was 
well below the nearly $3.6 million it spent on "denial groups" 
in 2005 and just over half the $3.9 million it shelled out in 
2004.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON May 18 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) said
its 150,000 barrel per day (bpd) Los Angeles-area refinery in
Torrance, California was operating normally on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources familiar with refinery operations said earlier on

spokeswoman Carolin Keith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sources familiar with refinery operations said Exxon's
100,000 bpd gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit
was having problems with its main air blower, leaks have
developed in an alkylation unit and problems have arisen on

originally planned to last two months when it began in early
February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The overhaul on hydrotreating, hydrocracking and two sulfur
recovery units was extended as the refinery ran into problems,
including a power outage in March.

&lt;p&gt;CARACAS May 18 (Reuters) - Venezuela's main oil union said
on Friday workers were prepared for a showdown with Exxon Mobil
(XOM.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N), companies ousted in
President Hugo Chavez's nationalizations of oil projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The two companies are both investors in the heavy crude
projects of the Orinoco Belt, which Chavez took over on May 1
as part of his efforts to build a socialist republic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are on alert ... because we are totally convinced that
these multinationals, Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, are not
going to sit quiet, because this decree has touched the most
deeply felt interests of U.S. imperialism," said Eudis Girot,
director of the Fedepetrol union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Venezuela slapped the largest tax bill in the nation's
history on Conoco last week. The U.S. company was the only
Orinoco investor not to sign an accord recognizing the nation's
takeover of the heavy crude projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other Orinoco investors include Total (TOTF.PA), BP (BP.L),
Chevron (CVX.N) and Statoil (STL.OL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chavez has given companies until June 26 to decide if they
will continue as minority partners in the project, but some of
the companies may take Venezuela to international arbitration
for contract violation.

it to shut the unit, two industry sources said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The crude distillation unit, the smaller of two at the

had said after the May 3 fire that it would restart the unit
"only when safe to do so", but industry sources had expected the
CDU to operate soon since it had not been seriously damanged.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A $6 billion purchase of Web 
advertising agency aQuantive Inc. may distract Microsoft Corp. 
from any potential merger with Yahoo Inc. (YHOO.O), but it does 
not derail the logic of such a deal, analysts said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We believe the odds of a deal happening over time actually 
increases," Goldman Sachs analyst Anthony Noto said in a note 
to clients after news of Microsoft's (MSFT.O) acquisition of 
online advertising company aQuantive AQNT.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Several newspapers reported this month that Microsoft was 
considering a deal worth an estimated $40 billion to $50 
billion to acquire Yahoo. A source close to the situation 
subsequently said at the time that any talks had cooled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Noto argued aQuantive does not plug the gap in Microsoft's 
Internet strategy, and "Yahoo remains the logical asset to fill 
the strategic hole."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Yahoo leapt 4.1 percent, or $1.18, to $29.75 on 
Nasdaq on speculation in the Web advertising market and wider 
media business about an eventual Microsoft bid for Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stifel Nicolaus analyst Scott Devitt was skeptical, 
however, saying Microsoft's $6 billion deal, its largest-ever 
acquisition, could be a prelude to a series of deals in which 
Microsoft assembles its own alternative to Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It lowers the probability that Microsoft is buying Yahoo, 
at least in the near term," Devitt said after Microsoft's 
agreement to pay a hefty premium for aQuantive -- 85 percent 
above the online advertiser's closing price on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft may be more interested in piecemealing together 
the highest-quality franchises that replicate what Yahoo 
already has," Devitt said in a phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo is the world's biggest Internet media company, 
attracting roughly 500 million Web users monthly to its network 
of properties. It derives the lion's share of its revenue from 
a mix of corporate brand display ads and Web search marketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Devitt pointed to Microsoft's move last week to buy a 4 
percent stake in online jobs site CareerBuilder.com, which 
competes with Yahoo's own job search site, HotJobs. 
CareerBuilder is owned largely by U.S. newspaper groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Assuming Microsoft is trying to create a "Yahoo on the 
cheap," the Stifel Nicolaus analyst speculated that Microsoft 
could be a buyer of smaller players in the mapping, online 
video, Web analytics and ad affiliate network categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Noto countered that while aQuantive gives Microsoft access 
to additional advertising customers and Web publishers, it is 
nowhere near the 300,000 to 500,000 advertisers that Yahoo and 
Google Inc. (GOOG.O) have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The deciding factor on Microsoft buying Yahoo is whether 
Yahoo is willing to sell," Noto said.&lt;/p&gt;

said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The other popular method of generating hydrogen fuel is to
convert fossil-based fuel such as natural gas into hydrogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Rosemead alkaline electrolyzer will produce up to 40
kilograms of hydrogen a day and can store up to 60 kilograms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As many as nine Hyundai fuel cell cars will be fueled at
the station and the project will monitor their performance, So

&lt;p&gt; (Adds comment from Chevron, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 21 (Reuters) - No. 2 U.S. oil company Chevron
Corp. (CVX.N) plans to sell its 12 percent stake in independent
power producer Dynegy Inc. (DYN.N), the companies said on
Monday, as Chevron moves to pare its non-core operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At Monday's closing price of $10.17 a share, Chevron's
stake would be worth around $985 million. After Dynegy
announced the planned sales, its shares fell 2.7 percent to
$9.90 in after-the-bell trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said its Chevron U.S.A. subsidiary intends to sell
all of its roughly 96.9 million Class A Dynegy shares in an
underwritten public offering through Goldman Sachs (GS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We want to focus on activities more closely allied with
our core business," said Chevron spokesman Don Campbell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have not earmarked the proceeds for any specific
purpose... They'll be commingled with other funds and used for
general corporate purposes," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron expects to take a gain in the second quarter from
the sale, but Campbell said the size of the gain will be
disclosed in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dynegy said the sales will not be dilutive to shareholders
because the shares being sold are already outstanding. It
expects the deal to close by May 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron took its stake in Dynegy in 1996 when it sold the
company its midstream natural gas assets. Dynegy agreed to
market Chevron U.S.A.'s natural gas production as part of that
deal, but the companies ended that arrangement in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dynegy sold its natural gas business in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last September, private equity fund LS Power agreed to take
a 40 percent stake in Dynegy as part of a complex deal in which
Dynegy also shelled out more than $2 billion for LS Power's
power plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before the LS Power deal was announced, Dynegy shares were
selling for about $5.76 a share.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 21 (Reuters) - Standard  Poor's on Monday
said it may raise its debt rating on Walt Disney Co. (DIS.N)
by one notch, citing the company's progress in reducing
leverage as earnings rose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; SP now rates Disney "A-minus," the seventh-highest
investment grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A decision on the rating will likely be made by September,
SP said in a statement. A rating upgrade could lower Disney's
borrowing costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this month, Disney earlier reported a net profit
ahead of Wall Street's targets following strong performances
from ESPN and movies like "Wild Hogs." Lower costs at its
movie studio and television network ABC also helped the
results. For details see [ID:nN08172909].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has been gradually reducing the ratio of debt
to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, SP said. In the fiscal quarter ended March 31,
EBITDA rose 28 percent, SP said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A key ingredient to an upgrade will be whether the
company can sustain its currently more conservative capital
structure and how management would react to a scenario of
weaker performance, whether driven by the economy or by
competitive circumstances," SP said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spreads on Disney's 5.875 percent notes due in 2017
widened on Monday to 82 basis points over Treasuries, out from
80 basis points on May 8, their previous significant trade,
according to MarketAxess.

&lt;p&gt;Citing "informed sources," Beverage Digest said the world's largest beverage company filed a Hart-Scott-Rodino Act notification with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which is required for proposed deals of significant size, so the FTC and Department of Justice can assess whether the deal is likely to reduce marketplace competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Coca-Cola spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beverage Digest said a deal, which it heard could be worth about $4 billion, is still likely subject to approval by Coca- Cola's board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glaceau, which is 30 percent owned by India's Tata Tea Ltd. TTTE.BO, maker of Tetley Tea, could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late last month, Beverage Digest reported that Coke, which is trying to enhance its portfolio of noncarbonated drinks, was in "serious talks" to acquire all or part of Glaceau, which controls 3.1 percent of the U.S. noncarbonated beverage market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glaceau, the No. 2 maker of enhanced water behind PepsiCo Inc.'s (PEP.N) Propel fitness water, sold 77 million cases last year, compared with Propel's 95 million, according to Beverage Digest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke shares were down 64 cents, or 1.2 percent, at $51.99 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wireless company Alltel Corp. (AT.N) said on Sunday it had agreed to be bought by TPG Capital and the buyout arm of Goldman Sachs (GS.N) for about $25 billion, making it the latest U.S. corporate giant to fall into private equity hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TPG Capital (formerly Texas Pacific Group) TPG.UL and GS Capital Partners will acquire Alltel for $71.50 per share in cash, the company said, in what would be among the largest private equity deals ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alltel's stock closed at $65.35 on Friday, with its shares steadily climbing throughout the year on speculation of a takeover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including the assumption of debt, the deal is worth around $27.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private equity firms typically buy companies and sell them a few years later, borrowing most of the money to make their purchases. A frothy debt market has fueled a massive wave of leveraged buyouts in the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last few weeks alone, automaker Chrysler Group, contact lens company Bausch  Lomb, and credit card processor Alliance Data all agreed to be bought by private equity firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have said Alltel shares trade around 9 times its cash flow, an attractive multiple to private equity buyers who are increasingly paying in the double-digits as competition for deals grows tougher. Buyout firms seek strong cash flows to pay down the debt borrowed for the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private equity interest for the company surfaced late last year and heated up in February when Alltel, the top rural U.S. wireless provider, said during an earnings conference call it was reviewing its strategic options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several teams of private equity suitors emerged earlier this month. Amid a wave of mergers and acquisitions in telecoms, Alltel Chief Executive Scott Ford had been eyeing a sale since the Little Rock, Arkansas-based company spun off its fixed-line arm last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alltel would likely aim for a sale agreement by April or May, analysts have previously said, ahead of a U.S. government sale of wireless airwaves that could take place as early as August. Rival bidders are barred from talking to each other once they register to take part in the auction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Sinead Carew and Jessica Hall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HANOI May 21 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) and Vietnam signed agreements on Monday that require government offices in Hanoi and other provinces to use licensed software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer and Vietnam Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung witnessed the signing of the deals with Vietnam's Posts and Telecommunications Ministry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Ballmer said Vietnam was "a real strong, committed member" of the World Trade Organisation, which it joined in January. Vietnam has one of the highest rates of software piracy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Later in the day, Ballmer witnessed Microsoft, state-run Vietindebank and the country's top IT services firm FPT FPT.HM signing a contract worth more than $3 million that allowed FPT to distribute 6,000 Microsoft licences to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Vietindebank is the country's second-largest lender. It is expected to be partially privatised this year with an IPO scheduled for the last quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "This is the largest contract among those involving Vietnamese enterprises in buying software copyright," FPT's chief executive, Truong Gia Binh, said at the signing ceremony. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "With this contract Vietnam will set the example for the countries which are facing many difficulties but are determined in implementing copyright issues," Binh said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In April 2006 Microsoft signed a copyright agreement with Vietnam's Finance Ministry to make it the first arm of the government to use licensed software.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The number of technology companies 
going public is expected to top last year's in 2007, although 
the market is still at a "rational, healthy level," JP Morgan's 
(JPM.N) head of technology investment banking said in an 
interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Ronald Pillar says the market is still selective in terms 
of which companies it will support, compared with the bubble 
era of the late 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Companies are a lot more mature and a lot of the 
venture-backed companies realize that (an initial public 
offering) is not the ultimate liquidity event," said Pillar. 
"If they want to go public they have to make sure they create 
value over time and accrete price over time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The pipeline is healthy," he added. "It's still a 
selective market -- which is great, we want that. It's not good 
in the long run to not have deals do well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tech IPOs have exceeded last year's so far in 2007 
according to figures from Dealogic. Year to date, there have 
been 18 tech IPOs valued at $2.5 billion, compared with 10 
valued at $1.3 billion the same time a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We think tech is such a good sector to be in because while 
things do mature, there is always the excitement and 
opportunity for new technologies and new ways to do things that 
create new markets and new companies," said Pillar, speaking 
ahead of an annual technology JPMorgan is hosting in Boston on 
Monday. "There's always a new opportunity, that's why the 
venture community is very active."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tech IPOs are still way below the 2000 peak of $34.5 
billion in value, however, with 2006's figure totaling $4.6 
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deal activity in general has been rapidly growing, with the 
value of U.S. technology firms targeted by buyers totaling $128 
billion in 2006, up 31 percent from 2006 although far below the 
$315 billion in the bubble year of 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That is coming as the technology industry matures from its 
high-growth era of the late 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These businesses were historically all about growth," said 
Pillar. "But now you're seeing a lot of public and private 
investors saying -- 'these are mature businesses and they 
should have mature capital structures'. Some of that is what is 
feeding into MA activity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pillar sees MA continuing across the technology sector in 
areas such as digital media, Internet and communications 
equipment. He sees particular activity in areas like IT 
services and payments, processing and software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Part of the driver for MA has come from the booming 
private equity industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Private equity has clearly become active in the technology 
sector, which traditionally was not the case," said Pillar. 
It's another source of competition for deals, and competition 
for deals leads to higher prices generally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some large technology buyouts of recent years have included 
a $17.6 billion buyout of chip maker Freescale Semiconductor 
and an $11.4 billion buyout of Sunguard Data Systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pillar said private equity firms had leveled the playing 
field in terms of how much they could bid against strategic 
bidders, and were in some cases outbidding trade buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Strategic, or trade buyers, traditionally outbid buyout 
firms as they are more able to generate cost-savings by 
combining businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But as private equity firms' portfolios grow, they are more 
able to generate the cost synergies that a strategic can 
achieve, Pillar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pillar says deal multiples -- a measure of the amount a 
buyer pays for a target -- have been rising over the past few 
years but doesn't see them "increasing by any stretch."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE May 21 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil (XOM.N) confirmed
on Monday it had restarted a 125,000 barrels per day (bpd)
crude distillation unit (CDU) at its Singapore refinery that
had been shut since May 3 after a fatal fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The... unit was commissioned safely and is now operating
normally," the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industry sources had told Reuters late last week that the
unit, previously reported to have a capacity of 115,000 bpd,
had been restarted on Friday after repairs were completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Repairs on the CDU, one of two units at its 296,000-bpd
Pulau Ayer Chawan facility, started three days after the fire
that killed three workers, the sources had said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An ExxonMobil spokeswoman declined to comment on the exact
restart date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There was minimal impact on ExxonMobil's supplies during
the 14-day shutdown as the affected unit on Jurong Island
churns out less than 20,000 bpd of diesel, against 360,000 bpd
exported from Singapore overall; and below 10,000 bpd of
gasoline, compared with 290,000 bpd of exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the U.S. oil major was seen offering unspecified
volumes of May-loading Abu Dhabi crude to Asian buyers. It is
not known if it sold any.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brief flash fire broke out in a cooling unit, called an
exchanger, that was undergoing maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokeswoman for Singapore's Ministry of Manpower, which
had enforced a stopwork order on ExxonMobil following the fire,
said it was lifted on May 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's Singapore plant has a total capacity of 605,000

&lt;p&gt;ANAHEIM, California (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney Interactive Studios is letting amusement park customers pillage a little extra content for its latest "Pirates of the Caribbean" game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The division showcased its first collaboration with Disney Parks and Resorts at Disneyland on Saturday, hours before the world premiere of "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" took place in the amusement park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning on Friday at both Disneyland and Walt Disney World in Orlando, consumers who bring their Nintendo DS and "At World's End" game to the Pirates of the Caribbean ride will be able to seek out 10 secured wireless hot spots to download free exclusive game content that won't be available anywhere else. The gaming stations will be marked with a Pirates "X" at different areas through Labor Day at both parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Nintendo DS game -- which will also be sold at both Disney parks, along with other versions of the "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" games -- follows the exploits of the third movie and features such characters as Captain Jack Sparrow, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann. There will be three different downloads available around the theme park ride, including one that gamers can access while standing in line for the Pirates ride that inspired the films and games. Players will be able to unlock bonus items such as unlimited health, new costumes for the three stars of the game and new weapons, characters and locations for the online dueling mode of the title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new area of Disneyland's Frontierland opens Friday called Pirates Lair, which previously was Tom Sawyer Island. The new attraction has been designed by Disney Imagineers to incorporate a pirate's life into a live-action show that was choreographed by Tony Angelotti, a stunt man in the three films. Disney Interactive Studios, which provided the software and download stations for the Nintendo DS hot spots, worked with the Imagineers to hide X's throughout this new area for gamers to find, as well as in other sections around the original ride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Interactive Studios had Xbox 360, Wii and Nintendo DS kiosks of "At World's End" set up for the world premiere of the third "Pirates" film for the roughly 2,500 guests to play before and after the film was shown in a closed-off section of Disneyland. The Xbox 360 and Wii game also were on display at the press reception area throughout the day. All attendees of the world premiere received a limited-edition "At World's End" Nintendo DS portable game player and Nintendo DS game as part of the gift bags handed out after the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Interactive Studios shipped seven versions of the new "Pirates" games across every current gaming platform. The new game incorporates action from both "Dead Man's Chest" and "At World's End" and expands the story beyond those films with new characters, plot twists and locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, which ousted Chief Executive Hank McKinnell last July after a disappointing pipeline of new medicines sent its share price to multi-year lows, said Levin had resigned to pursue career opportunities outside of Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John LaMattina, president of global research and development, will also leave his post and retire by the end of this year after 30 years with the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said a search had begun to replace both men, and each had agreed to remain during this period to ensure a smooth transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer CEO Jeff Kindler noted in the release that during LaMattina's tenure, the company had built up its oncology pipeline of drugs while increasing investment in biologics and vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is hoping new treatments, including Sutent for cancer, Chantix for smoking cessation and Lyrica for neuropathic pain, will help fuel profit growth longer term as other product setbacks and stiff competition for existing medicines pressure the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Kindler is pushing through a massive restructuring at Pfizer that includes several plant closures and job cuts along with a business realignment to spark a rebound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But until new treatments hit the shelves, those cost cuts are designed to fuel earnings growth. Last month, it said profits would rise as much as 4 percent this year, but sales would be roughly flat through 2008 due to patent expirations for its treatments of depression, allergies and high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barbara Ryan, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said the moves appeared to be part of that restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's a painful process for any organization and there's clearly going to be fallout," Ryan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LaMattina is well-regarded, Ryan added, noting his lengthy Pfizer career and she said it's not surprising that he would be moving toward retirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Ryan said, "the company has had more than its fair share of disappointments in research and development over the last five years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest setback to date came last December, when the New York-based drug maker halted clinical trials of its highest profile medicine in development, a cholesterol drug known as Torcetrapib, on safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, and its investors, were relying on the drug to replace its best selling drug, Lipitor, which is slated to lose patent protection as early as 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levin has played a less prominent role with Wall Street under McKinnell and now Kindler, Ryan added. He joined Pfizer in 1987 and was appointed CFO in February 2005, replacing David Shedlarz, who was promoted to Vice Chairman of Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background, byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Michael Flaherty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 20 (Reuters) - Wireless company Alltel Corp.
(AT.N) said on Sunday it had agreed to be bought by TPG Capital
and the buyout arm of Goldman Sachs (GS.N) for about $25
billion, making it the latest U.S. corporate giant to fall into
private equity hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TPG Capital (formerly Texas Pacific Group) [TPG.UL] and GS
Capital Partners will acquire Alltel for $71.50 per share in
cash, the company said, in what would be among the largest
private equity deals ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alltel's stock closed at $65.35 on Friday, with its shares
steadily climbing throughout the year on speculation of a
takeover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Including the assumption of debt, the deal is worth around
$27.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Private equity firms typically buy companies and sell them
a few years later, borrowing most of the money to make their
purchases. A frothy debt market has fueled a massive wave of
leveraged buyouts in the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the last few weeks alone, automaker Chrysler Group,
contact lens company Bausch  Lomb, and credit card processor
Alliance Data all agreed to be bought by private equity firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts have said Alltel shares trade around 9 times its
cash flow, an attractive multiple to private equity buyers who
are increasingly paying in the double-digits as competition for
deals grows tougher. Buyout firms seek strong cash flows to pay
down the debt borrowed for the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Private equity interest for the company surfaced late last
year and heated up in February when Alltel, the top rural U.S.
wireless provider, said during an earnings conference call it
was reviewing its strategic options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Several teams of private equity suitors emerged earlier
this month. Amid a wave of mergers and acquisitions in
telecoms, Alltel Chief Executive Scott Ford had been eyeing a
sale since the Little Rock, Arkansas-based company spun off its
fixed-line arm last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alltel would likely aim for a sale agreement by April or
May, analysts have previously said, ahead of a U.S. government
sale of wireless airwaves that could take place as early as
August. Rival bidders are barred from talking to each other
once they register to take part in the auction.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON May 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday passed legislation granting special immigration visas to hundreds of Iraqi and Afghan translators whose lives are endangered because they helped U.S. forces.

Democrats have pressed the Bush administration to open the United States to more Iraqi refugees and supporters, but acknowledged this legislation would help only a relatively small number of them. About 4 million of Iraq's 24 million people are thought to have fled their country because of sectarian violence or have left their homes for safer areas inside Iraq. Lawmakers have complained that last year, the United States accepted only 202 Iraqis out of its 70,000 refugee slots worldwide, despite the worsening refugee crisis.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TAIPEI May 22 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O), the world's leading software maker, said on Tuesday it is forming a joint venture with Taiwan's top telephone company to develop telecoms services for Taiwan firms doing business in China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The venture will target cross-strait small and medium-sized enterprises, Microsoft and its venture partner, Chunghwa Telecom (2412.TW), said at an event to announce the project. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The venture's offerings could include mobile value-added services, Web applications, Internet protocol television (IPTV) and voice over Internet protocol (VoIP). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "This shows that Bill Gates has confidence in the Taiwan market," said Chunghwa Telecom Chairman Ho Chen Tan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The two sides have signed a letter of intent and hope to have a final agreement by next month, said Michael Lee, special assistant to Chunghwa's chairman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Taiwan firms have invested some US$100 billion in China, and the island counts China as its top trading partner and favourite investment destination, according to private analyst estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    An estimated 1 million Taiwanese now live in China, or about 4 percent of Taiwan's total population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The deal was announced after Chunghwa's shares closed up 0.16 percent at T$63.00 on Tuesday, lagging a 0.58 percent rise on the broader market .TWII. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Sheena Lee, editing by Rachael Barker; Reuters Messaging: sheena.lee.reuters.com@reuters.net; +886 2500-4881)) Keywords: MICROSOFT CHUNGHWA/TAIWAN &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Investors who think it is too late to get into commodities-related stock because the market has risen so much are "crazy" as prices will only go higher due to tight supply and growing demand, JPMorgan Asset Management said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ian Henderson, fund manager of the UK-registered JPMorgan Natural Resources Fund, told Reuters in an interview that China's latest move to rein in its booming economy would dampen speculative activity but metal inventories remained low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think people are crazy not to be in it (commodities). I just can't imagine anybody being so naive as to imagine this is not a revolution like the way people have never seen before in their lifetimes," Henderson said late Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's absurd to imagine that with the enormous amount of infrastructure going on, whether that be railroads or roads or power stations or subways or airports, this is other than a revolution in terms of demand going on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund, which invests mostly in stock and is 1.18 billion pounds ($2.33 billion) in size, has handed investors more than 22 percent in returns this year as of the end of April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its portfolio consists of: base metal and diversified 37 percent; gold and precious metals 27.5 percent; energy 25 percent; diamonds/other 8.2 percent, with the rest in cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henderson, with 35 years of investing experience, also said there was no risk in investing commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For mineral producers the current situation with the arrival of China, India and other emerging markets as major commodity consumers sitting down to the table, can be likened to a hostess having prepared a dinner for eight having a further eight guests arrive for whom no food has been bought or prepared," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund manager said that the emerging economies accounted for 29 percent of the world's gross domestic product, bigger than the United States, and were growing by 5 to 10 percent a year, supporting the demand for raw materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The basic outlook is that most people imagine that mining companies will be able to bring new projects into production on time and on budget," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The honest truth is that at least in the past five years people's expectations for production growth had been almost twice as great as the actuality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy supply would also remain tight as companies were finding it difficult and expensive to accelerate their exploration programs, said Henderson, who has run the fund since 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for stock picks, the fund manager said he liked "small and micro cap" companies, where half of his fund is allocated, but he declined to give any names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, he added, there was good value in the larger companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Among the big companies, I would buy almost all of them today. All the major companies are undervalued quite a lot. And if I have to rank them in this very minute, I would be buying Norilsk (GMKN.MM), CVRD (VALE5.SA) (RIO.N)," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their commodity mixes are quite favorable. The markets are not valuing them using sensible forward earnings estimate. In addition, in the case of Norlisk there will be an $8 billion return of equity by way of a distribution of their energy subsidiary next year."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI (Reuters) - IBM, the world's largest technology

its country head said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp. (IBM.N) currently has 
more than 10,000 people on contract in mainland China, Henry 
Chow, Chairman of IBM Greater China Group, told Reuters on the

hire 100 people a week," Chow said, adding that seasonal 
fluctuations meant that some periods needed more manpower and 
some less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overall, however, Chow said he expected to see at least a 
10 percent increase in the company's China headcount per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM had 22 branch offices in China at the end of last year 
and hopes to raise that number to 26 this year, IBM 
representatives said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co. (KO.N) has filed a 
premerger notification with U.S. regulators about the proposed 
acquisition of vitamin water maker Glaceau, industry 
publication Beverage Digest reported on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Citing "informed sources," Beverage Digest said the world's 
largest beverage company filed a Hart-Scott-Rodino Act 
notification with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which is 
required for proposed deals of significant size, so the FTC and 
Department of Justice can assess whether the deal is likely to 
reduce marketplace competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Coca-Cola spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beverage Digest said a deal, which it heard could be worth 
about $4 billion, is still likely subject to approval by Coca- 
Cola's board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glaceau, which is 30 percent owned by India's Tata Tea Ltd. 
TTTE.BO, maker of Tetley Tea, could not immediately be 
reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Late last month, Beverage Digest reported that Coke, which 
is trying to enhance its portfolio of noncarbonated drinks, was 
in "serious talks" to acquire all or part of Glaceau, which 
controls 3.1 percent of the U.S. noncarbonated beverage market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glaceau, the No. 2 maker of enhanced water behind PepsiCo 
Inc.'s (PEP.N) Propel fitness water, sold 77 million cases last 
year, compared with Propel's 95 million, according to Beverage 
Digest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke shares were down 64 cents, or 1.2 percent, at $51.99 
on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ANAHEIM, California (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney 
Interactive Studios is letting amusement park customers pillage 
a little extra content for its latest "Pirates of the 
Caribbean" game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The division showcased its first collaboration with Disney 
Parks and Resorts at Disneyland on Saturday, hours before the 
world premiere of "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" 
took place in the amusement park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beginning on Friday at both Disneyland and Walt Disney 
World in Orlando, consumers who bring their Nintendo DS and "At 
World's End" game to the Pirates of the Caribbean ride will be 
able to seek out 10 secured wireless hot spots to download free 
exclusive game content that won't be available anywhere else. 
The gaming stations will be marked with a Pirates "X" at 
different areas through Labor Day at both parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new Nintendo DS game -- which will also be sold at both 
Disney parks, along with other versions of the "Pirates of the 
Caribbean: At World's End" games -- follows the exploits of the 
third movie and features such characters as Captain Jack 
Sparrow, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann. There will be three 
different downloads available around the theme park ride, 
including one that gamers can access while standing in line for 
the Pirates ride that inspired the films and games. Players 
will be able to unlock bonus items such as unlimited health, 
new costumes for the three stars of the game and new weapons, 
characters and locations for the online dueling mode of the 
title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A new area of Disneyland's Frontierland opens Friday called 
Pirates Lair, which previously was Tom Sawyer Island. The new 
attraction has been designed by Disney Imagineers to 
incorporate a pirate's life into a live-action show that was 
choreographed by Tony Angelotti, a stunt man in the three 
films. Disney Interactive Studios, which provided the software 
and download stations for the Nintendo DS hot spots, worked 
with the Imagineers to hide X's throughout this new area for 
gamers to find, as well as in other sections around the 
original ride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Interactive Studios had Xbox 360, Wii and Nintendo 
DS kiosks of "At World's End" set up for the world premiere of 
the third "Pirates" film for the roughly 2,500 guests to play 
before and after the film was shown in a closed-off section of 
Disneyland. The Xbox 360 and Wii game also were on display at 
the press reception area throughout the day. All attendees of 
the world premiere received a limited-edition "At World's End" 
Nintendo DS portable game player and Nintendo DS game as part 
of the gift bags handed out after the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Interactive Studios shipped seven versions of the 
new "Pirates" games across every current gaming platform. The 
new game incorporates action from both "Dead Man's Chest" and 
"At World's End" and expands the story beyond those films with 
new characters, plot twists and locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA (Reuters) - Coca-Cola's (KO.N) president said on Wednesday the beverage maker was open to making acquisitions, but declined to comment on recent speculation the company was interested in vitamin water maker Glaceau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There are some rumors in the marketplace always about us acquiring certain companies," Muhtar Kent told a group of reporters attending grand opening events in Atlanta for the new World of Coca-Cola attraction. "We do not comment on rumor and that's all I can say."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry publication Beverage Digest, citing "informed sources," reported earlier this week that Coca-Cola had filed a premerger notification with U.S. regulators about a proposed purchase of Glaceau, which is 30 percent owned by India's Tata Tea Ltd. TTTE.BO, and is the No. 2 maker of enhanced water behind PepsiCo Inc.'s (PEP.N) Propel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kent, named president and chief operating officer of Atlanta-based Coca-Cola in December, said that while boosting growth in existing businesses was the company's main priority, "we actually are very active in bringing in new portfolios to enhance, to supplement, to complement" the soft drink maker's product offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the future you will see more examples of that as we go around the world," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kent, a Turkish native, also said Coca-Cola was looking to use "inspirational consumer marketing" to tackle sluggishness in its North American market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first quarter, Coca-Cola said case volume, a key industry metric, fell 3 percent in North America but rose in Africa, Latin America and other international markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What you're going to see in the days and months ahead in our flagship market ... is a greater commitment to winning at the point of sale," Kent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To aid the operations, Coke brought some senior international executives to work in North America and had resolved issues with the region's bottlers, Kent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola shares eased 15 cents to close at $51.33 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of institutional investors and shareholder activists on Wednesday called on Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) shareholders to vote against the reappointment of a board member in protest of the company's stance on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group, which includes the California State Teachers Retirement System, labor funds and the treasurers of six U.S. states, is pushing for the removal of Michael Boskin, who is chairman of Exxon's public issues committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While Exxon Mobil's competitors are moving aggressively on climate change, this company -- one of the world's largest refiners and marketers of oil products -- continues to hide its head in the sand rather than acknowledge the business implications of climate change," Connecticut State Treasurer Denise Nappier said on a conference call with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholders backing the moves own nearly 100 million Exxon shares, according to a spokesman for the group, less than 2 percent of the more than 5.6 billion shares outstanding the company had at the end of the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group said that Boskin, a Stanford University economist, has refused five times to meet with investors about climate change issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Exxon Mobil spokesman Gantt Walton said that Boskin "has invested substantial time and resources over the past year addressing the concerns of Ms. Nappier and other shareholder groups."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Boskin had personally responded to all of Nappier's letters and had arranged for shareholders, including a representative for Nappier, to meet with management on climate change issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dr. Boskin has been very forthcoming in providing the position of the board," Walton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon -- the world's largest publicly traded oil company and the biggest company by market capitalization -- has long been a lightning rod for environmentalists who claim the company has worked to mislead the public about the causes of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists believe the use of fossil fuels causes global warming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the company has recently worked to improve its image, dropping its funding of some companies that have downplayed the risks of greenhouse gas emissions and saying its position on climate change has been misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the investors behind the attempt to remove Boskin remained unmoved by the company's about face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's time that shareholders and investors hold Exxon Mobil accountable," said California State Controller John Chiang. "It is our money on the line. It is absolutely up to the board of directors to respond to the people they are responsible for serving."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's annual meeting is scheduled for May 30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON May 23 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Asset Management
(JPM.N) is the now the world's biggest hedge fund, according to
a survey released on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Boasting $33 billion in hedge fund assets, JP Morgan rose
23 spots to beat last year's winner, Goldman Sachs (GS.N) to
No. 1 in Alpha magazine's annual listing of the industry's
biggest hedge fund portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three years ago, JP Morgan took a stake in Highbridge
Capital Management, adding enough assets to significantly shake
up the rankings this year in the fast-growing, lightly
regulated hedge fund industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Together the world's hedge funds invest roughly $1.5
trillion in assets, more than double what they had in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs, which moved into the No. 1 spot in 2006 with
$21 billion in assets, slipped in 2007 after its secretive
Global Alpha fund fell on hard times last year. Alpha said it
now has $32.5 billion in assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new rankings show how hedge funds have bulked up over
the last year as pension funds, endowments, charities and other
investors want a piece of these funds that often promise to
make money in all markets by using techniques that are off
limits at mutual funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New York-based Goldman, one of the industry's most
preferred prime brokers helping finance and clear trades for
hedge funds and often helping managers find investors, lost the
head of its alternative strategies unit when Lehman Brothers
said it hired George Walker in April 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In another shake-up, Renaissance Technologies Corp., run by
former mathematics professor James Simons who hires only
scientists to develop the firm's computer-run strategies,
vaulted into No. 6 from No. 26 in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alpha said the fund has $26 billion under management, but
more recent figures put assets closer to $30 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Renaissance's $6 billion Medallion Fund generated
annualized returns of over 33 percent over 15 years to 2004,
according to marketing material obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Westport, Connecticut-based Bridgewater Associates, with
$30.2 billion in assets, slipped to the No. 3 spot from No. 2,
while New York-based D.E. Shaw Group, which has $27.3 billion
in assets, moved to No. 4 from its No. 3 spot last year.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court declined on Wednesday to reconsider its decision to make Exxon Mobil Corp. pay $2.5 billion in punitive damages for the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds company reaction, quotes from dissent,

&lt;p&gt; By Adam Tanner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO May 23 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court
declined on Wednesday to reconsider its decision to make Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) pay $2.5 billion in punitive damages for
the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The punitive damages ruling against Exxon -- originally $5
billion in 1994 -- has been the subject of a long legal battle
between the oil company and 32,000 fishermen, Alaska natives
and property owners who were awarded the damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals based in San Francisco has
already looked at the Exxon Valdez case on three occasions,
taking into account new U.S. Supreme Court rulings in later
examinations of the biggest oil spill in U.S. history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In December, the court had already cut $2 billion off a
$4.5 billion verdict against the company, saying the earlier
penalty was too harsh when compared with the economic harm
caused by the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The split three-judge panel court had also said the energy
company's prompt action to clean up the oil and compensate
fishermen and others for economic losses lowered the

reconsider the matter wrote that punitive damages were not
appropriate in the much-litigated case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "For centuries, companies have built their seaborne
businesses on the understanding that they won't be subject to
punitive damages if they '(n)either directed it, nor
countenanced it, nor participated in' the wrong," Judge Alex
Kozinski wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Supreme Court ruled in April 2003 that punitive damages
must be reasonable and proportionate to the harm that was
suffered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The plaintiffs here suffered no physical injuries - their
only claim was that the oil spill harmed their commercial
fishing interests," wrote Judge Kozinski, who was appointed by
President Ronald Reagan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "After the accident, Exxon acted as a model corporation -
it spent over $2 billion to remove oil from the water and
adjacent shore and $900 million to restore damaged natural
resources."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Romanian born-judge, famous for his caustic remarks,
also added: "If your vessels sail into the vast waters of the
Ninth Circuit, a jury can shipwreck your operations through
punitive damages."

&lt;p&gt; (Adds description of investment firm in paragraph 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO May 23 (Reuters) - Greystripe, a distributor
of mobile games supported by advertising, said on Wednesday it
has received $8.9 million in funding led by a venture capital
firm with ties to Walt Disney Co. (DIS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Greystripe investment comes amid rising interest in ads
tied to video games, and as game publishers and advertisers
target the growing number of mobile phone users worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; San Francisco-based Greystripe runs Gamejump.com, where
some 800 games from publishers like Konami Corp. (9766.T) can
be downloaded and played on mobile phones. Short ads run at the
start and end of a game, and Greystripe gets a slice of that
revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're at an interesting convergence of mobile, advertising
and games," Greystripe Chief Executive Michael Chang said in an
interview. "There is all this content that wants to get out
there and all these consumers that want to get that content."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The investment was led by Steamboat Ventures, which says
only that it is "affiliated" with Disney and often supports
startups that are complimentary to Disney's business. The other
backers are Monitor Ventures and Incubic Venture Capital, which
invested $1.2 million in Greystripe's first funding round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Greystripe plans to use the new money to push abroad, which
already accounts for 85 percent of its users, Chang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mobile phone sales are running at about 1 billion units a
year, led by fast-growing markets such as India and China where
they are often the main computing and entertainment devices of
consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In March, Google Inc. (GOOG.O) bought Adscape, which can
present ads within a video game, following on the heels of
Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT.O) $200 million purchase last year of
in-game ad firm Massive Inc.

&lt;p&gt;BOGOTA May 23 (Reuters) - Colombia's national coffee

distribution points in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia said
the initial plan would bring products under its Juan Valdez
brand to 11,000 restaurants served by the world's No. 1
beverage company in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The accord has huge potential if you remember that
Coca-Cola food service attends 425,000 restaurants in the
United States. Reaching half of that potential, Colombia would
export 500,000 bags of processed coffee," said federation
director Gabriel Silva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The federation signed a similar deal with Japan 15 years
ago. Japan is the second largest market for Colombian coffee
after the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Silva said Colombia aimed to sell 45,000 bags of processed
coffee a year for the 11,000 Coca-Cola sales points, which he
estimated represented about $1 million a year in extra earnings
from processed coffee exports.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters Life!) - These days, the turnstiles rarely stop turning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year 4.5 million visitors flocked to Hong Kong's Ocean Park -- a marine conservation focused theme park which only a few years back faced crisis on mounting deficits and a formidable challenge from Disney's first magic kingdom in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter Allan Zeman, 58, a maverick Canada-born entrepreneur and longtime Hong Kong resident -- who became the park's chairman around the deadly SARS respiratory epidemic in 2003 which scared off most visitors, forcing the park to contemplate closure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm a can-do guy ... I turn the negative to the positive," Zeman told Reuters in his white-marbled, ultra-modern office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We decided to upgrade the park and came up with a masterplan," said the man also known for gentrifying a shabby district into Hong Kong's trendy nightlife hub of Lan Kwai Fong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, Zeman's masterplan has defied skeptics -- helped by a strongly rebounding economy -- transforming Ocean Park from a sleepy, fading has-been, into a world beater that's brushed off Hong Kong Disneyland's challenge since it opened in mid-2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disneyland said they had more than five million visitors in their first year, short of its 5.6 million target. Second year figures will be released this September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKING A SPLASH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, Fortune magazine rated the government owned and non-profit Ocean Park one of the world's top 10 amusement parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hands up we had more paid attendance (than Disney) in its first year," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All (Ocean Park) needed was a little TLC - tender, loving, care," he added with a laugh. "The paint was peeling off, you're in hospitality ... you want to make it a happy place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zeman did more than give the Park and its famous cable-cars a new paintjob. He brought in a fresh management team, overhauled its "inedible" food outlets and launched a zesty marketing blitz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a recent visit, the park resembled a mass construction site, with a slew of hotels and attractions slated as part of a HK$5.5 billion ($705 million) revamp to be completed by 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The park's also enlarging an enclosure for its four pandas -- including two new cubs sent by China last month to mark the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong's return from British to Chinese rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ocean Park is home-grown and it truly represents Hong Kong," said Ng Chi-kong, a 21-year-old student: "I've been coming since I was a kid, it would've been a great shame if Disney forced it to close down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ocean Park is something very special to Hong Kong people," said Zeman "It went from what was a sleepy park to playing with the big boys."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Top IPO underwriter Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS.N) this week launched a platform allowing an exclusive club of big investors to trade unregistered, privately placed securities, in the latest challenge to U.S. equity markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private placements have become a big deal on Wall Street, another alternative for companies who want to raise capital but don't want the regulatory and disclosure requirements that come with a public listing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman on Monday helped underwrite the private sale of 15 percent of hedge fund manager Oaktree Capital Management for $880 million. As part of that sale, Oaktree told investors they would be able to buy and sell Oaktree shares through the new Goldman Sachs Tradable Unregistered Equity system, or GSTRuE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new system comes two weeks after Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. (NDAQ.O) CEO Bob Greifeld said the exchange operator expected to launch a similar private placement "portal" as early as next month. (Double click on ID:nN04325377 to see Reuters story.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Morgan Stanley and other broker dealers are planning similar systems to tap the demand among investors and companies for a more transparent and liquid private placement market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, according to Nasdaq, $162 billion of capital was raised through unregistered private placements compared with $154 billion through IPOs, which are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman declined to comment on Oaktree or offer detail about its plans for GSTRuE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today we'll see how the system works and then as it evolves, as it develops, we'll see what happens," spokesman Ed Canaday said on Thursday. "We've put a significant first stake in the ground."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under SEC rules, companies can sell securities without registering them as long as issues are limited to qualified institutional buyers, investors with at least $100 million of assets, and there are no more than 499 stockholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GSTRuE is based on Goldman's RediPlus electronic trading system. Participants in the unregistered stock platform can view indicated bids and offers and last sale prices. Investors wanting buy or sell securities then must contact their broker to make a trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's spokesman added that the bank will monitor the market for private securities issued on its system, to ensure the number of investors stays below the 500 threshold. Goldman will also serve as a market maker to GSTRuE clients, committing capital to facilitate trades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court declined on 
Wednesday to reconsider its decision to make Exxon Mobil Corp. 
pay $2.5 billion in punitive damages for the 1989 Exxon Valdez 
oil spill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The punitive damages ruling against Exxon -- originally $5 
billion in 1994 -- has been the subject of a long legal battle 
between the oil company and 32,000 fishermen, Alaska natives 
and property owners who were awarded the damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals based in San Francisco has 
already looked at the Exxon Valdez case on three occasions, 
taking into account new U.S. Supreme Court rulings in later 
examinations of the biggest oil spill in U.S. history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In December, the court had already cut $2 billion off a 
$4.5 billion verdict against the company, saying the earlier 
penalty was too harsh when compared with the economic harm 
caused by the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The split three-judge panel court had also said the energy 
company's prompt action to clean up the oil and compensate 
fishermen and others for economic losses lowered the 
reprehensibility of Exxon's conduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the company had asked the court to rehear the case in 
hopes to further reduce the penalty. It has argued that 
punitive damages should not be more than $25 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil said Wednesday it would appeal the case to the 
Supreme Court, the last avenue for reconsideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Ninth Circuit Court ruling now allows the case to be 
appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court where the case should be 
decided," said Exxon spokesman Mark Boudreaux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have said many times that it is our continued view that 
the U.S. Supreme Court needs to provide more definitive 
guidance to the lower courts on the law governing punitive 
damages," he added.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DISSENTING VIEWS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In its ruling on Wednesday, the court said a larger 
15-member en banc group of judges would not reconsider the 
matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A judge of the court called for a vote on whether to 
rehear the matter en banc," the court wrote. "The matter failed 
to receive a majority of votes of the nonrecused active judges 
in favor of en banc consideration."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two judges who dissented from the decision not to 
reconsider the matter wrote that punitive damages were not 
appropriate in the much-litigated case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "For centuries, companies have built their seaborne 
businesses on the understanding that they won't be subject to 
punitive damages if they '(n)either directed it, nor 
countenanced it, nor participated in' the wrong," Judge Alex 
Kozinski wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Supreme Court ruled in April 2003 that punitive damages 
must be reasonable and proportionate to the harm that was 
suffered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The plaintiffs here suffered no physical injuries - their 
only claim was that the oil spill harmed their commercial 
fishing interests," wrote Judge Kozinski, who was appointed by 
President Ronald Reagan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "After the accident, Exxon acted as a model corporation - 
it spent over $2 billion to remove oil from the water and 
adjacent shore and $900 million to restore damaged natural 
resources."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Romanian born-judge, famous for his caustic remarks, 
also added: "If your vessels sail into the vast waters of the 
Ninth Circuit, a jury can shipwreck your operations through 
punitive damages."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Michael Erman in New York)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of institutional investors and 
shareholder activists on Wednesday called on Exxon Mobil Corp. 
(XOM.N) shareholders to vote against the reappointment of a 
board member in protest of the company's stance on climate 
change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The group, which includes the California State Teachers 
Retirement System, labor funds and the treasurers of six U.S. 
states, is pushing for the removal of Michael Boskin, who is 
chairman of Exxon's public issues committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While Exxon Mobil's competitors are moving aggressively on 
climate change, this company -- one of the world's largest 
refiners and marketers of oil products -- continues to hide its 
head in the sand rather than acknowledge the business 
implications of climate change," Connecticut State Treasurer 
Denise Nappier said on a conference call with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shareholders backing the moves own nearly 100 million Exxon 
shares, according to a spokesman for the group, less than 2 
percent of the more than 5.6 billion shares outstanding the 
company had at the end of the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The group said that Boskin, a Stanford University 
economist, has refused five times to meet with investors about 
climate change issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Exxon Mobil spokesman Gantt Walton said that Boskin 
"has invested substantial time and resources over the past year 
addressing the concerns of Ms. Nappier and other shareholder 
groups."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said Boskin had personally responded to all of Nappier's 
letters and had arranged for shareholders, including a 
representative for Nappier, to meet with management on climate 
change issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Dr. Boskin has been very forthcoming in providing the 
position of the board," Walton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon -- the world's largest publicly traded oil company 
and the biggest company by market capitalization -- has long 
been a lightning rod for environmentalists who claim the 
company has worked to mislead the public about the causes of 
climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scientists believe the use of fossil fuels causes global 
warming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the company has recently worked to improve its image, 
dropping its funding of some companies that have downplayed the 
risks of greenhouse gas emissions and saying its position on 
climate change has been misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the investors behind the attempt to remove Boskin 
remained unmoved by the company's about face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's time that shareholders and investors hold Exxon Mobil 
accountable," said California State Controller John Chiang. "It 
is our money on the line. It is absolutely up to the board of 
directors to respond to the people they are responsible for 
serving."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's annual meeting is scheduled for May 30.&lt;/p&gt;

(MSFT.O) said on Wednesday it now has "all the pieces" it needs to build a successful advertising business after its acquisition of digital advertising company aQuantive Inc. AQNT.O. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Speaking at the Goldman Sachs Internet Conference in Las Vegas, Microsoft Chief Advertising Strategist Yusuf Mehdi said the company does not need to acquire more scale in order to be a success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Last week, Microsoft said it would acquire aQuantive for $6 billion to gain a foothold in the online advertising business dominated by its rivals Google Inc.

Ltd. is the biggest maker of memory chips. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    They will work through 2010 to design, develop and produce the advanced-generation chips that can be used in products from mobile devices to supercomputers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Technologies using ever diminishing circuit sizes help boost chip makers' productivity, but companies are finding the ceaseless move to smaller sizes increasingly difficult. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Major new challenges are expected at the 32-nanometre node, both in materials as well as device structures," said Kwon Oh-Hyun, president of Samsung's System LSI business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Rhee So-eui, editing by Keiron Henderson; Reuters Messaging: soeui.rhee.reuters.com@reuters.net; soeui.rhee@reuters.com +822 3704 5650)) Keywords: IBM SAMSUNG/CHIPS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG May 26 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O)
plans to add 1,200 staff for research and development in
mainland China this year at an estimated cost of US$60 million,
the South China Morning Post reported on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software company has also bought land
to set up corporate campuses in Beijing and Shanghai, Zhang

on the mainland, last year invested about US$150 million "in
just people costs" in China and will "add probably 40 percent

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Tim McLaughlin &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 25 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS.N), a barometer of Wall Street's health, said on Friday it expects its head count to increase in the high single-digits this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    That's within the range of previous years, a Goldman Sachs spokesman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Investors are keeping a sharp eye on the hiring trends of Wall Street investment banks to see if there's any indication of a slowdown from record-setting profits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Goldman is always a good indicator of what's going on," said Brian Drum, president of executive search firm Drum Associates. "These large companies have tons and tons of openings. I'm not sold there's going to be a recession." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The BreakingViews column in Friday's Wall Street Journal said Goldman is taking a "pause" on hiring that goes beyond the usual season summer slowdown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In general, Wall Street recruiters say there are soft spots for hiring, but point to a scarce supply of middle managers and risk containment specialists, for example. In addition, the private equity and investment bank operations of Wall Street companies remain strong as global deal-making activity continues at a torrid pace. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     "We are continuing to recruit laterally and at colleges and universities,"  Goldman Sachs said in a statement. "We expect to grow this year in the high single-digits. However, as with all expenses, we continually monitor hiring to ensure it is both prudent and appropriate." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     Goldman reported a head count of 26,467 employees in its annual report for 2006, with 42 percent outside the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. MER.N, the world's largest brokerage, also said there's no change in the hiring practices of recent years.  "Merrill Lynch has selectively hired on an opportunistic basis in its strategy to strengthen areas of the firm, and continues to do so," the company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    John Carter, a vice president at New York fixed-income recruiter Hagan-Ricci Group, said while some companies continue to grow this year, others have been hit hard by the woes in the subprime mortgage market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "There's no question firms that were out there in risk-taking mode have changed" their hiring patterns, Carter said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Brian Moss; Reuters Messaging: tim.mclaughlin.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 646 223 6033)) Keywords: WALLSTREET HIRING/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;  (Refiles to fix typographical error in second paragraph) By Gideon Long LIMA, May 25 (Reuters) - Peru's Shining Path guerrillas could be gaining strength again more than a decade after they almost disappeared, but they are now more active in the cocaine trade than in fomenting Maoist revolution. The group, which posed a major threat until its leadership collapsed in the early 1990s, is believed to have a few hundred active fighters split between two main coca growing areas, one in the Huallaga valley in the north and the other in south-central Peru, east of the Andes mountains. In a recent report, the U.S. State Department said Shining Path was regrouping and could count on hundreds of armed combatants. It said it was shorter on revolutionary zeal than its predecessor but better funded due to its links to the drugs trade in a country second only to Colombia as the world's biggest cocaine producer. Shining Path was at its strongest in the 1980s and was one of the most ruthless rebel groups Latin America has ever seen. Led by former philosophy professor Abimael Guzman and inspired by China's Mao Zedong, it waged a popular war against Peru's European-descended, coastal elite that has dominated the country since the Spanish conquest. Peruvian authorities say the group killed over 31,000 people, sometimes beheading and mutilating its victims. Shining Path activists still peddle hard-line Maoist ideology in provincial universities and trade union offices but have dropped all pretensions to armed revolt. It makes absolutely no sense anymore to talk of a subversive threat in Peru from Shining Path, said Carlos Tapia, a former member of Peru's Truth Commission, which investigated atrocities on both sides of a long and brutal war between the group and the armed forces. COCAINE TRADE Guzman's arrest in 1992 led to the group's almost complete collapse and since then its remnant factions have split and changed direction several times. These days you really can't talk about Shining Path in general, said Jaime Antezana, a political analyst at Peru's Catholic University in Lima. He said the militants are in the cocaine trade, however. They have turned into organizations protecting the movement of drugs, the running of drug trafficking business. Experts say the remaining rebels have more in common with Colombia's drug-trafficking guerrillas than with their own Maoist past. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, rebel group has fought a four-decade conflict with the Colombian state, increasingly fueled by its links to the cocaine trade. The nature of Shining Path's link to the cocaine trade is difficult to prove, and the remnant groups issue occasional statements denying any such involvement. Tapia said the rebels were involved in drug trafficking and protection of illegal coca crops, while Antezana said they had gone further than that by moving into cocaine production. Both analysts questioned why the Peruvian state had failed to stamp out the relatively small, isolated remnant groups. To the relief of most Peruvians, the days when Guzman urged his acolytes to cross a river of blood to liberate their country are long gone, but for some the 72-year-old gray haired professor remains a potent figure, even in jail. For them, Guzman is like the Pope, and what the Pope says, the bishops and cardinals do, Antezana said. Who knows what will happen when he dies.

&lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli-Palestinian fighting in and round the Gaza Strip could end with the deployment of a foreign peacekeeping mission, including troops from neighboring Egypt, an Israeli cabinet minister said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pensioners Minister Rafi Eitan said nearly two weeks of Palestinian rocket attacks and Israeli air raids may prompt intervention like the boosted U.N. force in Lebanon after Israel's war against Hezbollah guerrillas last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The same thing, sooner or later, will happen in the Gaza Strip, with the senior partner in such a force being Egypt because it has no choice," Eitan told Israel Radio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And when the Egyptians are there, when 500 or 600 (Palestinian) civilians are killed, no one will say anything," he said. "That is what will eventually happen. We are getting there, gradually."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel long resisted the peacekeeper idea. Though it has signaled flexibility on the issue since the Lebanon war, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's spokeswoman said Eitan's thinking was not that of the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The official policy of the state of Israel is that the Palestinian Authority should take responsibility for themselves in Gaza and in the West Bank, fight terror, and have a stable government that would enable going forward to a two-state solution," the spokeswoman, Miri Eisin, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egyptian involvement in Palestinian affairs, especially in Gaza, is a touchy subject as Cairo controlled the territory before Israel captured it in a 1967 war. Israel quit Gaza in 2005, a move followed by spiraling cross-border violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest hostilities between the Jewish state and the dominant Palestinian Hamas Islamists have stirred new calls at home and abroad for peacekeepers in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Palestinians want independence in both territories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana said last week after talks with Israeli and Palestinian officials that a peacekeeping force was "one of many suggestions" that the EU would be "open to consider" if proposed by the parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Solana said Egyptian officials had made clear to him that "they don't see the need for that". The Palestinian government has said peacekeepers were not yet on its agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western diplomats say they doubt enough European countries would come forward for a peacekeeping force in Gaza, especially if Israel insisted on a sweeping mandate that required the foreign troops to disarm or arrest Palestinian militants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diplomats said, however, countries in the region like Jordan, Egypt and Turkey could be candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eitan said he also anticipated a future Jordanian deployment in the West Bank, which Amman lost to Israel in the 1967 war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Adam Entous in Jerusalem)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 25 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co. (KO.N) on Friday said it would acquire Glaceau for $4.1 billion in cash to gain a foothold in the fast-growing enhanced water market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Vitamin water maker Glaceau, also known as Energy Brands Inc., is 30 percent owned by India's Tata Tea Ltd.

It is the No. 2 maker of enhanced water behind PepsiCo Inc.'s (PEP.N) Propel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Coca-Cola said the deal would add to its earnings per share in the first full year after the agreement is completed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The world's largest beverage company said it would offer Glaceau's vitamin water in North America, but added that the brand had attractive longer-term international opportunities as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Glaceau will operate as a separate business unit within Coca-Cola North America, and its top three executives -- Darius Bikoff, Mike Repole and Mike Venuti -- plan to continue leading it for a minimum of three years, the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, which is seeking to bolster its portfolio of noncarbonated beverages in the face of slowing soft drink sales in its home market, said it expected the deal to close this summer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Martinne Geller and Franklin Paul; Reuters messaging: martinne.geller.reuters.com@reuters.net; martinne.geller@reuters.com; +1 646 223 6023)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Multimedia versions of Reuters Top News are now available for: * 3000 Xtra: visit topnews.session.rservices.com &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     * BridgeStation: view story .134 For more information on Top News: topnews.reuters.com)) Keywords: COKE GLACEAU/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds treasurer's comment, details on forecast, byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Philipp Gollner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO May 29 (Reuters) - International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM.N) said it bought back 8 percent of its
outstanding shares on Tuesday and raised its 2007
earnings-per-share forecast to reflect the smaller number of
shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM said it expects the $12.5 billion repurchase to boost
2007 earnings-per-share growth to 13 percent to 14 percent from
an earlier forecast of 11 percent. IBM said it bought back
118.8 million shares with $1 billion in cash and $11.5 billion
of borrowed funds from three banks on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The initial price was $105.18 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM reported 2006 profit of $6.06 per share from continuing
operations, the number most analysts use for their estimates.
On that basis, earnings per share would rise to about $6.85 to
6.91 in 2007 based on Tuesday's updated forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The repurchase should contribute about 14 cents to 17 cents
per share to the increased forecast, IBM said. It excludes the
gain from the sale of IBM's printer business, previously
announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The shares are out of the market right up front" with
Tuesday's transaction, IBM Treasurer Jesse Greene Jr. said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM of Armonk, New York, earlier this month said it
expected earnings per share to jump 80 percent in the next
three years, fueled by stock buybacks, increased profitability
in its services business and acquisitions, among other
factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of IBM edged up to around $106 after-hours following
the buyback announcement after closing up 0.7 percent at
$105.91 in regular-session trading on the New York Stock
Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The repurchase is part of a $15 billion buyback announced
in April, IBM said. IBM last month said it had repurchased a
total of about $79 billion of its shares since 1995.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 29 (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings on Tuesday
revised its rating outlook on Coca-Cola Co. (KO.N) to negative,
citing the company's decision to acquire vitaminwater maker
Glaceau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A negative outlook means Fitch is likely to cut Coca-Cola's
credit rating in the next one to two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola said last Friday it would buy Glaceau for $4.1
billion in cash, boosting its lagging position in the race to
dominate the fast-growing market for noncarbonated drinks. For
details, see [ID:nN25443592].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "revision to Negative is a result of materially weaker
system-wide credit measures resulting from the acquisition,
which will be 100 percent debt-financed, and the risk of
additional debt-financed acquisitions," Fitch said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola carries an "A-plus" issuer default and senior
unsecured debt rating, which is the fifth-highest rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's bonds did not trade in significant amounts on
Tuesday, but its 5.75 percent notes due in 2011 are trading at
48 basis points over U.S. Treasuries, according to
MarketAxess.

&lt;p&gt; (Refiles to fix typo in headline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Linda Hutchinson-Jafar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PORT OF SPAIN May 29 (Reuters) - BG Trinidad and Tobago and
its partner, Chevron Trinidad and Tobago Resources SRL, have
reached a $2 billion agreement to supply 220 million standard
cubic feet of natural gas per day to Trinidad and Tobago's
state-owned National Gas Company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies are affiliates of BG Group Plc (BG.L) and
Chevron Corp. (CVX.N) and finalized the deal at a signing
ceremony late on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beginning in 2009, they will deliver gas to the National
Gas Company for use in the domestic market for an initial term
of 11 years, with an option to extend for four more years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Martin Houston, BG's executive vice president and managing
director for North America, Caribbean and Global LNG, said the
deal underpins the commercialization of up to 1.2 trillion
cubic feet of currently undeveloped gas reserves in the East
Coast Marine Area off Trinidad's eastern coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron and BG each have a 50 percent working interest in
the East Coast Marine Area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As one of the country's long-term energy partners, BG was
committed to answering the government's call for additional gas
supply for the domestic market. This natural gas will enable
the new industrial plants that are currently under construction
to come on stream in 2009 and 2010 as scheduled," Houston said
at a signing ceremony late Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The project will involve drilling and completion of four
new wells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ali Moshiri, managing director for Chevron's Latin America
Business Unit, said his company looks forward to working with
BG and the National Gas Company to pursue additional
opportunities in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are going to be working closely with the governments of
Trinidad and Tobago and the government of Venezuela to develop
the natural resources that is shared between the two counties,"
he said.

&lt;p&gt;DALLAS (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) spent much of 
its annual meeting on Wednesday defending its environmental 
policy, but shareholders of the world's largest company were 
more concerned with its executive pay and governance practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; None of the 15 shareholder proposals that were up for 
approval at the annual meeting received 50 percent of the 
shareholder vote, but four dealing with pay and governance 
received at least 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All four measures would increase the accountability of 
Exxon's management and board for their policies and 
performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About 47.8 percent of the voting shareholders backed a 
measure that would give holders of 10 percent of Exxon's 
outstanding common shares the right to call special shareholder 
meetings and 47.2 percent favored a proposal to allow the 
company to recoup incentive bonuses it determined not to be 
justified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Proposals to give shareholders an advisory vote on 
executive pay and to split the chief executive and chairman 
positions got 41.2 percent and 40 percent of the vote, 
respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But climate change was the central topic of discussion at 
the meeting and one environmental proposal -- that the company 
adopt goals for greenhouse gas reductions from its products and 
operations -- received 31 percent of the shareholder vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson disputed claims by 
investor activists and environmentalists that the company is 
working to mislead the public about the causes of climate 
change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What I find perplexing is why people feel threatened 
because we want to have a discussion," Tillerson said, when 
offering an explanation for why the company funds some groups 
that are skeptical of the mainstream scientific views of 
climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'm not going to just adopt a slogan. If that makes me 
public enemy number one, so be it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors also voted in all 12 nominees to Exxon's board, 
including Michael Boskin, who received 93 percent of the vote 
despite an effort by a group of investors to unseat him in 
protest of the company's climate policy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PROTESTS OUTSIDE, INSIDE MEETING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About three dozen protesters -- outnumbered by police -- 
staged a peaceful demonstration outside the meeting against the 
company's funding of groups they believe deny or distort the 
science of global warming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The protesters waved banners with slogans like "People 
Before Profits" and chanted "No More Junk Science."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon Mobil is double-crossing the public and policy 
makers. It's avoiding real changes and continuing to fund 
groups that purposefully distort the science of global 
warming," said Shawnee Hoover, the campaign director of Exxpose 
Exxon, a coalition of green and scientific groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They say the company still funds about 40 organizations 
that the environmental group classified as "global warming 
deniers," shelling out over $2 million to the groups in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon disagrees with the claim that the groups, many of 
which concern themselves with a wide range of issues, are 
"deniers of climate change."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon has said man-made greenhouse gas emissions could be a 
source of global warming, while arguing that climate science is 
still uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most scientists believe the use of fossil fuels causes 
global warming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shareholder activists inside the meeting also took 
advantage of the opportunity to air their grievances about 
Exxon's environmental record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Can you imagine what would happen if the largest company 
in the world stood up and took a leadership position" on 
climate change, Sister Patricia Daly, a Dominican nun, asked 
Tillerson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are challenged by one of the most profound moral 
concerns and we have the wherewithal to respond," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tillerson generally listened quietly as the shareholder 
proposals were presented, but became more lively as he disputed 
criticism of his company during the question and answer period 
that followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said Exxon would continue to fund scientific research on 
climate change so the company can understand it better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also addressed claims that the company's environmental 
policy would leave it at a financial disadvantage to its peers 
who have already made more concessions on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If that makes us not Shell -- well, based on my results, 
I'm kind of glad we're not Shell," he said, referring to 
competitor Royal Dutch Shell. (RDSa.L)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp. (IBM.N) said it laid off about 1,570 employees on Wednesday in its computer services business in the United States, part of a plan to trim costs in the unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lay-offs bring to about 3,700 the number of jobs IBM has cut this year in its services unit, which accounts for about half of total revenue but whose profit lags the company's software business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, IBM eliminated about 1,300 jobs in the U.S. services business.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) will unveil a coffee-table-shaped "surface computer" on Wednesday in a major step towards co-founder Bill Gates's view of a future where the mouse and keyboard are replaced by more natural interaction using voice, pen and touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Surface, which has a 30-inch display under a hard-plastic tabletop, allows people to touch and move objects on screen for everything from digital finger painting and jigsaw puzzles to ordering off a virtual menu in a restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also recognizes and interacts with devices placed on its surface, so cell phone users can easily buy ringtones or change payment plans by placing their handsets on in-store displays, or a group of people gathered round the table can check out the photos on a digital camera placed on top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker said it will manufacture the machine itself and sell it initially to corporate customers, deploying the first units in November in Sheraton hotels, Harrah's casinos, T-Mobile stores, and restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is selling the Surface for between $5,000 and $10,000 each, but aims to bring prices down to consumer levels in three to five years and introduce various shapes and forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We see this as a multibillion dollar category, and we envision a time when surface computing technologies will be pervasive, from tabletops and counters to the hallway mirror," Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say the first few applications only hint at what is possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The potential for the interface is huge," said Matt Rosoff, an analyst with Directions on Microsoft, an independent research firm. "Once you open it up to applications, what you can think of is limitless."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft held demonstrations of the technology last week and Ballmer will officially introduce it at the Wall Street Journal's "D: All Things Digital" conference on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shunned its usual PC manufacturing partners and decided to take control of the surface computer's hardware production using an undisclosed contract manufacturer. It will run the Windows Vista operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BETTER THAN A TABLET?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has a mixed record with new technology. Its Zune music player has not yet become a major challenger to Apple Inc.'s (AAPL.O) iPod, but its Xbox 360 game console has enjoyed early success in the battle of next-generation game machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years Gates has championed touch-screen technology such as the tablet PC with little success, but the Surface is a totally different shape and allows for multiple users at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a demonstration, Microsoft placed a digital camera with a wireless chip on the tabletop. The Surface recognized the camera and sent its pictures to the display, allowing people around the table to sift through them, grabbing and turning pictures or making them bigger or smaller by spreading or narrowing their fingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft showed in another demonstration how Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE) cell phone operator T-Mobile USA, one of its launch partners, could deploy the computer in its stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A customer can grab a phone off the shelf, place it on the tabletop where it will recognize the device and pop up the handset's specifications and information to the screen. For a side-by-side comparison with another phone, the customer can put down a second handset next to the first phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's drop-dead simple and people really like it, because it mimics what they do in the real world," said Pete Thompson, general manager of Microsoft's surface computing business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said at launch it will deploy a virtual concierge for Harrah's Entertainment Inc.'s casinos in Las Vegas and place the surface computers in the lobbies of Starwood Hotel  Resorts Worldwide Inc.'s (HOT.N) Sheraton hotels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also signed a distribution and development agreement with slot-machine maker International Game Technology (IGT.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DALLAS May 30 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) Chief
Executive Rex Tillerson on Wednesday said his company would
likely need more clarity as to how the Russian government plans
to treat foreign investors before it considers any new projects
there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Tillerson said the country is still going through the
process of deciding what sort of control it wants to assert
over its natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Until that process is complete, my guess is it wouldn't be
real clear as to how we'd participate," Tillerson said,
speaking at a press conference after the company's annual
meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company already has a stake in the Sakhalin-1 oil and
gas project in the country. The project has been closely
watched after Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) was pressured to sell
its controlling stake in the nearby Sakhalin-2 project to
Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom. (GAZP.MM)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BP Plc (BP.L) has also encountered difficulty doing
business in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Tillerson said Exxon closely follows the
opportunities available in Russia, looking for complex projects
where Exxon's expertise might be needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When the time is right and something presents itself than
we'll look at what the terms and conditions of that might be,"
he said.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO May 30 (Reuters) - U.S. oil company Chevron

2002, Chevron has spent $2 billion researching renewable fuel
and expects to spend at least $2.5 billion more by 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ethanol is largely made from corn in the United States.
There are efforts underway to produce the renewable fuel from
plant material like corn stalks and switchgrass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron and Texas AM University said they will seek to
streamline the process from the harvest, production and,
ultimately, the delivery of fuel.

(JPM.N) has settled a long-running anti-trust lawsuit charging
copper market manipulation by the company and a Japanese
trading house in the mid-1990s, a lawyer for one of the

&lt;p&gt; The confidential out-of-court settlement with a group of

&lt;p&gt; By Michael Erman and Ed Stoddard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DALLAS May 30 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) spent
much of its annual meeting on Wednesday defending its
environmental policy, but shareholders of the world's largest
company were more concerned with its executive pay and
governance practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; None of the 15 shareholder proposals that were up for
approval at the annual meeting received 50 percent of the
shareholder vote, but four dealing with pay and governance
received at least 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All four measures would increase the accountability of    
Exxon's management and board for their policies and
performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About 47.8 percent of the voting shareholders backed a
measure that would give holders of 10 percent of Exxon's
outstanding common shares the right to call special shareholder
meetings and 47.2 percent favored a proposal to allow the
company to recoup incentive bonuses it determined not to be
justified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Proposals to give shareholders an advisory vote on
executive pay and to split the chief executive and chairman
positions got 41.2 percent and 40 percent of the vote,
respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But climate change was the central topic of discussion at
the meeting and one environmental proposal -- that the company
adopt goals for greenhouse gas reductions from its products and
operations -- received 31 percent of the shareholder vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson disputed claims by
investor activists and environmentalists that the company is
working to mislead the public about the causes of climate
change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What I find perplexing is why people feel threatened
because we want to have a discussion," Tillerson said, when
offering an explanation for why the company funds some groups
that are skeptical of the mainstream scientific views of
climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'm not going to just adopt a slogan. If that makes me
public enemy number one, so be it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors also voted in all 12 nominees to Exxon's board,
including Michael Boskin, who received 93 percent of the vote
despite an effort by a group of investors to unseat him in
protest of the company's climate policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PROTESTS OUTSIDE, INSIDE MEETING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About three dozen protesters -- outnumbered by police --
staged a peaceful demonstration outside the meeting against the
company's funding of groups they believe deny or distort the
science of global warming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The protesters waved banners with slogans like "People
Before Profits" and chanted "No More Junk Science."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon Mobil is double-crossing the public and policy
makers. It's avoiding real changes and continuing to fund
groups that purposefully distort the science of global
warming," said Shawnee Hoover, the campaign director of Exxpose
Exxon, a coalition of green and scientific groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They say the company still funds about 40 organizations
that the environmental group classified as "global warming
deniers," shelling out over $2 million to the groups in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon disagrees with the claim that the groups, many of
which concern themselves with a wide range of issues, are
"deniers of climate change."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon has said man-made greenhouse gas emissions could be a
source of global warming, while arguing that climate science is
still uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most scientists believe the use of fossil fuels causes
global warming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shareholder activists inside the meeting also took
advantage of the opportunity to air their grievances about
Exxon's environmental record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Can you imagine what would happen if the largest company
in the world stood up and took a leadership position" on
climate change, Sister Patricia Daly, a Dominican nun, asked
Tillerson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are challenged by one of the most profound moral
concerns and we have the wherewithal to respond," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tillerson generally listened quietly as the shareholder
proposals were presented, but became more lively as he disputed
criticism of his company during the question and answer period
that followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said Exxon would continue to fund scientific research on
climate change so the company can understand it better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also addressed claims that the company's environmental
policy would leave it at a financial disadvantage to its peers
who have already made more concessions on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If that makes us not Shell -- well, based on my results,
I'm kind of glad we're not Shell," he said, referring to
competitor Royal Dutch Shell. (RDSa.L)

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details throughout)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DALLAS May 30 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) Chief
Executive Rex Tillerson on Wednesday cast doubt on the
viability of proposed pipelines in Canada and Alaska due to
escalating costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tillerson, speaking at a press conference following the
company's annual meeting, said construction of the Mackenzie
pipeline project in Canada was not viable at current cost
levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are now in a situation where it's not economic at the
current costs," Tillerson said, noting that prices for steel
and other raw materials used to build the pipelines have surged
in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said he didn't know whether the Canadian government
could create "enough room in the fiscal structure" to
accommodate the rising costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It may just be that this project is going to have to wait
for a different cost environment," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this year, costs estimates for the project, which
is designed to ship natural gas from the Mackenzie River Delta
in the Arctic Circle to Alberta, had more than doubled to about
$14.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pipeline would carry 1.2 billion to 1.9 billion cubic
feet of gas a day from three huge fields in the Mackenzie River
Delta north of the Arctic Circle, and run 1,200 km (746 miles)
south to Alberta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil has a 69.6 percent stake in Imperial Oil Ltd.
(IMO.TO), which is the leader of the project. It also has its
own direct interest in the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tillerson also said that although Exxon has not done any
recent cost studies for a proposed pipeline in Alaska, he
believes those costs would have risen dramatically as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Costs were between $22 billion and $25 billion about three
years ago, when the company did its last estimate, Tillerson
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alaska has struggled for decades to come up with a workable
plan to build a multibillion-dollar pipeline to ship the 35
trillion cubic feet of natural gas held in the North Slope to
markets in the lower 48 states.

&lt;p&gt;KANO, Nigeria (Reuters) - A Nigerian state has filed criminal charges against Pfizer Inc. for its alleged role in the deaths of children who received an unapproved drug during a meningitis epidemic, court papers showed on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world's biggest drug maker, said in a statement the allegations of negligence are untrue and it acted ethically when it tested the antibiotic Trovan in Kano state in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The director of public prosecutions of Kano, in northern Nigeria, filed eight criminal charges before a state high court. The accused are Pfizer, its Nigerian subsidiary and eight individuals who worked for the companies at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case will have its first hearing on June 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, the attorney general of the state filed a civil lawsuit seeking $2.075 billion in damages from Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The accused persons ... caused an untested and unregistered drug ... to be administered on about 200 patients without an informed consent from parents," said the criminal charge sheet, adding that they had acted in a "rash and negligent manner".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The acts of the accused persons endangered human lives by causing side-effects (such) as deafness, muteness, paralysis, brain damage, loss of sight, flawed speech and even death," the document added in a "summary of evidence".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials in Kano have alleged for years that Pfizer's actions resulted in the deaths of some of the children and left others with permanent health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state government alleges Pfizer selected children and infants from crowds at a makeshift epidemic camp and gave about half of the group Trovan, which it says was untested at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legal dispute has been going on for years. A U.S. federal judge in 2005 dismissed a lawsuit that accused Pfizer of not properly warning Nigerian families about the risk of Trovan, saying it should be heard in a Nigerian court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said the clinical trial was conducted with the full knowledge of the Nigerian government "and in a responsible and ethical way consistent with the company's abiding commitment to patient safety".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said that at the time of the meningitis outbreak, Trovan was in late-stage development and had been evaluated in 5,000 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Washington Post newspaper in the United States said it obtained internal Pfizer records that showed five children died after being treated with Trovan.

&lt;p&gt; (Updates with criminal charges) By Mike Oboh KANO, Nigeria, May 30 (Reuters) - A Nigerian state has filed criminal charges against Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) for its alleged role in the deaths of children who received an unapproved drug during a meningitis epidemic, court papers showed on Wednesday. Pfizer, the world's biggest drug maker, said in a statement the allegations of negligence are untrue and it acted ethically when it tested the antibiotic Trovan in Kano state in 1996. The director of public prosecutions of Kano, in northern Nigeria, filed eight criminal charges before a state high court. The accused are Pfizer, its Nigerian subsidiary and eight individuals who worked for the companies at the time. The case will have its first hearing on June 4. Separately, the attorney general of the state filed a civil lawsuit seeking $2.075 billion in damages from Pfizer. The accused persons ... caused an untested and unregistered drug ... to be administered on about 200 patients without an informed consent from parents, said the criminal charge sheet, adding that they had acted in a rash and negligent manner. The acts of the accused persons endangered human lives by causing side-effects (such) as deafness, muteness, paralysis, brain damage, loss of sight, flawed speech and even death, the document added in a summary of evidence. Officials in Kano have alleged for years that Pfizer's actions resulted in the deaths of some of the children and left others with permanent health problems. The state government alleges Pfizer selected children and infants from crowds at a makeshift epidemic camp and gave about half of the group Trovan, which it says was untested at the time. The legal dispute has been going on for years. A U.S. federal judge in 2005 dismissed a lawsuit that accused Pfizer of not properly warning Nigerian families about the risk of Trovan, saying it should be heard in a Nigerian court. Pfizer said the clinical trial was conducted with the full knowledge of the Nigerian government and in a responsible and ethical way consistent with the company's abiding commitment to patient safety. The company said that at the time of the meningitis outbreak, Trovan was in late-stage development and had been evaluated in 5,000 patients. The Washington Post newspaper in the United States said it obtained internal Pfizer records that showed five children died after being treated with Trovan. However, there is no indication in the documents that the drug was responsible for the deaths. Six children died while taking the comparison drug, the paper said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 30 (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings on Wednesday cut
its ratings for International Business Machines Corp. (IBM.N)

to about 8 percent of its outstanding shares, was nearly fully

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO May 30 (Reuters) - Nigerian authorities have filed
criminal charges against Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N), the world's
biggest drug maker, for its alleged role in the deaths of an
unspecified number of children who received an unapproved drug
during a meningitis epidemic, The Washington Post reported on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Authorities in the Nigerian state of Kano filed eight
criminal charges related to a 1996 clinical trial, as well as a
civil lawsuit seeking more than $2 billion in damages and
restitution from the drug maker, the newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a statement, Pfizer said the allegations are untrue and

the deaths of an unspecified number of children and left others
deaf, paralyzed, blind or brain-damaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The suit alleges that the company did not get consent from
the children's families and that the researchers knew Trovan to
be an experimental drug with life-threatening side effects that
was "unfit for human use."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Washington Post said it obtained internal Pfizer
records that showed five children died after being treated with
Trovan. However, "there is no indication in the documents that

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW May 30 (Reuters) - Russian environmental inspectors
found no major violations of the law during an investigation
into the Exxon Mobil-led (XOM.N) Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project,
Itar-Tass news agency reported on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Itar-Tass quoted an unnamed official at Russia's Natural
Resources Ministry as saying the inspectors were now finalising
their findings and would announce them within weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors follow Russian environmental inspections carefully
because several major foreign firms have been forced to cede
control of their projects after sustained criticism from
officials and threats of administrative sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The most vocal critic is Oleg Mitvol, deputy head of Russian
environmental agency RosPrirodNadzor, who said in March that the
inspections would focus on how Exxon and its partners -- Rosneft
(ROSN.MM), ONGC (ONGC.BO) and Japanese consortium Sodeco --
fulfilled their environmental obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Previous inspections conducted last year by Russia's
technical standards agency, RosTekhNadzor, delayed full-scale
exports from the project on Sakhalin island by several months
after finding Exxon needed to do more work at its Pacific export
terminal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mitvol led inspections of Royal Dutch/Shell's (RDSa.L)
neighbouring Sakhalin-2 oil and gas scheme last year, and
analysts said his actions helped persuade the group to sell a
controlling stake to Gazprom for $7.45 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pressure quickly subsided after the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts say a similar outcome is unlikely at Sakhalin-1,
because state-controlled oil firm Rosneft is also a partner in
the scheme, which will proved the biggest new source of Pacific
basin crude in more than a decade.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - "It's still the same old Exxon."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; That's the sentiment being expressed by environmentalists 
and shareholder activists gearing up for Exxon Mobil Corp.'s 
(XOM.N) annual meeting this week in Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That was not always their hope. When Rex Tillerson, a 
genial Texan, took the helm at the world's largest company at 
the beginning of 2006, replacing combative long-time Chief 
Executive Lee Raymond, some felt change was inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But, as both the company and activists would attest, Exxon 
has stayed true to the course set by Raymond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under Tillerson, Exxon's "tone is not as harsh," 
Connecticut State Treasurer Denise Nappier said at a press 
conference last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's not a lot of rhetoric, but when you get beyond 
that the policies are very much the same as they were under the 
old leadership," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shareholder activists claim that the company is insular and 
resistant to change. Moreover, despite a campaign to improve 
its environmentally unfriendly image, critics allege Exxon is 
still funding groups that mislead the public about the causes 
of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil faces 15 shareholder proposals at its annual 
meeting on topics including executive compensations, corporate 
governance and environmental issues, as well as an effort to 
unseat board member Michael Proskin, a Stanford University 
economist and chair of the company's public issues committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The problem is the same with Exxon," said governance 
activist Robert Monks, who has submitted a proposal that the 
company split its chairman and chief executive positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is a company that listens only to itself," he said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; STUBBORN OR STEADY?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon disagrees with many of the charges leveled against 
the company and says it has been more active in communicating 
its positions on key issues externally over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spokesman Gantt Walton said the company's policies are 
constantly reviewed by the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They are not taken lightly by any stretch," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the philosophy and the principles of the company 
have not changed due to the transition from Raymond to 
Tillerson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If you are saying that they have been consistent, we would 
probably agree with that," Walton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ironically, the fact that Exxon has not changed may be 
attracting investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They were operating very well under Raymond, and they 
continue to do so," said John S. Herold analyst Lysle Brinker, 
noting that Exxon Mobil has stayed closer to its long-term 
strategy than any of its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During the roughly 12-1/2 years that Raymond led the 
company, Exxon acquired Mobil Corp. and its shares rose to 
nearly 3.5 times their value when he started -- well ahead of 
the Standard  Poor's 500 index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After Tillerson took over the company, Exxon Mobil pulled 
in a whopping $39.5 billion in 2006 -- the largest corporate 
profit in history. The company's stock has also continued its 
rise, climbing nearly 50 percent in the last 16 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If you are one of the most profitable oil companies you're 
going to attract more shareholders," Brinker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the company can expect pressure to change from its 
shareholders in the meeting, scheduled for May 30, and from 
environmental protesters outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ken Sylvester, assistant comptroller for pension policy in 
the New York City comptroller's office, is backing a proposal 
for the ninth straight year asking the company to explicitly 
prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon has long maintained that its existing global policies 
prohibit any discrimination, including sexual orientation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sylvester said the comptroller's office has not seen any 
softening on the issue from Exxon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The company still remains opposed to the resolution. 
There's been no change at all," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI May 30 (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) has hired

Jasani for the technology sector, Gunjan Prithyani for real
estate and Karan Singh Uberoi for the financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In order to achieve our ambitious growth targets in India
the firm needs a deep and broad research capability and these
hires will certainly help us fulfill this aim," said Sunil
Garg, head of Asia ex-Japan equity research for JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International firms such as Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and UBS
(UBSN.VX) have been poaching talent from rivals to bolster
their presence in India's fast-growing finance market. Last
week, local firm India Infoline Ltd. (IIFL.BO) hired four top
executives from international brokerage CLSA.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON May 30 (Reuters) - Britain's cost-effectiveness
watchdog NICE has recommended Pfizer Inc.'s (PFE.N) smoking
cessation drug Champix for use by the state-funded National
Health Service, the U.S. drugmaker said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In its final appraisal determination, the National Institute
for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) concluded the drug was
better than nicotine replacement therapy and GlaxoSmithKline
Plc's (GSK.L) Zyban pill in helping smokers quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Champix, the first new prescription product for smoking
cessation, targets the specific receptor to which nicotine
binds, thereby reducing the severity of the smoker's urge to
smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The medicine is sold as Chantix in the United States. It was
approved as safe and effective by European and U.S. regulators
last year.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds treasurer's comment, details on forecast, byline) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Philipp Gollner &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SAN FRANCISCO, May 29 (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp. (IBM.N) said it bought back 8 percent of its outstanding shares on Tuesday and raised its 2007 earnings-per-share forecast to reflect the smaller number of shares. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM said it expects the $12.5 billion repurchase to boost 2007 earnings-per-share growth to 13 percent to 14 percent from an earlier forecast of 11 percent. IBM said it bought back 118.8 million shares with $1 billion in cash and $11.5 billion of borrowed funds from three banks on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The initial price was $105.18 per share. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM reported 2006 profit of $6.06 per share from continuing operations, the number most analysts use for their estimates. On that basis, earnings per share would rise to about $6.85 to 6.91 in 2007 based on Tuesday's updated forecast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The repurchase should contribute about 14 cents to 17 cents per share to the increased forecast, IBM said. It excludes the gain from the sale of IBM's printer business, previously announced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The shares are out of the market right up front" with Tuesday's transaction, IBM Treasurer Jesse Greene Jr. said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM of Armonk, New York, earlier this month said it expected earnings per share to jump 80 percent in the next three years, fueled by stock buybacks, increased profitability in its services business and acquisitions, among other factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of IBM edged up to around $106 after-hours following the buyback announcement after closing up 0.7 percent at $105.91 in regular-session trading on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The repurchase is part of a $15 billion buyback announced in April, IBM said. IBM last month said it had repurchased a total of about $79 billion of its shares since 1995. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Leslie Gevirtz; +1 415 677-2547, E-mail: philipp.gollner@reuters.com)) Keywords: IBM REPURCHASE/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co. is downplaying its role in subprime lending even as spectacular flameouts in that sector have turned the Wall Street bank into one of the biggest originators of risky mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We don't do much in the subprime business -- at all," JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told investors earlier this month at the company's annual meeting. "It will be a good business, by the way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the No. 3 U.S. bank, along with other Wall Street companies, has stepped into a void triggered by a meltdown in the market for lending money to homebuyers with weak credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's first-quarter subprime mortgage originations, through Chase Home Finance, jumped 11 percent to $3.02 billion, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. The bank was No. 11 in a ranking that included No. 7 New Century Financial Corp., which now is being liquidated in bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not much subprime business at JPMorgan translates into a subprime mortgage portfolio that stood at $13.2 billion at the end of last year, or about 3.6 percent of the company's $367 billion consumer loan portfolio. JPMorgan sold most of its 2006 subprime production, offloading risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan does not specify how much subprime lending contributes to its bottom line, but the earnings potential is there. In March, Charles Scharf, head of JPMorgan's retail division, said home equity loans and subprime mortgages have the potential to contribute a total of $800 million in annual net income when working with the company's investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profits increase when JPMorgan's investment bank packages pools of loans into securities and sells them to investors. That's one key reason why Wall Street banks have stepped up their subprime game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CitiMortgage, a unit of Citigroup, originated $8.1 billion in subprime mortgages during the first quarter, a 29 percent year-over-year gain that catapulted the bank to the top spot among U.S. subprime lenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While CitiMortgage, JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch  Co.'s subprime unit, First Franklin Financial, showed gains, industrywide subprime lending plummeted 32 percent to $95 billon in the first quarter, Inside Mortgage Finance said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countrywide Financial Corp. and HSBC Finance, the U.S. unit of London's HSBC Holdings Plc, have reined in their subprime lending, but remain the No. 2 and No. 3 lenders in the sector, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merrill Lynch Chief Executive Stanley O'Neal recently told Bernstein Research analyst Brad Hintz that Merrill's $1.3 billion acquisition of First Franklin will allow the company to boost its market share for mortgage-backed securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mr. O'Neal admitted that it's hard to make money in mortgages now," Hintz said in a research note. "But he pointed out that 25 competitors have left the market or declared bankruptcy and (First Franklin) leaves Merrill Lynch with large origination capabilities that will prove its value as the market adjusts to new issuance standards and economics of the mortgage business."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ROME (Reuters) - Scientists have discovered particles of cocaine and marijuana, as well as caffeine and tobacco, in the air of Italy's capital, they said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concentration of drugs was heaviest in the air around Rome's Sapienza university, though the National Research Council's Dr. Angelo Cecinato warned against drawing conclusions about students' recreational habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calling their study "the first in the world to show the presence of particles of cocaine suspended in the atmosphere of the city", the researchers said they took samples in Rome, the southern city of Taranto and in Algiers in North Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicotine and caffeine were detected in all three, "showing how widespread consumption of these substances is and how they remain in the atmosphere", state-funded CNR said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concentration of cocaine in Rome's atmosphere was only 0.1 nanogrammes (1 nanogramme is one billionth of a gramme) per cubic metre at its height during winter months, the researchers said. But the conclusions were worrying for public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is well documented that even small concentrations in the air of these pollutants can seriously damage health," said Dr. Ivo Allegrini of the CNR's Institute for Atmospheric Pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON May 31 (Reuters) - Companies are showing ever
greater appetite to reward shareholders at the expense of
bondholders, with this week's debt-financed payouts by IBM and
ASML (ASML.AS) the latest causes for bond market concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Share buybacks, big dividend payments and a tidal wave of
merger and acquisition activity -- set this year to beat the
record level reached in 2006 -- all pose threats to company
creditworthiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the corporate debt market in Europe has yet to react,
with yield spreads at their tightest in at least two years,
according to data from Merrill Lynch, and new bond issues being
snapped up voraciously -- although investors and analysts warn
that this rosy view of the world cannot persist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM (IBM.N), the world's largest technology services
company, said on Tuesday it was borrowing $11.5 billion and
using $1 billion of cash to buy back $12.5 billion of shares,
boosting earnings per share but leading to a credit-rating cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ASML, the Dutch chip equipment maker, said on Thursday it
would pay out 960 million euros ($1.3 billion) to shareholders
and would issue its debut bond to help pay for it, in a direct
transfer of cash from bondholders to equity investors.
 "The market is coming to an inflection point," said Simon
Ballard, credit strategist at ABN AMRO Asset Management, which
has 209 billion euros under management, 36 percent of which is
in fixed-income investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "One man's meat is another man's poison. But the bond market
seems to think that one man's meat is his meat as well," he
said, referring to the lack of reaction in prices to the growing
tide of shareholder-friendly activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In six months' time, when it starts to filter through the
digestive system, the bond market will start to realise that it
has been poisoned and that's when we're going to get a
correction in spreads," Ballard said. "It's a potential timebomb
for the risk-asset investor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Others too are warning of the growing threat to credit
quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Credit fundamentals are deteriorating, with aggregate
leverage rising and free cash flow dwindling," analysts at
Morgan Stanley said in a note this week, though they noted the
deterioration was from a relatively strong position. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The three-six-month outlook for credit spreads is wider, in
our view."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BALANCE SHEET BALANCING ACT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move by ASML may also signal a shift in European
corporate psychology, as shareholder returns in Europe have so
far largely been paid for with cash already on the balance sheet
rather than directly through new borrowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is undoubtedly an increased chance of more violent
releveraging than in the past," said Matt King, credit
strategist at Citigroup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shareholder-friendly policies have traditionally been more
aggressive in the United States, where CEOs face more active
equity investors and are paid more often in stock, while
European companies have usually taken a more conservative
approach, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the boom in private-equity MA activity is placing
pressure on CEOs to look at the balance sheet in a new light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "CEOs are going to get forced into it," King said. "You
can't beat the cycle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bondholders however face a painful dilemma. With redemptions
of euro-denominated corporate debt running ahead of new
issuance, they have strong inflows of cash that need to be put
to work -- a situation that has helped investment-grade
companies price close to 20 billion euros of debt in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And while the market remains benign, taking a more defensive
posture could prove expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ABN AMRO Asset Management's Ballard said memories of early
2006, when some corporate bond investors had taken bearish
positions only to see the market rally throughout the year,
persisted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The market is very much aware of not being caught offside
or being left behind when the party is in full swing," he said.
"Until we see a consistent run of more fundamentally bearish
corporate data, then people are going to continue to buy into
the trend."

Securities upgraded Yahoo Inc. (YHOO.O) to "overweight" from
"neutral," saying the market is undervaluing the assets of the
Internet media company that is addressing weakness in display
advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo's valuation does not reflect the revenue upside from
its partnerships with Comcast Corp. (CMCSA.O), eBay Inc.
(EBAY.O), and a consortium of U.S. newspapers, J.P Morgan
analyst Imran Khan said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo has more advertising relationships than can currently
be fully monetized on their own properties and this is a way
for the company to leverage its technology and graphical
advertising strength, Khan added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst said he expects the partnerships to yield an
additional $94 million in fiscal 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo's display ad business is expected to grow 19 percent
in fiscal 2007 and 16 percent in fiscal 2008, the brokerage
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) increased its revenue per search
by about 30 percent since the launch of its AdCenter platform,
Yahoo can do better than this given its higher market share and
better user knowledge, according to Khan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Given the exuberant mergers and acquisitions activity in
the online search and advertising industry, the inherent value
of Yahoo's search business, display properties, and Right Media
Inc. acquisition will limit the downside on the stock, the
research note added.

&lt;p&gt;DARWIN (Reuters) - Australia's plan to quadruple liquefied 
natural gas (LNG) exports to 60 million tonnes a year by 2017 
was becoming more challenging due to soaring costs, oil giant 
Chevron Corp. (CVX.N) said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Neil Theobold, in charge of marketing the Gorgon project 
for Chevron Australia, said while construction costs for LNG 
projects were rising globally, cost pressures in Australia were 
higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The fundamental nature of Australia being a high cost 
environment means that controlling costs has been a particular 
challenge," Theobold said at an oil and gas conference in 
Australia's northern city of Darwin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Australia, which aims to be the world's second-largest LNG 
exporter after Qatar, has six proposed LNG projects along its 
northwest coast, led by companies including Woodside Petroleum 
Ltd. (WPL.AX), Chevron and Japan's Inpex Holdings (1605.T).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But rising construction costs, environmental concerns and 
shortage of manpower are threatening to delay or even halt some 
of these projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's Greater Gorgon project was first expected to 
deliver in 2010, but analysts now say 2015 is more likely after 
delays due to environmental issues. Its cost is expected to 
jump to $12.4 billion, from $11 billion estimated three years 
ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, the third-largest U.S. oil company by market 
value, scrapped a 2006 deadline for approving the giant 
project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theobold said Chevron was undertaking a study to offset the 
cost increase of Gorgon, which he expected to be complete in a 
few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will then reassess the project and its timelines," 
Theobold said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industry analysts have suggested Chevron and its partners 
will increase the scale of the project, building two LNG trains 
with up to 7.5 million tonnes capacity each, compared with 5 
million tonnes per train planned earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney wants to breathe some excitement into the TV-DVD business, which after several years of explosive growth is beginning to lose some of its luster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The studio is taking the unusual step of announcing all its upcoming marquee TV-DVD releases at once and packing into them a wealth of novel extras, from Spanish-language audio tracks to a virtual fashion show, extended and bonus episodes and unaired story lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highlight: Season 3 sets of top-rated shows "Lost," "Desperate Housewives" and "Grey's Anatomy." Breaking tradition, each set gets a special name, similar to special editions of movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Desperate Housewives: The Complete Third Season -- The Dirty Laundry Edition" will arrive in stores September 4. The six-disc set includes all 23 episodes along with such extras as a behind-the-scenes look at the season finale, a Spanish audio track, a conversation with series star Eva Longoria in which she shares stories from some of her favorite bloopers, a collection of creator Marc Cherry's favorite scenes and several unaired story lines, deleted scenes and outtakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week later, on September 11, comes "Grey's Anatomy: The Complete Third Season -- Seriously Extended Edition," a seven-disc set with all 25 episodes, four of them extended exclusively for the DVD release. Other bonus features include a one-on-one with series star Ellen Pompeo, a visit to the race track with star (and race-car enthusiast) Patrick Dempsey, cast and crew members' favorite scenes and audio commentaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lost: The Complete Third Season -- The Unexplored Experience" follows December 11 on DVD and Blu-ray Disc. The 23-episode, seven-disc set comes with a one-on-one with star Matthew Fox, a featurette on "The Others," a documentary chronicling 24 hours in production and a selection of never-before-seen flashbacks. Also included are behind-the-scenes looks at 10 episodes, audio commentaries, deleted scenes and bloopers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also in the pipeline are three new series that never before have been available on DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ugly Betty: The Complete First Season -- Bettyfied Edition" will be out August 21. The six-disc set contains all 23 episodes as well as an exhibit of some of the first season's best and worst fashions, a Spanish audio track, a discussion with the cast on the show's origins and a behind-the-scenes documentary with the show's production, costume and set designers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Brothers  Sisters: The Complete First Season," also a six-disc set, is scheduled for a September 18 release. On September 25 comes "What About Brian? -- Seasons 1  2," a five-disc set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Disney announcement comes at a time when the pace of TV-DVD releases is slowing. Just 158 multi-disc TV-DVD season sets came to market in the first four months of this year, according to the DVD Release Report, down 12.2% from the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co. (KO.N) will no longer fund or conduct animal experiments, animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beverage giant joins rival PepsiCo Inc. (PEP.N), which made the same move earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke does not conduct animal tests and does not directly fund animal tests on its beverages, and is asking its partners and research organizations to use alternatives to animal testing, the company said in a letter provided by PETA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pepsi's announcement helped to spur Coke along," said Bruce Friedrich, a vice president of PETA. Coca-Cola could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PETA, whose campaign to change practices at Coke and Pepsi lasted about a year, said it would now target consumer products giants Altria Group (MO.N) and Unilever (ULVR.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're two of the worst abusers," Friedrich said. "we will be stepping up our pressure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither Altria nor Unilever immediately returned calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - A foundation that owns rights to much of 
the code behind Linux software has decided not to carry out 
threats to punish Novell Inc. NOVL.O over a deal with 
Microsoft Corp, a person familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The nonprofit Free Software Foundation had threatened to 
take punitive action against Novell for entering into a patent 
agreement with Microsoft (MSFT.O), whose Windows operating 
system is a rival to Linux and is seen as a foe by the open 
source community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some saw the deal as endorsing Microsoft's claims that it 
holds patents to intellectual property behind some open source 
software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The foundation was reviewing whether to block Novell from 
getting access to the foundation-controlled components of Linux 
that will be distributed under the terms of a new licensing 
agreement that is being finalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the pioneering forces behind the open source 
software movement, the foundation has decided not to include 
any language in the final draft of the agreement that will 
punish Novell, according to the person familiar with the 
foundation's deliberations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is good news for Novell," said Katherine Egbert, an 
analyst with Jefferies  Co."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The foundation controls rights to a group of programs known 
as the GNU operating system, an important part of Linux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The group does not control the software's namesake, the 
Linux kernel, which is owned by another nonprofit, the Linux 
Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Free Software Foundation Executive Director Peter Brown 
would not discuss the foundation's decision, but confirmed that 
it had finalized its proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Novell and its main rival Red Hat Inc. (RHT.N) sell 
standardized versions of Linux with custom features, 
maintenance plans and technical support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two companies also sell other types of open source 
software, including OpenOffice, which competes with Microsoft 
Word; Excel and PowerPoint programs; and XenSource, a rival to 
EMC Corp.'s (EMC.N) VMware software that boosts the efficiency 
of server computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales of Novell's SUSE Linux products accounted for 5 
percent of the $967 million in revenue that the company 
reported last year. The deal with Microsoft has turned into a 
far bigger cash generator, bringing in two upfront payments 
totaling $348 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two companies agreed to sell their products jointly, 
develop technologies that make it easier for businesses to use 
Linux alongside Windows software, and not sue each other's 
customers for any patent violations when using their software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some members of the open source community said that deal 
would undermine the patent security of Linux software and give 
Microsoft an edge in persuading businesses to use Microsoft 
products over Linux and other types of open source software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The foundation is scheduled to disclose its decision on the 
Novell matter by June 4 on its Web site, www.fsf.org, when it 
will post the final draft of the new license, which is known as 
the General Public License version 3, or GPLv3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Novell Chief Financial Officer Dana Russell declined 
comment on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
