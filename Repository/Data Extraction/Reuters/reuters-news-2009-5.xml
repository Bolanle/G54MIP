&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Washington Mutual Inc WAMUQ.PK on Friday asked a U.S. bankruptcy court to let it probe whether JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) had unlawfully damaged its former thrift unit's assets in order to buy it "on the cheap," at $1.9 billion, last September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WaMu, the bankrupt holding company of what was Washington Mutual Bank, filed a motion in U.S. bankruptcy court in Delaware, charging that JPMorgan engaged in "sham negotiations" designed to get confidential information out of WaMu and gain an unfair advantage in buying its assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The request cited a federal lawsuit brought by WaMu stakeholders against JPMorgan in Texas in February. The suit claims that in the summer of 2008 JPMorgan leaked false and harmful information from WaMu's financial records, in an attempt to deflate its value and purchase WaMu's assets at a fire-sale price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokeswoman said the firm does not comment on pending litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WaMu's collapse was the largest U.S. bank failure in history. The bank was seized by U.S. regulators on September 25 and its deposits immediately sold to JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surviving holding company filed for bankruptcy protection in Delaware a day later, with $32.9 billion in assets, including several corporate entities, real estate assets and an insurance business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WaMu said in court documents that if the claims in the Texas suit turn out to be true, JPMorgan could be held responsible for the "destruction" of the parent company and the "total losses suffered by its creditors and shareholders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WaMu said it wanted to investigate whether the sale could be classified as a fraudulent transfer, so that WaMu's creditors could get their money back, or whether it could sue JPMorgan for other claims like unfair competition, breach of contract, and misappropriation of confidential information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WaMu, once the largest U.S. savings and loan, claimed in court documents that JPMorgan had "long coveted" the bank's depositor base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The request was the second legal action taken by WaMu against JPMorgan this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WaMu sued JPMorgan on Tuesday seeking the return of more than $4 billion in cash deposits it lost access to when its bank was sold last year. In that suit WaMu said that JPMorgan wrongfully claims it acquired the deposits as part of the takeover transaction, but that they should have been treated like any other deposit at the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also last month, WaMu sued the FDIC for more than $13 billion, arguing that JPMorgan paid too little for its bank business and that more money should be available for creditors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hearing on WaMu's request to investigate JPMorgan is set for May 20, according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Emily Chasan; Additional reporting by Elinor Comlay; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 1 (Reuters) - Washington Mutual Inc
WAMUQ.PK on Friday asked a U.S. bankruptcy court to let it
probe whether JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) had unlawfully
damaged its former thrift unit's assets in order to buy it "on
the cheap," at $1.9 billion, last September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; WaMu, the bankrupt holding company of what was Washington

Delaware, charging that JPMorgan engaged in "sham negotiations"

assets, including several corporate entities, real estate
assets and an insurance business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WaMu said in court documents that if the claims in the
Texas suit turn out to be true, JPMorgan could be held
responsible for the "destruction" of the parent company and the
"total losses suffered by its creditors and shareholders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WaMu said it wanted to investigate whether the sale could
be classified as a fraudulent transfer, so that WaMu's
creditors could get their money back, or whether it could sue

business and that more money should be available for
creditors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A hearing on WaMu's request to investigate JPMorgan is set
for May 20, according to court documents.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - The Disney Channel is grooming "Wizards of Waverly Place" as its next blockbuster tween franchise in the mold of "High School Musical" and "Hannah Montana."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cable channel has picked up a third season of the hit comedy series starring Selena Gomez and has unveiled an original telefilm, "Wizards of Waverly Place The Movie," to premiere in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wizards," which co-stars David Henrie, Jake T. Austin, Jennifer Stone, Maria Canals-Barrera and David DeLuise and centers on the three Russo siblings who have wizard powers, ranked in April as the No. 2 scripted series across all cable and broadcast television channels among tweens (viewers 9-14 years old).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set to premiere in August, the "Wizards" movie follows the Russo kids as they embark on a vacation at the Caribbean resort where their parents met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the cable channel discovered Gomez during an open casting call in Dallas five years ago, it placed her in three pilots before getting her on the air with "Wizards."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We knew we wanted her as a star in the Disney Channel universe," said Gary Marsh, president of entertainment for Disney Channels Worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the show is getting exposure in Disney Channel's ultimate showcase, the original movie franchise that launched&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"HSM."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a great example of how we can groom our stars across different genres on different platforms," Marsh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's shaping up to be a summer of Selena Gomez on Disney; on June 26 the channel will premiere the original movie "Princess Protection Program," in which Gomez stars alongside Demi Lovato.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for "Hannah Montana," which recently jumped to the big screen as a box-office-topping feature, talks are under way for a fourth season of the series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Sheri Linden at Reuters)&lt;/p&gt;

STELLUNGNAHME VON REX W. TILLERSON, CHAIRMAN VON EXXONMOBIL: 

&#8222;ExxonMobil konnte das erste Quartal trotz einer Abschw&#228;chung auf dem Weltmarkt
sowie stark gesunkener Rohstoffpreise mit einem guten Ergebnis abschlie&#223;en. Im
ersten Quartal belief sich das Nettoergebnis von ExxonMobil auf USD 4,6
Milliarden. Das entspricht einem R&#252;ckgang von 58 % gegen&#252;ber dem ersten Quartal
von 2008. Die Gewinne je Aktie sanken um 54 %, was auf die gesunkenen Gewinne
sowie die positive Resonanz des Aktienr&#252;ckkaufprogramms zur&#252;ckzuf&#252;hren ist.

&#8222;Trotz wesentlicher Ver&#228;nderungen in der Weltwirtschaft f&#252;hrte ExxonMobil seine
langfristige Strategie und seinen disziplinierten Ansatz in Bezug auf
Investitionen fort. Im ersten Quartal wendete das Unternehmen USD 5,8 Milliarden
f&#252;r Investitions- und Explorationsprojekte auf. Dies entspricht einem Anstieg
von 5 % gegen&#252;ber 2008. Wir sind bestrebt, auch weiterhin aktiv in unsere
Spitzenprojekte zu investieren, um neue Energievorr&#228;te zu schaffen, die f&#252;r das
Wirtschaftswachstum von gro&#223;er Bedeutung sind.

&#8222;Die Gesellschaft sch&#252;ttete im ersten Quartal insgesamt USD 9,0 Milliarden an
seine Aktion&#228;re aus. Dies geschah in Form von Dividenden und Aktienr&#252;ckk&#228;ufen
zur Verringerung der sich im Umlauf befindlichen Aktien."

DIE WICHTIGSTEN DATEN DES ERSTEN QUARTALS

* Das Nettoergebnis belief sich auf USD 4.550 Millionen. Das entspricht einem
R&#252;ckgang von 58 % oder USD 6.340 Millionen gegen&#252;ber dem ersten Quartal 2008. 
* Der Gewinn je Aktie betrug USD 0,92 - ein R&#252;ckgang von 54 %. 
* Die Kapital- und Explorationsaufwendungen betrugen USD 5,8 Milliarden - ein
Anstieg von 5 % gegen&#252;ber dem ersten Quartal 2008. 
* Die F&#246;rderung von &#214;l&#228;quivalenten in H&#246;he von 4,2 Millionen Barrel pro Tag hat
sich im Vergleich zum ersten Quartal 2008 leicht erh&#246;ht. Ohne die Auswirkungen
von Anspr&#252;chen, OPEC-Quoteneffekt und Devestitionen, stieg die F&#246;rderung um 2 %
an. 
* Der Cashflow aus Gesch&#228;ftst&#228;tigkeiten und dem Verkauf von Verm&#246;genswerten
betrug ca. USD 9,1 Milliarden, einschlie&#223;lich des Verkaufs von Verm&#246;genswerten
in H&#246;he von USD 0,1 Milliarden. 
* Der R&#252;ckkauf von Aktien in H&#246;he von USD 7,0 Milliarden f&#252;hrte zu einer
Verringerung der sich im Umlauf befindlichen Aktien um 1,9 %. 
* ExxonMobil gab die Ankunft der ersten Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Lieferung an
die Empfangsstation South Hook LNG in Wales bekannt. Mit der Station vergr&#246;&#223;ert
sich die LNG-Importkapazit&#228;t und Energievielfalt Gro&#223;britanniens, denn sie kann
den britischen Markt mit bis zu 2 Milliarden Kubikfu&#223; Gas pro Tag beliefern. Die
Station ist Bestandteil des Qatargas II Joint Venture, das das Vereinigte
K&#246;nigreich mit Gas vom Quatar North Field beliefert. 
* ExxonMobil weihte sein neuestes, hochleistungsf&#228;higes Heizkraftwerk an seinem
Raffineriestandort in Antwerpen, Belgien, ein. Neben der Erzeugung von 125
Megawatt tr&#228;gt das neue Kraftwerk auch zur Verringerung des Co2-Aussto&#223;es von
Belgien in einem Umfang bei, der einer Entfernung von 90.000 Autos auf
europ&#228;ischen Stra&#223;en entspricht. 
* ExxonMobil Chemical gab bekannt, dass der Bau eines Technologiezentrums in
Shanghai, China, in Planung sei. Durch dieses Zentrum will die Gesellschaft
seine wachsenden Absatzm&#228;rkte in China und Asien mit Produktanwendungen
unterst&#252;tzen. Die Inbetriebnahme des Technologiezentrums wird f&#252;r 2010
erwartet.

Erstes Quartal 2009 im Vergleich zum ersten Quartal 2008

Der Upstream-Gewinn betrug USD 3.503 Millionen, USD 5.282 Millionen weniger als
im ersten Quartal 2008. Der Gewinnr&#252;ckgang ist in erster Linie auf geringere
Erd&#246;lf&#246;rderungen mit einem Anteil von etwa USD 4,4 Milliarden und gesunkene
&#214;lpreise mit einem Anteil von &#252;ber USD 500 Millionen zur&#252;ckzuf&#252;hren. Durch
gestiegene Betriebskosten ist der Gewinn ebenfalls um mehr als USD 300 Millionen
gesunken. 

In Bezug auf &#214;l&#228;quivalente stieg die F&#246;rderung gegen&#252;ber dem ersten Quartal 2008
leicht an. Ohne die Auswirkungen von Anspr&#252;chen, OPEC-Quoteneffekten und
Devestitionen stieg die F&#246;rderung um 2 % an. 

Die F&#246;rderung von Fl&#252;ssigkeiten betrug insgesamt 2.475 kbd (Tausend Barrel pro
Tag) und war damit 7 kbd h&#246;her als im ersten Quartal 2008. Ohne die Auswirkungen
von Anspr&#252;chen, OPEC-Quoteneffekten und Devestitionen stieg die F&#246;rderung von
Fl&#252;ssigkeiten um 3 % an. Abnehmende F&#246;rdermengen aufgrund alter Felder wurden
durch h&#246;here F&#246;rderungen im Rahmen von Projekten in Westafrika, USA und in der
Nordsee sowie geringere Wartungst&#228;tigkeiten mehr als ausgeglichen. 

Die Erdgasf&#246;rderung betrug im dritten Quartal 10.195 mcfd (Millionen Kubikfu&#223;
pro Tag). Dies entspricht einem Anstieg von 34 mcfd gegen&#252;ber 2008. Abnehmende
F&#246;rdermengen aufgrund alter Felder und eine gesunkene Nachfrage auf dem
europ&#228;ischen Markt wurden durch h&#246;here F&#246;rdermengen im Rahmen zus&#228;tzlicher
Projekte in Katar, in der Nordsee und Malaysia ausgeglichen. 

Der Gewinn aus Upstream-T&#228;tigkeiten in den USA lag bei USD 360 Millionen, d. h.
1.271 Millionen weniger als im ersten Quartal 2008. Der Upstream-Gewinn
au&#223;erhalb der USA betrug USD 3.143 Millionen, und somit 4.011 Millionen USD
weniger als 2008. 

Der Downstream-Gewinn belief sich auf USD 1.133 Millionen und lag damit um USD
33 Millionen unter dem Gewinn des ersten Quartals 2008. Auswirkungen auf den
Absatz und Mischeffekte verringerten den Gewinn um &#252;ber USD 400 Millionen,
nachteiligen Auswirkungen auf dem Devisenmarkt sowie Betriebsaufwendungen um
&#252;ber USD 300 Millionen. Durch h&#246;here Margen stieg der Gewinn auf &#252;ber USD 700
Millionen. Der Absatz von Petroleum belief sich auf 6.434 kbd, und somit 387 kbd
weniger als im ersten Quartal des Vorjahres und ist vorwiegend auf die Verk&#228;ufe
von Verm&#246;genswerten sowie einer gesunkenen Nachfrage zur&#252;ckzuf&#252;hren. 

Der Downstream-Gewinn in den USA belief sich auf USD 352 Millionen, und somit
USD 46 Millionen weniger als im ersten Quartal 2008. Der Downstream-Gewinn
au&#223;erhalb der USA betrug USD 781 Millionen, und somit USD 13 Millionen mehr als
im Vorjahr. 

Der Gewinn aus dem Chemikaliengesch&#228;ft betrug USD 350 Millionen, und somit USD
678 Millionen weniger als im ersten Quartal 2008. Dies ist auf geringere Abs&#228;tze
und Margen mit einem Gewinnr&#252;ckgang von jeweils USD 300 Millionen sowie
nachteiligen Auswirkungen auf dem Devisenmarkt zur&#252;ckzuf&#252;hren. Der Absatz von
Produkten im Prim&#228;renergiebereich betrug 5.527 kt (Tausend metrische Tonnen),
und somit 1.051 kt weniger als im Vorjahr. Dies ist haupts&#228;chlich auf eine
gesunkene Nachfrage zur&#252;ckzuf&#252;hren. 

Der Konzern- und Finanzierungsaufwand belief sich auf USD 436 Millionen und
stieg damit um USD 347 Millionen, was auf die insgesamt gesunkenen Zinsertr&#228;ge
zur&#252;ckzuf&#252;hren ist. 

Im ersten Quartal von 2009 kaufte die Exxon Mobil Corporation 107 Millionen
Aktien des eigenen Stammaktienbestands als Vorratsaktien zu einem Bruttopreis
von USD 7,9 Milliarden zur&#252;ck. Diese R&#252;ckk&#228;ufe enthielten USD 7,0 Milliarden zur
Verringerung der Anzahl der sich im Umlauf befindlichen Aktien, der Rest entfiel
auf den Ausgleich von Aktien, die in Verbindung mit den
Versorgungsleistungspl&#228;nen und -programmen des Unternehmens aufgewandt wurden.
Die Anzahl der sich im Umlauf befindlichen Aktien wurde von USD 4.976 Millionen
zum Ende des vierten Quartals auf USD 4.880 Millionen zum Ende des ersten
Quartals verringert. Im zweiten Quartal 2009 sollen R&#252;ckk&#228;ufe zur Verringerung
der sich im Umlauf befindlichen Aktien in H&#246;he von USD 5,0 Milliarden get&#228;tigt
werden. Die R&#252;ckk&#228;ufe k&#246;nnen sowohl am freien Markt als auch durch ausgehandelte
Transaktionen vorgenommen und jederzeit ohne Vorank&#252;ndigung erh&#246;ht, verringert
oder eingestellt werden.

LE PR&#201;SIDENT DU CONSEIL D`ADMINISTRATION D`EXXONMOBIL REX W. TILLERSON A FAIT LE
COMMENTAIRE SUIVANT : 

&#171; ExxonMobil a enregistr&#233; des r&#233;sultats solides au premier trimestre malgr&#233; le
ralentissement du march&#233; mondial et les prix nettement r&#233;duits des marchandises.
Le b&#233;n&#233;fice du premier trimestre d`ExxonMobil a atteint 4,6 milliards de
dollars, un recul de 58 % par rapport au premier trimestre de l`exercice
pr&#233;c&#233;dent. Le b&#233;n&#233;fice par action a recul&#233; de 54 %, refl&#233;tant la baisse du
b&#233;n&#233;fice et la poursuite du programme d`achat d`actions.

&#171; Malgr&#233; les changements consid&#233;rables survenus dans l`environnement &#233;conomique
mondial, ExxonMobil maintient son objectif &#224; long terme et son approche
disciplin&#233;e en mati&#232;re d`investissements. Au cours du premier trimestre, les
d&#233;penses d`investissement et d`exploration ont atteint 5,8 milliards de dollars,
une hausse de 5 % par rapport &#224; l`exercice pr&#233;c&#233;dent. Nous sommes d&#233;termin&#233;s &#224;
investir dans notre inventaire de projets de classe internationale afin de
d&#233;velopper les nouvelles sources d`&#233;nergie qui sont vitales pour la croissance
&#233;conomique.

&#171; Au cours du premier trimestre, l`entreprise a r&#233;mun&#233;r&#233; de mani&#232;re importante
ses actionnaires en distribuant un total de 9,0 milliards de dollars par le
biais de dividendes et d`achats d`actions pour r&#233;duire les actions en
circulation. &#187;

FAITS MARQUANTS DU PREMIER TRIMESTRE

* Le r&#233;sultat net a atteint 4 550 millions de dollars, un recul de 58 % par
rapport aux 6 340 millions de dollars du premier trimestre de 2008. 
* Le b&#233;n&#233;fice par action a atteint 0,92 dollar, un recul de 54 %. 
* Les d&#233;penses d`investissement et d`exploration se sont &#233;lev&#233;es &#224; 5,8 milliards
de dollars, une hausse de 5 % par rapport au premier trimestre de 2008. 
* La production sur une base d`&#233;quivalent-p&#233;trole a atteint 4,2 millions de
barils par jour, soit une l&#233;g&#232;re hausse par rapport au premier trimestre de
2008. Hors l`impact des volumes admissibles, des effets des quotas de l`OPEP et
des d&#233;sinvestissements, la production a augment&#233; de 2 %. 
* Le flux de tr&#233;sorerie issu de l`exploitation et des cessions d`actifs a &#233;t&#233;
d`environ 9,1 milliards de dollars, dont 0,1 milliard de dollars en cessions
d`actifs. 
* Les achats d`action de 7,0 milliards de dollars ont r&#233;duit le nombre d`actions
en circulation de 1,9 %. 
* ExxonMobil a annonc&#233; la r&#233;ception du premier chargement de gaz naturel
liqu&#233;fi&#233; (GNL) au terminal GNL de South Hook au pays de Galles. Pouvant livrer
jusqu`&#224; 2 milliards de pieds cubiques de GNL par jour au march&#233; anglais, le
terminal am&#233;liore la capacit&#233; d`importation et la diversification &#233;nerg&#233;tique du
Royaume-Uni. Le terminal fait partie du projet Qatargas II qui pr&#233;voit
d`acheminer au Royaume-Uni le GNL du gisement de North Field au Qatar. 
* ExxonMobil a inaugur&#233; sa derni&#232;re installation de cog&#233;n&#233;ration hautement
performante &#224; sa raffinerie d`Anvers en Belgique. En plus de produire 125
m&#233;gawatts, la nouvelle installation r&#233;duira les &#233;missions de dioxyde de carbone
en Belgique. Le volume des r&#233;ductions &#233;quivaudra au retrait de 90 000 voitures
des routes europ&#233;ennes. 
* ExxonMobil Chemical a annonc&#233; la construction d`un centre technologique en
Chine, &#224; Shanghai, afin de soutenir par un programme d`assistance produit ses
activit&#233;s en expansion sur les march&#233;s chinois et asiatique. Le centre
technologique devrait devenir op&#233;rationnel en 2010.

Le premier trimestre 2009 par rapport au premier trimestre 2008

Le b&#233;n&#233;fice en amont s`est &#233;lev&#233; &#224; 3 503 millions, soit une baisse de 5 282
millions de dollars par rapport au premier trimestre de 2008. Des r&#233;alisations
moindres de p&#233;trole brut ont fait baisser le b&#233;n&#233;fice d`environ 4,4 milliards de
dollars tandis que les prix moins &#233;lev&#233;s du gaz naturel ont fait baisser le
b&#233;n&#233;fice d`environ 500 millions de dollars. Des charges d`exploitation plus
&#233;lev&#233;es ont fait baisser le b&#233;n&#233;fice d`environ 300 millions de dollars. 

Sur une base d`&#233;quivalent-p&#233;trole, la production a l&#233;g&#232;rement augment&#233; par
rapport au premier trimestre de 2008. Hors l`impact des volumes admissibles, des
effets des quotas de l`OPEP et des d&#233;sinvestissements, la production a augment&#233;
de 2 %. 

La production de liquides a atteint au total 2 475 kbj (milliers de barils par
jour), soit une hausse de 7 kbj par rapport au premier trimestre de 2008. Hors
l`impact des volumes admissibles, des effets des quotas de l`OPEP et des
d&#233;sinvestissements, la production de liquides a augment&#233; de 3 %, la production
plus &#233;lev&#233;e des projets en Afrique occidentale, aux &#201;tats-Unis et en mer du Nord
et des activit&#233;s d`entretien moins importantes ayant largement compens&#233; le
d&#233;clin des champs. 

La production de gaz naturel au premier trimestre s`est &#233;lev&#233;e &#224; 10 195 mpcj
(millions de pieds cubiques par jour), soit une diminution de 34 mpcj par
rapport &#224; 2008. Des nouveaux volumes de production dus &#224; l`ajout de projets au
Qatar, en mer du Nord et en Malaisie ont &#233;t&#233; largement contrebalanc&#233;s par le
d&#233;clin des champs et une demande europ&#233;enne moins importante. 

Le b&#233;n&#233;fice des op&#233;rations en amont aux &#201;tats-Unis a atteint 360 millions de
dollars, 1 271 millions de dollars de moins qu`au premier trimestre de 2008. Le
b&#233;n&#233;fice en amont en dehors des &#201;tats-Unis a atteint 3 143 millions de dollars,
soit une diminution de 4 011 millions de dollars par rapport &#224; l`ann&#233;e derni&#232;re.


Le b&#233;n&#233;fice en aval de 1 133 millions de dollars a diminu&#233; de 33 millions de
dollars par rapport au premier trimestre de 2008. Les effets des volumes et de
la composition ont fait diminuer les b&#233;n&#233;fices d`environ 400 millions de dollars
tandis que les impacts des taux de change d&#233;favorables et les charges
d`exploitation plus &#233;lev&#233;es ont fait diminuer le b&#233;n&#233;fice d`environ 300 millions
de dollars. Les marges plus &#233;lev&#233;es ont fait augmenter le b&#233;n&#233;fice d`environ 700
millions de dollars. Les ventes de produits p&#233;troliers de 6 434 kbj ont diminu&#233;
de 387 kbj par rapport au premier trimestre de l`ann&#233;e pr&#233;c&#233;dente, refl&#233;tant
essentiellement des cessions d`actifs et une demande moins importante. 

Le b&#233;n&#233;fice en aval aux &#201;tats-Unis a atteint 352 millions de dollars, une perte
de 46 millions de dollars par rapport au premier trimestre de 2008. Le b&#233;n&#233;fice
en aval en dehors des &#201;tats-Unis a atteint 781 millions de dollars, soit une
progression de 13 millions de dollars par rapport &#224; l`ann&#233;e pr&#233;c&#233;dente. 

Le b&#233;n&#233;fice des produits chimiques de 350 millions de dollars a diminu&#233; de 678
millions de dollars par rapport au premier trimestre de 2008. Des volumes plus
bas et des marges moins &#233;lev&#233;es ont, dans les deux cas, fait diminuer le
b&#233;n&#233;fice d`environ 300 millions de dollars. Les effets d`un taux de change
d&#233;favorable ont &#233;galement fait diminuer le b&#233;n&#233;fice. Les ventes de produits de
base de 5 527 kt (milliers de tonnes m&#233;triques) au premier trimestre ont diminu&#233;
de 1 051 kt par rapport &#224; l`ann&#233;e pr&#233;c&#233;dente du fait d`une demande moins
importante. 

Les charges d`entreprise et les charges de financement de 436 millions de
dollars ont progress&#233; de 347 millions de dollars du fait d`imp&#244;ts nets plus
&#233;lev&#233;s. 

Au cours du premier trimestre de 2009, Exxon Mobil Corporation a achet&#233; 107
millions d`actions ordinaires pour sa tr&#233;sorerie au co&#251;t brut de 7,9 milliards
de dollars. Ces achats incluent les 7,0 milliards de dollars qui ont permis de
r&#233;duire le nombre d`actions en circulation, le solde ayant servi &#224; compenser les
actions &#233;mises dans le contexte des plans et programmes de r&#233;mun&#233;ration de la
soci&#233;t&#233;. Le nombre d`actions en circulation qui &#233;tait de 4 976 millions &#224; la fin
du quatri&#232;me trimestre a &#233;t&#233; r&#233;duit &#224; 4 880 millions &#224; la fin du premier
trimestre. On estime &#224; pr&#233;sent que les achats d`actions en vue de r&#233;duire les
actions en circulation &#233;quivaudront &#224; 5,0 milliards pendant le deuxi&#232;me
trimestre 2009. Les achats peuvent &#234;tre r&#233;alis&#233;s &#224; la fois sur l`open market et
par le biais de transactions n&#233;goci&#233;es et peuvent augmenter, diminuer ou cesser
&#224; tout moment, sans pr&#233;avis.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) reported a 64 percent decline in quarterly profit on Friday, lagging Wall Street forecasts, as a sharp drop in energy prices stung the second-largest U.S. oil company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron, like other oil majors, is making efforts to adjust to the lower energy price environment but finding it harder than some smaller and nimbler rivals because of its size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're cutting costs, they're changing what they're doing ... and conserving cash," said James Halloran, analyst at National City Private Client Group. "But the bigger they are, the harder it is to slow down quickly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Production actually climbed by 64,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from a year ago to 2.66 million boepd, even as reduced production quotas in OPEC states cut its output by 50,000 bpd during the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the output increase was not nearly enough to compensate for the steep drop in oil and natural gas liquids prices, which fell by nearly 60 percent to $36 a barrel in the United States and by 55 percent to $39 a barrel in its international operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing the economy and weaker pricing, Chevron is keeping its dividend steady despite an expected rise, and said share buybacks, halted last quarter, were unlikely to resume this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The share repurchases come after the dividend and they come after the capital program," Chief Financial Officer Pat Yarrington told analysts on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larger rival Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) announced reduced buybacks alongside results on Thursday that disappointed investors who had been growing accustomed to energy companies reporting better-than-expected profits despite the collapse in crude oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said its net profit fell to $1.84 billion, or 92 cents per share, from $5.17 billion, or $2.48 per share, a year earlier. Revenue plunged 46 percent to $35 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding a $400 million gain from the sale of its marketing businesses in Nigeria and Brazil, its earnings of 72 cents per share were short of the average analyst estimate of 81 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares were 0.2 percent higher at $66.24 by midday, following a drop on Thursday in response to Exxon results. Chevron is down 11 percent in 2009, versus a 5 percent decline for the Chicago Board Options Exchange oil index .OIX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about a $27 billion claim over environmental damage in Ecuador, Yarrington repeated the company's stance that the case was without merit and any remaining environmental damages were the responsibility of state oil company Petroecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is possible that we could see a judgment come down any day now," she said.

&lt;p&gt;Shareholders Increasingly Nervous About Possible $27 Billion Liability for Oil
Giant

WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
The CBS investigative news show 60 Minutes has announced it will air a segment
this Sunday about Chevron`s complicity in the contamination of pristine
rainforest deep in the Amazon jungle of Ecuador. The highly acclaimed news show
is expected to focus on the sub-standard practices used by Texaco, now owned by
Chevron, for oil exploration from 1964 to 1990 when it extracted more than one
billion barrels of oil from a pristine area of rainforest that was once home to
six thriving indigenous groups. 

Chevron faces a potential liability of $27 billion in a 15-year class action
lawsuit over the environmental damage in Ecuador`s courts, which experts have
called the "Amazon Chernobyl". A decision in that case, which was transferred
from U.S. federal court to Ecuador at Chevron`s request, is expected later this
year. 

The 60 Minutes piece follows insightful and compelling news coverage by large
media outlets during the past few weeks, including an article in the Wall Street
Journal about pension funds` concerns over Chevron`s actions and its failure to
adequately disclose information about the case to shareholders. This week, the
Washington Post and National Public Radio exposed new details about Texaco`s
sub-standard operational practices in Ecuador. 

Public pension funds from New York City and Philadelphia, and the states of New
York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland, have expressed concern to Chevron over the
threat to shareholder value posed by the potential clean-up liability in
Ecuador. 

Driving the 60 Minutes segment is the epic court battle in Ecuador between
Chevron and the indigenous groups and farmer communities whose way of life has
been decimated by the dumping of what even Chevron admits was over 18 billion
gallons of untreated waste water directly into Amazon waterways. Texaco also
gouged more than 900 large, unlined pits out of the jungle floor to store oil
sludge left over from exploration and well maintenance. 

During the past five decades, toxic sludge from these pits has leached into the
underground water and surrounding soils. Because no other water supply is
available, most people in the area are forced to drink and bathe in water
contaminated with carcinogens and other toxic hydrocarbons, leading to a
dramatic increase in cancer deaths and the decimation of the traditional
lifestyles of five indigenous groups. 

A court-appointed team of 15 experts that recently reviewed almost 200,000 pages
of evidence in the case concluded that the contamination has produced more than
1,400 deaths from cancer and an undetermined number of skin diseases,
miscarriages, and respiratory illnesses. The team`s report, which totals 4,000
pages and has won praise from several scientists who have reviewed it, also
estimated that damages to Chevron could be as high as $27 billion - an amount
that would wipe out more than a year of profits for the oil giant. 

Testifying before a congressional committee earlier this week, Steven Donziger,
a U.S. legal advisor to the affected Amazonian communities, described Texaco`s
operation in Ecuador as an environmental "pump and dump" operation. 

"The environmental degradation of this area, done intentionally by Texaco to
lower production costs, has today produced a humanitarian crisis of epic
proportions," Donziger testified. 

Chevron`s main line of defense has been to blame the government-owned oil
company Petroecuador for the pollution, and to claim that a 1995 remediation
agreement between the government of Ecuador and Texaco releases them from
damages. 

These defenses fall flat for several reasons: 

Texaco exclusively engineered, built, and operated the system in way that was
designed to pollute without any involvement from its investment partners. As the
Washington Post and NPR reported, Texaco was the "sole operator" of the oil
fields for 26 years. Petroecuador inherited the deficient operation in 1990 and
has invested significant amounts to upgrade the system to minimize environmental
impacts. 

Chevron also has the right to sue Petroecuador for indemnification at part of
the trial process, but has chosen not to do so. 

Chevron also argues that Texaco`s use of unlined pits was consistent with U.S.
practices; however, unlined pits are generally prohibited in the U.S. because of
the threat they pose to groundwater. In the rare instances when they are used,
it is for temporary storage of waste. In Ecuador, Texaco used the pits for
permanent storage and most have been on the ground for almost four decades and
will be there for centuries unless cleaned up, according to experts. 

The remediation agreement, often cited by Chevron in its defense, did not
release third-party private claims of the type being pressed in the lawsuit (it
only released Chevron from government claims). In fact, that "release" is
irrelevant to the private lawsuit as the plaintiffs in the case never signed it;
a Chevron attorney recently acknowledged in sworn testimony that it does not
apply to the private lawsuit. 

Language from the Memorandum of Understanding signed in conjunction with the
release expressly carves out private claims: "The provisions of this [MOU] shall
apply without prejudice to the rights possibly held by third parties for the
impact caused as a consequence of the operations of the former
Petroecuador-Texaco consortium." 

Evidence in the trial has shown the agreement to be invalid, and possibly
fraudulent, because the oil pits Texaco agreed to clean up in exchange for the
release remain highly contaminated. In fact, the court damages team found no
difference in levels of contamination between pits "remediated" by Texaco and
those not remediated. All 94 former Texaco production sites inspected by the
court demonstrated high levels of soil contamination and much of the proof came
from Chevron itself, according to the court report on damages.

Recently, an Ecuadorian prosecutor indicted two Chevron lawyers and seven former
Ecuadorian officials for lying about the results of the "remediation" so Texaco
could obtain the release.

&lt;p&gt;ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) - Mickey Mouse, Pluto, the Fairy Godmother and other Walt Disney favorites were still dishing out kisses, handshakes and high-fives at the Magic Kingdom on Thursday, despite the flu virus alert gripping the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the world famous Florida theme park, which is run by Walt Disney Co and visited by millions each year, enthusiastic crowds filled the avenues and rides, apparently unworried by the warnings of a possible pandemic of a new strain of influenza A (H1N1) virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States has declared a health emergency and in Mexico, where up to 176 people have died following the outbreak there of the virus originally termed "swine flu," the government has ordered a five-day partial shutdown of nonessential government offices and businesses. The Mexican Health Ministry also warned people against touching or kissing while greeting each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities in the United States, who have reported 109 confirmed swine flu infections but only one death, are recommending that people sick with flu symptoms seek treatment and stay home. Florida is testing a number of suspected cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Magic Kingdom on Thursday, one mother pressed her baby's face into the costumed character Pluto's furry snout for a kiss. Other youngsters continued to snuggle up to various other Disney characters and share "high-fives," while fidgety kids slid their hands along the rope lines while waiting to get on the rides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the crowds were the Jansens from Amsterdam in the Netherlands. They said they were not worried about bringing their 2-year-old and 7-year-old children to the Magic Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no concern for us. We always go to the big public places with the kids," said Ed Jansen. "Just like any Dutch man or Dutch woman, we have both feet on the floor. We're not a panicked people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coordinating the international campaign against the new flu virus, the World Health Organization (WHO) has its current alert level just one notch below a full pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite some official fears that crowded venues could increase contagion risk, there were no visible extraordinary precautionary measures in place at Disney's Magic Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trash sweepers, as usual, swept up bits of garbage almost before they touched ground, but they did not appear to be doing any extra disinfecting or unusual cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DISNEY 'MONITORING SITUATION'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Walt Disney Co. has maintained a tight-lipped stance about the flu alert, wary of any news that could trouble its carefully crafted guest experience at the world's largest theme park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney spokeswoman Andrea Finger in Orlando told Reuters this week, "We're not really talking about it," declining to say whether any special health measures were being taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney World representatives held a closed-door meeting with public health leaders on Thursday in Orlando to discuss the flu alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the meeting with Orange County Health Director Dr. Kevin Sherin, Disney representative Mike Griffin told local media the company was "monitoring the situation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sherin and Orange County Mayor Rich Crotty said they had full confidence in Disney's contingency plans in the event of a health emergency, but they gave no details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We truly have world class theme parks in Orange County and Osceola County," Sherin said, referring to Disney World, Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando. "These are the best in the world. The practices they have to protect cast members and staff and guests are second to none."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Universal Orlando is co-owned by the Blackstone Group and NBC Universal, a unit of General Electric Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most visitors seemed determined not to let the alarm over the spreading flu virus spoil their family fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We come from a tropical island and we have many kinds of fevers," said Puerto Rican retiree Luis Larregoity and his wife Miriam Cruz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ann Genthner, a grandmother from Boston visiting the Magic Kingdom with her daughter-in-law and two grandchildren, said she hadn't bothered to follow the news about the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I thought about it, but it didn't affect me in any way," Genthner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Pascal Fletcher)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * To use spreads to assess risk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Will invest in investment grade and high yield&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * GSAM to add to credit team in London this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Claire Milhench&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, May 1 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs's (GS.N) fund arm is
developing a new global credit strategy for institutions that
will rely on market prices rather than heavily-criticised credit
rating agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Clients often give investment guidelines determined by
credit ratings, but we don't think that's the way to think about
risk," said Andrew Wilson, global co-head of fixed income and
currency at Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, GSAM's approach is to segment credit spreads into
five groups, to assess how issuers are trading in relation to
their peers, Wilson told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "So the widest 20 percent are the most risky, regardless of
the rating," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That has helped us identify risky names and react in a
timely fashion, as the market is a much better guide. Credit
spreads widen immediately on bad news, whereas it might take a
while for the ratings agencies to reflect that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regulators and analysts have criticised ratings agencies
Moody's Investors Service, Standard and Poor's and Fitch Ratings
for making errors of judgement on complicated credit tools that
helped to create the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a dearth of alternatives makes it difficult to get away
from the agencies entirely. [ID:nLA503215]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wilson said that relying on names which are rated 'triple B'
and above -- the traditional way of framing investment grade
mandates -- had not been that helpful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Ratings agencies are good at static analysis but they are
less good at forecasting," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The strategy will take an unconstrained, or "opportunistic"
approach, investing across the credit spectrum and assessing how
cheap investment grade credits are relative to high yield, for
example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EXPOSURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wilson said there were no specific limits on exposure, but
said there might be 30 to 40 percent in investment grade, and
the rest in distressed and high yield assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We think it's a good time to start putting money to work
(in the credit area)," he said. "From a risk-adjusted point of
view, investment grade is possibly the best place to be but we
see good opportunities across the credit spectrum."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GSAM's fixed income and currency business had some 240
billion pounds ($356.1 billion) in assets at the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GSAM is looking to add to its credit team in London this
year, Wilson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I would hope to have at least an extra two to three people
by year-end -- both analysts and portfolio managers to make sure
we are well resourced," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Looking across GSAM's fixed income portfolios, the aim is to
gradually increase exposure to credit over the next three to six
months as earnings clarity improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In terms of sector exposure, Wilson said GSAM would probably
start with financials as these were the cheapest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also tipped early cyclicals in energy and mining: "We are
relatively optimistic about the economic situation in relation
to the gloom and doom that is around. We don't think it's going
to be as bad as the scaremongers are saying."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He pointed out that China is improving, which should support
miners and other commodity-related stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We don't like the later consumer cyclicals such as autos or
retailers. It's way too soon for that," he added.

SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today reported earnings of $1.84 billion ($0.92
per share - diluted) for the first quarter 2009, compared with $5.17 billion
($2.48 per share - diluted) in the 2008 first quarter. Earnings in the 2009
period included gains of approximately $400 million ($0.20 per share) on
downstream asset sales. 

Sales and other operating revenues in the first quarter 2009 were $35 billion,
down from $65 billion in the year-ago period due mainly to lower prices for
refined products and crude oil.

"Operationally, we had an excellent quarter," said Chairman and CEO Dave
O`Reilly, "with oil production and refinery inputs both higher than a year ago
and operating expenses lower. However, upstream earnings declined sharply on
lower prices for crude oil and natural gas. Downstream profits improved mainly
on gains from asset sales, while margins on the sale of refined products
recovered only slightly from a depressed level in last year`s first quarter." 

O`Reilly said production increases in the first quarter included volumes from
start-up of deepwater projects last year at Agbami in Nigeria and Blind Faith in
the United States and from expansion activities completed last year at Tengiz in
Kazakhstan. 

Deepwater production start-ups in 2009 are scheduled at 58 percent-owned Tahiti
in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, 31 percent-owned Tombua-Landana in Angola and 52
percent-owned Frade in Brazil. Total maximum oil-equivalent production is
estimated at 135,000 barrels per day from Tahiti by the end of 2009, while
Tombua-Landana and Frade are expected to reach maximums of 100,000 barrels per
day and 90,000 barrels per day, respectively, in 2011. 

O`Reilly said operational successes in the first quarter of this year also
included a deepwater oil discovery in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico at the 55
percent-owned Buckskin prospect and completion of an exploration and appraisal
program for the Wheatstone and Iago fields offshore northwest Australia. Chevron
has a 100 percent interest in Wheatstone and a two-thirds interest in Iago.
Resources from Wheatstone and Iago are expected to support the construction of a
two-train LNG plant and domestic natural-gas plant. 

UPSTREAM - EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

Worldwide oil-equivalent production was 2.66 million barrels per day in the
first quarter 2009, up 64,000 barrels per day from the corresponding 2008
period. The increase was driven by the effect of production start-ups during
2008 and the impact of lower prices on cost-recovery and variable-royalty
volumes in certain production contracts outside the United States. Production
quotas imposed by OPEC curtailed company production by about 50,000 barrels per
day. At the end of the period, approximately 35,000 barrels per day of
production remained offline in the Gulf of Mexico due to damage caused by
hurricanes last September, with restoration of the volumes to occur as repairs
to third-party pipelines and producing facilities are completed.

U.S. upstream earnings of $21 million in the first quarter of 2009 were down
$1.6 billion from the year-ago period on sharply lower prices for crude oil and
natural gas and a decline in natural-gas production. The 2009 quarter also
included about $100 million of write-offs associated with exploration
activities. 

The company`s average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural gas
liquids was $36 in the 2009 quarter, down $51 from a year earlier. The average
price of natural gas of $4.14 per thousand cubic feet in 2009 was $3.41 lower. 

Net oil-equivalent production of 671,000 barrels per day in the 2009 period was
down 44,000. The lower volumes were mainly due to production shut in as a result
of last year`s hurricanes and normal field declines. Partially offsetting these
effects was an increase of 35,000 barrels per day between periods that was
associated with the late-2008 start-up of the Blind Faith project in the Gulf of

441,000 barrels per day between periods. Net natural gas production of 1.38
billion cubic feet per day in the 2009 quarter declined 17 percent, with nearly
half the decline associated with the hurricane effects.

International upstream earnings of $1.2 billion decreased $2.3 billion from the
first quarter 2008 due mainly to lower prices for crude oil. A benefit between
periods from higher sales volumes in various regions was largely offset by
higher depreciation expenses. Foreign-exchange effects increased income by $33
million in the 2009 period but reduced earnings $167 million a year earlier. 

The average sales price for crude oil and natural gas liquids in the 2009
quarter declined about $47 per barrel to $39. The price of natural gas decreased
62 cents to $4.21 per thousand cubic feet. 

Net oil-equivalent production of 1.99 million barrels per day in the 2009 first
quarter was 108,000 higher than a year ago. The increase included about 150,000
barrels per day of production associated with the mid-2008 start-up at Agbami in
Nigeria and the expansion project at Tengiz in Kazakhstan. The impact of lower
prices on cost-recovery volumes and other contractual provisions affecting
Chevron`s share of production resulted in a net increase of about 50,000 barrels
per day between periods.These effects were partially offset by OPEC-related
curtailments of about 50,000 barrels per dayand lower natural gas production in
Thailand. The net liquids component of production increased about 10 percent
from a year ago to 1.38 million barrels per day, while net natural gas
production declined about 3 percent to 3.64 billion cubic feet per day.

International downstream earnings of $690 million increased $442 million from
the first quarter 2008. The 2009 quarter included gains of $400 million
associated mainly with sales of marketing businesses in Nigeria and Brazil.
Margins on the sale of refined products were slightly higher between periods,
and operating and selling expenses declined. Foreign currency effects reduced
earnings in the 2009 quarter by $65 million but benefited income $111 million a
year earlier. 

Refinery crude-input of 985,000 barrels per day was about 2 percent higher than
the first quarter of 2008. Total refined-product sales volumes of 1.96 million
barrels per day declined 5 percent from last year`s first quarter on lower sales
of fuel oil, gas oil and gasoline.

Capital and exploratory expenditures in the first quarter 2009 were $6.5
billion, compared with $5.1 billion in the corresponding 2008 period. These
amounts included approximately $300 million and $500 million, respectively, for
the company`s share of expenditures by affiliates, which did not require cash
outlays by Chevron`s consolidated companies. Outlays in the 2009 quarter
included $2 billion for an upstream concession extension. Expenditures for
upstream projects in the first quarter 2009 represented 85 percent of the
companywide total.

value integrating WebSphere commerce technology with Omniture's Online
Marketing Suite and Pluck's integrated social media platform. IBM Impact

and is designed to provide actionable plans to achieve measurable

that will provide companies the most relevant metrics pertaining to
customer satisfaction, such as site acquisition, site traffic and
segmentation," said Larry Bowden, vice president of portals and mashups,
IBM. "This integration with Omniture SiteCatalyst provides users the
ability to measure comprehensive data about visitor activity on the
WebSphere portal so mutual customers can best utilize the technologies
that optimize business success."

    The UEOI will be a multi-phase program that will enable WebSphere
components to collect metric data, then integrate Omniture SiteCatalyst
with IBM's WebSphere Portal to better create, measure and manage content.

    "Omniture and IBM are coming together to serve the largest online portal
customers in the world," said Mark Dillon, vice president of worldwide

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
DPL Inc. (NYSE: DPL), Hexcel Corp. (NYSE: HXL), Pozen Inc. (NASDAQ: POZN), LSI
Corp. (NYSE: LSI) and ExxonMobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM).

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

DPL Making Strategic Shift

DPL Inc. (NYSE: DPL) reported its financial results for its 1st quarter of
fiscal 2009. DPL reported 1st quarter 2009 earnings of $0.61 per share, compared
to $0.66 per share for the same period in 2008. Total diluted shares outstanding
were 112.7 million for the first quarter of 2009 and 116.4 million for the same
period in 2008. 

In the reported quarter, revenues decreased $1.1 million to $415.0 million
compared to $416.1 million in the year-ago quarter. This decrease was primarily
the result of lower retail and wholesale sales volumes and lower average
wholesale rates, partially offset by higher average retail rates and higher RTO
capacity revenues. 

Hexcel Conditions Improving

Hexcel Corp. (NYSE: HXL) announced that Q1-09 Sales declined by 10.8% to $307.3
million (on a constant dollar basis, sales decreased by only 5.5%); even with
this revenue drop, EPS were still flat at 24&#162; -- pretty darn good, considering
what some other Aerospace/Defense suppliers have recently reported. 

The most significant Sales decline occurred in the Commercial Aerospace sector,
which was off by 19.9% to $153.8 million, followed by Industrial, which dropped
by 1.3% to $77.3 million; Space &amp; Defense, on the other hand, rose by 2.6% to
$76.2 million. 

Pozen Fundamentals Look Strong

Pozen Inc. (NASDAQ: POZN) reported financial results for the first quarter 2009
on April 30, 2009. Total revenues for the first quarter were $8.8 million, an
increase of 12% from the first quarter in 2008 and slightly ahead of our
forecasts. Revenues consisted of $4.1 million in licensing revenue and $4.7 of
development revenues. Included in this figures is approximately $1.0 million in
royalty on sales of Treximet $20.3 million. 

Net loss for the quarter totaled $3.5 million, or $0.12 per share, slightly
worse than our $2.8 million forecast. Operating expenses were slightly higher
than expected during the quarter. Management is incurring legal fees associated
with the patent litigation lawsuit against Par for the paragraph IV challenge to
Treximet. Management exited the first quarter 2009 with $52.3 million in cash
and investment. 

LSI Q2 Likely in the Red

LSI Corp. (NYSE: LSI, Hold) reported its fiscal Q1 results yesterday. Q1 revenue
of $482.3 million came in towards the higher end of guidance ($440 - $500
million) and topped our and consensus estimate of $474 million and $469 million,
respectively. Revenues were driven largely by an upside in the semiconductor
business, with weak systems business being the mitigating factor. Non-GAAP net
loss came in at $(0.03), versus our estimate of $(0.04). 

The company guided Q2 revenue of $470 - $530 million and non-GAAP EPS in the
range of $0.01 to $(0.06). This compares with our estimate of $479 million in
revenues and non-GAAP EPS of $(0.03). LSI achieved reduction in operating
expense in the quarter at $214 million, down from $232 million in the prior
quarter. Q2 opex is expected to remain at the current levels and expects opex of
$213-$223 million in Q2. 

Exxon Earnings Miss Modestly

ExxonMobil Corp.'s (NYSE: XOM) first-quarter 2009 earnings came in modestly
below expectations, but the company raised its quarterly dividend and maintained
its share buyback rate of the last few quarters. With a cash balance of around
$25 billion and a pristine credit profile, Exxon remains better positioned than
any other company in the world to navigate the current downturn. 

Exxon raised its quarterly dividend by $0.02 per share to annualized run rate of
$1.68 per share, the 27th consecutive year that it has raised its dividend. The
company remained active on the share buyback front as well, maintaining its
quarterly repurchase average of around $7 billion. The company guided towards a
buyback rate of $5 billion for the second quarter and refused to give any color
on this vital front going forward. While dividends and capital expenditures are
not expected to drop in response to the weak macro backdrop, the pace of
buybacks will have to slow down in the coming quarters, in our view.

Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

L-3 Quarterly Results Improve

L-3 Communications (NYSE: LLL) announced results for its 1st quarter of 2009.
LLL reported stable 1st quarter 2009 results with sales up 3.7% year-over-year,
net income up 5.3% and fully-diluted EPS up 9.9%. 

The U.S. Department of Defense accounted for 74% of the company`s total revenue
in 2008. 

Net income for the reported quarter increased 4.8% to $197 million or $1.66 per
basic and diluted share, compared to $188 million or $1.51 per diluted share
($1.53 basic) recorded in the prior-year quarter. Net sales increased 3.7% to
$3.6 billion compared to $3.5 billion in the year-ago quarter. The growth came
through primarily from the C3ISR segment, and in the Specialized Products
segment. 

Wyeth Shares Tread Water

We currently rate shares of Wyeth (NYSE: WYE) a Hold with a $47 price target.
Our target assumes Pfizer Inc.`s (NYSE: PFE) shares trade up near $14.50
(currently $13.25) by the expected close date in the third or fourth quarter. At
an exchange ratio of 0.985 and combined with the $33 cash per Wyeth share, this
equates to roughly $47 per share. 

Revenue in 2008 grew 2% and was up 1% excluding the benefit from foreign
exchange. EPS was flat from 2007 on lower interest income and a higher tax rate,
partially offset by lower SG spend. Revenue in the first quarter 2009 was
lower than our forecast. This was largely due to a stronger than expected impact
from foreign exchange, lower contribution from Alliance revenue as a result of
softer U.S. sales of Enbrel and weaker-than-expected international sales of
Effexor. 

Sanofi Should Buy Biogen

Sanofi-Aventis SA (NYSE: SNY) posted EPS of EUR5.36 in 2008, an increase of just
2% from 2007. Revenue fell 1% in 2008 as a number of products experienced a
significant decline in sales including: Ambien, Tritace and Copaxone. 

However, for 2009 we expect revenue growth to return as generic erosion is more
than offset by strong growth of Taxotere, Lantus, Avapro and the vaccines
business. We expect revenue growth of 6% in 2009 and EPS of EUR5.89 ($3.90), up
10% from 2008. 

CBI Pulls an Iron Out of the Fire

Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron (NYSE: CBI) reported that -- while first quarter 2009
Revenue had dropped by 10.0% to $1.439 billion -- EPS had risen by 15.7%, from
43&#162; to 51&#162;, on a 2.0% drop in the number of shares. Extremely refreshing! 

CBI`s Gross Profit rose by 14.4% to $144.2 million and the Gross Profit Margin
increased from 8.8% to 11.1%. S,G Expense declined by 7.4% to $59.2 million;
however, it increased as a percent of Sales from 4.4% to 4.6%. Amortization of
Intangibles dropped by 4.9% to $5.6 million.

&lt;p&gt;Oil Giant Fails to Disclose That It Paid for "News" Video Narrated by Former CNN
Correspondent Gene Randall


WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
To promote a misinformation campaign about its role in the oil contamination of
a pristine area of the rainforest in Ecuador, Chevron recently produced a video
that copies the format and style of television news shows and portrays Texaco,
now owned by Chevron, as completely blameless in the dumping of billions of
gallons of toxic waste into the Amazon jungle. 

Chevron has bought online advertising on Google to promote the 13-minute video
ahead of the airing tonight of a 60 Minutes segment, reported by Scott Pelley,
that is expected to expose the company`s complicity in what is considered the
world`s worst oil-related contamination. Chevron never reveals it paid for the
video, which is designed to look like an "objective" CNN news report and is
narrated by former CNN correspondent and current corporate consultant Gene
Randall. 

Two environmental groups are blasting Chevron and Randall for engaging in the
deceptive practice of producing a corporate news video that looks like a news
broadcast. They called on Chevron to stop airing the video until the company
makes a full disclosure. 

"Chevron is using false information in this deceptive video to mislead the
public, its own shareholders, and Chevron employees about its responsibility for
an environmental disaster of epic proportions," Mitch Anderson, Executive
Director of Amazon Watch, an environmental advocacy group in San Francisco. 

"Randall should be ashamed to lend his credibility built up over years as a
legitimate journalist to an oil company trying evade accountability for a
disaster that is literally killing off indigenous groups and destroying the
rainforest," added Anderson. 

"If I were CNN, I would be furious because Randall essentially is getting paid
by Chevron to use and dilute CNN`s brand without permission." 

The video can be seenat http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YMCGC-2ytE.

Chevron faces a potential civil liability of up to $27 billion for the Ecuador
contamination in an epic 15-year trial in Ecuador`s courts brought by dozens of
indigenous groups and farmer communities. The damages assessment was produced by
a team of 15 experts and is contained in a 4,000 page court report that analyzed
the evidence in the case and places blame squarely on Chevron for the problems. 

A final decision on the case is expected later this year. 

The trial is taking place in Ecuador at Chevron`s request after it was
transferred from U.S. federal court in 2002. At the time, Chevron submitted
numerous sworn affidavits praising the fairness of Ecuador`s courts, although
with a decision in the case imminent the company now claims those same courts
are treating it unfairly. 

The Chevron corporate video uses paid Chevron consultants and employees who cite
discredited information consistent with the company`s talking points on the
case, said Karen Hinton, a U.S.-based spokesperson for the rainforest
communities. Randall advertises himself as a producer and narrator of corporate
videos with a "news flavor". (For more information about Randall, see
http://www.generandall.com/) 

The Ecuadorian man who has led the communities in the battle against Chevron
said the company should either pull the ad or inform viewers it produced it. 

"Telling the truth isn`t easy for Chevron because the company has put out much
misinformation about the harm Texaco did to my country and its people," said
Luis Yanza, President of the Amazon Defense Coalition, an Ecuadorian group that
represents the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. 

The hiring of Randall is not the first time Chevron has tried to use the veneer
of the news media to promote its misinformation campaign, said Hinton. Chevron
paid a little-known San Francisco-based online newspaper publisher, Pat Murphy,
to write positive news article about Chevron in Ecuador without revealing Murphy
was paid, said Hinton. Collaborating with Murphy has been the online blogger
Zennie Abraham, known as Zennie 62, who parrots Chevron`s talking points in his
blogs. (For more information regarding Chevron`s use of Pat Murphy and Zennie
Abraham as proxies to disseminate the company`s propaganda, see
http://chevrontoxico.com/news-and-multimedia/2008/1024-chevron-asked-to-disclose-relationship-to-pat-murphy.html
and
http://chevrontoxico.com/news-and-multimedia/2009/0331-chevron-pr-director-donald-samson-behind-secret-payments-to-bloggers-to-hide-ecuador-liability.html

Chevron has not denied charges that it funnels money to seemingly independent
journalists, including Murphy and Abraham, to post what appears to be editorial
content that is actually paid advertising, said Hinton. 

The Chevron video misleads viewers on several important elements of the lawsuit,
as demonstrated by evidence in the 4,000-page report prepared by a team of court
experts, said Anderson. Some of the misleading facts are as follows:

* The video quotes Pedro Alvarez, a Chevron consultant, as saying the
contamination in Ecuador poses no risk to public health. In fact, several
parties - including Chevron - have found dangerous contaminants and carcinogens
such as Chromium VI at levels thousands of times higher than allowed by law in
Ecuador. 
* The video falsely claims Texaco earned $490 million in profits from Ecuador.
In reality, Texaco earned between $25 billion and $30 billion; Texaco`s
fourth-tier subsidiary, Texpet, earned $490 million. 
* The video falsely claims the case was brought under law passed in 1999, after
Texaco left Ecuador. In fact, it was brought under a provision of Ecuador`s
civil code dating to 1861 - a fact Chevron has admitted in court. 
* The video claims Ecuador`s courts are "unfair" but fails to reveal that the
charge was made only after the evidence at trial started to point to Chevron`s
culpability. It also fails to disclose that Chevron argued as recently as 2007
in another case that Ecuador`s courts are an adequate forum. 
* The video claims that Ecuadorian lawyer Pablo Fajardo, who has won a CNN
"Hero" Award for his work on the case, tried to stop Ecuador`s state-owned oil
company from cleaning Texaco`s contaminated sites. In fact, Fajardo tried to get
that company to clean the sites properly rather than just cover them with dirt. 
* Chevron tries to claim the health impacts such as cancers are caused by fecal
matter in the water. There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that
fecal matter causes cancer. 
* The video lies when it claims that the billions of gallons of water of
formation dumped by Texaco were "treated" before discharge. In fact, Chevron`s
own environmental audits, in evidence in the case, show the water contained
carcinogens and was not treated.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A top Hong Kong government official is pleased with the progress in talks with the Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) on expanding the underperforming Hong Kong Disneyland, and a deal could be reached soon, his spokesman said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Financial Secretary John Tsang met with Disney executives including theme parks Chairman Jay Rasulo and parks Chief Financial Officer Jim Hunt on Friday in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney and Hong Kong, which are partners in the park, have held protracted talks over financing for a second phase of construction, which could cost a reported HK$3 billion ($387 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We had very good discussions with the Disney management ... yesterday. We are happy with the progress achieved at the negotiations regarding Hong Kong Disneyland's expansion plans," spokesman Patrick Wong said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are still a number of issues to be sorted out but we hope that an agreement could be reached quite soon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney was "encouraged by the recent discussions with our partners regarding the expansion of Hong Kong Disneyland and are optimistic we will be able to finalize a deal to move forward on exciting new plans for the park," Disney spokeswoman Tasia Filippatos said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Hong Kong, officials said the talks had broken fresh ground and details on Disney's expansion would be announced soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"According to my understanding, on a number of important and significant points, everyone is beginning to have little breakthroughs," said Rita Lau, Hong Kong's Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meeting comes weeks after Disney said it had suspended expansion plans and disbanded the group of designers working on adding attractions to the 310-acre (125-hectare) park that opened in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics say it is too small to attract the repeat visits that have made Disney's other parks profitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attendance has failed to reach initial bullish projections, despite the park's proximity to mainland China, and the Chinese tourist market has since been hit by the economic crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney, meanwhile, has signed a framework agreement with authorities in Shanghai to build a park there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gina Keating and James Pomfret in Hong Kong; Editing by Xavier Briand and Valerie Lee)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to hand it to Microsoft. The software giant has taken its share of drubbings for software missteps and strong-armed business tactics. But when it comes to opening up international markets, Microsoft has been very successful, often because the company will do whatever it takes to get on the right side of local officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An appearance in Moscow last week by CEO Steve Ballmer demonstrated that making key local partnerships, announcing major investments, and lavishing praise can open doors and set the stage for future expansion abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Microsoft, Ballmer announced Russian investments totaling 10 billion Rubles (about US$300 million). The investments included:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Free Microsoft software licenses for 1,000 Russian start-ups through 2011&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Expanding the number of local computer training centers around Russia, and teaching 300,000 locals "e-skills," which Microsoft says will help them get jobs and become better citizens of the "information society." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Partnering with local universities to provide government-certified IT training&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Launching Microsoft DreamSpark -- a program aimed at getting students involved in programming and IT -- in Russia &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the products featured in the training are Microsoft's. So while the company is incurring real costs in setting up these programs and building out the facilities, they are also establishing Microsoft-centric skill sets which will help the company expand its Russian footprint in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ballmer's appearance included something else. According to the Moscow Times, he also heaped praise upon local officials for their efforts in fighting the global recession. Never mind the Russian government's attempts to stabilize the Ruble by burning through its foreign currency reserves, or its leaders' tirades against the United States for causing the global economic slowdown. The Microsoft CEO praised the "amazing work the Russian government is doing" to boost the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement might seem strange to American ears. But these comments have to be read in context of where they are said. In Russia, China, and other international markets which lack transparent legal and regulatory systems, the playing field is very uneven. Governments often play favorites. Companies from Western countries can be hurt by geopolitical shifts, historical grievances, and connections with the wrong locals. Foreign executives tread carefully with their marketing and public comments, and sometimes say things that might be laughed at back home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to say or do things the American way can backfire. Michael Dell discovered this when he tried to offer help to Russia at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January. "How can we as an IT sector broaden the economy as we move out of the crisis?" Dell asked Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin during a panel session. He got a sharp response from Putin, who apparently saw the offer as an insult. "We are not invalids," Putin declared. "We do not have limited capacity. People with limited capacities, abilities should be helped ... developing countries should be helped."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer's approach -- spread the wealth and pour on the sugar -- was received much more favorably. Ultimately, it has a much better chance of opening doors overseas and helping Microsoft achieve its long-term strategic plans.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union antitrust regulators have set a hearing next month for Microsoft to respond orally to EU charges that it sought to stymie rivals by tying the firm's Web browser to its Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closed hearing will be from June 3 to 5, European Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will be an opportunity for Microsoft to state orally the arguments they outlined in their response to the statement of objections," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. software giant Microsoft replied to EU antitrust charges, the so-called "statement of objections," on April 28. The EU's executive arm charged the company on January 15 with infringing EU rules by abusing its dominant position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By bundling its Internet Explorer with Windows, Microsoft shielded its browser from head-to-head competition with rival products, harming innovation and reducing customer choice, the Commission had said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer's global market share in February was 67.4 percent, with the Mozilla foundation's Firefox browser a distant second at about 22 percent, according to market research firm Net Applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said the Commission may order it and equipment makers to obligate users to choose a particular browser when buying a computer or that multiple browsers be made available on new Windows-based computers. It could also get a hefty fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was fined 899 million euros ($1.2 billion) in February on charges it used high prices to thwart rivals and for not complying with a previous antitrust decision by the Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee, editing by Dale Hudson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - On the face of it, Microsoft Corp stands to be the biggest loser in the cloud computing revolution if it means big companies jettison software on their own computers and move to handling information entirely on the Web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upside for the world's largest software company is that such a revolution is moving very slowly, if at all. And by the time it does arrive, Microsoft could have levered itself into position to emerge a big winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is definitely slow and late to the game," said Matt Rosoff, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft, which sells independent research to the company's customers and developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But they have a huge advantage when they finally get these services out because most businesses already have large contracts for Microsoft software that come up for renewal every two or three years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That gives the Redmond, Washington-based company an in-built edge over emerging cloud pioneers like Amazon.com Inc, Google Inc and Salesforce Inc. They have moved more aggressively into cloud computing -- the trend toward running software in remote data centers and accessing it over the Internet -- but do not have the power to capture Microsoft's most lucrative customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The promise of what Microsoft could achieve in the cloud is not yet factored into its dawdling stock price, according to Todd Lowenstein, a portfolio manager at HighMark Capital Management, which holds 434,000 shares of Microsoft across a number of funds it manages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cloud computing is an opportunity and a threat for Microsoft. The opportunity is not built in, the threat is," said Lowenstein. "If they can seize it right, this is a net benefit to them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAT REVOLUTION?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Software Architect Ray Ozzie put cloud computing at the forefront of Microsoft's long-term thinking in 2005 with a widely circulated "Internet Services Disruption" memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That memo hasn't fundamentally changed Microsoft's business model -- it still gets the bulk of profit from the traditional licensing of its Windows and Office suite of software -- but Ozzie reckons its product teams have become more focused on the cloud and moved away from being "PC-centric."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm extremely pleased -- well beyond what I would have expected -- in terms of change to the product and to how we target the market," Ozzie said at a Seattle technology gathering last week, when asked about the effects of his memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the banner "Software plus services," Microsoft is stressing the importance of software installed on the PC being augmented -- rather than replaced -- by online software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not religious about moving everything to the cloud, or keeping everything on premise," said Chris Capossela, a senior vice president who manages Office products and has been at the forefront of the move toward the cloud. "The more generic a service is, that lends itself to a hosted service."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Email is a good example of a service that Microsoft reckons can migrate easily to the cloud, and it has trumpeted big contracts with European drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc and soft drink bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. Between them, the companies moved about 170,000 employees off International Business Machine Corp's Lotus Notes onto a hosted version of Microsoft's Exchange email system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next year Microsoft plans to roll out its Office suite of applications online, and by then its Azure cloud platform should be up and running, allowing third-party developers to design programs to run in Microsoft's cloud, expanding the range of tasks customers can do with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CANNIBALIZING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft says hosting companies' systems in the cloud means they can charge more for services, while the customer ends up saving money on hardware, servers and IT support, potentially taking sales away from companies like IBM and Hewlett-Packard Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To back that up, Microsoft has invested heavily in data centers -- massive buildings holding stacks of servers -- anticipating a boom in online processing and storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For security reasons, Microsoft is cagey on details, but says it has more than 10 and less than 100 data centers of various sizes around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It typically invests $300 million to $500 million on new data centers, and has built 500,000 square feet facilities in Quincy, Washington and San Antonio, Texas. Even larger ones are under construction in Chicago and Dublin, Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite that firepower, the company has clearly not pushed its customers hard to take advantage of the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They know it's something they have to participate in, because it's a threat to their core businesses," said Sid Parakh, an analyst at regional brokerage McAdams Wright Ragen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The problem is: how do you migrate to this new model, because in a way it will be cannibalizing some of their existing revenues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft denies there is any conflict with its core business, and says it will provide the mix of software and services that a customer wants. Many of Microsoft's cloud-based offerings will "slot right alongside" existing software, said Rosoff at Directions on Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most industry-watchers say the cloud is not an immediate threat to Microsoft, but over the next five years they expect it to take a more dynamic approach to prevent rivals from eating into their core business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Go back to the old technology maxim," said Lowenstein. "You are better off cannibalizing yourself than have your competitors do it for you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby, editing by Tiffany Wu, Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prominent Physician, Researcher and Business Leader Will Direct Global Medical
and Regulatory Strategy, Join Executive Leadership Team
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc announced today that Freda Lewis-Hall, M.D., has been appointed as
Chief Medical Officer and Senior Vice President, Pfizer Inc. Dr. Lewis-Hall will
be the senior physician in the company, responsible for enterprise-wide medical,
patient safety, regulatory affairs and quality assurance as well as outreach to
doctors and other medical professionals. She joins Pfizer from Vertex
Pharmaceuticals, where she was responsible for clinical and non-clinical
development as well as both medical and regulatory. 

"We welcome Dr. Lewis-Hall to Pfizer and know that she will make a distinctive
contribution as we build the world`s premier biopharmaceutical company. Her
achievements as a biomedical researcher, patient advocate, academician and

executive officer. 

Dr. Lewis-Hall will report to Mr. Kindler and serve on Pfizer`s Executive
Leadership Team, its most senior leadership group. She will shape Pfizer`s
regulatory and medical policy during a time of fast-changing expectations for
healthcare companies and a wave of new therapies in development, especially as
information technologies change the ways companies develop medicines, clinicians
prescribe them, and patients and payers value them. 

"Dr. Lewis-Hall brings a unique perspective to Pfizer, having worked in large
and small biopharmaceutical companies, in government, in academia, and in direct
patient care and patient advocacy," said Phyllis Greenberger, M.S.W., president
and CEO of the Society for Women`s Health Research who has worked with Dr.
Lewis-Hall in numerous capacities for the past 20 years. "She has special
sensitivities, having a doctor`s compassion, a leader`s vision and a
researcher`s love of science and medicine." 

"No other pharmaceutical company has Pfizer`s potential," said Dr. Lewis-Hall,
"potential that will increase greatly with the pending acquisition of Wyeth. I
look forward to building on the company`s longstanding commitment to better
medicine through strong science, and on its vision of closer partnership with
patients, doctors, and the entire healthcare community." 

Prior to joining Vertex, Dr. Lewis-Hall was Senior Vice President of Medical
Affairs at Bristol-Myers Squibb, Vice President of Research and Development at
Pharmacia, and Product Team Leader at Eli Lilly and Company, where she was
involved in the development and launch of dozens of new drugs over the last
decade. Previously, Dr. Lewis-Hall held leadership positions at the National
Institute of Mental Health and the Howard University College of Medicine and
maintained a private practice in both the District of Columbia and the U.S.
Virgin Islands. 

Dr. Lewis-Hall is a Fellow of the American Academy of Psychiatry. Her

Research" and a number of journal articles on diagnosing and treating mental
health. She`s a well-known speaker and television commentator on the effects of
illness on patients, families and communities as well as healthcare disparities,
mental illness and women`s health issues. 

Dr. Lewis-Hall received her Bachelor of Arts and Sciences from The Johns Hopkins
University and her Medical Doctorate from Howard University Hospital and College
of Medicine. 

She succeeds Dr. Joseph Feczko, who previously announced his retirement from
Pfizer.

&lt;p&gt;Oracle Corp. today announced enhancements to its recently launched Beehive collaboration software in hopes of positioning it more strongly against long-established offerings from Microsoft Corp. and IBM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle also slashed its entry-level price for Beehive by more than half, while announcing prices for a cloud-based version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle announced Beehive at last September's OpenWorld conference. It replaces the Oracle Collaboration Suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to independent analyst Peter O'Kelly, Beehive represents Oracle's fourth attempt to crack the collaboration market, which has been long dominated by Microsoft and its Exchange and SharePoint products, and IBM with its Lotus Notes and Domino software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last updated in 2005, Collaboration Suite "failed to put a dent in the universe," O'Kelly wrote in a blog at Beehive's launch last fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SharePoint, meanwhile, has 100 million licensed users, according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its late entrance to the market, Oracle's senior vice president of collaboration technologies David Gilmour asserts that things will be different for Beehive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The market leaders are groupware products that have grown up," he said. "Collaboration was layered on after the fact, not designed that way in the beginning. Beehive is almost the complete inverse of that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gilmour was CEO of collaboration vendor Tacit Software Inc. Tacit offered a cutting-edge "expertise location" platform that tracked employees' usage to build a profile of their expertise that could be found by other employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tacit was acquired by Oracle in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle did not mentione an expertise location feature today. However, new features announced include "Web-based team workspaces," which include wikis, team calendaring, file sharing and others built with enterprise-grade security and compliance, enhanced Web and teleconferencing, and expanded compatibility with non-Oracle desktop tools, such as Microsoft Outlook e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only can end users employ existing e-mail or IM clients of their choice with Beehive, but IT managers can continue to use Microsoft Exchange in conjunction with Beehive, Gilmour said. That can smooth over one of the difficulties associated with persuading large enterprises that have invested years and millions of dollars in Microsoft or IBM to migrate to Beehive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, while "people hate switching, there are immediate hard dollar savings," Gilmour said. He reitierated that Beehive, which stores all data in an Oracle database, is more scalable than competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is just way better when you're living in a real database," he said. "Everything is pretty complicated and brittle in Exchange. With Beehive, there are no hidden, strange 1GB store limitations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SharePoint uses Microsoft's SQL Server, while Exchange uses the Jet database, which some users have criticized for not scaling well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle previously set Beehive's price for a one-time license at $120 per user, plus an additional 18% of that license per year for maintenance. In its announcement, Oracle cut the entry-level price to $50 per user. Components such as messaging and team collaboration, however, cost an additional $30 per user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies can also deploy Beehive as a cloud-based service for $15 per user per month with as many features as they want, Gilmour said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - On the face of it, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) stands to be the biggest loser in the cloud computing revolution if it means big companies jettison software on their own computers and move to handling information entirely on the Web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upside for the world's largest software company is that such a revolution is moving very slowly, if at all.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) may be called on by regulators for more acquisitions, as the U.S. banking sector is likely to see further consolidation, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on a webcast call on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There are still too many banks in the United States," Dimon told Calyon Securities analyst Mike Mayo on the call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan last year purchased Bear Stearns Cos at a fire-sale price and snapped up the assets of failed Seattle thrift Washington Mutual Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second-largest bank is busy absorbing these acquisitions, Dimon said, but added that regulators may still look to JPMorgan to "do something" in terms of acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is also looking to grow outside of the United States by expanding existing businesses in countries like Brazil, China, India and Russia, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer businesses in the United States remain under stress and the credit card business in particular is suffering, according to Dimon, who added that he expects these businesses to shrink over the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unemployment and home prices (are) driving losses way beyond what we expected, even (with) unemployment like this," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussing the broader economic outlook, however, Dimon said the pace of decline has slowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know if I call it bottoming out, but kind of a crawling along the bottom here -- maybe a little bit better," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan posted a better-than-expected first-quarter profit in April, largely helped by trading gains and a surge in underwriting revenue at its investment banking unit, and Dimon warned in a call with analysts last month that those conditions were unlikely to continue into the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Mayo asked him on Monday about April's trading performance, he declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay; editing by Gunna Dickson and Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;Milestone Reflects Changing Attitudes, as Consumers and Businesses Embrace Visa
Debit as a Better Alternative to Cash and Checks for Everyday Spending
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) has announced that spending on Visa debit cards in the U.S.
has surpassed credit for the first time in the company`s history. For the period
ending December 31, 2008, debit payments volume was $206 billion, compared with
credit payments volume of $203 billion.

Debit transactions were nearly 70% of U.S. transactions for the same time
period, representing an increasingly larger portion of Visa`s U.S. transactions.


"In 2002, U.S. Visa debit transactions surpassed credit transactions for the
first time, and now payments volume has also exceeded credit. This marks an
important achievement for Visa, as we continue to advance migration to
electronic payments from cash and checks," said Bill Sheedy, President, North
America, Visa, Inc. "For more than 20 years, Visa has championed the adoption of
debit as a convenient and secure payment alternative for consumers and
businesses. Now that cardholders can use Visa for almost every type of everyday
spending - from taxis to grocery stores - the value of electronic payments over
cash and checks is more clearly evident." 

Consumers are increasingly turning to debit cards for non-discretionary
purchases, or everyday spending. As of March 2009, approximately 52 percent of
debit volume was for non-discretionary items like food and clothing in the U.S.1

The top categories for Visa debit usage include bill payment, gas, groceries and
quick service restaurants. Additionally, Visa research shows consumers have a
growing preference for using debit in new merchant categories where cash and
check were once the preferred way to pay - like dry cleaners, gas/service
stations, movie theaters and convenience stores2. 

"In today`s challenging economic environment, debit is an ideal way for
consumers to access their own funds and focus on smarter spending, budgeting and
control," continued Sheedy. "The increased popularity of debit also provides our
financial institution clients with an important tool that allows them to build
strong and lasting relationships with their customers, while providing greater
choice, security and convenience over less efficient forms of payment." 

Within the U.S. marketplace, Visa`s debit strategy has been to simplify card
issuance and transaction processing for financial institution and merchant
clients. Security enhancements like Zero Liability3 which protect consumers from
unauthorized use, and merchant programs like no-signature required have also
helped to increase the products` popularity among cardholders who have embraced
this pay-now alternative. 

"This milestone could only be reached with the support of Visa`s financial
institution and merchant clients including a broad range of critical industry
partners, including acquirers, processors and terminal manufacturers," observed
Sheedy. "We`re encouraged that the industry has embraced Visa debit and we will
continue to work hard to ensure Visa product enhancements keep pace with
evolving consumer needs." 

Visa debit features prominently in the company`s recently introduced global
advertising campaign entitled, "More People Go with Visa." The print, online and
television advertisements promote the security, control and convenience
advantages that Visa debit provides over cash and checks.

&lt;p&gt;Sylvia Garrigo Compares Makeup on Her Face to Heavily Contaminated Toxic Waste
Pits; "Public Relations Disaster" for Chevron
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Chevron shocked the public relations and legal worlds Sunday by allowing a
relatively unknown in-house lawyer to stumble through an interview trying to
defend the company on 60 Minutes against charges that it is responsible for the
world`s largest oil contamination in Ecuador, where it faces a $27 billion
liability. 

The spokesperson, Sylvia Garrigo, did not disappoint the company`s detractors -
she quickly made the bizarre claim that trace amounts of oil in the makeup on
her face was no more harmful that the toxic sludge filmed by 60 Minutes in
hundreds of unlined waste pits Texaco built in Ecuador`s rainforest that are
still polluting soils and groundwater, according to an independent court expert.


One viewer who posted comments on the internet compared Garrigo`s performance to
satirical appearances by Dan Akroyd on Saturday Night Live. Another found it
shocking that Chevron did not put forth David O`Reilly, the company`s CEO, to
defend the company in what 60 Minutes called the largest environmental legal
case ever. 

Sadly for Chevron, Garrigo`s performance had nothing to do with satire. 

"Chevron`s effort to duck, dodge, bob and weave by not making available a senior
level executive such as the CEO, Board Member or officer is the public relations
equivalent of a criminal defendant on trial for a heinous crime not taking the
witness stand in their own defense - it communicates to everyone that you must
be guilty," said Chris Lehane, a political and media consultant and former White
House lawyer under the Clinton Administration. 

"This has to be one of the more shocking and sickening performances by a
corporate spokesperson in the history of journalism," said Drew_6583, in a
typical online posting on the 60 Minutes website. "The moment could not have
been more important for the company and they blew it by not putting forth their
CEO." 

Garrigo, who spoke to CBS correspondent Scott Pelley from a corporate office in
the U.S., denied that Chevron had found toxins in the environment despite visual
images of oil in streams next to abandoned company well sites. Her claim
directly contradicts laboratory reports Chevron has submitted as evidence in the
trial, which are available as public records. 

The highlight of the Garrigo interview - or lowlight, depending on one`s
perspective - was when CBS asked her about the 916 toxic waste pits that Texaco
abandoned in the jungle over an area roughly the size of the state of Rhode
Island. Garrigo apparently was trying to downplay the danger of the oil in the
pits by comparing them to oil in her own makeup. 

The only problem is that the trial evidence shows the pits contain contaminants
and carcinogens up to thousands of times higher than norms allow. Many of the
pits are the size of Olympic-sized swimming pools and are filled with toxic
sludge, as shocking visuals in the 60 Minutes broadcast made evident. 

"I have make-up on, and that`s naturally occurring oil on my face," Garrigo told
Pelley. "Doesn`t mean that I`m going to get sick from it." 

Julio Prieto, a lawyer for the Amazonian communities, said Garrigo "would not be
able to survive one hour if she plastered benzene and TPHs on her face at levels
being found in Texaco`s waste pits in Ecuador." 

Garrigo`s title at Chevron is manager of global issues and policy, but there is
no evidence she has meaningful litigation or public relations experience. Her
biography is not listed on the company`s website and no press release was issued
when she was hired for her current job. 

The trial is currently taken place in Ecuador at Chevron`s request after the
company asked that it be transferred out of U.S. federal court, where it was
filed in 1993. The lawsuit alleges that Texaco dumped billions of gallons of
waste into the rainforest from 1964 to 1990, decimating indigenous groups and
causing dramatic increases in cancer rates. 

Prieto, who has worked on the case for three years, said Garrigo "lied to
millions of people on 60 Minutes by denying the scientific evidence in the case
as proven by Chevron`s own lab reports, which are easily available as public
records." 

As examples, Prieto pointed out that Chevron itself submitted several soil
samples to the court that show high levels of public health risk above legal
norms. While the typical norm is Ecuador is 1,000 parts per million in the soil
for Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (norms mark the point past which public health
is threatened), Chevron found samples at 63,140 ppm (63 times higher than the
Ecuadorian norm) at Texaco`s former Sacha 51 well site, 39,180 ppm (39 times
higher) at Texaco`s Sacha 21 well site, and 20,180 ppm at Texaco`s Sacha 53 well
site (20 times higher). 

Garrigo`s claim that these soil samples pose no risk to human health is
demonstrably false, said Prieto. The official U.S. government
 website that tracks toxicity
asserts that substances in TPH - which include the carcinogen benzene - can
cause leukemia, damage the central nervous system, and create fatigue, headache,
nausea, and drowsiness. 

Despite the science, Garrigo insisted to 60 Minutes that in "thousands" of soil
and water samples taken in the Amazon by Chevron "there has been no detection of
any type of toxin&#8230; that is dangerous to human health or the environment." 

Numerous comments posted on the website for 60 Minutes also focused on Garrigo`s
bizarre performance. 

"I have rarely seen a corporate spokesperson LESS effective than the Chevron
lawyer. She looked like Dan Akroyd in the old SNL spoofs on the show. How she
could, with a straight face, argue that they couldn't be sued in Ecuador after
getting the venue changed TO Ecuador, or that oil doesn't cause environmental
damage in the Amazon is bewildering," said a posting by MBarlingon. 

Chevron could have used any of a number of experienced executives or lawyers for
the interview, including General Counsel Charles James, who served at Assistant
Attorney General under President George H.W. Bush, and Tim Cullen, the company`s
lead outside counsel and a respected litigator at the Jones Day law firm. 

"Let`s just say Chevron brought the wrong person out of the bullpen," said a
public relations executive in New York. "The entire interview backfired and
undermined Chevron`s credibility."

&lt;p&gt; * Eyes expansion overseas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Credit card business is most under stress
  (Recasts; Adds Dimon's comments on economy, April trading)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 4 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) may
be called on by regulators for more acquisitions, as the U.S.
banking sector is likely to see further consolidation, Chief
Executive Jamie Dimon said on a webcast call on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are still too many banks in the United States,"
Dimon told Calyon Securities analyst Mike Mayo on the call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan last year purchased Bear Stearns Cos at a
fire-sale price and snapped up the assets of failed Seattle
thrift Washington Mutual Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second-largest bank is busy absorbing these
acquisitions, Dimon said, but added that regulators may still
look to JPMorgan to "do something" in terms of acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan is also looking to grow outside of the United
States by expanding existing businesses in countries like
Brazil, China, India and Russia, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Consumer businesses in the United States remain under
stress and the credit card business in particular is suffering,
according to Dimon, who added that he expects these businesses
to shrink over the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Unemployment and home prices (are) driving losses way
beyond what we expected, even (with) unemployment like this,"
he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Discussing the broader economic outlook, however, Dimon
said the pace of decline has slowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't know if I call it bottoming out, but kind of a
crawling along the bottom here -- maybe a little bit better,"
he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan posted a better-than-expected first-quarter profit
in April, largely helped by trading gains and a surge in
underwriting revenue at its investment banking unit, and Dimon
warned in a call with analysts last month that those conditions
were unlikely to continue into the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Mayo asked him on Monday about April's trading
performance, he declined comment.

&lt;p&gt;SAN JUAN ISLAND, Wash.--(Business Wire)--
Highland Estate, a spectacular home situated on 1.84+/- wooded acres on the west
side of San Juan Island, will sell at real estate auction on Thursday, May 14th
at 11 a.m. The auction will take place at the home with J. P. King Auction
Company, the nation`s leading real estate auction marketing firm specializing in
high-luxury properties, managing the sale of the estate. 

"Few places combine rocky shores, sandy beaches, prairie land and the sea like
San Juan Island," said Craig King, president &amp; CEO of J.P. King Auction Company.
"The San Juan Island area is a stress-free environment with little traffic. The
area averages 250 days a year of sunshine, only 20 inches of annual rainfall
with gorgeous sunsets and remarkable views of the Salish Sea, Olympic Mountain
Range and Victoria, BC. 

The estate boasts 3 spacious suites with private baths and a powder room bath
with shower. Each suite offers unique views, access to the large veranda and
privacy with exceptional amenities. The property has a large two car garage and
a fully furnished guest cottage. The one room retreat contains 1 full bath,
kitchen and all the modern amenities of a home. The cottage is perfect for
weekend guests and offers a large deck with swing, table and chairs, and
hydrotherapy spa. 

The entire second floor of the estate is devoted to the large master bedroom
suite. It is perfectly situated to view passing ships, and breathtaking sunsets
from the built-in window seat, or from the large sweeping private deck with
hydrotherapy hot tub. The room features a gas fireplace, separate study, large
walk-in closet with auto lighting, many built-ins and skylight, enclosed bar
with small refrigerator, and sink, and separated bath with marble surrounds, jet
tub, skylight, towel warmer, bidet and shower. 

"The home is located on private road in a peaceful and quiet area of the Island,
about seven miles from town," said owner Helen King. "We truly live in paradise
here, where nature is at our front door, deer fox and San Juan bunnies are
frequent visitors and you often hear the sounds and see our three resident pods
of Orca Whales May through October. The area is ideal for hiking, biking,
kayaking, sailing, diving, fishing, golf, tennis, spas, with all activities
nearby." 

Two additional suites are located on the first level and are separated by the
living space of the home. The whale watch suite furnishings are included. Both
have raised hearth wood burning fireplaces, built-in window seats, and open to
the 88` foot view veranda. Bathrooms have large skylights, built-in cabinetry,
marble counter tops, and small-under counter refrigerators, jetted tubs, steam
showers and towel warmers. All closets are spacious and contain automatic
lighting. 

The bevel level glass entry leads you to the living room and dining room with
stone fireplace and a gourmet kitchen. The office opens to the living room with
a large built-in bookcase and desk space, which enjoys the same spectacular sea
view. The spacious kitchen is surrounded with built-in cabinetry, has a large
island, warming and ventilated drawers, cork floor, all polished travertine
counter tops and a large cookbook bookcase. Stove top features four gas and two
electric burners, and grill, stainless hood with warming racks and heat lamps,
pull-out recycle bins, dishwasher, subzero refrigerator, freezer, pull out spice
rack and under-counter lighting are included. Pantry features Neptune washer and
dryer. Large four door built ins and deep closet storage by back door porch. 

Two 400 year old Douglas fir trees add to the lush landscaping of the estate.
Pennsylvania Blue Stone was purchased from the movie set of Practical Magic
after the filming on San Juan Island and was used to construct the walkways,
steps, patio, porches and interior hearths. A cascading waterfall with pond adds
to the serenity found on this impressive estate. 

Highland Estate is perched above Washington`s Puget Sound and located minutes
from the picturesque town of Friday Harbor. The small town atmosphere of Friday
Harbor is an attraction for many looking to escape the hustle and bustle of
everyday life. Guests and residents can enjoy this quaint town, which is a quiet
oasis located just a lovely ferry ride away, a 30 minute flight to the local
airport, or a seaplane flight to the harbor from Seattle.

&lt;p&gt;May 4 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded its Americas coal

2009, this could potentially improve global metallurgical coal
supply/demand balances, reducing downside pricing risk for
2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst also said he expects less coal-to-gas
substitution during the summer months and that he sees natural
gas prices rising in the next six months which should improve
coal prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the decline in production in recent weeks was a

&lt;p&gt;ConAgra Foods and RPM Connect Claim Second Place
WESTPORT, Conn.--(Business Wire)--
For the second year in a row, Procter &amp; Gamble and Mars Advertising topped the
Hub Magazine`s annual ranking of excellence in shopper marketing. ConAgra Foods
and RPM Connect surged to the number two spots for brand marketers and agencies,
respectively. 

The Hub report measures progress among both brand marketers and agencies in ten
areas critical to success in shopper marketing, an emerging discipline focused
on building brands by improving the shopping experience. 

"Our goal is to help set standards and move shopper marketing forward," said Tim
Manners, publisher of the Hub, which conducts the annual survey in collaboration
with Hoyt &amp; Company, a consulting firm specialized in shopper marketing. 

The survey asks brand marketers and agencies to rank each other against ten
criteria, and attracted twice as many respondents this year as compared to last.
Survey participants included Hub readers as well as members of LinkedIn`s
Shopper Insights and Marketing Professionals Group and the Promotion Marketing
Association. 

Because more brand marketers and agencies scored high this year, the Hub
expanded its rankings to a "top 12" from last year`s "top 10," which Manners
says is a sign of growth in shopper marketing. Brand marketers saw a tie for
12th place, making a baker`s dozen. 

The Hub Top 12 Brand Marketers are: 1) Procter &amp; Gamble; 2) ConAgra Foods; 3)
Campbell Soup; 4) Unilever; 5) Clorox; 6) Kraft Foods; 7) Hormel Foods; 8)
Kimberly-Clark; 9) Coca-Cola; 10) PepsiCo; 11) Abbott Nutrition; and 12) General
Mills and Colgate-Palmolive (tied). 

The Hub Top 12 Agencies are: 1) Mars Advertising; 2) RPM Connect; 3) TracyLocke;
4) Integrated Marketing; 5) Catapult Marketing; 6) Malone Advertising; 7)
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi X; 8) Ryan Partnership; 9) G2; 10) Integer Group; 11) Upshot;
and 12) Marketing Drive. 

A summary and analysis of the survey`s results are available online at
http://www.hubmagazine.com. A full report will be published later this year.

CUPERTINO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chordiant Software, Inc. (Nasdaq:CHRD), a leading provider of Customer
Experience (Cx) software and services, today announced general availability of
the Chordiant Connector for IBM WebSphere Process Server (WPS), a new linkage
intended to help customers improve the process of managing customer
conversations as a larger business process. The Connector plugs into Chordiant
Enterprise Foundation version 6.4 and Call Center Advisor version 6.4, which are
also both generally available today. The new Connector provides functionality
and transfers data to evoke actions in workflow within WPS. The combination of
Chordiant customer experience management solutions with IBM WPS will enable
companies to seamlessly orchestrate live customer interaction management and
back-end enterprise wide process and work management. This will allow call
center and retail agents to initiate and manage long running processes during a
customer conversation without switching desktop applications. 

At the point of interaction, Chordiant Call Center Advisor provides agents with
a comprehensive, role-based view of the customer, including a real-time,
multi-product profile and complete multi-channel interaction history. This
unique intelligence not only improves first-call resolution, but facilitates the
cross-selling of new products and services. IBM WPS handles enterprise workflows
lasting hours, days, weeks or months. By connecting these capabilities with the
Chordiant Enterprise Foundation 6.4 environment, Chordiant and IBM customers can
achieve end-to-end management of processes and interactions, improving the
customer experience. 

"The integration of WebSphere Process Server with Chordiant customer experience
management will benefit our customers looking to increase customer loyalty
during these challenging economic times," said Craig Hayman, Vice President of
IBM Websphere. "This further enhancement of our partnership with Chordiant
combines our business process management and Chordiant's role based customer
views which are critical to enabling a seamless customer experience." 

Chordiant Enterprise Foundation and Call Center Advisor Version 6.4 Released

Chordiant Enterprise Foundation delivers a multi-channel, centrally orchestrated
platform for building and executing customer experience management solutions. It
offers interaction control, real-time connection to trusted systems of record,
and a best-in-class thin client call center application, Chordiant Call Center
Advisor. With their unique focus on helping companies optimize the customer
experience, Chordiant products can help improve customer loyalty and operational
productivity during every customer interaction. 

With the latest version of Chordiant Foundation and Advisor, customers will
benefit from increased scale and performance, as well as improved options for
Telephony integration (CTI). These new capabilities enable better utilization of
existing IT and telephony resources, further protecting existing investments,
while enabling effective, responsive customer interactions. The new versions
also support multi-byte character languages for data persistence across broader
geographies. 

"Part of delivering a great customer experience means handling work at the point
of interaction-enabling agents to fully address the customer`s requirements
regardless of how many steps or processes must be executed," said Shari Zedeck,
Vice President, Product Management, Chordiant. "With Chordiant`s patented
desktop application managing the customer interaction and IBM`s high performance
workflow engine managing back-end processes, companies can deliver a highly
responsive and efficient customer experience. In addition to this latest

&lt;p&gt;New Content Product Accelerates Delivery, Cuts Cost of e-Commerce Solutions
LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--
iRise&#174;, the world`s leading visualization solutions company and Ascendant
Technology (Atech) today announced the immediate availability of iRise for IBM&#174;
WebSphere Commerce, a pre-configured set of visualization templates that gives
businesses a unique way to visualize new e-Commerce applications based on IBM
solutions. By visualizing before building, organizations can dramatically cut
implementation time and delivery cost of the resulting solution. Both iRise and
Atech are selling iRise for IBM WebSphere Commerce. 

iRise for IBM WebSphere Commerce is being demonstrated at the IBM Impact 2009
Conference in Las Vegas from May 3rd through May 6th in the iRise booth S9A and
Ascendant booth G1. 

The iRise for IBM WebSphere Commerce product is a set of reusable simulation and
prototyping assets that can be quickly customized for specific stand-alone
implementations or integrated within WebSphere Portal applications, without
having to perform a technical proof of concept, saving money and time. 

Jointly developed by iRise and Atech, iRise for IBM WebSphere Commerce offers a
visualization toolkit of generalized IBM solution-based page templates, masters
and styles used to accelerate the assembly of high-fidelity, working simulations
of proposed e-Commerce applications. Starting with a library of pre-configured
content and by leveraging the power of iRise Studio, product managers or
business analysts can bring together a working preview of e-Commerce solutions
in a fraction of the time it would take to generate paper specification
documents or build coded prototypes. Business stakeholders can `test drive` the
visualizations on their own or in collaborative meetings that directly involve
subject matter experts. Comments can be logged and acted upon quickly, speeding
consensus and eliminating confusion on business requirements. 

"Accelerating time to market is the key business driver for e-Commerce
solutions," stated Emmet B. Keeffe III, CEO and co-founder of iRise. "Businesses
are discovering that visualization is a critical strategy for driving faster
delivery and compressing more functionality into each release cycle." 

Atech will also be leveraging iRise for IBM WebSphere Commerce to rapidly create
simulations of e-Commerce applications during proposal pursuits and on client
engagements. This will ensure that clients receive the ultimate in communication
and collaboration both during the selling process and the project definition
phase for these engagements. 

"Content solutions for e-Commerce companies provide the most cost-effective way
for organizations to understand the value and develop requirements without
wasting time on writing code," said Jim Deters, president of Ascendant
Technology. 

Software Visualization - The Ultimate Change Agent

iRise visualization software gives business and IT leaders a powerful way to
"move the needle" and cost-effectively drive change in their organizations.
iRise is the only enterprise grade, real-time collaborative software definition
platform on the market today. By enabling global organizations to "test drive"
and fully experience critical business systems early in the process, iRise is
now an essential strategy to modernize their systems, consolidate applications,
cut cost, accelerate delivery and leverage global sourcing partnerships without
the usual confusion and risk. 

With thousands of projects completed successfully, the value of visualization
has proven to be enormous for businesses in highly competitive markets:

* Get to market twice as fast; 
* Eliminate 30% of project cost; 
* Ensure success of global sourcing strategies; and, 
* Dramatically improve customer experience

Pricing and Availability

iRise for WebSphere Commerce is available immediately. Pricing is available upon
request. 

About iRise

iRise is the world`s leading provider of visualization software for business
applications. Visualization has become a critical competitive advantage for
businesses to more effectively communicate their needs to technology teams and
give everyone involved the ability to interact with and fully experience
applications before they are built. Companies of all sizes like General Motors,
UPS, Wachovia, Manpower, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and many others use iRise
to "test drive" their applications before building, which accelerates time to
revenue, improves customer experience, and drives costs down. At iRise, our
vision is that by 2020, all business software will be visualized before being
built, the same way that every car, airplane, and building is visualized today.
Headquartered in El Segundo, Calif., iRise is backed by Morgan Stanley Venture
Partners, and Deutsche Bank, and has sales offices across North America.

&lt;p&gt;Reaffirms 2009 Earnings Guidance
PORTLAND, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
Portland General Electric Company (NYSE:POR) today reported net income of $31
million or $0.47 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2009,
compared to $28 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, for the first quarter of
2008. Revenues increased in the first quarter of 2009 as the General Rate Case
order went into effect at the beginning of the year. However, these increases
were substantially offset by a reduction in energy sales, higher power costs,
and increases in other operating expenses. Adjustments related to Senate Bill
408 (SB 408) and a smaller decline in the fair market value of non-qualified
benefit plan trust assets contributed to the increase in net income in the first
quarter of 2009 compared to the first quarter of 2008. 

"We made progress with major capital projects during the first quarter," said
Jim Piro, President and CEO of Portland General Electric (PGE). "We`ve
officially started the rollout of our new smart meter project system-wide, and
construction of our Biglow Canyon Wind Farm Phases II and III are on schedule.
These projects reflect a strong alignment with the priorities our customers
place on energy efficiency and green power - priorities that are confirmed by
the fact that, for the fourth year in a row, we sold more renewable energy to
residential customers than any other utility in the United States." 

First Quarter 2009 Highlights

* Total retail customers increased by approximately 0.5% from 810,197 at the end
of 2008 to 814,058 at the end of the first quarter of 2009. 
* Total retail energy deliveries decreased by 1.3% on a weather adjusted basis
in the first quarter of 2009 compared to the first quarter of 2008. 
* Prices increased approximately 5.6% pursuant to the General Rate Case order
that went into effect on January 1, 2009 and other price adjustments, including
a reduction to reflect less-than-anticipated power costs in 2007. 
* Ranked "Highest in Customer Satisfaction with Business Electric Service in the
Western U.S.", according to J.D. Power and Associates 2009 Electric Utility
Business Customer Satisfaction StudySM.* 
* The Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) approved a decoupling mechanism
for a two-year trial period effective February 1, 2009. 
* Completed systems acceptance testing phase of the smart meter project in March
2009 and began full deployment of 850,000 smart meters in April. Installation is
expected to be completed by year-end 2010. 
* Construction of Phases II and III of the Biglow Canyon Wind Farm continued on
track in the first quarter of 2009. Phases II and III are expected to be
completed by the end of 2009 and 2010, respectively. 
* Issued 12.5 million shares of common stock in March 2009 for net proceeds of
$170 million. 
* $130 million in First Mortgage Bonds (FMBs) were issued in January 2009. Also,
$300 million in FMBs were issued in April 2009, in part to refinance
approximately $142 million in Pollution Control Bonds.

2009 Earnings Guidance

PGE is reaffirming full-year 2009 earnings guidance within the previously
disclosed range of $1.80 to $1.90 per diluted share. PGE is also reaffirming its
long-term annual earnings growth expectation of 6 to 8 percent beginning with
2009. 

Liquidity

PGE has two unsecured revolving credit facilities with two separate groups of
banks and an aggregate borrowing capacity of $495 million. As of March 31, 2009,
the company had an aggregate remaining borrowing capacity of $272 million
available under the two credit facilities and a cash balance of $47 million. As
of April 30, 2009, the aggregate borrowing capacity was $279 million. PGE posts
or receives margin deposits related to power and natural gas contracts. These
contracts are used to meet load requirements and are reflected in customer
prices. As of March 31, 2009, PGE had posted margin deposits of $409 million,
consisting of $205 million in cash and $204 million in letters of credit. 

Capital Expenditures

* Capital expenditures in 2009 are estimated to be $723 million. The majority of
these expenditures in 2009 are related to Phases II ($230 million) and III ($176
million) of the Biglow Canyon Wind Farm and ongoing expenditures for production,
transmission and distribution ($226 million). 
* Capital expenditures in 2010 are estimated to be $522 million. The majority of
these expenditures are for Phase III of the Biglow Canyon Wind Farm ($201
million) and ongoing expenditures for production, transmission and distribution
($223 million).

Financing Plans

To fund a portion of the capital expenditures, PGE issued $130 million of First
Mortgage Bonds in January 2009. The Company also issued $300 million in FMBs in
April 2009, in part to refinance $142 million of Pollution Control Bonds and to
fund capital expenditures related to Biglow Canyon Phase II and smart meters. In
addition to the debt issuances, PGE issued 12.5 million shares of common stock
for net proceeds of $170 million. Under PGE`s current capital expenditure
program the Company anticipates issuing approximately $375 million of debt
through 2010, part of which will be used to refinance approximately $186 million
in debt maturities in 2010. 

First Quarter 2009 Summary

Higher revenues in the first quarter of 2009 compared to first quarter 2008 were
offset by a reduction in energy sales, higher power costs and increases in other
operating expenses. Other items impacting comparative results are as follows: 

First Quarter 2009

* $1.6 million after-tax loss or $0.02 per diluted share from a decline in the
fair market value of non-qualified benefit plan trust assets. 
* Approximately $1 million after-tax loss or $0.01 per diluted share from
additional costs related to the December 2008 storm.

First Quarter 2008

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co is developing an Internet subscription service and may consider trimming studio output, executives said on Tuesday after the division posted a 97 percent decline in operating income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a conference call, Disney chief executive officer Bob Iger blamed the disappointing performance on a spate of underperforming DVD and movie releases in the second quarter from "Bolt" to "Beverly Hills Chihuahua".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger said the company would continue to monitor the amount of films it makes, after scaling back just a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we don't have specific plans, it's possible we'll continue to look at reducing the total output of the studio," Iger said, adding that Disney also will examine production and marketing costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Staggs, Disney chief financial officer, expects difficult comparisons for the studio again in the third quarter, because of a less-favorable release slate in home video and television distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studio revenues fell 21 percent to $1.4 billion primarily due to decreases of $225 million in worldwide home entertainment, $50 million in domestic theatrical distribution and $34 million in music distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operating income at the studio fell 97 percent or $364 million to $13 million, largely due to decreases in domestic home entertainment and worldwide theatrical distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2006, Disney said it would produce and distribute about 10 Disney live-action and animated films a year and two to three Touchstone films a year, from 14 to 18 films evenly divided between its Disney and its mature Touchstone label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney said on Tuesday it will continue to reposition itself for a changing marketplace as industrywide DVD sales slump and as more and more consumers look online for content, even though a clear business model for online distribution has not yet emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We realize that monetizing at a rate that is as robust as the traditional platforms doesn't exist yet, but we believe... that eventually it will," Iger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said on Tuesday the company was developing a subscription service of Disney-branded content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are looking to create a real blend in terms of how we monetize and how we reach consumers and what kind of product we make available," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney last week announced it would buy a 30 percent stake in Hulu.com, bringing popular TV shows such as "Lost" and "Grey's Anatomy" to the video Web site founded by General Electric's NBC Universal and News Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney became the third major U.S. broadcast network to take a stake in Hulu, which has emerged as one of the most popular online video destinations since its launch in 2007 but still lags Google Inc's YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YouTube, once the scourge of the entertainment industry as a destination for unauthorized content, has recently made inroads with Hollywood, last month announcing a deal to post Sony Corp films and TV shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YouTube also has a partnership with Disney to get shortform excerpts of content from ABC and ESPN. Iger on Tuesday said he did not rule out putting longer content on Youtube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The possibility of our long form content ending up on Youtube platform still exists," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We feel pretty, pretty confidently that if we don't put our product out online in a well-timed and well-priced basis, it will still ... be demanded by consumers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co posted a 26 percent earnings drop on Tuesday as the global downturn ate into ad sales and consumer spending, but company executives said the worst may be over for its key media networks and theme parks businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney shares jumped about 4 percent in after-hours trade on the company's earnings results, which beat Wall Street forecasts. Revenue dropped 7 percent and missed expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A relatively strong showing at its cable operations, especially the ESPN sports network, ABC Family Channel and Disney Channel, and a better-than-expected 10 cents per share of restructuring charges helped the company to an earnings beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The stock is indicated up, likely on a relief rally that they didn't miss so materially once again. A lot of analysts thought they'd miss a third time," said David Miller with Caris  Co. "From a restructuring charge perspective, they actually beat consensus."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The media networks arm of the No. 1 U.S. entertainment conglomerate bucked expectations for the quarter with a 2 percent rise in revenue and a tiny 4 percent decrease in operating profit, despite a global advertising downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They beat on low expectations. I think that is what we are seeing in media and consumer discretionary companies," Edward Jones analyst Robin Diedrich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall, the numbers are not good in advertising and the parks, and that's where we thought the weakness would be."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net income fell to $613 million, or 33 cents per share, from $1.13 billion, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier. But excluding restructuring and impairment charges of 10 cents per share, Disney's profit came to 43 cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue fell to $8.09 billion, partly the result of aggressive discounting at domestic theme parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts, on average, had expected earnings, excluding items, of 40 cents per share on revenue of $8.14 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Severance and related costs accounted for most of the restructuring charges as the media and tourism giant trims its workforce and consolidates operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOWNTURN HAS STABILIZED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger told analysts the company sees "some sign the economic downturn has stabilized" but added it was "too early to make predictions about the time and pace of the recovery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger and Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said the pace of decline in advertising sales has "generally stabilized" and that room reservations at Disney's U.S. parks for the second half of 2009 were "nearly on par" with last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staggs did not, however, deliver a customary outlook for ad sales and pricing for the ABC broadcast network, saying only that sales were "down modestly versus the prior year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staggs indicated the company still plans to end deep hotel discounts at Walt Disney World in August, as planned, but did not rule out future park promotions to drive attendance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll have to read the marketplace as we get there and take a look and make those decisions as we go," Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studio division has a "less favorable" release slate in home video and TV distribution in the third quarter, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both executives saw a possible continuation of cost cutting with Iger mentioning possible cuts to the studios' output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger also said the company was "optimistic" that an agreement would be reached with the Hong Kong government to expand the underperforming Hong Kong theme park, and that the proposed Shanghai park was awaiting approval from China's central government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue for Disney's theme parks, seen as a bellwether for the company and the economy, dropped 12 percent while segment operating income fell 50 percent from declines at its domestic parks, Disney Vacation Club and Paris resort as well as a shift in the Easter holiday to the third quarter in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The movies studios reported a 21 percent decline in revenue coupled with a disastrous 97 percent plunge in operating income due to a weaker box office and DVD sales of titles such as "High School Musical 3," "Beverly Hills Chihuahua," "Confessions of a Shopaholic" and "Bolt," and higher distribution costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weaker consumer spending hit the company's consumer products licensing business, which posted a 9 percent increase in revenue but a 24 percent downturn in operating income. Revenue from Interactive Media fell 17 percent while the segment's operating loss stayed flat, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Disney rose nearly 4 percent to $24.02 in after-hours trade, after closing up 1.3 percent at $23.15 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gina Keating and Sue Zeidler; Editing by Edwin Chan, Richard Chang and Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co is developing an Internet subscription service and may consider trimming studio output, executives said on Tuesday after the division posted a 97 percent decline in operating income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a conference call, Disney chief executive officer Bob Iger blamed the disappointing performance on a spate of underperforming DVD and movie releases in the second quarter from "Bolt" to "Beverly Hills Chihuahua".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger said the company would continue to monitor the amount of films it makes, after scaling back just a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we don't have specific plans, it's possible we'll continue to look at reducing the total output of the studio," Iger said, adding that Disney also will examine production and marketing costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Staggs, Disney chief financial officer, expects difficult comparisons for the studio again in the third quarter, because of a less-favorable release slate in home video and television distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studio revenues fell 21 percent to $1.4 billion primarily due to decreases of $225 million in worldwide home entertainment, $50 million in domestic theatrical distribution and $34 million in music distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operating income at the studio fell 97 percent or $364 million to $13 million, largely due to decreases in domestic home entertainment and worldwide theatrical distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2006, Disney said it would produce and distribute about 10 Disney live-action and animated films a year and two to three Touchstone films a year, from 14 to 18 films evenly divided between its Disney and its mature Touchstone label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney said on Tuesday it will continue to reposition itself for a changing marketplace as industrywide DVD sales slump and as more and more consumers look online for content, even though a clear business model for online distribution has not yet emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We realize that monetizing at a rate that is as robust as the traditional platforms doesn't exist yet, but we believe... that eventually it will," Iger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said on Tuesday the company was developing a subscription service of Disney-branded content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are looking to create a real blend in terms of how we monetize and how we reach consumers and what kind of product we make available," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney last week announced it would buy a 30 percent stake in Hulu.com, bringing popular TV shows such as "Lost" and "Grey's Anatomy" to the video Web site founded by General Electric's NBC Universal and News Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney became the third major U.S. broadcast network to take a stake in Hulu, which has emerged as one of the most popular online video destinations since its launch in 2007 but still lags Google Inc's YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YouTube, once the scourge of the entertainment industry as a destination for unauthorized content, has recently made inroads with Hollywood, last month announcing a deal to post Sony Corp films and TV shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YouTube also has a partnership with Disney to get shortform excerpts of content from ABC and ESPN. Iger on Tuesday said he did not  rule out putting longer content on Youtube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The possibility of our long form content ending up on Youtube platform still exists," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We feel pretty, pretty confidently that if we don't put our product out online in a well-timed and well-priced basis, it will still ... be demanded by consumers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES May 5 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) is
developing an Internet subscription service and may consider
trimming studio output, executives said on Tuesday after the
division posted a 97 percent decline in operating income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; On a conference call, Disney chief executive officer Bob
Iger blamed the disappointing performance on a spate of
underperforming DVD and movie releases in the second quarter
from "Bolt" to "Beverly Hills Chihuahua".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Iger said the company would continue to monitor the amount
of films it makes, after scaling back just a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While we don't have specific plans, it's possible we'll
continue to look at reducing the total output of the studio,"
Iger said, adding that Disney also will examine production and
marketing costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tom Staggs, Disney chief financial officer, expects
difficult comparisons for the studio again in the third
quarter, because of a less-favorable release slate in home
video and television distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Studio revenues fell 21 percent to $1.4 billion primarily
due to decreases of $225 million in worldwide home
entertainment, $50 million in domestic theatrical distribution
and $34 million in music distribution. [ID:nN05507452]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Operating income at the studio fell 97 percent or $364
million to $13 million, largely due to decreases in domestic
home entertainment and worldwide theatrical distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In July 2006, Disney said it would produce and distribute
about 10 Disney live-action and animated films a year and two
to three Touchstone films a year, from 14 to 18 films evenly
divided between its Disney and its mature Touchstone label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney said on Tuesday it will continue to reposition
itself for a changing marketplace as industrywide DVD sales
slump and as more and more consumers look online for content,
even though a clear business model for online distribution has
not yet emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We realize that monetizing at a rate that is as robust as
the traditional platforms doesn't exist yet, but we believe...
that eventually it will," Iger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said on Tuesday the company was developing a
subscription service of Disney-branded content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are looking to create a real blend in terms of how we
monetize and how we reach consumers and what kind of product we
make available," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney last week announced it would buy a 30 percent stake
in Hulu.com, bringing popular TV shows such as "Lost" and
"Grey's Anatomy" to the video Web site founded by General
Electric's (GE.N) NBC Universal and News Corp (NWSA.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Disney became the third major U.S. broadcast network to
take a stake in Hulu, which has emerged as one of the most
popular online video destinations since its launch in 2007 but
still lags Google Inc's (GOOG.O) YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; YouTube, once the scourge of the entertainment industry as
a destination for unauthorized content, has recently made
inroads with Hollywood, last month announcing a deal to post
Sony Corp (6758.T) films and TV shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; YouTube also has a partnership with Disney to get shortform
excerpts of content from ABC and ESPN. Iger on Tuesday said he
did not not rule out putting longer content on Youtube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The possibility of our long form content ending up on
Youtube platform still exists," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We feel pretty, pretty confidently that if we don't put
our product out online in a well-timed and well-priced basis,
it will still ... be demanded by consumers."

&lt;p&gt; * Q2 EPS excluding items 43 cents vs Street view 40 cents&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Disney beats profit expectations, revenue misses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shares rise 4 percent in after-hours trade
 (Recasts first paragraph; adds byline, Disney comments,
details; updates share price)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Gina Keating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES, May 5 (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co (DIS.N)
posted a 26 percent earnings drop on Tuesday as the global
downturn ate into ad sales and consumer spending, but company
executives said the worst may be over for its key media
networks and theme parks businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney shares jumped about 4 percent in after-hours trade
on the company's earnings results, which beat Wall Street
forecasts. Revenue dropped 7 percent and missed expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A relatively strong showing at its cable operations,
especially the ESPN sports network, ABC Family Channel and
Disney Channel, and a better-than-expected 10 cents per share
of restructuring charges helped the company to an earnings
beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The stock is indicated up, likely on a relief rally that
they didn't miss so materially once again. A lot of analysts
thought they'd miss a third time," said David Miller with Caris
 Co. "From a restructuring charge perspective, they actually
beat consensus."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The media networks arm of the No. 1 U.S. entertainment
conglomerate bucked expectations for the quarter with a 2
percent rise in revenue and a tiny 4 percent decrease in
operating profit, despite a global advertising downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They beat on low expectations. I think that is what we are
seeing in media and consumer discretionary companies," Edward
Jones analyst Robin Diedrich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Overall, the numbers are not good in advertising and the
parks, and that's where we thought the weakness would be."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net income fell to $613 million, or 33 cents per share,
from $1.13 billion, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier. But
excluding restructuring and impairment charges of 10 cents per
share, Disney's profit came to 43 cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue fell to $8.09 billion, partly the result of
aggressive discounting at domestic theme parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts, on average, had expected earnings, excluding
items, of 40 cents per share on revenue of $8.14 billion,
according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Severance and related costs accounted for most of the
restructuring charges as the media and tourism giant trims its
workforce and consolidates operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DOWNTURN HAS STABILIZED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger told analysts the
company sees "some sign the economic downturn has stabilized"
but added it was "too early to make predictions about the time
and pace of the recovery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iger and Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said the pace
of decline in advertising sales has "generally stabilized" and
that room reservations at Disney's U.S. parks for the second
half of 2009 were "nearly on par" with last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs did not, however, deliver a customary outlook for ad
sales and pricing for the ABC broadcast network, saying only
that sales were "down modestly versus the prior year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs indicated the company still plans to end deep hotel
discounts at Walt Disney World in August, as planned, but did
not rule out future park promotions to drive attendance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We'll have to read the marketplace as we get there and
take a look and make those decisions as we go," Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The studio division has a "less favorable" release slate in
home video and TV distribution in the third quarter, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both executives saw a possible continuation of cost cutting
with Iger mentioning possible cuts to the studios' output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iger also said the company was "optimistic" that an
agreement would be reached with the Hong Kong government to
expand the underperforming Hong Kong theme park, and that the
proposed Shanghai park was awaiting approval from China's
central government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue for Disney's theme parks, seen as a bellwether for
the company and the economy, dropped 12 percent while segment
operating income fell 50 percent from declines at its domestic
parks, Disney Vacation Club and Paris resort as well as a shift
in the Easter holiday to the third quarter in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The movies studios reported a 21 percent decline in revenue
coupled with a disastrous 97 percent plunge in operating income
due to a weaker box office and DVD sales of titles such as
"High School Musical 3," "Beverly Hills Chihuahua,"
"Confessions of a Shopaholic" and "Bolt," and higher
distribution costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Weaker consumer spending hit the company's consumer
products licensing business, which posted a 9 percent increase
in revenue but a 24 percent downturn in operating income.
Revenue from Interactive Media fell 17 percent while the
segment's operating loss stayed flat, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Disney rose nearly 4 percent to $24.02 in
after-hours trade, after closing up 1.3 percent at $23.15 on
the New York Stock Exchange.

 (Updates with Disney shares rising late, adds volume)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 5 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday as
cautious investors fretted about impending bank stress test
results and energy shares succumbed to the pressure of lower
oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drop halted a two-day run-up that had propelled the SP
500 into positive territory for the year-to-date. The benchmark
index had risen 34 percent after touching a 12-year lows in
early March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Selling was seen across the board with big-cap technology
companies, banks, home builders and big manufacturers dragging
indexes lower. These sectors have all been among the market's
bright spots during the two-month rebound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of energy company Chevron (CVX.N), down 1.4 percent
at $65.75, were among the Dow's drags, along with those of No.2
U.S. bank JPMorgan (JPM.N), which ended off 2.7 percent at
$34.82.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's a little bit of profit-taking today. You're also
probably having a bit of a breather going into Thursday, with
the stress test results although most people think this will
somewhat be a non-event," said John O'Brien, senior vice
president at MKM Partners LLC in Cleveland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI dipped 16.09
points, or 0.19 percent, to 8,410.65 points. The Standard 
Poor's 500 Index .SPX shed 3.44 points, or 0.38 percent, to
903.80. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC dipped 9.44 points,
or 0.54 percent, to 1,754.12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of software maker Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), off 2
percent at $19.79, was the Nasdaq's top drag, followed by
Hologic Inc (HOLX.O), whose shares plunged 20.2 percent to
$12.45, a day after the medical diagnostics maker delayed the
U.S. launch of its Tomosynthesis mammography system and posted
a quarterly loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Procter  Gamble (PG.N) was the Dow's top drag, down 2.4
percent at $49.79, after news of problems at one of its
manufacturing plants. For details, see [ID:nN05401624]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DISNEY UP LATE, STRESS TESTS LOOM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the bell, shares of Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), another
Dow component, rose 2 percent to $23.61 after the No. 1 U.S.
entertainment company posted a quarterly profit above Wall
Street's forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney had ended the regular session up 1.3 percent at
$23.15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Increasingly less dire economic reports have boosted
optimism that the economic recession that began in December
2007 may be abating, while some renewed confidence about the
banking sector underpinned sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even so, investors fretted about the looming release of
government stress test results -- expected on Thursday -- which
may show about half of the 19 biggest banks under review need
to raise more capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The KBW Bank index .BKX -- which through Monday had risen
88 percent since March 9, slipped 1.6 percent -- with Wells
Fargo (WFC.N) down 4.04 percent to $23.27, but Citigroup (C.N)
gained 3.4 percent to $3.31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors are optimistic that the largest banks do not need
dramatic new government interventions. Among banks undergoing
the tests, Citigroup, for example, has been told it will need
to boost its common equity by about $10 billion, a person
familiar with the matter said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tuesday's economic data showed that the vast services
sector contracted less severely in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also on Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said
the three-year U.S. housing bust may be near a bottom and that
he expected the recession to end this year, barring a relapse
of the financial crisis. However, he also noted U.S. growth
would remain subdued and unemployment high. [ID:nN05470010]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. front-month crude CLc1 shed 63 cents, or 1.16
percent, to settle at $53.84 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, while the SP Energy index slid 1.3
percent. The Dow Jones home construction index .DJUSHB
dropped 1.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kraft Foods KFT.N helped cushion losses on the Dow after
the maker of household brands including Oreo cookies, reported
a higher profit. [ID:nN05387053]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like many companies this earnings season, Kraft said its
results were helped by raising prices and cutting costs,
sending its shares up nearly 4 percent to $25.22.
[ID:nN05387053]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trading volume was active on the New York Stock Exchange,
with about 1.53 billion shares changing hands, above last
year's estimated daily average volume of 1.49 billion, while on
Nasdaq, about 2.56 billion shares traded, also above last
year's daily average of 2.28 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones by a ratio of
about 6 to 5 on both the NYSE and Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) today reported earnings for its second fiscal
quarter and six months ended March 28, 2009. Diluted earnings per share (EPS)
for the second quarter were $0.33 including restructuring and impairment charges
which had a $0.10 per share impact on EPS. Excluding these items, EPS decreased
26% to $0.43 from $0.58 in the prior-year quarter. 

For the six month period, diluted EPS was $0.78. In addition to the
restructuring and impairment charges, EPS for the six month period included a
gain on the sale of our investment in two pay television services in Latin
America. Collectively, these items adversely affected EPS by $0.07 per share for
the six months. Excluding these items, EPS decreased 30% to $0.85 from $1.21 in
the prior-year six months. 

"We had a difficult second quarter due to the weak economy and other factors,"
said Robert A. Iger, president and CEO, The Walt Disney Company. "At the same
time, we remain focused on our core business strategy and believe our
creativity, brands and businesses will serve us well as the economy recovers." 

The following table summarizes the second quarter and six-month results for

Cable Networks

Operating income at Cable Networks increased 5% to $1.1 billion for the quarter
due to growth at ESPN, ABC Family and the domestic Disney Channel. The growth at
ESPN was driven by higher affiliate revenue primarily due to contractual rate
increases partially offset by decreased advertising revenues and higher
programming costs. The decrease in advertising revenues was due to a decrease in
sold inventory, partially offset by higher rates. Operating income growth at ABC
Family reflected higher advertising and affiliate revenue, both of which were
driven by higher rates, along with higher sold advertising units, while growth
at the domestic Disney Channel was driven by higher affiliate revenue due to
higher rates. 

Broadcasting

Operating income at Broadcasting decreased 38% to $162 million for the quarter
primarily due to lower advertising sales at the owned television stations and
higher programming costs at the ABC Television Network due to an increase in
production expenses, partially offset by increased sales of ABC Studios
productions in international markets, led by Ugly Betty, Desperate Housewives
and Criminal Minds. Higher production expenses reflected more production
activity during the current quarter compared to the prior-year quarter which was
affected by the Writers` Guild of America work stoppage. 

Parks and Resorts

Parks and Resorts revenues for the quarter decreased 12% to $2.4 billion and
segment operating income decreased 50% to $171 million. Lower operating income
was due to decreases at the Walt Disney World Resort, Disney Vacation Club,
Disneyland Resort and Disneyland Resort Paris. Operating income comparisons were
unfavorably impacted by the shift of the Easter holiday from the second quarter
in fiscal 2008 to the third quarter in fiscal 2009. 

Domestic Operations

Lower operating income at the Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Resort was
primarily due to decreased guest spending, partially offset by lower costs.
Decreased guest spending at the Walt Disney World Resort was due to lower
average daily hotel room rates, lower average ticket prices and decreased
merchandise spending. At Disneyland Resort, decreased guest spending was
primarily due to lower average ticket prices and decreased merchandise spending.
Lower costs reflected savings from cost mitigation activities and lower cost of
merchandise, food and beverages sold, partially offset by labor and other cost
inflation. Lower operating income at Disney Vacation Club reflected unfavorable
impacts associated with securitized ownership interests, higher per unit cost of
sales, decreased sales of term extensions on certain existing properties and
lower rentals of vacation club units. 

International Operations

At Disneyland Resort Paris, lower operating income was primarily due to
decreased guest spending and attendance. The decrease in guest spending
reflected lower average ticket prices, lower average daily hotel room rates and
decreased merchandise spending. 

Studio Entertainment

Studio Entertainment revenues for the quarter decreased 21% to $1.4 billion and
segment operating income decreased 97% to $13 million. The decrease in segment
operating income was primarily due to decreases in domestic home entertainment
and worldwide theatrical distribution. 

The decrease in domestic home entertainment was driven by lower unit sales
reflecting the performance of current quarter titles, which included High School
Musical 3: Senior Year, Beverly Hills Chihuahua and Bolt,ascompared to
Enchanted, Game Plan and No Country for Old Men in the prior-year quarter.

The decrease in worldwide theatrical distribution reflected a lower performing
slate of titles in the current quarter in both domestic and international
markets and higher distribution expense for future quarter releases in domestic
markets. Significant current quarter titles domestically included Bedtime
Stories, Race to Witch Mountain and Confessions of a Shopaholic while the
prior-year quarter included National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets, Hannah
Montana/Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds and Enchanted.

Significant current quarter titles internationally included Confessions of a
Shopaholic, Bolt and Bedtime Stories compared to the strong performance of
Enchanted and National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets in the prior-year quarter. 

Consumer Products

Consumer Products revenues for the quarter increased 9% to $496 million, and
segment operating income decreased 24% to $97 million. The revenue increase was
due to the acquisition of the Disney Stores North America in the third quarter
of fiscal 2008, partially offset by a decrease in earned royalty revenue at
Merchandise Licensing. 

Lower segment operating income was due to the acquisition of the Disney Stores
North America and lower earned royalty revenue across multiple product
categories at Merchandise Licensing. At the Disney Stores North America, the
increase in revenues due to the acquisition was more than offset by the related
operating costs and the absence of royalties from the former licensee. 

Interactive Media

Interactive Media revenues for the quarter decreased 17% to $129 million and
segment operating loss was essentially flat at $61 million as a decrease in
revenues at Disney Interactive Studios was largely offset by increased revenues
from our mobile phone service business in Japan, which was launched in the
second quarter of fiscal 2008, lower marketing expenses at Disney Interactive
Studios and Disney Online and lower administrative costs at Disney Online. The
decline in revenues at Disney Interactive Studios was driven by lower sales of
self-published video games reflecting the strong performance of Turok in the
prior-year quarter. 

OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Restructuring and Impairment Charges

The Company recorded $305 million of charges in the current quarter which
included non-cash impairment charges of $203 million and restructuring costs of
$102 million. The most significant of the impairment charges were $108 million
related to radio FCC licenses and $46 million related to an investment in an
Indian media company. The restructuring charges consisted of severance and other
related costs as a result of various organizational and cost structure
initiatives across our businesses, roughly half of which related to the Parks
and Resorts segment.

The decrease in net interest expense for the quarter was primarily due to lower
effective interest rates. 

Income taxes

The effective income tax rate for the quarter decreased to 34.8% from 37.6% in
the prior-year quarter primarily due to the favorable impacts of legislative
changes and the resolution of certain prior-year income tax matters, partially
offset by the impact of a non-deductible impairment charge that was recorded in
the second quarter of the current year.

See the discussion of non-GAAP financial measures that follows below.                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   


The decrease in free cash flow was driven by lower segment operating results,
higher net investment in film and television productions and an increase in
capital expenditures, partially offset by lower income tax payments and
favorable working capital impacts. The increase in capital expenditures
reflected a construction progress payment on the new cruise ships and new
broadcast and film production facilities.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This earnings release presents earnings per share excluding certain items, net
borrowings, free cash flow, and aggregate segment operating income, all of which
are important financial measures for the Company but are not financial measures
defined by GAAP. 

These measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP
financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of earnings per
share, borrowings, cash flow or net income as determined in accordance with
GAAP. Earnings per share excluding certain items, net borrowings, free cash
flow, and aggregate segment operating income as we have calculated them may not
be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 

Earnings per share excluding certain items - The Company uses earnings per share
excluding certain items to evaluate the performance of the Company`s operations
exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period
to period, including significant restructuring and impairment charges and
dispositions. The Company believes that information about earnings per share
exclusive of these impacts is useful to investors, particularly where the impact
of the excluded items is significant in relation to reported earnings, because
the measure allows for comparability between periods of the operating
performance of the Company`s business and allows investors to evaluate
separately the impact of restructuring and impairment charges and decisions
regarding the sale of interests in businesses from the impact of the operations
of the business. The following table reconciles reported earnings per share to
earnings per share excluding certain items:

Net borrowings - The Company believes that information about net borrowings
provides investors with a useful perspective on our financial condition. Net
borrowings reflect the subtraction of cash and cash equivalents from total
borrowings. Since we earn interest income on our cash balances that offsets a
portion of the interest expense we pay on our borrowings, net borrowings can be
used as a measure to gauge net interest expense. In addition, a portion of our
cash and cash equivalents is available to repay outstanding indebtedness when
the indebtedness matures or when other circumstances arise. However, we may not
immediately apply cash and cash equivalents to the reduction of debt, nor do we
expect that we would use all of our available cash and cash equivalents to repay
debt in the ordinary course of business. 

Free cash flow - The Company uses free cash flow (cash provided by operations
less investments in parks, resorts and other property), among other measures, to
evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for
purposes other than capital expenditures. Management believes that information
about free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the
cash available to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments and
pay dividends or repurchase shares. 

Aggregate segment operating income - The Company evaluates the performance of
its operating segments based on segment operating income, and management uses
aggregate segment operating income as a measure of the performance of operating
businesses separate from non-operating factors. The Company believes that
information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors by
allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company`s
portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net
income, thus providing separate insight into both operations and the other
factors that affect reported results. 

A reconciliation of segment operating income to net income is as follows (in
millions):

&lt;p&gt; * Bankruptcy judge delays decision on JP Morgan dispute&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Judge approves disclosure statement on pre-arranged plan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Confirmation hearing set for July 20
 (Adds disclosure statement approval, paragraphs 3-4)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Emily Chasan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 5 (Reuters) - A U.S. bankruptcy judge on
Tuesday said he would delay addressing a dispute between
JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) and Charter Communications Inc
CHTRQ.PK over the cable operator's plan to reinstate about
$8.5 billion in debt when it emerges from bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At a hearing in U.S. bankruptcy court in Manhattan, Judge
James Peck said that JPMorgan's complaint is an issue that
affects the "core" of Charter's bankruptcy proceedings and
would delay issuing a ruling until hearings to confirm its
reorganization plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peck did approved the disclosure statement containing
details of the Charter's proposed pre-arranged plan. It allows
the cable company to begin soliciting votes of creditors on the
plan. The court set the voting deadline for June 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A confirmation hearing was scheduled for July 20 where the
court would consider approval of the pre-arranged plan,
including the reinstatement of the debt of its subsidiaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Charter, which is controlled by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
co-founder Paul Allen, filed for bankruptcy protection in
March, buckling under the weight $21.7 billion in debt, but
saying it had reached agreements with key stakeholders to
pursue a "prepackaged" bankruptcy reorganization plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Almost immediately after filing for bankruptcy, however,
Charter was sued by lender JPMorgan on behalf of itself and
other holders of $8.5 billion of the company's senior debt.
JPMorgan claimed Charter had violated its loan agreements and
would not be able to reinstate its senior bank debt at
pre-bankruptcy interest rates, as contemplated by its
prepackaged plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Charter, the fourth-largest U.S. cable operator, had asked
the court to dismiss JPMorgan's complaint and rule that it was
a "core" proceeding that should be handled as part of its
reorganization plan confirmation proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If JPMorgan prevails on its adversary complaint, there is
no reinstatement and this plan cannot be confirmed," Stephen
Hessler, a bankruptcy attorney at Kirkland  Ellis representing
Charter, said in court on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A favorable decision on the complaint would blow up the
plan of reorganization," he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Attorneys for JPMorgan argued that Charter had been unable
to pay its debt prior to filing for bankruptcy, and had come up
with a one-time method of making its payment. JPMorgan said
that one-time payment put Charter in default under its bank
agreement because even though JPMorgan received its money,
Charter would have been unable to pay its debt going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Charter were unable to reinstate its debt at
pre-bankruptcy levels, it would have to renegotiate with its
banks and reprice the debt at significantly higher interest
rates. The company's interest payments could increase by more
than $500 million annually if that were to occur, according to
court papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peck said he did not dismiss JPMorgan's complaint outright
but would issue a formal opinion at a later date on his
decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case in re: Charter Communications Inc., U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 09-11435.

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Shortly after the close, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) is scheduled to
release its quarterly earnings report. Currently, Wall Street is looking for a
profit of 40 cents per share from the Mouse's House, though at least one options
player may have higher expectations. 

At about 10:33 a.m. Eastern time, 2 blocks of 5,250 June 25 call contracts
traded simultaneously on the Philadelphia Exchange for the ask price of $0.70.
The total outlay for this trade would be $735,000 -- ($0.70 * 100)*10,500 =
$735,000. In order for this trade to reach breakeven by expiration, DIS would
need to rally about 6.3%. The maximum loss on this position is limited to the
initial investment of $735,000.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Bernanke comment, analyst research, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; DALLAS, May 5 (Reuters) -The chief executive of JPMorgan
Chase  Co (JPM.N) said on Tuesday he expects most firms will
release the results of the U.S. government's stress tests to
shareholders on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I have been informed that they (U.S. regulators) will be
making their announcement on Thursday, so I think a lot of
firms will be announcing to shareholders the proper information
on Friday," Dimon told a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. regulators are working with the 19 largest U.S. banks
on Tuesday to finalize the stress tests and to brief them on
how policymakers will roll out the results on Thursday
afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon declined to comment further on the stress tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government has been conducting the tests since February
to determine the banks' revenues, losses and capital needs
should the economy dip even deeper into recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those banks deemed to need more of a capital buffer to
weather future credit losses will be expected to devise a
capital recovery plan that they can execute in six months.
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told lawmakers on Tuesday
that banks will be encouraged to raise private capital first,
but a new government capital infusion program will serve as a
backstop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FBR Capital Markets Managing Director Paul Miller estimated
on Tuesday that 11 of the 12 banks he analyzed will need new
capital, with JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) being the sole
exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan shares were trading down about 3 percent at $34.73
during afternoon dealings on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regulators are expected to direct about 10 of the 19 banks
they examined to bolster their capital positions, according to
a source familiar with official talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government will release aggregate results of the stress
tests and individual institutions' results late on Thursday in
a document that will number about 150 pages, the source said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 5 (Reuters) - Constellation Growth Capital, a

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Blue-chip bank JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) is garnering pessimistic
attention from option players. During the past five days, traders on the
International Securities Exchange (ISE) have bought to open 16,187 puts on JPM,
compared to 9,804 calls. In other words, 1.65 puts have been purchased for every
call during the past week. 

This bearishly skewed ratio echoes the equity's 10-day ISE put/call volume ratio
of 1.62, which ranks higher than 82.5% of other such readings taken during the
past year. This elevated reading indicates that JPM's put options have been in
greater demand on the ISE less than 18% of the time during the previous 52
weeks.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON May 5 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil is set to fall to
$45 a barrel in the next two months, before recovering to $65 by
the end of the year, Goldman Sachs (GS.N) said in a research
note on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "The improvements in the leading economic indicators
increase our confidence that a return to sequential economic
growth in second half 2009 will support a rise in WTI (U.S.)
crude oil prices to $65 a barrel."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the investment bank said before this recovery,
high crude oil supplies and weak demand for oil products would
force a retracement of U.S. crude oil prices back to $45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. crude has been trading largely between $44 and $55 for
the past two months, hitting a 2009 high of $54.83 on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The oil price recovered from $32.40, the lowest since early
2004, in December. It remains down sharply from the record high
above $147 reached in July, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Joe Brock; Editing by William Hardy)

&lt;p&gt;WHITELEY, UK--(Business Wire)--
Innovation Group plc (LSE:TIG.L) ("Innovation" or "the Company" or "the Group"),
the leading provider of enterprise software, business process outsourcing (BPO)
and repair and service network management solutions to the global Property and
Casualty industry, today announced that it had completed validation of its
Innovation Insurer software for the IBM Insurance Process Acceleration Framework
(IPA). As part of the new IBM framework, the Innovation Insurer software will
help insurance companies improve business processes based on best practices,
global experience and service oriented technologies that improve agility,
productivity, competitiveness, profitability and combined ratios. 

During changing economic climates, insurance leaders are under pressure to
transform their core business by increasing agility and responsiveness to market
shifts. Insurance companies also face heightened customer expectations for
everything from improved operations and underwriting to claims and rapid product
development. As they strive to meet these goals, insurance providers often find
that many of their legacy systems cannot respond quickly and cost-effectively to
these challenges. 

To counter this, Innovation Insurer uses the latest interactive technologies and
business tools within a service-orientated architecture (SOA) model to increase
business flexibility while maximizing re-use of assets and reducing total cost
of ownership. Innovation Insurer is the latest release of a globally installed,
proven solution that combines industry expertise and best practices into a
holistic, yet modular insurance business platform. 

Through the partnership with IBM, Innovation Group also provides customers with
access to an industry-specific software framework that efficiently deploys their
solutions. The framework can help accelerate the insurance industry solution
lifecycle from creation through to the availability of a service, while
providing quality assurance, enhanced security and ongoing management and
maintenance. 

"IBM's IPA provides a platform that allows insurance companies to get up and
running quickly with a pre-integrated and pre-validated industry solutions and
to help them meet cost and profit objectives," said Chae An, Vice President -
Financial Sector Industry Solutions, IBM Software Group. "IPA delivers an
end-to-end service delivery framework which, when combined with Innovation
Insurer, can provide the business services necessary for insurance companies
meet current challenges and opportunities while providing a foundation for
future applications and solutions." 

"Change is inevitable and a constant. We believe the P insurance industry will
benefit tremendously by creating an environment that supports business
transformation, innovation and enables new levels of competitive and strategic
advantage. Innovation Insurer leverages the services oriented architecture and
IBM`s IPA as an accelerator for business transformation today and in the future.
This allows insurers to focus on redefining their business processes and
capabilities to focus on innovation, redesign, automation, flexibility and
agility by leveraging the combined business and technology value from IBM and
Innovation Group through the IPA," commented Hassan Sadiq, CEO. 

Innovation Insurerhas been designed with significant input from key customers,
partners and industry analysts. A key differentiator of Innovation Insureris
services-oriented architecture (SOA), this enables insurance functionality to be
used together, selectively or as stand-alone solution components. These
components include complete policy administration, first notice of loss, full
claims processing, analytics, fraud, and usage-based insurance processing.
Innovation Insurer provides a platform for rapid scalability for new product,
distribution, or market expansion creating business value based on optimum
flexibility, best practices, and innovative options.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 5 (Reuters) - A U.S. bankruptcy judge on
Tuesday said he would delay addressing a dispute between
JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) and Charter Communications Inc
CHTRQ.PK over the  cable operator's plan to reinstate about
$8.5 billion in debt when it emerges from bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; At a hearing in U.S. bankruptcy court in Manhattan, Judge
James Peck said that JPMorgan's complaint is an issue that
affects the "core" of Charter's bankruptcy proceedings, and
that he may delay dealing with it as far out as the company's
hearings to confirm its reorganization plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Charter, which is controlled by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
co-founder Paul Allen, filed for bankruptcy protection in
March, buckling under the weight $21.7 billion in debt, but
saying it had reached agreements with key stakeholders to
pursue a "prepackaged" bankruptcy reorganization plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Almost immediately after filing for bankruptcy, however,
Charter was sued by lender JPMorgan on behalf of itself and
other holders of $8.5 billion of the company's senior debt.
JPMorgan claimed Charter had violated its loan agreements and
would not be able to reinstate its senior bank debt at
pre-bankruptcy interest rates, as contemplated by its
prepackaged plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Charter, the fourth-largest U.S. cable operator, had asked
the court to dismiss JPMorgan's complaint and rule that it was
a "core" proceeding that should be handled as part of its
reorganization plan confirmation proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If JPMorgan prevails on its adversary complaint, there is
no reinstatement and this plan cannot be confirmed," Stephen
Hessler, a bankruptcy attorney at Kirkland  Ellis representing
Charter, said in court on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A favorable decision on the complaint would blow up the
plan of reorganization," he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Attorneys for JPMorgan argued that Charter had been unable
to pay its debt prior to filing for bankruptcy, and had come up
with a one-time method of making its payment. JPMorgan said
that one-time payment put Charter in default under its bank
agreement because even though JPMorgan received its money,
Charter would have been unable to pay its debt going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Charter were unable to reinstate its debt at
pre-bankruptcy levels, it would have to renegotiate with its
banks and reprice the debt at significantly higher interest
rates. The company's interest payments could increase by more
than $500 million annually if that were to occur, according to
court papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peck said he did not dismiss JPMorgan's complaint outright
but would issue a formal opinion at a later date on his
decision.

&lt;p&gt;IBM has bought the data discovery software assets of Exeros, and will use them to enhance the services offered by its business analytics consulting division, it said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exeros makes software that can automate the search for relationships between different databases, something the company says is a prerequisite for successful data quality or data integration projects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM plans to integrate the Exeros tools with other elements of its Information Management Software range, it said. That range includes software from Cognos, which IBM acquired for US$5 billion in November 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Exeros software can cut the cost of data warehousing and master data management, IBM said. Among the software's users will be consultants at IBM's Business Analytics and Optimization Services division, created last month following a reorganization of its Global Business Services consulting activities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM did not disclose the terms of the acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exeros, founded in 2002, is a privately held company funded by two venture capital firms, Globespan Capital Partners and Bay Partners, and by investment management company AllianceBernstein. Its CEO and cofounder, Piyush Gupta, is a former employee of IBM, where he helped develop an enterprise information integration tool called DataJoiner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Hispanic Heritage Youth Awards encourage academic achievement in science
education 
* Regional winners to be honored in 12 cities 
* ExxonMobil has contributed over $1.4 million over nine years

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil announced today its sponsorship of the Hispanic Heritage Youth Awards
to honor America`s Latino students who excel in engineering and mathematics. 

"ExxonMobil sees it as an imperative to encourage and reward students who are
excelling in the vital areas of math and science," said Rex W. Tillerson,
chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corporation. 

"We want to develop more engineers and scientists and our partnership with the
Hispanic Heritage Youth Awards supports that goal. We are proud of our
involvement in the awards and congratulate all of the winners." 

ExxonMobil has contributed more than $1.4 million in the nine years it has
sponsored the awards. 

The Hispanic Heritage Awards Foundation will honor regional winners this spring
in 12 cities, including Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York,
Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, San Jose and Washington, D.C.
Award recipients are graduating seniors and are chosen based on academic
achievement, community service and an essay about the importance of their
heritage. 

One National Youth Award winner will be chosen from the regional winners in each
category and will receive an additional educational grant, a laptop computer and
a trip to the National Youth Award presentation in Washington, D.C. 

Studies have shown that the United States will face a critical shortage of
engineers, scientists and other technically trained workers in the near future.
To help address the nation`s math and science crisis, ExxonMobil supports
programs and organizations such as the National Math and Science Initiative
(NMSI) that focus on improvements in these areas from pre-school through higher
education.

range of philanthropic activities that advance education, health and science in

States, ExxonMobil supports initiatives to improve math and science education at
the K-12 and higher education levels. 

Globally, ExxonMobil provides funding to improve basic education and combat
malaria and other infectious diseases in developing countries. In 2008, together
with its employees and retirees, Exxon Mobil Corporation, its divisions and
affiliates, and ExxonMobil Foundation provided $225 million in contributions
worldwide, of which more than $89 million was dedicated to education. Additional
information on ExxonMobil`s community partnerships and contributions programs is
available at www.exxonmobil.com/community. 

About the Hispanic Heritage Youth Awards:

The Hispanic Heritage Youth Awards were created in 1998 by the Hispanic Heritage
Awards Foundation in an effort to recognize and celebrate the achievements of
Hispanic high school seniors across the nation and promote them as role models
for their peers. 

Throughout the United States, a total of 216 Regional Youth Award winners-three
students in each of six categories in 12 cities-will be honored and receive
educational grants during special ceremonies. Subsequently, one National Youth
Award Winner will be chosen from the pool of regional winners in each category
and will receive an additional educational grant, a laptop computer, a free trip
to the National Youth Award presentation and to the national Hispanic Heritage
Awards ceremony in Washington, D.C. where they will be presented with their
award on stage.

    On April 13, 2009, Walton completed the sale of undivided interests in
land located in Phoenix, Arizona known as Sawtooth View 1, to 720
purchasers, for an aggregate purchase price of $12,290,000 USD.

    Sawtooth View 1 is part of an approximately 2,250-acre master planned
community informally known as Sunland. The Sunland assembly is
strategically located in the City of Eloy in the Phoenix-Tucson I-10
corridor, one of Arizona's fastest-growing regions.

    Walton has been researching and participating in North American real
estate markets for thirty years, and identifying strategic land in
Arizona for almost a decade. For years, Arizona has been one of the USA's
strongest economic growth regions, and is expected to continue being so
in the future, given Arizona's long-term fundamentals in employment,
population, economics, and housing affordability.

    About Walton: Walton International Group Inc. and the other members of
the Walton group of companies constitute one of North America's leading
land-based real estate investment groups. Over the past 30 years, Walton
firms have acquired more than 49,200 acres of quality land strategically
located in the development path of some of North America's leading urban
growth areas. Walton companies are innovative leaders in the research,
selection, acquisition, syndication, planning, development management and
sale of land, having to date syndicated over $2 billion of land in
Alberta, Ontario, Arizona, Texas and Georgia with over 53,600 investors
and purchasers.

&lt;p&gt;Companies Launch WebSpan to Help Businesses Reduce the Cost and Complexity of
Business Connectivity and Integration
LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--
Hubspan Inc., a leading provider of business integration solutions, and IBM
(NYSE:IBM) today announced WebSpan, a new Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
integration platform. WebSpan combines the Hubspan on-demand integration
platform and IBM WebSphere integration software into a single platform that can
help businesses reduce the cost, time and complexity associated with traditional
integration and business process automation solutions. 

Companies and solution providers worldwide continue to focus on the critical
need to connect and integrate data and processes across a growing number of
applications and business processes. With WebSpan, these businesses will have a
new option to deploy business community networks, extend the reach of existing
application and infrastructure investments, and accelerate service oriented
architecture (SOA) initiatives. 

"Our clients are asking us for cloud-based platforms that offer robust and
comprehensive integration capabilities," said Steve Worrall, vice president of
WebSphere BPM, Connectivity, Commerce and GB Sales for IBM. "These companies are
increasingly looking for a flexible solution that provides an easy entry point,
delivering rapid and quantifiable business value. WebSpan expands our clients`
choices when implementing connectivity and integration solutions." 

WebSpan is a single instance, multi-tenant SaaS integration platform, which
enables cost-effective business integration and ease of scalability while
optimizing the sharing of resources across partner communities. WebSpan is
available with specific solution packages to meet the needs of a wide range of
companies and business processes, with an initial set of offerings targeting
e-procurement, demand/supply chain, e-payments, logistics and e-commerce
integration. 

"Hubspan is proud to combine forces with IBM to change the way the world
accesses and consumes integration technologies and solutions," said Trisha
Gross, CEO of Hubspan. "WebSpan can dramatically drive down the cost of
integrating systems and business processes while accelerating time to value." 

WebSpan can help reduce the costs of operating the integration infrastructure by
providing management and maintenance directly within the integration platform.
Its subscription-based pricing also provides a further advantage by enabling
companies to pay for the solution as an operating expense versus a capital
expenditure. In today`s demanding economy, this "pay-as-you-grow" model helps
organizations tackle even small integration challenges by offering an affordable
starting point with the ability to expand over time. In addition, the platform
easily integrates with existing technology investments, expediting solution
deployment and providing a potential competitive advantage. 

Organizations such as Visa Inc., who recently launched a strategic alliance with
Hubspan, have identified integration as an obstacle to the smooth flow of
inter-enterprise information and have embedded integration solutions into their
product and services offerings. Visa recently announced its Accounts Payable
Automation solution, which incorporates integration capabilities as a standard
component of the offering. 

"There`s no doubt that process automation and information integration can help
to deliver cost savings, but our financial institution clients and corporate
customers needed a simplified road map for a more cost-effective
implementation," said Nick Marchetti, head of supply chain management, Visa Inc.
"Visa`s alliance with Hubspan has helped reduce the integration hurdle, enabling
greater partner collaboration and leading to automation of time and resource
intensive processes such as the accounts payable function." 

With its low cost of entry and speed of deployment, the software subscription
model is increasingly in demand from businesses in all market segments. In fact,
a recent report by a leading analyst firm cites that SaaS enterprise application
spending will reach $14.8 billion by 2012.1 With the WebSpan offering based on
IBM technology, enterprises will have easy access to a proven on-demand platform
to overcome integration challenges. 

WebSpan is marketed and sold by both the IBM global sales network and Hubspan to
ensure broad awareness of this critical integration solution to general business
customers worldwide. 

IBM is the worldwide SOA leader with more than 8,000 client engagements, 7,400
SOA business partners, 300 SOA-specific technology patents, a community of
greater than 120,000 architects and developers, and over 2000 universities
advancing the SOA curriculum. For more information on how IBM is helping clients
make smarter, faster decisions by using SOA, visit: http://www.ibm.com/soa.

(1) As of March 27, 2009, there was US$355,000,000 aggregate principal amount of
the Series 2004-4 Floating Rate Liquidity Funding Notes outstanding (which is
reflected in DTC's system as US$710,000,000, with a factor of 0.5). 

The tender offer will expire at 11:59 P.M., New York City time, on June 2, 2009,
unless extended or earlier terminated (the "Expiration Time"). Holders of Notes
who validly tender (and do not withdraw their Notes) on or before 5:00 P.M., New
York City time, on May 18, 2009, unless extended (the "Early Tender Date"), and
whose Notes are accepted for purchase will receive the applicable Total
Consideration for the relevant series specified in the table above. The Total
Consideration includes both the applicable Tender Offer Consideration and the
applicable Early Tender Premium, in each case, set out in the table above.
Holders of Notes who validly tender their Notes after the Early Tender Date but
on or before the Expiration Date and whose Notes are accepted for purchase will
receive the applicable Tender Offer Consideration for the relevant series
specified in the table above, but will not receive the applicable Early Tender
Premium . In addition, the Bank will pay all accrued and unpaid interest on the
Notes purchased pursuant to the offer up to, but not including, the Settlement
Date (as defined below). The Bank will pay the Total Consideration or the Tender
Offer Consideration, as applicable, plus all accrued and unpaid interest on the
Notes purchased pursuant to the offer in same-day funds promptly after the
Expiration Time (the "Settlement Date"), which is expected to be on or about
Tuesday, June 2, 2009. The Bank expects to use available cash on hand at the
time of settlement to pay for the Notes. 

Notes tendered by a holder may be withdrawn at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on May 18, 2009, unless extended, but not thereafter. 

If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that are validly tendered (and
not withdrawn) exceeds the Maximum Tender Amount, the Bank will accept for
purchase tendered Notes in accordance with the Acceptance Priority Level (in
numerical priority order) set forth on the table above. If the remaining portion
of the Maximum Tender Amount available for purchase of Notes of an Acceptance
Priority Level is sufficient to purchase some, but not all, of such Notes
validly tendered (and not withdrawn), the Bank will accept such Notes for
purchase on a pro rata basis in an aggregate principal amount equal to such
remaining portion. Tendered Notes with an Acceptance Priority Level lower than
the Acceptance Priority Level at which the full Maximum Tender Amount has been
utilized will not be accepted for purchase. 

The tender offer is conditioned upon the satisfaction or waiver of certain
conditions as described in the Offer to Purchase. Subject to applicable law, the
Bank may also terminate the tender offer at any time prior to the Expiration
Date in its sole discretion. 

Additional terms and conditions of the tender offer are set forth in the Offer
to Purchase and the Letter of Transmittal dated May 5, 2009. 

This press release is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation to buy any
of the Notes, nor is it a solicitation for acceptance of the tender offer. The
Bank is making the tender offer only by, and pursuant to the terms of, the Offer
to Purchase and the Letter of Transmittal. The tender offer is not being made in
any jurisdiction in which the making or acceptance thereof would not be in
compliance with the securities, blue sky or other laws of such jurisdiction.
None of the Bank or its affiliates, the Dealer Manager, the Depositary or the
Information Agent is making any recommendation as to whether or not holders
should tender their Notes in connection with the tender offer. 

The complete terms and conditions of the tender offer are set forth in the Offer
to Purchase and Letter of Transmittal that are being sent to holders of the
Notes. Holders are urged to read the tender offer documents carefully when they
become available. Copies of the Offer to Purchase and Letter of Transmittal may

&lt;p&gt;Prominent Physician, Researcher and Business Leader Will Direct Global Medical
and Regulatory Strategy, Join Executive Leadership Team
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc announced today that Freda Lewis-Hall, M.D., has been appointed as
Chief Medical Officer and Senior Vice President, Pfizer Inc. Dr. Lewis-Hall will
be the senior physician in the company, responsible for enterprise-wide medical,
patient safety, regulatory affairs and quality assurance as well as outreach to
doctors and other medical professionals. She joins Pfizer from Vertex
Pharmaceuticals, where she was responsible for clinical and non-clinical
development as well as both medical and regulatory. 

"We welcome Dr. Lewis-Hall to Pfizer and know that she will make a distinctive
contribution as we build the world`s premier biopharmaceutical company. Her
achievements as a biomedical researcher, patient advocate, academician and
organizational leader fit perfectly with our goal of applying innovative science
to improve world health," said Jeffrey B. Kindler, Pfizer`s chairman and chief
executive officer. 

Dr. Lewis-Hall will report to Mr. Kindler and serve on Pfizer`s Executive
Leadership Team, its most senior leadership group. She will shape Pfizer`s
regulatory and medical policy during a time of fast-changing expectations for
healthcare companies and a wave of new therapies in development, especially as
information technologies change the ways companies develop medicines, clinicians
prescribe them, and patients and payers value them. 

"Dr. Lewis-Hall brings a unique perspective to Pfizer, having worked in large
and small biopharmaceutical companies, in government, in academia, and in direct
patient care and patient advocacy," said Phyllis Greenberger, M.S.W., president
and CEO of the Society for Women`s Health Research who has worked with Dr.
Lewis-Hall in numerous capacities for the past 20 years. "She has special
sensitivities, having a doctor`s compassion, a leader`s vision and a
researcher`s love of science and medicine." 

"No other pharmaceutical company has Pfizer`s potential," said Dr. Lewis-Hall,
"potential that will increase greatly with the pending acquisition of Wyeth. I
look forward to building on the company`s longstanding commitment to better
medicine through strong science, and on its vision of closer partnership with
patients, doctors, and the entire healthcare community." 

Prior to joining Vertex, Dr. Lewis-Hall was Senior Vice President of Medical
Affairs at Bristol-Myers Squibb, Vice President of Research and Development at
Pharmacia, and Product Team Leader at Eli Lilly and Company, where she was
involved in the development and launch of dozens of new drugs over the last
decade. Previously, Dr. Lewis-Hall held leadership positions at the National
Institute of Mental Health and the Howard University College of Medicine and
maintained a private practice in both the District of Columbia and the U.S.
Virgin Islands. 

Dr. Lewis-Hall is a Fellow of the American Academy of Psychiatry. Her
publications include the book "Psychiatric Illness in Women: Emerging Trends and
Research" and a number of journal articles on diagnosing and treating mental
health. She`s a well-known speaker and television commentator on the effects of
illness on patients, families and communities as well as healthcare disparities,
mental illness and women`s health issues. 

Dr. Lewis-Hall received her Bachelor of Arts and Sciences from The Johns Hopkins
University and her Medical Doctorate from Howard University Hospital and College
of Medicine. 

She succeeds Dr. Joseph Feczko, who previously announced his retirement from
Pfizer.

&lt;p&gt;In the latest sniping in the long-running feud over document format standards, IBM this week claimed that Microsoft Corp.'s Excel 2007 corrupted formulas and data in spreadsheets created in the OpenDocument Format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rebuffed the charge, while an industry analyst called the spat an overblown issue that users of ODF-based productivity suites, taking the right steps, can dodge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excel 2007 and other parts of Office 2007 began supporting the ODF standard last week with the release of Office 2007 Service Pack 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But according to an analysis posted on the personal blog of Rob Weir, chief ODF architect for IBM, Excel 2007 "silently strips out formulas" when reading spreadsheets created by other ODF-compliant programs, such as OpenOffice.org and IBM's Lotus Symphony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This can cause subtle and not so subtle errors and data loss," wrote Weir, as results dependent upon dynamic calculations -- today's date, for instance -- become inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This data loss is also true when Excel 2007 tries to read spreadsheets created by Microsoft Office 2003 with the aid of a Microsoft-sponsored plug-in or one from Sun Microsystems Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When creating ODF-based spreadsheets, Excel 2007 also saves formulas in a nonstandard location, Weir said. That causes other spreadsheet programs to also fail to read the data properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weir fixed the blame squarely on Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The degree of incompetence needed to explain SP2's poor ODF support boggles the mind and leads me to further uncharitable thoughts," Weir wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft assigned fault, however, on the latest versions of OpenOffice.org and Symphony that write formulas according to the ODF 1.2 specification. Office 2007's recent update supports ODF 1.1, which is an approved standard. ODF 1.2 has yet to be approved by the nonpartisan OASIS standards body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When ODF 1.2 is "completed, standardized, and published, we'll be looking at that as the future path for enabling formula interoperability in ODF spreadsheets," wrote Microsoft's senior program manager for Office interoperability, Doug Mahugh, in a blog posted Tuesday. "But we're not there yet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his analysis, Mahugh came to the opposite conclusion: Excel 2007 actually rendered results from an OpenOffice.org-created spreadsheet more correctly than Lotus Symphony did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and IBM have been trading barbs on document format standards for half a decade, since Microsoft first announced plans to create an XML-based document format for Office 2007. In reaction, IBM helped engineer the approval of the ODF standard by global standards bodies such as ISO and OASIS in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That led to Microsoft's successful push to get its document format, now called Office Open XML (OOXML), to also approved by the same standards bodies two years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than taking sides in this Rashomon-like squabble, Guy Creese, an analyst with Burton Group, blames the data corruption problems in ODF on the reluctance of standards makers to strictly define the spreadsheet formulas when ODF was first approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ODF 1.2 will finally do that, Creese wrote, but in the meantime, others supporting ODF, such as Google Inc. and its Google Docs, had followed OpenOffice.org's de facto example. Perhaps naturally, Microsoft was reluctant to join that camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "takeaway," Creese wrote, is that "ODF interoperability isn't here yet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, organizations working with ODF documents can still mostly dodge interoperability problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The best strategy is to stick with one productivity suite as a way to avoid these interoperability problems," wrote Creese. "That way, even if formula support is idiosyncratic, it at least will be consistent within the enterprise."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Says chance to create better search product with Yahoo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * CEO Ballmer says economy "resetting" to lower level&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PALO ALTO Calif. May 6 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
CEO Steve Ballmer said he sees opportunities to work with Yahoo
Inc (YHOO.O) to create a "better search product" but would not
comment on discussions that the two may be engaged in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer's trip to the San Francisco Bay area has prompted

"valuable." He was speaking to students at Stanford University

reiterated previous comments about the potential opportunities
of a search partnership with Yahoo, which could bring in more

&lt;p&gt;Company "Clearly Hiding" Risk Factors from Investors and Financial Markets,
Representatives Say
LAGO AGRIO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
Behind the letter sent by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo to Chevron over
its potential $27 billion environmental liability in Ecuador is a growing
concern in the investor community that the company is providing misleading
information about its financial risk to regulatory authorities and investors,
said an Amazon Defense Coalition official. 

For several months, representatives of the indigenous communities in Ecuador`s
Amazon have been warning shareholders that Chevron has been using false
information to minimize its financial exposure in the litigation, which is
expected to end this year with a possible record-breaking judgment against the
company. Cuomo has asked Chevron to provide information about its public filings
on the litigation and set a response deadline for May 11, according to news
reports Wednesday. 

"We believe Chevron is distorting information in its public filings and thumbing
its nose at SEC regulators," Pablo Fajardo, the lawyer for the Ecuadorians, was
quoted as saying on February 17

of this year. Fajardo at the time described Chevron`s SEC disclosures as
"dishonest and misleading." 

Today, Fajardo said he stands by his comments. "The letter from the New York
Attorney General is not surprising and is probably overdue," he said when told
of the news reports. "It has been clear to us for some time that Chevron has
engaged in a cover-up to hide the liability from shareholders." 

The Cuomo letter to Chevron follows an article in April in the Wall Street
Journal that outlined concerns from several large public pension funds about the
way Chevron`s management is handling the Ecuador matter. On Sunday night, 60
Minutes broadcast a segment where a Chevron lawyer, Sylvia Garrigo, stumbled
through an interview unable to explain how the company could find itself facing
such a huge liability in a court where Chevron asked for the trial to take
place. 

The lawsuit charges Texaco (now Chevron) with dumping more than 18 billion
gallons of toxic waste into Ecuador`s Amazon waterways, decimating indigenous
groups and causing increases in cancers and oil-related health problems. A team
of court experts have calculated damages at $27 billion, and a decision is
expected later this year. 

While the case was initially filed in the U.S. in 1993 and the trial started in
2003 in Ecuador at Chevron`s request, Chevron never disclosed any potential
liability in the matter in its public filings until 2008. 

Fajardo said Chevron has provided misleading or incomplete information, or
blatantly lied, in its 10-q and 10-k filings as follows:

* Chevron claims in its disclosures that it is not subject to jurisdiction in
Ecuador`s courts. This directly contradicts a court order
 the
company signed in 2001 voluntarily subjecting itself to jurisdiction in Ecuador,
as a condition of the case being transferred out of U.S. courts. 
* Chevron also claims that is has statute of limitations defense in Ecuador. But
in the same order cited above, Chevron waived those defenses as a condition of
transferring the case to Ecuador. 
* Chevron asserts in its filings that it was released from Ecuador`s government
from further environmental liability, but the release itself by its express
language does not cover the claims of private litigants. 
* Chevron also asserts that the law used in Ecuador is being applied
retroactively, when in fact it has been part of Ecuador`s civil code since the
1800s.

Each of the misrepresentations is easily provable with a minimum of
investigation, said Fajardo. "It strikes us that the Chevron legal department is
absolutely reckless with regard to its public filings on the Ecuador case," he
said.

five indigenous groups that inhabit Ecuador`s Northern Amazon region. The
mission of the Coalition is to protect the environment and secure social justice

&lt;p&gt;* Invested $160 million in community initiatives around the world
* Posted record safety performance
* Completed major energy efficiency projects and reduced GHG emissions

SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) invested $160 million in communities around the
world, posted record safety performance and completed major energy efficiency
projects, according to the company's 2008 Corporate Responsibility Report, which
was issued today. 

"Energy is the foundation of global growth and prosperity," said Dave O'Reilly,
Chevron chairman and CEO. "But Chevron does much more than provide energy. Our
partnerships touch millions of lives and set the stage for human advancement by
addressing basic human needs, education and economic development." 

Chevron's seventh annual corporate responsibility report provides descriptions,
data and perspectives on key areas such as community engagement, health and
safety, energy efficiency, renewable and alternative energy, and environmental
performance for 2008. Highlights include: 

Community Engagement

Through building partnerships that produce sustainable results, Chevron invested
$160 million in communities around the world in 2008, an increase of $41 million
over 2007. These investments help improve access to basic human needs, enable
education and training opportunities, and promote sustainable livelihoods. 

Chevron is the first Corporate Champion of The Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria. In 2008, Chevron provided the initial $5 million
investment of a $30 million commitment for Global Fund grants in Indonesia,
Thailand, Angola, South Africa, Nigeria and the Philippines. 

Chevron also responded to natural disasters in Myanmar, China, the Caribbean,
and on the U.S. Gulf Coast to help meet the needs of those affected. Chevron`s
longer-term post-disaster response projects reached milestones in 2008 with the
opening of a polytechnic institute in Aceh, Indonesia, and the final evaluation
of Chevron`s Energy For Learning program in Louisiana and Mississippi. 

Health and Safety

For the seventh consecutive year, Chevron has improved its safety performance. 

In 2008, Chevron provided HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention training to more
than 4,500 employees around the world and hosted AIDS Day events at more than 25
Chevron facilities in 11 countries. 

Energy Efficiency and Climate Change

In 2008, Chevron reduced its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 800,000 metric
tons of CO2 equivalent. Chevron is committed to energy efficiency and has
increased the energy efficiency of its global operations by 28 percent since
1992. 

Chevron Energy Solutions (CES), a corporate subsidiary, was recently listed in
Fast Company`s "World`s Most Innovative Companies." CES completed efficiency and
solar projects for schools, the U.S. federal government, and Chevron. In
December 2008, CES was awarded a master Energy Saving Performance Contract from
the U.S. Department of Energy to work with federal agencies to reduce energy and
water consumption and increase the use of renewable energy at agency facilities.
This Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract provides a significant
opportunity for CES to expand its efficiency work with federal agencies in 2009
and into the future. 

In late 2008, Chevron launched "I Will," a new phase of its Human Energy
campaign in the United States. It encourages Americans to conserve energy and
use it more efficiently. Willyoujoinus.com has drawn more than 3.7 million
visitors since it was launched in July 2005, and more than 1.3 million of them
since the "I Will" campaign was launched. 

Renewable and Alternative Energy

Through a joint venture with Weyerhaeuser Co., one of the nation`s largest
forest products companies, Chevron formed Catchlight Energy LLC to develop the
next generation of renewable transportation fuels from nonfood sources. The
joint venture is a research and development partnership to transform cellulosic
biomass into biofuels. Cellulosic biomass is made from renewable sources of
forest and agricultural residuals instead of food crops. 

In May 2008, Chevron completed its first LEED (Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design) Gold-certified green building project in Covington,
Louisiana. LEED is a certification program of the U.S. Green Building Council
and is the recognized standard for measuring the sustainability of buildings,
taking into account energy and water use, the procurement of recycled material
in construction, waste minimization, and other elements. 

Stakeholder Engagement

Chevron's Environmental, Social and Health Impact Assessment (ESHIA) process
identifies, analyzes and develops measures that enhance benefits and avoid or
mitigate environmental, social and health impacts of new capital projects. By
the end of 2008, ESHIA was being applied to more than 450 capital projects
worldwide. A goal of ESHIA is to establish and maintain dialogue with
stakeholders throughout the lifetime of a project and solicit their views and
ideas to improve benefits and avoid or mitigate potential adverse impacts, and
to consider potential environmental, social and health effects and stakeholder
input in the company`s assessments and planning.

&lt;p&gt; * Ambac accuses JPMorgan of violating investment agreement

 * JPMorgan says will vigorously contest the allegations
 (Adds JPMorgan comment, other details)

 NEW YORK, May 6 (Reuters) - A British subsidiary of Ambac
Financial Group Inc ABK.N has filed court papers seeking $1
billion in damages, accusing JPMorgan Investment Management of
buying risky mortgage-backed securities for its portfolio in
violation of their investment agreement.

 Ambac Assurance UK Ltd accused the JPMorgan Chase  Co
(JPM.N) investment unit of breach of contract, breach of
fiduciary duty and gross negligence.

 JPMorgan was the investment manager for $1.65 billion of
assets in the name of Ballantyne Re Plc, Ambac said in a brief
court summons notice filed in New York State Supreme Court. The
notice was dated Monday.

 JPMorgan spokeswoman Mary Sedarat said that the firm had
received the summons notice, and intends "to contest vigorously"
any allegations that it managed assets improperly.

 "Being familiar with the client, we believe that we managed
the account appropriately," Sedarat said.

 Ambac said JPMorgan placed almost all of the Ballantyne
assets it oversaw in "inappropriate securities," including risky
subprime and "Alt-A" residential mortgage-backed securities.

 Alt-A loans are loans in which borrowers do not need to
provide income verification or asset documentation. These loans,
and other nontraditional mortgages broadly called subprime
loans, have been blamed for exacerbating U.S. housing market
woes as borrowers have defaulted on their payments.

 Ambac said it was seeking $1 billion in compensatory
damages, plus interest and the costs associated with the
litigation.

 "JPMorgan's acts and omissions were, at a minimum, grossly
negligent, and were the proximate cause of Ballantyne's
losses," Ambac said in its court papers. No details of the
losses were provided in the filing.

  (Updates to midday)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Leah Schnurr&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 6 (Reuters) - The Dow and SP 500 gained on
Wednesday on reassuring labor market data and Walt Disney's
better-than-expected profit, while the Nasdaq dipped as
investors took profits on Apple and other bellwether names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A rise in bank stocks also cushioned the broader market as
investors bet that bank capital shortfalls will be manageable
the day before stress test results are expected to be
unveiled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Apple (AAPL.O) fell 0.9 percent to $131.49,
while International Business Machines (IBM.N) was the Dow's
biggest drag, falling 1.3 percent to $103.95.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tech sector was one of the few to suffer the least in
the market's plunge to 12-year closing lows in early March,
and has also served as a major underpinning of the market's
rebound from that significant trough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In economic news, data showed private-sector job losses
slowed in April, coming in below expectations and providing
further reason for optimism that the U.S. economy has seen the
worst before the government's release of the monthly non-farm
payrolls report on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The market got a bit of a lift from the
better-than-expected ADP employment report, which indicates
that Friday's monthly national jobs report might also show
some moderate improvement and indicate that the jobs market
may have turned the corner," said Michael Sheldon, chief
market strategist at RDM Financial in Westport, Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At this point going forward, investors will need to see a
continuation of the trend of positive economic news to help
send stocks higher."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI added 37.91
points, or 0.45 percent, to 8,448.56. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX rose 7.37 points, or 0.82 percent, to 911.17.
But the Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC lost 5.69 points, or
0.32 percent, to 1,748.43.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since hitting a bear market low in early March, the SP
500 has surged more than 34 percent, driven by optimism about
the financial system's condition and hopes the recession may
be waning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of major banks advanced, sending the KBW Bank index
.BKX up 6.5 percent. About 10 of the 19 institutions under
review may need more capital, a person familiar with official
talks has said. The results are expected to be unveiled on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of America Corp(BAC.N) has been told it needs $34
billion of capital to withstand a deep economic downturn, a
source said. Its stock rose 9.4 percent to $11.86.
[ID:nL6943131].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Additionally, Bloomberg reported Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N)
will need $15 billion of new capital after the stress tests,
while JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) does not need to raise
capital after its own stress test. Wells Fargo's stock was up
10.9 percent at $25.74 and JPMorgan was up 4.5 percent at
$36.38.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) gave the Dow its biggest lift,
jumping 11.1 percent to $25.72 after the No. 1 U.S.
entertainment company posted a quarterly profit above Wall
Street's forecasts after Tuesday's closing bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's results gave more support to views that the
economy may be stabilizing and consumers may be regaining some
confidence.

How to Regularly Access Picks from the Zacks Rank Discovery for
Free:http://at.zacks.com/?id=88

Underlying the four free stock picks is a simple truth that first appeared in a
Financial Analysts Journal article published in 1979. Leonard Zacks, a Ph.D. in
Mathematics from M.I.T. found that "earnings estimate revisions are the most
powerful force impacting stock prices." Zacks #1 Rank is awarded to a stock when
analysts sharply upgrade their estimates of what the company will earn. 

Today, Zacks is promoting its stock recommendations by offering four daily picks
free to those who register at http://at.zacks.com/?id=88

OCEANPORT, N.J.--(Business Wire)--
CommVault(NASDAQ: CVLT):

News Facts:

* CommVault will showcase its industry-leading Simpana 8 software with
enhancements to its support for Microsoft Corp. data and applications, at the
upcoming Microsoft Tech&#183;Ed Conference. 
* As a bronze sponsor, CommVault technology experts will be on hand to provide
attendees one-on-one demonstrations of Simpana 8 software at Booth #310. 
* CommVault recently announced that Simpana 8, the only truly unified data
management platform, has been tightly integrated with key Microsoft applications
to provide superior data and information management for Microsoft Windows Server
2008, Microsoft Exchange Server 2007, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Office
SharePoint Server 2007 and Active Directory. 
* Simpana 8 provides Microsoft customers with benefits including electronic
records management, tight integration with the Microsoft FAST indexing engine,
data reduction, backup and recovery and content management, management of
virtual server environments, discovery capabilities, and performance
enhancements for Office SharePoint Server 2007. 
* With the industry`s first global embedded software deduplication, Simpana 8
software offers a holistic approach to data deduplication that spans both disk
and tape tiers of storage. CommVault extends this feature for Microsoft users by
enabling a simple 64-bit Windows Server 2008 with commodity disk to be a
deduplication target at a much more attractive price than a comparable dedicated
appliance. Further, CommVault`s unique, end-to-end approach expands the benefits
of block-level deduplication for Exchange Server 2007 and Office SharePoint
Server 2007 across all backup and archive copies within an organization,
resulting in cost-efficient scaling and performance across the entire data
management infrastructure.

&lt;p&gt;Company Provides Deep Web Security Expertise to the Microsoft Reputation Service
Offering (MRS)
ORANGE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Marshal8e6, a global provider of Secure Web Gateway and email security products
to over 20,000 businesses worldwide, today announced its collaboration with
Microsoft Corporation to supply URL categorization for Microsoft products.
Microsoft will integrate the comprehensive Marshal8e6 Library of URLs and
keywords, the backbone of the company`s Web filtering solutions, into the
Microsoft Reputation Service (MRS) platform. In addition, Marshal8e6 will join
the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), and will receive security
vulnerability information from the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) in
advance of Microsoft`s monthly security update. 

"We are incredibly enthusiastic about the collaboration with Marshal8e6, and
view the company`s comprehensive URL Library and in-depth Web expertise as a
valuable component of our broad goal to protect customers with `business-ready`
endpoint security and management solutions. It was a natural move to incorporate
their data into our reputation services," said Greg Kohanim, Microsoft Product
Unit Manager, Identity and Security Division. "It is exactly this type of
collaboration that enables us to deliver comprehensive security and management
solutions." 

The Microsoft Reputation Service (MRS) is a cloud-based object categorization
system designed to provide comprehensive reputation content to enable core trust
scenarios across Forefront and Microsoft security and management endpoint
solutions. The first Forefront branded product that MRS will support is the
Microsoft Forefront Threat Management Gateway (TMG), slated for release later
this year. Microsoft TMG customers will have access to in-depth URL
identification and classification that is provided in part by Marshal8e6. 

With over 13 years in development, the Marshal8e6 Library is one of the oldest
and most comprehensive filtering libraries available today. It consists of
millions of URLs and keywords, divided into over 100 categories, and is
maintained in real-time by the Marshal8e6 TRACElabs, a collection of
highly-skilled Internet threat experts. TRACElabs works around the clock on
multiple continents to ensure customers receive up-to-the-minute categorizations
and protections from Internet threats such as malicious code, viruses, spyware,
phishing and blended threats. Now one of just a handful of security vendors in
the MAPP program, TRACElabs will also receive vulnerability information before
the monthly Microsoft patch releases and can provide customers with rapid and
updated protections against possible exploits and attacks. 

"Marshal8e6 is thrilled to be part of the coveted MAPP program, and are equally
pleased that our extensive URL Library has been selected as a provider of Web
filtering categorization for the next generation of Microsoft`s Forefront Threat
Management Gateway," said Paul Myer, senior vice president, Corporate
Development, Marshal8e6. "Our partnership with Microsoft further validates our
extensive Web filtering expertise and provides a channel with which we can help
protect many more organizations from today`s and tomorrow`s Web-based threats."

&lt;p&gt;Gulf`s Deepest Production Expected to Add 125,000 Barrels of Oil Per Day
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) has announced that it has started crude oil
production from its Tahiti Field, the deepest producing field in the Gulf of
Mexico. First oil from Tahiti was achieved on May 5, 2009. Daily production is
expected to ramp up to approximately 125,000 barrels of crude oil and 70 million
cubic feet of natural gas before the end of the year. 

The Tahiti Field is one of the largest in the Gulf of Mexico. It was discovered
in 2002 and is estimated to contain total recoverable resources of 400 to 500
million oil-equivalent barrels. The total cost for the first phase of the
project is $2.7 billion and represents one of 40 projects in which Chevron`s
share of the investment is over $1 billion. 

"Tahiti is a significant addition to our growing reserves and production," said
George Kirkland, executive vice president, Global Upstream and Gas. "It is
another demonstration of our deepwater expertise, and our ability to execute an
industry-leading queue of major capital projects." 

Tahiti is located at Green Canyon Blocks 596, 597, 640 and 641, approximately
190 miles (305 kilometers) south of New Orleans, and in approximately 4,100 feet
(1,250 meters) of water. Primary pay sands are Lower to Middle Miocene from
23,000 to 28,000 feet and lie below a salt canopy ranging from 8,000 to 15,000
feet thick. The deepest producing well is more than 26,700 feet, a record for
the Gulf of Mexico. Production is from two subsea drill centers tied backed to a
floating production facility supported by a truss spar. 

Chevron holds a 58 percent working interest in Tahiti and is the operator,
StatoilHydro holds a 25 percent working interest, and Total owns a 17 percent
working interest. 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world's leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company's success is
driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and other energy products; manufactures and sells
petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides
energy efficiency solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future,
including biofuels and other renewables. Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif.

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Corp. Exec Board Retains Sell Rec

We reiterate our Sell rating on shares of The Corporate Executive Board (NASDAQ:
EXBD) after the company lowered its full-year outlook in conjunction with its
first-quarter earnings release. 

The quarterly results were actually above our expectation from an earnings
standpoint, as cost-cutting enabled the company to limit the decline in earnings
despite a 15% year-over-year decline in revenues. 

Cautious on Alkermes` Surge

Early this morning, Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMLN), Eli Lilly
(NYSE: LLY) and Alkermes (NASDAQ: ALKS) announced that a New Drug Application
(NDA) for Exenatide once weekly for type II diabetes has been submitted to the
US FDA. 

Exenatide once weekly is an investigational sustained release medication for
type II diabetes that is injected subcutaneously and administered only once a
week. Exenatide is the active ingredient in Byetta injection, which is currently
available on the market for people with type II diabetes who are unable to
achieve good glycemic control with common oral therapies. Exenatide once weekly
is co-developed by Amylin, Eli Lilly and Alkermes. 

PFE Makes Big Bet on Alzheimer`s

Spending on the research and development of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) treatment
and prevention has grown significantly over the last 20 years. The aging
baby-boom generation has resulted in a larger population of people at risk for
developing the disease. 

This, coupled with recent advances in developing drugs that address the
underlying cause of the disease versus just treating its symptoms, have been the
catalysts for the recent accelerated interest in AD research. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:
PFE), through partnering arrangements, has been one of the leaders of these
efforts.

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:

Get the most recent insight from Zacks Equity Research with the free Profit from

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

PALM Pre Trade Reports

Trade and press reports are speculating that Palm, Inc. (NASDAQ: PALM) will
release a downsized, cheaper version of the Pre phone code named the Pixie.
Other reports suggest that Palm will not release the Pre in May as speculated
but will wait until June 7. 

iSupply, a major consulting firm, has suggested that the Pre will cost $170 to
produce. Research In Motion's (NASDAQ: RIMM) gross margin for fiscal 2009 was
46%, suggesting that the selling price of the Pre could be $300 or more. 

Hain Celestial Weathers Storm

Yesterday after the close, The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: HAIN)
reported results for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 ending March 31, 2009.
Despite the very tough quarter being the second consecutive below expectations
quarter, we maintain our Buy rating on the stock. 

Hain Celestial has weathered the perfect storm, and not only survived but
prospered. Despite multiple headwinds, sales increased. And on an operating
basis, the company was profitable. 

Sony Looks to Challenge Wii

The trade press has reported that Sony Corp. (NYSE: SNE) will introduce motion
sensor capabilities in the PlayStation 3 that may be introduced at E3 in June.
Although Sony does offer a DualShock 3 wireless controller as an accessory for
the PS3, the new controller is rumored to be better than the current Nintendo
Wii system. 

Nintendo is still the leading seller of game consoles with its two products with
the Xbox from Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) being third and the PS3 and PlayStation
Portable being fourth and fifth. Nintendo's growth in Wii sales is flattening as
there is a shortage of new games and the whole industry is suffering due to the
current economy.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. on Thursday released a Facebook application that it says is the first that lets users upload videos straight from their phone -- in this case, Windows Mobile 6 smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The free app, dubbed Facebook, can be downloaded from the Windows Mobile Web site, or directly from users' mobile Web browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to video and picture uploads, users can send messages or call people on their Friends lists, manage their Facebook profile, confirm Friend requests, update their status and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another app, ThumbLink, from the small Ohio developer Wugland, already enabled Windows Mobile users to upload pictures to Facebook, but not videos. And Thumblink is not free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A version of Microsoft's Facebook app for the new Windows Mobile 6.5 operating system will be available later this year, according to a Microsoft press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has a small stake in Facebook and a large-scale Web advertising and search deal with the popular social network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is also preparing a similar free MySpace app this summer, which Korean handset maker LG Electronics Inc. has already agreed to preload on its Windows Mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG/LOS ANGELES May 8 (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co
(DIS.N) is close to agreeing to invest more capital in Hong
Kong Disneyland and allow the island's government convert its
loans to equity to maintain its majority share of the theme
park, a source involved in their talks said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; If Disney and Hong Kong's government, which now owns 57
percent of the underperforming and much-maligned resort, can
close a deal, it could pave the way for an expansion that is
estimated to cost HK$3 billion ($387 million) and boost
flagging attendance at the nearly four-year-old park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Hong Kong government put up the bulk of the estimated
total investment of $3.6 billion to develop and build the
310-acre (126 hectare) resort at Penny's Bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source, who declined to be identified because the
negotiations have not been made public, told Reuters however
that Hong Kong's government will not budge on two points: the
need to retain equity control of the project, and a refusal to
put up any more cash for the park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Hong Kong government might reduce its holdings, but
still retain a majority shareholding. That's the bottomline,"
said the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Top Disney executives met with Financial Secretary John
Tsang in Los Angeles last week, triggering speculation that the
two partners were close to hammering out an agreement after
years of back-and-forth over China's first Disney themepark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hong Kong officials and Disney executives have said their
recent talks had broken fresh ground and they would announce
details soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney spokeswoman Tasia Fillippatos had no comment, saying
the No. 1 U.S. entertainment company is "not going to negotiate
the deal through the press."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Critics say the Hong Kong site is too small to attract the
repeat visits that have made Disney's other parks profitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Attendance has failed to reach initial bullish projections,
despite the park's proximity to mainland China, and the Chinese
tourist market has since been hit by the economic crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The proposed expansion plans would enlarge the park's
existing area by around a third, a source told Reuters and
feature three new "lands" to complement the four existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney has also signed a framework agreement with
authorities in Shanghai to build a park there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources say that the Hong Kong government isn't willing to
surrender its controlling stake given pressure from the Hong
Kong public, and especially the city's legislators who have
final say on whether to approve the deal.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N), JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) and several other big U.S. banks said they were in a position to quickly repay Treasury capital injections after regulators released bank stress test results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officials assessed the financial strength of 19 financial institutions to see how much capital they would need over the next two years to survive a deep and extended recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of banks were found to have sufficient capital, paving the way for them to repay capital injected by the Treasury under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the money provided critical support during the darkest days of last year's financial crisis, it also carried restrictions, including limits on bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which passed the test, said it believed it had met all requirements and was "highly confident that we will soon repay the government's investment from the TARP's Capital Purchase Program."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares, down 4 percent during regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange trade, rose 2 percent after the results of the stress tests were announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which received $10 billion in TARP funds, last month announced the sale of $5 billion of common stock and $2 billion of debt that was not guaranteed by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also believes it is eligible to repay the $25 billion it has received in taxpayer money, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on a conference call with analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will be in that process as soon as we can," said Dimon, who has repeatedly said that the bank did not want to take the funds in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in the second largest U.S. bank sank more than 5 percent to $35.24 in regular trading and climbed slightly after hours to $35.85.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, even as it was directed to boost capital by $1.8 billion, said it too expected to repay its $10 billion in TARP funds "as soon as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan announced it would sell $2 billion in stock and $3 billion in 5- and 10-year notes not guaranteed by the FDIC. The debt sale is "multiple times" oversubscribed, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley shares, down 4.8 percent in regular trading, fell another 1.4 percent after the bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of banks that were found to be adequately capitalized also rushed to say they wanted to free themselves of the Treasury as an investor as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Express Co (AXP.N), Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N), State Street Corp (STT.N), U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) and BBT Corp (BBT.N) said they would seek to repay TARP as soon as they were permitted by regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup (C.N), which was found to have a $5.5 billion capital shortfall, said it would repay the $45 billion it got from Treasury as soon as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of American Express, which received $3.4 billion in TARP funds, rose 3 percent in after-market trade after it was deemed adequately capitalized by the stress test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, federal officials said TARP recipients had to prove they had sufficient capital, could issue common stock and sell long-term debt without government guarantees before they could seek to return the TARP money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Street, down 3.3 percent in regular trading, also passed the test and its shares rose 8.8 percent in after-hours trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Elinor Comlay; Editing by Ted Kerr, Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Says has met all requirements to repay $10 billion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Preferred shares have 5 pct interest rate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Joseph A. Giannone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 7 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
said on Thursday it expected to repay "soon" the U.S.
Treasury's $10 billion capital investment in the bank after it
passed the government's bank stress test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government, which assessed the financial strength of 19
large U.S. financial institutions, determined that Goldman
would require no additional capital over the next two years
even if financial markets became severely challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said in a statement after the release of the stress
test results that it believed it had met all requirements for
repaying $10 billion of capital injected by the Treasury last
fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That investment, part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program
(TARP), came with several restrictions, including on bonus
pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank said it was "highly confident that we will soon
repay the government's investment from the TARP's Capital
Purchase Program."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, Goldman announced the sale of $5 billion of
stock and $2 billion of debt that was not guaranteed by the
U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For months, Goldman has told investors it had plenty of
capital, did not need the TARP money and was eager to repay the
preferred securities, which have a 5 percent interest rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, federal officials said TARP recipients had to
prove they had sufficient capital, could issue common stock and
sell debt without government guarantees before they could seek
to return the TARP money.

conducting our business."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) - We are pleased that the Federal
Reserve`s Supervisory Capital Assessment Program has been completed. We view it
as an important step to restoring investor confidence and financial stability. 

As regulators have stated, underlying the stress test`s methodology was a very
conservative set of assumptions on potential revenues and losses in a more
adverse market scenario than the already challenging environment. 

With respect to Goldman Sachs, the test determined that the firm does not
require further capital. 

After a review of the repayment conditions issued by the Federal Reserve and the
Treasury, we believe that we have met all of the requirements stipulated and are
highly confident that we will soon repay the government`s investment from the
TARP`s Capital Purchase Program. 

The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is a leading global financial services firm
providing investment banking, securities and investment management services to a
substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial
institutions, governments and high-net-worth individuals. Founded in 1869, the
firm is headquartered in New York and maintains offices in London, Frankfurt,
Tokyo, Hong Kong and other major financial centers around the world.

&lt;p&gt;Company`s Tier 1 Common Ratio at 7.3% as of 3/31/09; Would Remain Well in Excess
of Government`s 4.0% Buffer Level under More Adverse Scenario

Tier 1 Capital of 11.4% as of 3/31/09 (9.3% Excluding Tarp) Also Would Remain
Very Strong under Government Scenario
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) confirmed today that it has completed the U.S.
Government`s Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP), which determined
that JPMorgan Chase`s capital position would remain strong under far more highly
stressed conditions than exist today, and that there is no need for the company
to raise additional capital at this time. 

JPMorgan Chase`s existing strong capital base and loan-loss reserves, together
with its significant pretax, pre-provision earnings power, would enable it to
weather adverse scenarios envisioned by SCAP, while still maintaining very
strong capital ratios. JPMC`s ratios under SCAP would remain very strong even
when excluding TARP preferred stock. Importantly, the company believes it could
handle a substantially worse environment than the Government`s adverse
conditions, even though the company is not expecting such a scenario. 

Specifically, JPMorgan Chase`s Tier 1 Capital Ratio is 11.4% -- or 9.3%
excluding TARP -- as of March 31, 2009. The company`s Tier 1 Common Ratio is
7.3% as of March 31, 2009, which is well in excess of the Government`s 4.0%
buffer level, and would remain so even under more highly adverse scenarios. 

Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "JPMorgan Chase has
worked hard to maintain its fortress balance sheet and strong capital position
in this challenging environment." He added, "We are committed to supporting
healthy economic growth and to doing our part to help our country through these
tough times. In particular, we remain committed to safe and sound lending and to
being a responsible corporate citizen. In the first quarter of this year alone,
JPMorgan Chase lent more than $150 billion to consumers, small businesses,
non-profits, municipalities, corporations and others." 

JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) is a leading global financial services firm
with assets of $2.1 trillion and operations in more than 60 countries. The firm
is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers, small
business and commercial banking, financial transaction processing, asset

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON May 7 (Reuters) - The U.S. economy may be at the
bottom of its current downturn, but is unlikely to rebound
substantially before the end of this year, the chief executive
of Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "I do think that it'll take most of 2009 before we get all
of this behind us," said David O'Reilly, chief executive
officer of the second-largest U.S. oil company. "There is some
sense that we are skating along near the bottom in some places
and I hear people talking about green shoots, but as long as
unemployment continues to rise, I think it will be hard to see
consumer confidence build enough to have a sustained recovery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Reilly told the Boston College Chief Executives Club that
he believes it will be years before the world can develop
sufficient alternative sources of energy to offset its current
reliance on fossil fuels including oil, natural gas and coal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like other major oil producers, Chevron has been scrambling
to cut costs following the collapse of oil prices from a
historic high near $150 a barrel last summer. U.S. light crude
oil futures CLc1 were trading up 2 percent at $57.44 on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron is the second-largest U.S. oil company behind Exxon
Mobil Corp (XOM.N).

&lt;p&gt;Positive Pay Service Confirms Check Information to Prevent Check Fraud;
Employees Benefit from More Check Cashing Locations Nationwide
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
J.P. Morgan`s Treasury Services business, a full-service provider of cash
management, trade finance and treasury solutions, today announced enhanced check
cashing services for its check disbursement clients. Employees of these clients
will be able to cash payroll checks at Wal-Mart stores (NYSE: WMT) which will
utilize the client`s Positive Pay information to confirm the validity of checks
presented for payment. This will provide protection against fraud and improve
daily account reconcilement. 

By offering its Positive Pay clients this protection at all Wal-Mart locations
in 46 states, J.P. Morgan has significantly expanded its non-bank branch check
cashing footprint while maintaining security for its clients. Additionally,
clients can continue to take advantage of Positive Pay check cashing services
offered at all Chase branches. 

"Using Positive Pay, clients gain important fraud protection on payroll checks
issued to employees," explained Iqbal M. Khan, executive director, J.P. Morgan
Treasury Services. "Fraudsters continue to see checks as an easy target for
theft. It is critical that the financial community remain vigilant when it comes
to making fraud mitigation tools available. We take our responsibility to help
clients protect their assets very seriously and are pleased to be able to extend
the availability of this service." 

Employees of J.P. Morgan clients can cash checks at dedicated check cashing
windows at participating Wal-Mart retail locations. Checks are electronically
scanned when presented at Wal-Mart, and using J.P. Morgan`s Positive Pay
service, the check is verified against the check issue information provided by
the client. The client`s account reconcilement data is updated by J.P. Morgan
throughout the day with the information gathered as checks are cashed. 

J.P. Morgan`s Positive Pay service enables Wal-Mart`s check cashing employees to
quickly validate that a payroll check is legitimate. Cashiers are notified
electronically if there is a discrepancy, preventing checks from being
fraudulently cashed. If a check is not validated, an error message is
transmitted electronically to the Wal-Mart employee. The check is returned to
the presenter along with a phone number to call for resolution. 

"We are pleased to be working with J.P. Morgan to offer Positive Pay protection
to their clients, providing a safe and secure way for their employees to cash
their payroll checks," stated Scott Sandlin, Senior Director Money Services,
Wal-Mart. "Our service allows employees to take advantage of lower cost check
cashing fees and a greater number of locations where they can cash their checks.
Wal-Mart will benefit from an increase in foot traffic to our stores." 

Wal-Mart makes check cashing services available at all its retail locations
except in New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Connecticut. 

J.P. Morgan`s Positive Pay service is part of the bank`s overall payment fraud
prevention services which include:

* Account Reconciliation - Reduces the time and expense associated with
reconciling outstanding or paid checks 
* ACH Transaction Review - Review and confirm ACH debit and credit transactions
online and return unauthorized transactions on a case-by-case basis 
* Maximum Dollar Amount - Allows unpaid checks to automatically be returned if
they exceed a given dollar limit, or enables or allows decisions to be made on
paying or returning checks 
* Payee Verification - Enhances traditional Positive Pay by identifying
potential fraudulent checks when the payee name has been changed 
* Reverse Positive Pay - Enables customers to identify payment discrepancies and
advise the bank of return instructions 
* Stale-Dating - Lets clients determine the number of days after a check was
issued that it may be honored, opt to return expired checks automatically, and
make decisions on paying or returning checks

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 7 (Reuters) - New York's top legal officer
asked Chevron Corp (CVX.N) to disclose information to
shareholders about its potential liability for pollution in
Ecuador, but the company said it had "communicated fully" with
stockholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In a letter dated May 4, New York State Attorney General
Andrew Cuomo referred to a lawsuit on behalf of thousands of
Amazon rain forest residents charging the oil company with
environmental and health damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said shareholders had complained to his office regarding
Chevron's disclosures of the potential litigation risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given the fact that both New York State and New York City
public pension funds hold substantial Chevron shares and that
many New Yorkers are also shareholders (including Amnesty
International USA), this office has an interest in ensuring
that public statements about the litigation are accurate and
complete," Cuomo's letter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Shareholders also have a right to know what contingencies,
if any, have been taken by Chevron in recognition of a possible
adverse ruling in the litigation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said in a statement that the company, the
second-largest oil company in the United States, had received
the letter and would respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We presume the inquiry is a result of a campaign by the
American trial lawyers behind this case that seeks to pressure
Chevron into a settlement," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have communicated fully with stockholders about the
Ecuador case and we will continue to do so in the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Ecuadorean plaintiffs believe Chevron is liable for
pollution from oil wells and pipelines built mostly in the
1970s by Texaco Inc, which was bought by Chevron in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A judge in Ecuador is hearing the case and he could order
the company to pay damages of about $27 billion.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) is looking at growth opportunities through government-assisted acquisitions of troubled institutions, despite the obstacle posed by deposit caps, said Oppenheimer and Co analysts, who met JPMorgan's chief financial officer earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysts noted that JPMorgan's $2.1 trillion in assets accounted for 17 percent of the $12.1 trillion in assets in the Federal Reserve system, and that all the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) depository institutions combined have just $13.8 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oppenheimer analysts, including Chris Kotowksi, questioned CFO Mike Cavanagh on whether authorities would allow JPMorgan to grow given its "huge size."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cavanagh acknowledged that deposit caps were an obstacle to growth, but added it would not be in the case of an assisted acquisition of a troubled institution, analysts wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By being patient, well capitalized and supportive, JPMorgan probably remains a favored 'go to' solution for regulators in solving other problem situations when otherwise their size might have started to become a constraint," they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares were down about 4 percent at $35.86 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tenzin Pema in Bangalore; Editing by Anil D'Silva)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as the world economy languishes, Microsoft is putting an increasing focus on its research efforts in areas well beyond its traditional desktop and office software domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New research can take up 15 years before it is incorporated into a product, so Microsoft needs to be ready when the economy comes back, said Andrew Herbert, managing director of Microsoft's research facility in Cambridge, England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company employs about 1,000 researchers across its five labs in the U.S., U.K., India and China and is adding around 80 people a year, nearly the same number of people as many universities' computer science departments, Herbert said. It expects to spend US$9 billion this year on research and development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Microsoft opened the doors of its U.K. facility, the Roger Needham Building at the University of Cambridge. The open house had a sort of science-fair feel to it, with researchers on hand near displays describing what they've been working on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commercial prospects for many of the innovations remain fuzzy, and none of the technologies will necessarily be on the market any time soon. Microsoft's researchers work quite separate from the company's product developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for researchers to come up with innovations that will put a smile on CEO Steve Ballmer's face, Herbert said. Ballmer is probably already smiling, as many of the lab's projects show promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are few of the most interesting:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somniloquy: Most of Microsoft's research efforts are in software, but one of the more exotic displays from Wednesday was Somniloquy, a raw-looking USB drive sticking out of a desktop PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somniloquy is the term for talking during sleep, which is essentially what it allows a PC to do. When PCs go into sleep mode, they lose the ability to communicate on networks. The only alternative is to leave the PC on, which constantly draws power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business users often leave their office PCs on overnight to allow remote file access, and consumers tend to leave them on for overnight BitTorrent downloads or constant VOIP presence, said James Scott, a Microsoft researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somniloquy lets a computer go to sleep yet maintain a presence on the network. It has an SD Card for memory, so it could continue to download or even share files. It can also maintain a VOIP connection, waking up the PC when a call comes in. Somniloquy can also wake up the PC if someone is trying to remotely access the machine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The power difference is astounding: Scott showed the desktop computer was consuming around 85 watts of power, but with Somniloquy, it consumes only around 4 watts. That small amount of power is used to maintain the DRAM state and power Somniloquy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Instead of having computers as all-on or all-off we want more finer-grained tiers of functionality in the computer so that when the user is not there you don't need the graphics card on, you don't need the CPU on," Scott said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to run BitTorrent or VOIP, Somniloquy would need to run application "stubs," or a stripped-down versions of an application with no user interface but capable of handling network protocols, Scott said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Microsoft doesn't make networking hardware, Somniloquy might be more appropriate for companies such as Intel or Broadcom to produce, Scott said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HomeWatcher: Microsoft's HomeWatcher is a small application that shows the amount of data downloaded and uploaded by users of a particular PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers often don't have an easy way to monitor their broadband usage, which can cause frustration when broadband connections may not be working well, said Tim Regan, a research software development engineer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You don't want to know about your central heating unless you're bloody freezing -- then you do," Regan said. "It's those moments. One side of it is how do we apportion blame among ourselves. The other side is how do we become more sophisticated in what we're asking for."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As demand for bandwidth and overall broadband data consumption increases, Regan said HomeWatcher could prompt more inquisitive questions from consumers over how they manage their network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later this month, Microsoft plans to trial HomeWatcher in a few homes. Those testers will likely be able to mount a small screen near their computer that shows the data or can opt to use a desktop, Flash-based widget, Regan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everest: This software application allows the redirection of input and output calls from one server to another. One of the advantages is that Everest allows a disk that is receiving lots of write requests to allow another disk to handle that load, either on the same server or one nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"During a period of high load, the normal system can only really get about 100 requests per second for this particular brand of disk, whereas if you enable Everest, then we can get up to 200 requests per second," said Austin Donnelly, a research software design engineer. "That's quite an improvement in the request rate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data that is written to another server is eventually copied back to the original file server, Donnelly said. "You can think of it as opportunistic use of spare resources," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everest also can cut data-center energy use. Since Everest allows administrators to direct input and output calls, during certain times one server can be designated to handle all of them. The rest of the servers in the rack can then be shut down, Donnelly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been working on Everest for about two years and experimented with it on the company's SQL Server product. Donnelly said Everest is fairly mature, but no decision has been made yet about when or how it will become a product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'd love to see this in Windows 7 but this is a research project," Donnelly said.&lt;/p&gt;

How to Regularly Access Picks from the Zacks Rank Discovery for
Free:http://at.zacks.com/?id=88

Underlying the four free stock picks is a simple truth that first appeared in a
Financial Analysts Journal article published in 1979. Leonard Zacks, a Ph.D. in
Mathematics from M.I.T. found that "earnings estimate revisions are the most
powerful force impacting stock prices." Zacks #1 Rank is awarded to a stock when
analysts sharply upgrade their estimates of what the company will earn. 

Today, Zacks is promoting its stock recommendations by offering four daily picks
free to those who register at http://at.zacks.com/?id=88

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - U.S. banks will need about $130 billion in capital this year -- for the weaker banks to fill shortfalls and the stronger ones to repay government rescue funds, analysts at Goldman Sachs said, ahead of a release of banks' stress test results due later Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of the government's stress tests of the top 19 U.S. banks will show which banks need to raise capital to bolster their balance sheets should the economy weaken further in the years ahead. Results are expected to show about half the banks need more capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman analysts said their total capital need estimate for banks include $100 billion for weaker banks that need to raise capital to plug holes, and $30 billion for banks that may raise capital to repay funds from the Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, in an opinion piece in the New York Times on Thursday, said he expects banks will pay back more than the $25 billion of government rescue funds that he had previously estimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geithner also wrote that recently completed bank stress tests applied "exacting" loss estimates and conservative earnings estimates, an apparent rebuff to critics who have questioned whether the tests are tough enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman analysts said bank stocks were now "moving to the next phase."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investors are now looking to diluted, normalized, and discounted earnings with the assumption that stress test induced capital raises are both successful and credible and therefore banks will be able to absorb the losses to come," the analysts said. They upgraded Capital One Financial Corp to "buy," and Fifth Third Bancorp and American Express Co to "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysts downgraded SunTrust Banks Inc and Comerica Inc to "sell," and cut its rating on KeyCorp to "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tenzin Pema in Bangalore; Editing by Himani Sarkar)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &amp; A Defers Storage Purchases for Two Years, Improves Manageability of Physical
and Virtual Server Environment
SUNNYVALE, Calif. &amp; REDMOND, Wash.--(Business Wire)--
NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) and Microsoft Corp. today announced that A &amp; A Contract
Customs Brokers Ltd., a fast-growing customs and freight broker, has achieved
dramatic IT efficiency gains by using Windows Server 2008 with Hyper-V
technology and Microsoft System Center with NetApp storage solutions. 

A &amp; A provides customs and freight forwarding expertise to a large base of
international customers. By 2012, the company expects to grow at a rate of 20
percent per year by further expanding its services and opening an additional
five branch offices. As A &amp; A`s business continues to grow, so does its
information technology environment and the need for more storage and servers.
The acquisition of more servers and storage has led to increased IT costs and
server and storage sprawl in the company`s data center. As a result, A &amp; A
needed to transform its IT infrastructure to meet its planned growth and
business objectives. 

"Our antiquated direct-attached storage system was not meeting our growth and
management challenges," said Dan Morris, systems engineer at A &amp; A. "We were
continually adding more disk drives as a short-term solution to scale storage
capacity. And we desperately needed to consolidate our servers as well. While
server virtualization alleviated part of our problem, we still experienced disk
capacity issues that constrained our virtualized environment." 

A &amp; A needed a more scalable server and storage architecture that would unlock
the full potential of its virtualization environment. Therefore, the company
consolidated its server and storage infrastructure based on an end-to-end
virtualization solution with Microsoft Corp. and NetApp. 

A &amp; A consolidated multiple applications and significantly reduced its number of
physical servers using Windows Server 2008 with Hyper-V technologyand Microsoft
System Center. The consolidation project helped A &amp; A:

* Reduce the total number of servers required by nearly 60 percent to run
Microsoft Office SharePoint Server and eight proprietary applications 
* Administer both physical and virtual assets using the Microsoft System Center
suite of systems management tools 
* Improve overall system availability using the built-in clustering capabilities
of Windows Server 2008 to automate the failover of servers

Combined with NetApp storage efficiency technologies such as deduplication and
RAID-DP, A &amp; A was able to use less storage and better protect its valuable data
to achieve the following benefits:

* Reclaimed 70 percent of its storage capacity for Windows Server 2008 with
Hyper-V technologyand backup data from System Center Data Protection Manager
2007 
* Deferred the purchase of additional storage for up to 24 months by freeing
more than 25 percent of primary storage for reuse 
* Quadrupled retention times for disk-based backup data from one week to one
month to significantly bolster data protection and recovery efforts

"It didn`t take long for Microsoft and NetApp to win me over," continued Morris.
"The Microsoft virtualization and systems management solution provided greater
value operationally and reduced capital costs, while NetApp gave us the most
storage at the best value. I`ve had such a great experience that I`ve begun
recommending NetApp to other IT groups exploring server virtualization with
Microsoft. I always tell people I see no reason why anyone would choose anything
else but Microsoft and NetApp solutions for their IT infrastructure needs." 

"NetApp and Microsoft are delivering end-to-end virtualization solutions for IT
consolidation, site recovery, and remote offices," said Zane Adam, senior
director of Virtualization Strategy and Management at Microsoft. "NetApp
provides one of the best storage platforms to deliver integrated solutions in
conjunction with Windows Server 2008 with Hyper-V technology and Microsoft
System Center. Together we`re giving our customers innovative ways to help
reduce costs, and improve availability and efficiency." 

Customers such as A &amp; A rely on NetApp`s complete set of storage efficiency
technologies that are inherent in its Data ONTAP operating system, including
deduplication, thin provisioning, RAID-DP, and Snapshot technology, to improve
storage efficiency and dramatically simplify data management of their virtual
server environments. Customers that deploy NetApp with Windows Server 2008 with
Hyper-V technologycan enhance protection of their data assets, buy less storage,
and reduce their overall power, space, and cooling costs in their data centers. 

"A &amp; A is an excellent example of how our customers are reducing their storage
requirements by 50-70 percent using our storage efficiency technologies," said
Patrick Rogers, vice president of Solutions Marketing at NetApp. "We understand
the challenges our customers are facing to do more with less and reduce costs
and unplanned downtime. Microsoft`s server virtualization platform gives
customers a powerful solution to consolidate their IT infrastructure. Together,
we`re helping customers maximize the value of their storage and servers in their
virtualized environments. NetApp will even guarantee that customers will use
less storage as part of our Virtualization Guarantee* Program." 

NetApp`s Virtualization Guarantee Program enables customers to take advantage of
NetApp`s guarantee that they will use 50 percent less storage in their virtual
environments with NetApp storage compared to traditional storage arrays.
Alternatively, for customers that already own other select storage systems,
NetApp will reduce redundant copies of their primary data by at least 35 percent
with NetApp V-Series. For more information, visit www.netapp.com/guarantee.

&lt;p&gt;SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today confirmed a discovery within the
Moho-Bilondo license in the Republic of the Congo. 

The Moho Nord Marine-4 well, in which Chevron Overseas (Congo) Limited holds a
31.5 percent interest, is located approximately 46 miles (75 kilometers)
offshore of the Republic of the Congo, in 3,537 feet (1,078 meters) of water in
the northern part of the Moho-Bilondo license. 

George Kirkland, Chevron executive vice president, Global Upstream and Gas,
said, "This exciting discovery emphasizes the future potential of this region in
which Chevron and its partners have already made significant energy investments,
including the Moho-Bilondo project." 

Moho Nord Marine-4 was drilled to a total depth of 13,907 feet (4,239 meters)
and proved a 535 foot (163 meter) column of high-quality oil flowing at 8,100
barrels per day. 

The discovery follows two previous successful exploration wells, Moho Nord
Marine-1 and 2, drilled in the permit area in 2007, and the positive appraisal
well Moho Nord Marine-3 in 2008. 

The permit area`s deepwater Moho-Bilondo project, which began production April
2008, consists of subsea well clusters that flow into a floating processing
unit. Maximum total daily production of 90,000 barrels of crude oil is expected
in 2010. 

Chevron's partners on the permit area are Soci&#233;t&#233; Nationale des P&#233;troles du
Congo (15 percent) and Total E Congo (operator and 53.5 percent). 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company`s success is
driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and other energy products; manufactures and sells
petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides
energy efficiency solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future,
including biofuels and other renewables. Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif.

&lt;p&gt; (adds quote, Reuters' survey on May refinery runs)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING May 7 (Reuters) - Sinopec Corp's (0386.HK) expanded
240,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) Fujian refinery, a joint venture
with Saudi Aramco and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), started pumping
crude into its new facility late April, an industry source told
Reuters on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The refinery, part of a $5 billion venture that includes a
petrochemical complex, was expected to reach normal operating
rates as early as July, said the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The start-up, delayed from the last quarter of 2008, comes as
Chinese state refiners are enjoying improved refining margins
under a new fuel-pricing system and earlier ballooned fuel stocks
have thinned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is no more reason for further delay, except that the
plant has to watch out for domestic fuel demand and how the
economic situation is evolving to decide on operation ratios when
it passes the test period," said the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Top refiner Sinopec Corp, which owns 50 percent of the
venture, has planned regular maintenance this month at several
major plants such as Zhenhai and Guangzhou to allow for the new
refinery to start runs. [ID:nSP398110]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil and Aramco each own 25 percent of the venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among recent signs of recovery in oil demand, diesel stocks
held by the country's top two oil conmpanies fell 16 percent in
March from February, while gasoline dropped 20 percent, a
newsletter run by Xinhua reported, the first major decrease after
China amassed brimming stocks ahead of 2008 Beijing Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China is also seen topping up crude stocks with its main
ports bringing in 9 percent more foreign crude in April than a
year earlier in its first increase this year, a paper run by the
Ministry of Communications said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Chen Aizhu; Editing by Chris Lewis)

&lt;p&gt; * SEC to take action against JPMorgan over county loans&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Jefferson County commissioner welcomes SEC decision
 (Adds comment from Republican party)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Melinda Dickinson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BIRMINGHAM, Ala., May 8 (Reuters) - Jefferson County,
Alabama on Friday hailed a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission decision to file an enforcement action against
JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) over bond swap sales to the county.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SEC decision was disclosed by JPMorgan on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; County commissioners Jim Carns and Sheila Smoot, part of a
five-person body, welcomed the decision as did Republican U.S.
Representative Spencer Bachus of Alabama, the ranking member of
the House Financial Services Committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I am extraordinarily encouraged by the SEC approval of an
enforcement action against JPMorgan Chase  Co for securities
law violations over bond and swap sales for Jefferson County,"
said Carns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smoot said the precise impact of the move was hard to
gauge, adding: "I do hope it brings us some relief."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jefferson County has spent more than a year fighting to
stave off what would be the largest municipal bankruptcy in
U.S. history over its $3.2 billion sewer debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The county accumulated the debt to JPMorgan and seven other
creditors through interest and credit swaps earlier this decade
but it has spiraled since February 2008 when ratings agencies
downgraded Jefferson's insurers, prompting county bonds to
plummet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said late Thursday the SEC is planning to take
action against the bank for alleged violations of securities
rules in the sale of bond and interest swaps to Jefferson
County in 2002 and 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a regulatory filing, JPMorgan said the enforcement
action also alleges that it violated rules created by the
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, the main regulator for
the municipal bond market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The firm has been engaged in discussions with the SEC
Staff in an attempt to resolve the matter prior to litigation,"
said the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jefferson County is negotiating with creditors, including
JPMorgan, to restructure its debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; REVENUE PLANS THWARTED?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How far any charges affect talks depends in part on the
nature of the charges, said Melissa Woodley, assistant
professor of finance at Samford University in Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "From the bargaining point of view, this cannot hurt
Jefferson County's position. The fact that there are ... fraud
allegations against JPMorgan should be advantageous to the
county," said Woodley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the county's position was hurt by the apparent failure
of the state legislature to pass laws that could help raise
revenue for the county, said Woodley, who follows the debt
situation closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In particular, it could jeopardize a deal under which the
county's debt would be reduced by $1.3 billion if additional
revenues were raised through a sales tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More than one year into negotiations to stave off
bankruptcy it was still "difficult to handicap" whether the
county would be successful, in part because with every passing
month interest payments continue to accrue, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jefferson County had hoped that the state legislature would
pass into law this week bills to levy an occupational tax and a
sales tax on the county to provide revenue to run its affairs
and to address the sewer debt respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That revenue would also have given the county leverage in
its negotiations with major creditors, who in turn were pushing
for the taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the 1 cent sales tax never reached the floor of the
legislature in the state capital in Montgomery, and the
occupational tax went to the state Senate and is now back in
the House for further consideration, Representative John Rogers
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It looks increasingly unlikely that the state legislature
will pass the bills during this session, which ends May 18,
dealing a blow to the county's efforts, analysts said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 8 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
director Stephen Friedman, who quit as Federal Reserve Bank of
New York chairman on Thursday amid conflict-of-interest
questions, said on Friday he did not break any rules, nor did
he have inside information about Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Friedman, who served as senior partner of Goldman Sachs 
Co in the early 1990s, was the subject of a Wall Street Journal
story that raised questions about his ties to Goldman at the
same time he served on the board of the powerful regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I followed the rules as I always have," he said during the
Goldman annual shareholder meeting on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As Lehman Brothers collapsed and credit markets churned,
Goldman sought and quickly received Fed approval to become a
bank holding company. The new status meant Goldman answered to
the Fed, but also enjoyed permanent access to federal funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Friedman, a Goldman director since 2005, continued to sit
on the New York Fed's board, where he was a "public" director
and its chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This week the Wall Street Journal reported on Friedman's
purchases of Goldman stock in December and again in January.
During that period, the U.S. Treasury and the Fed were drafting
plans to bolster the nation's big banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Normally, a New York Fed director is not allowed to buy
stock in a member bank, but the New York Fed requested -- and
the Federal Reserve's board of governors approved -- a waiver
that would let Friedman hold both posts for another year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New York Fed also concluded Friedman's purchases of Goldman
stock did not violate the Fed's rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It was a very tempestuous time" and a period when New York
Fed president Timothy Geithner was widely expected to leave and
join the Obama administration, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That board didn't want to lose its president and its
chairman at the same time. I felt it was my obligation to
continue to serve," Friedman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Friedman had 111,516 Goldman shares, according to the
firm's proxy statement on March 9, currently worth $154.5
million. Friedman said the recent purchases were vetted by the
New York Fed and by Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Friedman, 71, denied he benefited from any kind of insider
information about Goldman from his role on the New York Fed.
Fed board members, he said, do not get involved in the
supervision of individual banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I bought the Goldman stock because I thought that Goldman
trading below tangible net worth was attractively priced. I
also thought it was not a bad time at all for a director in the
company to stand up and show that confidence by putting his
money where his mouth was," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Friedman's comments came in response to heated accusations
from investor Evelyn Davis. At the onset of the meeting, she
called for Friedman's ouster from the Goldman board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Mr. Friedman, I think you should right now pack up your
bags get out of this meeting, never to be seen again anywhere
on Goldman property," said Davis. "You are a shame and disgrace
to the board."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein defended Friedman
as he took issue with Davis' outburst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Steve Friedman is accused of no wrongdoing. No wrongdoing
at all. He has been a credit to our board and in every
situation," Blankfein said. "If you read the Federal Reserve
press release, he did nothing in slightest bit wrong or
untoward or unclear. Everything was above board and visible."

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
There has been a powerful surge in option trading on Exxon Mobil Corporation
(NYSE: XOM) this afternoon. The stock has seen 179,948 contracts cross the tape,
which is 3.8 times the equity's average trading volume of 47,034 contracts.
According to data from WhatsTrading.com, 89.5% of this volume has traded on the
call side. 

The May 65 call has seen the bulk of the action, as more than 100,400 contracts
have changed hands on open interest of only 17,268 contracts. It appears to be a
pretty safe assumption that the bulk of today's action represents new positions.
The option had two blocks of 50,000 contracts change hands at $5.70.
Unfortunately, the blocks were marked "late," making it impossible to determine
if they crossed at the bid or ask price.

&lt;p&gt;Elderly Man in Ecuador`s Rainforest Becomes Target of Global Internet Attacks
Fostered by Oil Giant
LAGO AGRIO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
Yes, the scientific evidence at trial in Ecuador proves that the freshwater well
at the house of Manuel Salinas in Ecuador`s Amazon -- featured on 60 Minutes on
Sunday -- is contaminated with toxic carcinogens. Sorry, Chevron, but Mr.
Salinas knows more than you do about his own well. 

Salinas, a long-suffering elderly man in Ecuador`s rainforest who was featured
on the broadcast Sunday, has been targeted by Chevron in a web-based global
misinformation campaign that claims the well from where he gets his drinking
water is free of oil-related contamination. He lived with his family and some
chickens for more than twenty-five years next to an enormous toxic waste pit
built by Texaco in 1974 that still oozes its contents into the surrounding soils
and groundwater, as reported by the broadcast network and confirmed by trial
evidence. 

In the broadcast, Mr. Salinas - one of thousands of Ecuadorians suing the oil
giant for $27 billion in damages -- complained to correspondent Scott Pelley
that the water in his well was contaminated and smelled of oil. 

Chevron has since claimed, in messages repeated on the internet by several
right-wing bloggers, that evidence in the trial shows that the water well on Mr.
Salinas` land is not contaminated with hydrocarbons. 

Chevron is wrong, according to the definitive report on the trial evidence
prepared by an independent, court-appointed expert who reviewed more than 62,000
chemical sampling results produced as evidence by both parties. 

A water sample taken in the trial directly from Mr. Salinas` freshwater well
showed toxic levels of likely carcinogens and harmful heavy metals that are
derived from oil, including benzo[a]pyrene, indeno[1,2,3]pyrene, and cadmium.
The U.S. government, has determined that each of these chemicals are likely or
probable carcinogens, as reflected in a toxic substance registry maintained at
the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. 

The oil drilling site next to Salinas` house, called Shushufindi 38, was built
by Texaco and closed by the company without any remediation long before it
stopped operating in Ecuador in 1990. Petroleum hydrocarbon levels found in soil
samples taken in and around the waste pit were as high as 476,528 ppm, or 4,760
times than maximum amounts permitted under relevant U.S. law. 

"The pollution in the entire area where Mr. Salinas lives is comparable to many
Superfund sites in the U.S.," said Douglas Beltman, the scientific advisor to
the local communities and a former EPA official. "Chevron should be ashamed of
itself for attacking this defenseless man instead of cleaning up the pollution
it left behind, which Mr. Salinas has been forced to live with." 

Chevron has also tried to claim the oil well next to Mr. Salinas` house is the
property of Petroecuador, Ecuador`s state-owned oil company. In fact, the well
was never used by Petroecuador for oil production, only by Texaco. Texaco was
solely responsible for the design, construction, operation, and closure of the
waste pits around Salinas` home and will be held responsible for cleaning it
should the communities win the lawsuit. 

Chevron purchased Texaco in 2001 and will be responsible for any liability
assessed in the case. The trial is expected to end later this year.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein offered shareholders a guardedly optimistic forecast for economic recovery, saying investors are now talking about when, not if, markets will rebound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"My hope is, and if I had to guess I'd say, that business feels like it's off its lowest ebb," Blankfein said at the bank's annual shareholder meeting, a day after Goldman (GS.N) received a clean bill of health from the U.S. government stress tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former commodities trader hedged his comments, though, telling shareholders, "It's hard to make those kinds of forecasts. You have to make them every minute, because markets are so volatile."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein said Goldman, which slashed its ranks of bankers and traders amid one of the worst market environments since the Great Depression, does not plan to make further job cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have no plans on the horizon for downsizing, but we'll respond to the environment," he said. "We don't feel the pressure to downsize now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein told shareholders the tone of the markets had greatly brightened since the darkest days of last fall, when the government scrambled to avert the collapse of Goldman and other banks caught in a spiraling credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, he said, investors today are talking about an eventual recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are clearly in a very bad recession, but if you think about the rhetoric applied to the markets, that set of probabilities is vastly diminished," he said. The debate now is how soon will the economy bottom out, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The end is already in sight, in the sense we're talking about it, and we have some confidence we will reverse out of (the downturn). And that is what I think is making the markets cheerier than they have been for while, and which has surprised people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit markets have improved, as illustrated by Goldman, Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and other banks tapping bond markets without guarantees from the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is more reason for optimism, though it's not upbeat; it's sober," Blankfein said.

ABOUT THE MOVIE 

"Disney`s A Christmas Carol," a multi-sensory thrill ride re-envisioned by
Academy Award-winning filmmaker Robert Zemeckis, captures the fantastical
essence of the classic Dickens tale in a groundbreaking, performance-capture 3D
motion picture event. Ebeneezer Scrooge (Jim Carrey) begins the holiday with his
usual miserly contempt, barking at his faithful clerk (Gary Oldman) and his
cheery nephew (Colin Firth). But when the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and
Yet to Come take him on an eye-opening journey, revealing truths Old Scrooge is
reluctant to face, he must open his heart to undo years of ill will before it`s
too late. Through the magic of performance-capture technology, Jim Carrey
tackles seven roles, including Scrooge and all of the Christmas spirits.

&lt;p&gt;May 9 (Reuters) - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp
(9432.T) is expected to report a group operating profit of
roughly 1.1 trillion yen for fiscal 2008, down 16 percent from
the year before and nearly in line with an earlier outlook, the
Nikkei business daily said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; With Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) slipping into the red, the
telecommunications giant is now set to reclaim the No. 1 spot
among listed companies in terms of operating profit after a
six-year hiatus, the daily said without citing sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drop in operating profit stems from a boost the firm
enjoyed in fiscal 2007 on 317.6 billion yen gain from returning
a portion of pension assets to the government, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nikkei said excluding special factors, operating profit was
mostly flat and this was largely due to a 3 percent uptick in
operating profit at cellular phone service unit NTT DoCoMo Inc
(9437.T).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite cell phone sales slumping more than 20 percent in
unit terms, DoCoMo enjoyed an increase in operating profit
because of reduced commission fees paid to sales agents, the
paper said.

&lt;p&gt;From Sneak Peeks of Exclusive 3D Film Footage to Summertime Snow - Disney Pulls
out All the Whistle Stops for 40-City Traveling Experience

Departing Los Angeles May 22; Tour to Cover More Than 16,000 Miles
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Disney is pulling out all the whistle stops and taking its show on the road with
a spectacular immersive and interactive 40-city train tour including a 3D sneak
peek of film footage from the upcoming movie "Disney`s A Christmas Carol," it
was announced today (05/08/09) by Dick Cook, chairman, The Walt Disney Studios.
Set amidst a snowy backdrop-complete with all of the sights and sounds of
Christmas including carolers, decorations, giveaways and many more surprises in
each of the 40 cities-the Train Tour is being launched with HP on board as the
title and technology sponsor and driven by Amtrak. This family event is for
guests of all ages and is free to the public. 

Starring Jim Carrey and directed by Academy Award&#174;-winning filmmaker Robert
Zemeckis, "Disney`s A Christmas Carol" opens in theatres November 6 in Disney
Digital 3D and in IMAX 3D&#174;. 

Commenting on the announcement, Cook said, "`Disney`s A Christmas Carol` Train
Tour is an incredibly fun way to introduce families across the country to the
wonders and spectacle that is Robert Zemeckis` unique and spectacular new
holiday film. We are so proud of the movie, and think the 3D footage is so
incredible, we just had to give everyone a chance to see it in Disney Digital
3D. From Los Angeles to New York, and all points in between, guests are going to
have a fabulous time discovering things about the making of this extraordinary
film, participating in their own festive fantasies, and getting into the holiday
spirit all year round. `Disney`s A Christmas Carol` is great entertainment for
moviegoers of all ages, and this is the perfect introduction to a fun and
exciting new holiday classic." 

Among the highlights of the tour are authentic artifacts on loan from the
Charles Dickens Museum of London; artwork, costumes and props from the film;
demonstrations of performance capture technology; and a chance to morph your
face into one of the film`s characters using HP TouchSmart PCs. At each stop
along the way, a state-of-the-art Disney Digital 3D Theatre will be erected,
where guests can get a sneak peek of "Disney`s A Christmas Carol" and see other
exclusive behind-the-scenes materials from the movie. The latest details about
tour stops and scheduled events are available at
www.christmascaroltraintour.com. 

Featuring four custom-designed vintage rail cars full of behind-the-scenes
attractions, entertaining demonstrations, and fun activities, the tour will have
its inaugural stop at Los Angeles` Union Station over Memorial Day Weekend, from
May 22nd through May 25th. During the next 24 weeks, the train will make 40
stops in 36 states, as it travels its way across more than 16,000 miles of
track. The tour will finish at New York`s Grand Central Terminal over the
weekend of October 30th through November 1st. 

At every tour stop, Radio Disney will invite kids to enter for a chance to
become a Movie Surfer representing their hometown. Each Hometown Movie Surfer
will get a chance to appear on Disney Channel by filming their very own Movie
Surfer`s segment! They`ll also receive a prize package of exclusive Movie Surfer
and "Disney`s A Christmas Carol" gear. 

ABC television stations across the country will run local promotions. At each
stop, guests will have the chance to win an HP TouchSmart PC and an HP
Photosmart wireless printer. Additionally, Disney is working with the Boys &amp;
Girls Clubs of America organization to provide an early Christmas experience to
kids across the country. Disney will present the organization with a donation in
the amount of $100,000 at the May 21st launch in Los Angeles to further the
organization`s efforts of helping kids grow up to be great and will invite Boys
&amp; Girls Club kids to be part of the tour when it comes to their town. Boys &amp;
Girls Clubs throughout the nation are impacting the lives of 4.8 million young
people each year with after-school programs that emphasize education, career
exploration, community service, technology skills, financial literacy, the arts
and more to help them reach their full potential as productive, caring citizens.


A variety of innovative HP technologies helped to make the Train Tour possible.
HP ProLiant servers and HP ProCurve switches will provide Disney with the
computing power that will allow guests to collect and upload photos. Throughout
the train exhibits, Disney is using HP TouchSmart PCs to run an interactive face
morph application and HP monitors to showcase performance capture technology as
well as images and digital effects from the film. Additionally, each train car
will be wrapped with Disney`s Train Tour logo using the versatility of HP Scitex
printers. 

"For decades HP and Disney have joined together to captivate audiences through
technology innovation and digital entertainment," said Michael Mendenhall,
senior vice president and chief marketing officer, HP. "HP technology used in
the making of `Disney`s A Christmas Carol` has enabled Disney to push the
boundaries in performance capture technology. The Train Tour offers an
innovative way for guests to interact with HP`s latest technology and experience
the magic behind the film." 

Amtrak locomotives and engineers will lead the four-car Train Tour (plus a
private car), across the US, with stops ranging from 1-3 days along the way.
Each train station will be themed with holiday decorations, and feature artwork
from the film, Christmas Carolers, fun activities for the entire family, and
snow! 

"Rail travel continues to influence the way people connect with each other and
celebrating the release of a true classic is a perfect way to further that
connection," said Emmett Fremaux, Vice President Marketing and Product
Management, Amtrak. "We couldn`t be more thrilled to be teaming up with Walt
Disney Studios for this 40 city tour to help educate Americans about the benefit
of rail travel." 

Dolby Laboratories will be supplying its Dolby 3D Digital Cinema solution for
the traveling Digital 3D theater, and Barco is providing the DP2000 digital
projectors. Panasonic provides some of the latest high resolution large screen
technology available to consumers today throughout the train cars. And, the
Department of Transportation`s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is
encouraging guests traveling to and from the train to Buckle Up, Every Trip,
Every Time! 

ABOUT THE MOVIE 

"Disney`s A Christmas Carol," a multi-sensory thrill ride re-envisioned by
Academy Award-winning filmmaker Robert Zemeckis, captures the fantastical
essence of the classic Dickens tale in a groundbreaking, performance-capture 3D
motion picture event. Ebeneezer Scrooge (Jim Carrey) begins the holiday with his
usual miserly contempt, barking at his faithful clerk (Gary Oldman) and his
cheery nephew (Colin Firth). But when the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and
Yet to Come take him on an eye-opening journey, revealing truths Old Scrooge is
reluctant to face, he must open his heart to undo years of ill will before it`s
too late. Through the magic of performance-capture technology, Jim Carrey
tackles seven roles, including Scrooge and all of the Christmas spirits.

Exxon Mobil's fluid catalytic cracking unit at its 503,000
barrel-per-day refinery in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, was not
known as repairs and inspections continued, a state regulator
said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The unit will remain closed until repairs are done. Exxon
is using the downtime to inspect other expansion joints for
problems. It is unknown when the unit will be back up," said
Tim Beckstrom, a spokesman for Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The unit was shut down after a leak was noticed in the
expansion joint of the unit and the area evacuated. Nine people
were medically cleared after treatment for exposure symptoms to
carbon monoxide.

&lt;p&gt;Natural Habitat Adventures Offers Trips to See Polar Bears, Elephants and
Humpback Whales 
BOULDER, Colo.--(Business Wire)--
The new Disneynature documentary "Earth" follows three animal families - polar
bears, elephants and humpback whales - as they journey across the planet.
Travelers longing for a firsthand encounter with the movie`s wild species will
be interested in 5 small-group - and family-friendly - tours from award-winning
ecotour provider Natural Habitat Adventures (http://www.nathab.com) that visit
wildlife and habitats seen in the film: 

1. Remember the swimming elephants in "Earth"? Botswana`s Okavango Delta on the
"Expedition Botswana" African safari (www.nathab.com/africa/expedition-botswana)
was that life-giving oasis. See multitudes of elephants and more from private
camps deep in the bush on this 11-day adventure. 

2. An ice-bound wonderland 600 miles from the North Pole, Spitsbergen is the
largest island in the Svalbard archipelago and home to some 2,500 polar bears -
part of the polar bear footage in "Earth" was filmed in the archipelago. Cruise
along narrow fjords and towering glaciers on the "Spitsbergen: The European
Arctic" polar bear tour (www.nathab.com/expedition-voyages/spitsbergen). 

3. Polar bears mass in great numbers each fall near Churchill, Manitoba,
awaiting the freeze-up of Hudson Bay and seal-hunting season - providing
best-in-the-world polar bear tours. Special tundra vehicles provide intimate
wildlife access on four separate Churchill polar bear tours
(www.nathab.com/north). 

4. In "Earth," cute Adelie penguins coast over the ice. Experience penguins,
whales, seals, seabirds, indescribable landscapes and legendary history on the
"Classic Antarctica Expedition" (www.nathab.com/antarctica/classic-antarctica). 

5. "Earth" follows a mother humpback whale and her calf from their tropical
winter home all the way to Antarctica. Humpbacks also migrate north along the
Pacific coast to summer in Alaska. Kayak through waters where humpbacks play and
stalk the rare kermode bear on the "Spirit Bears and Humpback Whales of B.C."
tour (www.nathab.com/north/spirit-bears).

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Chemical announced that Arthur J. Sullivan, global vice president of
its Butyl Polymer business, will receive the International Institute of
Synthetic Rubber Producers` (IISRP) prestigious General Award at the group`s
annual meeting in New York City. 

The award ceremony, set for Tuesday, May 12, will help mark the 50th anniversary
of the IISRP, an international trade association whose corporate members produce
more than 90 percent of the world`s supply of synthetic rubber. The IISRP
meeting runs from May 11-14. 

Sullivan is being honored for his contributions to the industry and to the
continuing success of the IISRP. He became an IISRP director in 1998 and has
served as the Americas Section President and as a member of the Finance, Pension
and Audit Committee, the IISRP`s primary oversight body. 

With a degree in chemical engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology,
Sullivan began his career in the Polymer Laboratory of Exxon Research and
Engineering Co. in 1968. He joined ExxonMobil Chemical in 1973 with a position
in elastomer sales, and has since held a number of senior management positions.
He also is a director of Japan Butyl Co. Ltd. 

At the forefront of technology and innovation

ExxonMobil Chemical`s Butyl Polymers business has been at the forefront of
technology and innovation in the rubber industry for more than 70 years after
inventing and patenting butyl rubber in 1937. Today it is a world leader in
butyl technology, services and products, and markets high-quality synthetic
rubber polymers worldwide. 

ExxonMobil Chemical is a technology-driven company that continues to push both
process and product improvements to address the growth needs of the butyl rubber
industry. The company recently conducted a successful pilot plant demonstration
of next-generation butyl rubber that benefits from nanocomposite technology,
with the goal of doubling the number of tire innerliner applications that can be
served from existing halobutyl capacity. The company also is working with its
customers to develop a new material for tire innerliners, Exxcore DVA resin,
which sets the stage for lighter and more durable tires that hold air longer and
help reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.

&lt;p&gt;To accommodate a growing slate of nonfeature projects, Disney and Pixar will launch an animation studio in the fall in Vancouver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus will be on Pixar's established characters, including Buzz and Woody from the "Toy Story" films and Lightning McQueen and Mater from "Cars."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The operation will be small in size and dedicated to producing short-form quality computer animation for theme parks, DVDs, television and theatrical exhibition ... for several different divisions of the Walt Disney Co.," Disney/Pixar president Ed Catmull said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pixar general manager Jim Morris said he expects the staff to reach 75 to 100. He added that feature work and all stereoscopic 3-D work will still be done at Pixar's headquarters in Emeryville, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The venture is the latest example of a company opening a visual effects (VFX) or animation facility in Vancouver. Other residents include Rainmaker, an animation company; CIS Vancouver, a Deluxe-owned VFX business; and Moving Picture Co., a Technicolor-owned VFX facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tax incentives, a local talent base and proximity to Pixar contributed to the decision. Pixar will receive incentives offered for animation production and research and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Canada, and Vancouver specifically, has had terrific tax incentives for this type of work," Pixar general manager Jim Morris said. "I think they have a desire to grow this sort of business activity and get a critical mass. This will allow us to do more with the budgets that we have."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris said Pixar would step up production of its character-based ancillary content at the new venue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a somewhat unfulfilled demand," he said. "We wanted to do various things with 'Toy Story' to keep the characters alive. People like to see them somewhat regularly." He pointed to Pixar chief creative officer John Lasseter, who would like to do more with the "Cars" characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pixar has a full slate of upcoming titles -- some sequels and some introducing new characters. "Up," the studio's 10th computer-animated feature and first to be released in digital 3-D, opens May 29 and introduces new characters, including elderly Carl Fredricksen and young wilderness explorer Russell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3-D releases of "Toy Story" and "Toy Story 2" bring Woody, Buzz and the toys back to theaters October 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current film projects at Pixar are the 3-D features "Toy Story 3," "Cars 2," "The Bear and the Bow" and "Newt." The studio also is developing a series of shorts based on the Mater character from "Cars" as well as theme park projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Sheri Linden at Reuters)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA, May 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Riverbed Technology (NASDAQ: RVBD), the IT infrastructure performance
company for networks, applications and storage, today announced its
participation in the annual Microsoft Tech-Ed North America 2009
conference, taking place May 11-15 at the Los Angeles Convention Center.
At the conference, Riverbed(R) will showcase its WAN optimization
products, which provide end-to-end network and application visibility and
which enable organizations running Microsoft environments to dramatically
improve application performance and achieve consolidation without
disruption. In addition, Riverbed will be one of the vendors in the
Windows Services for the Branch booth featured in the Microsoft Technical
Learning Center. This booth will showcase the Windows Server on the
Steelhead(R) appliance.

    For years enterprises have depended on Riverbed to dramatically accelerate
and optimize Microsoft Windows-based applications over the WAN, in some
cases up to 100 times faster. To further the benefits provided to
customers, Riverbed has worked closely with Microsoft. Most recently,
Riverbed announced a licensing agreement to integrate Windows Server 2008
on the Riverbed Steelhead appliance through the Riverbed Services Platform
(RSP). The RSP is a virtualized partition within the Steelhead appliance
that allows customers to deploy applications critical to the branch office
as virtualized services on the appliance, enabling them to further
consolidate their IT infrastructure.

    In August 2008, Riverbed joined the Microsoft Protocol Optimization
Licensing Program (POLP). Through this protocol implementation agreement,
Microsoft gives Riverbed access to its intellectual property so that
Riverbed can build on its expertise and success accelerating and
optimizing Windows-based applications over the wide area network (WAN).
Participation in POLP, combined with Riverbed's licensing of Windows
Server 2008, gives enterprises that have standardized on Microsoft a
proven platform for IT consolidation.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Morgan Stanley and several other big U.S. banks said they were in a position to quickly repay Treasury capital injections after regulators released bank stress test results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officials assessed the financial strength of 19 financial institutions to see how much capital they would need over the next two years to survive a deep and extended recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of banks were found to have sufficient capital, paying the way for them to repay capital injected by the Treasury under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the money provided critical support during the darkest days of last year's financial crisis, it also carried restrictions, including limits on bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which passed the test, said it believed it had met all requirements and was "highly confident that we will soon repay the government's investment from the TARP's Capital Purchase Program."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares, down 4 percent during regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange trade, rose 2 percent after the results of the stress tests were announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which received $10 billion in TARP funds, last month announced the sale of $5 billion of common stock and $2 billion of debt that was not guaranteed by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, even as it was directed to boost capital by $1.8 billion, said it too expected to repay its $10 billion in TARP funds "as soon as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan announced it would sell $2 billion in stock and $3 billion in 5- and 10-year notes not guaranteed by the FDIC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley shares, down 4.8 percent in regular trading, fell another 1.4 percent after the bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of banks that were found to be adequately capitalized also rushed to say they wanted to free themselves of the Treasury as an investor as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co, American Express Co, Bank of New York Mellon, State Street Corp, U.S. Bancorp and BBT Corp said they would seek to repay TARP as soon as they were permitted by regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, which was found to have a $5.5 billion capital shortfall, said it would repay the $45 billion it got from Treasury as soon as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, federal officials said TARP recipients had to prove they had sufficient capital, could issue common stock and sell long-term debt without government guarantees before they could seek to return the TARP money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of American Express, which received $3.4 billion in TARP funds, rose 3 percent in after-market trade after it was deemed adequately capitalized by the stress test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Street, down 3.3 percent in regular trading, also passed the test and its shares rose 8.8 percent in after-hours trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Ted Kerr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kforce Clinical Research Wins Pfizer Development Operations Strategic Supplier
Excellence Award

TAMPA, Fla., May 8, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kforce Clinical Research Inc., a
provider of clinical trial resourcing solutions and a division of Kforce Inc.
(Nasdaq:KFRC), has won the 2008 Pfizer Development Operations' "Strategic
Supplier Excellence Award." The annual award recognizes functional service
providers that have demonstrated consistent performance in the areas of quality,
service delivery and reliability, innovation and business processes and customer
service.

"This recognition is the direct result of the efforts and accomplishments of our
tremendously talented and dedicated team members," said Randy Kehrmeyer,
President of Kforce Clinical Research. "We are driven by a shared belief that we
have an opportunity -- and an obligation -- to make a meaningful impact in the
lives of our employees, clients and ultimately the countless patients in need of
the medicines we are working together to develop."

Kforce Clinical Research managed project deliverables for more than 200 Pfizer
studies consistently throughout the year. Applying the principals of Lean Six
Sigma, Kforce streamlined business processes across the U.S. and provided Pfizer
with a more consultative view into project staffing and overall protocol
management. Kforce also instituted a new business model for site selection that
has improved study start-up time.

"Kforce has consistently demonstrated superior performance, adding high value to
the U.S. clinical operations business," said Mike Collins, Vice President of
Clinical Study Operations at Pfizer. "In addition to exceeding expectations
across all award categories, Kforce implemented strong business tools and
processes that had meaningful impacts supporting our commitment for continuous
improvement within Pfizer."

Kforce Clinical Research (www.kforce.com/clinicalresearch) provides customized
and flexible functional outsourcing solutions to the biopharmaceutical industry.
It specializes in clinical monitoring, site and study management, drug safety,
regulatory, clinical data management, data entry, clinical programming and
biostatistics. Whereas other outsourcing providers either augment a company's
drug trial with people or handle all aspects of the trial, Kforce's functional
outsourcing model offers a flexible, tailored approach developed to mirror each
company's business model and address specific requirements of the drug trial
itself.

permanent staffing solutions in the skill areas of technology, finance &amp;
accounting, health and life sciences, and government solutions (KGS). Backed by

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Auxilium a Buy at $20

Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: AUXL) reported financial results for the
first quarter 2009 on May 6, 2009. Total revenues for the first quarter were
$34.7 million, an increase of 28% over the first quarter in 2008. 

Revenues consisted of approximately $32.5 million in U.S. sales of Testim, up
20% year-over-year, $1.3 million in milestone recognition from Ferring
International S.A. on ex-U.S. Testim activities, and $0.9 million in
amortization from the previous upfront payment from Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). This was
slightly lower than expected by about $2.0 million based on lower sales of
Testim. 

Cognizant - Bearish Trend Over?

Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (NASDAQ: CTSH, Hold) reported its fiscal Q1
results yesterday. Q1 revenues of $746 million were ahead of our $734 million
estimate, although down 1% q/q (but flat assuming constant currency). Non-GAAP
gross margin of 20.2% were in-line with guidance, while GAAP EPS of $0.38 were
ahead of our and consensus estimates by a penny. 

Overall, the company posted solid results across all verticals, although the
banking vertical (with nearly 30% of revenues) saw a 2% sequential decline in
revenues. 

An Update on NBIX's Elagolix

Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: NBIX) has recently completed the entire
twelve months of the Petal-602 study, which includes six months of treatment and
six months follow-up. 

Post-treatment reviews looking to determine the impact of elagolix on bone
mineral density (BMD) by dual energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) show consistent
results with the six month data, whereas there was no apparent effect from
baseline in the elagolix treatment arms. After the twelve months, patients
taking 150mg elagolix showed a mean change in BMD of +0.19% for the spine and
-0.28% for the femur. 

Coca-Cola FEMSA Inexpensive

Coca-Cola FEMSA S.A. de C.V. (NYSE: KOF) is the largest Coca-Cola bottler in
Mexico and Argentina, and is one of Coke's two anchor bottlers in Latin America.


The company posted positive operating results for the first quarter of 2009,
mainly considering the difficult economic situation. Moreover, the results in
the Mercosur and Latincentro division were particularly impressive. The recent
acquisitions will enhance company`s topline growth in the medium term.

&lt;p&gt;Company`s Tier 1 Common Ratio at 7.3% as of 3/31/09; Would Remain Well in Excess
of Government`s 4.0% Buffer Level under More Adverse Scenario

Tier 1 Capital of 11.4% as of 3/31/09 (9.3% Excluding Tarp) Also Would Remain
Very Strong under Government Scenario
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) confirmed today that it has completed the U.S.
Government`s Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP), which determined
that JPMorgan Chase`s capital position would remain strong under far more highly
stressed conditions than exist today, and that there is no need for the company
to raise additional capital at this time. 

JPMorgan Chase`s existing strong capital base and loan-loss reserves, together
with its significant pretax, pre-provision earnings power, would enable it to
weather adverse scenarios envisioned by SCAP, while still maintaining very
strong capital ratios. JPMC`s ratios under SCAP would remain very strong even
when excluding TARP preferred stock. Importantly, the company believes it could
handle a substantially worse environment than the Government`s adverse
conditions, even though the company is not expecting such a scenario. 

Specifically, JPMorgan Chase`s Tier 1 Capital Ratio is 11.4% -- or 9.3%
excluding TARP -- as of March 31, 2009. The company`s Tier 1 Common Ratio is
7.3% as of March 31, 2009, which is well in excess of the Government`s 4.0%
buffer level, and would remain so even under more highly adverse scenarios. 

Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "JPMorgan Chase has
worked hard to maintain its fortress balance sheet and strong capital position
in this challenging environment." He added, "We are committed to supporting
healthy economic growth and to doing our part to help our country through these
tough times. In particular, we remain committed to safe and sound lending and to
being a responsible corporate citizen. In the first quarter of this year alone,
JPMorgan Chase lent more than $150 billion to consumers, small businesses,
non-profits, municipalities, corporations and others."

with assets of $2.1 trillion and operations in more than 60 countries. The firm

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Microsoft says EU regulators will hand Google more dominance of the Internet search business if they go ahead with planned regulations on Microsoft's Windows operating system, the Financial Times reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FT said on Saturday that the move by Microsoft was contained in a confidential last-minute submission to the European Commission aimed at heading off antitrust action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Commission spokesman said in response to the report: "The Commission will examine all the arguments outlined by Microsoft in their reply to the statement of objections."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft officials could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission, which regulates competition in the 27-country European Union, has charged Microsoft with seeking to stymie rivals by tying the firm's Web browser to its dominant Windows system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft replied to the EU antitrust charges, a so-called "statement of objections," on April 28. It is due to respond orally to the accusations in early June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By bundling Internet Explorer with Windows, Microsoft shielded its browser from competition with rival products, harming innovation and reducing customer choice, the Commission had said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said the Commission may order it to distribute other browsers with the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the newspaper reported that Microsoft had questioned in its official response, a copy of which the FT had seen, whether such a proposal from the Commission would be legal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company claimed competition would be harmed in the Internet search market, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because two of the main rival browser companies, Opera and Mozilla, maker of the Firefox browser, have agreements with Google so their browsers automatically default to the Google search engine, as does Google's browser, Chrome, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, if the screen showing computer users their browser choices is created by the PC makers, Google could work directly with these manufacturers and have them set the search defaults in its favor, the paper cited the software company as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also contends that a requirement to distribute other browsers with Windows could infringe its brand rights and impose a potential intellectual property liability, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Dale Hudson, Editing by Peter Blackburn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BRUSSELS, May 9 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) says EU

Internet search business if they go ahead with planned
regulations on Microsoft's Windows operating system, the

such a proposal from the Commission would be legal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company claimed competition would be harmed in the

Opera and Mozilla, maker of the Firefox browser, have agreements
with Google so their browsers automatically default to the
Google search engine, as does Google's browser, Chrome, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, if the screen showing computer users their browser
choices is created by the PC makers, Google could work directly
with these manufacturers and have them set the search defaults
in its favour, the paper cited the software company as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft also contends that a requirement to distribute
other browsers with Windows could infringe its brand rights and
impose a potential intellectual property liability, the paper
said.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON May 10 (Reuters) - A Thursday malfunction of a
gasoline-producing unit at Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) 503,000
barrel-per-day (bpd) Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery came
during a restart after an unplanned shutdown earlier in the
week, said sources familiar with refinery operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; An Exxon spokesman declined to discuss specific unit
operations at the Baton Rouge refinery, which is the second
largest in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon has said it will be able to meet its customer supply
obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Workers were attempting to get the 120,000 bpd fluidic
catalytic cracking unit, one of three at the refinery, back to
normal operations following an initial startup early on
Thursday when an equipment failure is thought to have occurred,
triggering a second shutdown, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nine workers were exposed to carbon monoxide in the
Thursday upset and taken to area hospitals. All were released
on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The shut FCC underwent a four-week overhaul earlier this
year and returned to service in early March.

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY May 11 (Reuters) - Two cable units of Mexico's
top broadcaster Televisa (TV.N) are teaming with at least one
rival to offer a blanket $38-per-month triple play package
aimed at low-income earners as competition increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Televisa's (TLVACPO.MX) Cablevision and Cablemas will join
forces with Megacable to launch the new service under the "YOO"
banner in a move to strengthen their presence in three key
markets: Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The websites of all three companies featured the new YOO
package prominently on their front pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The teaming of the three could also mean a direct aim at
Telefonos de Mexico TELMEXL.MX TMX.N, the leading
fixed-line phone operator in Mexico owned by tycoon Carlos
Slim, among the world's wealthiest men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Telmex offers Internet and phone packages. A government
refusal to grant it permit to operate television due to
competition concerns has put its expansion on the triple play
market on hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa and competition officials were not available for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Telmex is already offering billing services for Dish
Mexico, the direct-to-home programming venture between Mexican
media company MVS Comunicaciones and set-top-box provider
EchoStar (SATS.O). In December it also launched a short
Web-based newscast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For Cablevision (CABLECPO.MX) -- which already has a phone,
Internet and television offer for 657 pesos per month ($50) --
the YOO package will mean less channels available and slower
broadband speed for customers who decide to switch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "YOO is 24 percent cheaper than the (existing) triple play
package from Televisa -- its lowest-priced offer -- therefore
Televisa's ARPU's (average revenue per user) could contract,"
BBVA Bancomer analyst Andres Coello wrote in a report on
Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cablemas users were already paying 499 pesos ($38) for

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Monday sold a $3.75 billion debt issue in its first foray into the U.S. corporate bond market, joining a spate of companies taking advantage of beneficial borrowing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cash-rich, "triple-A" rated Microsoft announced its first debt authorization last September, allowing it to issue up to $6 billion in debt. Monday's bond sale attracted well over $10 billion in demand, market sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale included $2 billion of five-year notes yielding about 95 basis points over comparable U.S. Treasuries, $1 billion of 10-year notes yielding about 105 basis points over Treasuries and $750 million of 30-year bonds yielding about 105 basis points over Treasuries, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, has already issued about a third of its $6 billion debt authorization in the commercial paper market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It says it does not need financing, but will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including working capital and buying back stock, according to a spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company decided to take advantage of "good market conditions and Microsoft's great credit rating," a spokesman said. The software giant is one of only a handful of U.S. companies still rated 'AAA' by both Moody's Investor Service and Standard  Poor's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitch rates it one notch lower at 'AA-plus'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think people thought it might be the only shot in a lifetime to lend money to Microsoft," said Robert Bishop, portfolio manager at SCM Advisors in San Francisco. "When a company is borrowing and they don't really need the money, you don't know when you're going to get another shot at them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of the end of March, Microsoft reportedly had cash and short-term investments worth $25.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale did well because "Microsoft is a great credit and everybody's got a place in their portfolio for a few high quality credits," Bishop added. Still, he declined to participate because yields being offered "didn't seem like great value."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bond sale benefited from massive investor cash flowing into corporate bonds as tentative signs of economic recovery improve investors' appetite for risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"An awful lot of people want to pile into the credit markets now," Bishop said. "They think things are better but the problem is, I think they probably don't realize how much spreads have tightened over the course of the last two months."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporate bonds started attracting demand when their yield spreads hit a record 656 basis points over Treasuries last December. As the market rallied, spreads have narrowed to just 444 basis points, according to Merrill Lynch data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But companies are taking advantage of the falling yield spreads, with more than $26 billion of U.S. corporate bonds sold in just the first six business days of the month, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems to me that there's almost an urgent need for issuers to announce a deal as quickly as they can to catch the market before it does turn the other way," said Richard Lee, head of fixed income at New York broker-dealer Wall Street Access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The corporate bond market appeared to already be softening on Monday, with spreads suffering their first widening in weeks under the spate of heavy supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's shares ended down 10 cents at $19.32 on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its bond sale was led by JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), with Banc of America Securities (BAC.N) and Citigroup (C.N) as passive managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debt sale had sparked talk that Microsoft could be readying a bid for German business management software firm SAP (SAPG.DE), in light of a recent article in Barron's citing an analyst as saying SAP cannot remain independent forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAP Co-Chief Executive Leo Apotheker, in New York unveiling an acquisition, declined to comment on a possible Microsoft bid but did say he believes his firm should stay independent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAP's stock rose 2.85 percent in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'AA+' rating to Microsoft Corp.'s (Microsoft)
proposed offering of $3.75 billion senior unsecured notes consisting of
five-year, 10-year and 30-year notes. The proceeds from the offering will be
used for general corporate purposes, including funding for working capital,
capital expenditures, share buybacks and potential future acquisitions. 

Fitch currently rates Microsoft as follows: 

--Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'AA+'; 

--Senior unsecured revolving credit facility (RCF) 'AA+'; 

--Senior unsecured debt 'AA+'; 

--Short-Term IDR 'F-1+'' 

--Commercial Paper (CP) Program 'F-1+'. 

The Rating Outlook is Stable. 

The ratings and Stable Outlook incorporate Fitch's current expectations that
Microsoft's debt balance will increase over time, as the company replenishes
U.S.-based cash balances in order to continue funding stock repurchases, cash
dividends and acquisitions without repatriating offshore cash subject to
incremental taxes. Microsoft's total liquidity is strong (see below), and the
company has historically relied largely on its substantial free cash flow to
fund share repurchases, cash dividends and modest acquisition activity. However,
similar to other large technology companies with significant international
operations, a substantial portion of Microsoft's cash is generated overseas.
Fitch believes that international cash represents a considerable portion of
total cash due to continued funding of share repurchases and dividends with
U.S.-based cash. Fitch believes the company has financial flexibility to issue
significantly more debt over the intermediate term, particularly to deal with
cash location issues, as the company maintains its net cash position. On March
31, 2008, total debt was $2 billion, consisting solely of CP borrowings.
Microsoft has current Board authorization to issue up to $6 billion of total
debt, although Fitch believes this is likely to increase over time. 

As of March 31, 2009, Microsoft's total liquidity was strong at $25.3 billion of
cash and investments, consisting of approximately $7.3 billion of cash and cash
equivalents, and $18.1 billion of short-term investments, which are invested in
highly liquid, fixed-income securities. The company also has $4.1 billion of
long-term investments, consisting of primarily public and highly liquid equity
securities. Liquidity is further supported by Microsoft's industry-leading
annual free cash flow of approximately $12 billion-$14 billion, a $2 billion RCF
maturing in November 2009 that serves as a back-up to the CP program, and an
additional $1 billion RCF maturing in March 2010. Fitch gains further confidence
in Microsoft's liquidity profile from the company's historical practice of
maintaining a significant net cash position. Fitch anticipates that free cash
flow will continue to be utilized primarily for share repurchases and
acquisitions. Microsoft spent $9.3 billion of cash on share repurchases in the
first nine months of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009, although there was no
repurchase activity in third quarter-2009 (3Q'09). There is approximately $34.5
billion remaining under the company's $40 billion share repurchase program,
which expires on Sept. 30, 2013. 

The ratings and Outlook are supported by Microsoft's: 

--Leading market share in all of its core software segments; 

--Superior balance sheet with exceptional financial flexibility, particularly
for acquisitions; 

--Industry-leading liquidity supported by a considerable cash position and
consistent free cash flow; 

--Unparalleled financial performance and operating profile, complemented by a
sizable recurring revenue base. 

Although Microsoft's recent results have shown that the company is not immune to
the current macroeconomic challenges, particularly in its historically strong
emerging markets, Fitch believes there are no near-term competitive or financial
risks to the ratings. Nonetheless, longer-term rating concerns consist of: 

--New software models that could challenge Microsoft's highly profitable license
model, including open-source software, software as a service (SaaS) or
advertising-supported software; 

--Gross margin pressures attributable to investments in emerging markets subject
to lower average selling prices (ASP); 

--Substantially lower operating margins for the two non-software business
segments, which represent approximately 20% of total revenues; 

--Further legal and/or regulatory actions that could impede the company's course
of business. 

Fitch expects international growth and the ongoing expansion into adjacent
businesses will continue to pressure Microsoft's margins, but are unlikely to
materially affect the company's free cash flow.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is on track to release its new Windows 7 operating system in time for the holiday shopping season, an executive said on Monday, confirming talk it is ahead of its own conservative schedule for replacing the unpopular Vista system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company has so far been vague on specifying the timing of its new operating system, wary of disappointing customers.

&lt;p&gt; * New operating system testing well&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * On track to be in shops by holiday season
 (Adds more detail on timing, executive blog quote)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE May 11 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is on
track to release its new Windows 7 operating system in time for
the holiday shopping season, an executive said on Monday,

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) agreed to pay up to $60 million to settle a Massachusetts probe into whether its subprime mortgage securitization business had encouraged unfair loans, state officials said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman did not write mortgages but contributed to demand for the riskiest home loans by securitizing them -- buying mortgages, packaging them and reselling them, Attorney General Martha Coakley told reporters. This is the first such settlement with a subprime mortgage securitizer, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no dispute that Goldman Sachs and other securitizers have been involved intricately in this whole process by which loans were made to homeowners who were destined to fail," Coakley said. "Many of these loans were unfair; they were destined to fail."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman will work on renegotiating the terms of existing subprime mortgages with Massachusetts homeowners who are having trouble making payments -- and whose home values have fallen below their loan amounts -- but who have not yet suffered foreclosure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will make up to $50 million in concessions to homeowners and pay another $10 million to the state, Coakley said. No lawsuit was filed as part of the inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally said the company was "pleased" to have settled the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REVISING MORTGAGE TERMS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subprime mortgages -- loans to homebuyers with poor credit -- played a major role in the creation of the U.S. housing bubble earlier this decade. The deflation of that bubble was a major contributor to the global recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reworking the terms of securitized mortgages -- which have been resold to other investors -- has been a major sticking point for government officials looking to prevent foreclosure for homeowners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although people think loans should be modified, actually accomplishing it has been difficult," Coakley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising unemployment and falling home values mean that many Americans are finding themselves unable to make their regular mortgage payments, and are also unable to refinance because their homes are now worth less than they owe on their loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has agreed to reduce the principal due on first mortgages by up to 35 percent and on second mortgages by 50 percent or more, Coakley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms generated enormous profits during the boom years, but lawmakers and other critics have argued their pressure on mortgage brokers to generate loans needed to feed their securitization business helped lower standards and pumped up the bubble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has long insisted it was a minor player in the mortgage-backed business, relative to rivals like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry league tables showed it climbed as high as No. 7 in issuing subprime mortgage-backed securities and was sixth in underwriting in 2006, but quickly fell out of the top 10 by the following year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coakley acknowledged that the $60 million in payments is a small amount for Wall Street giant Goldman, which last year earned $2.3 billion -- even in the midst of the worst financial crisis the world has seen in decades. But it is a meaningful move for the more than 700 Massachusetts residents who could keep their homes as a result of the agreement, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For Goldman Sachs, the amount of money is probably negligible," Coakley said. "For those in Massachusetts, it's a huge boost."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Scott Malone; Additional reporting by Joseph Giannone; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, May 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Titus Labs today announced beta availability of two new classification
offerings for the Windows Server 2008 R2 File Classification
Infrastructure (FCI). These new classification offerings extend the
native file classification capabilities in Windows Server 2008 R2, and
complement the existing Titus Labs Message Classification and Document
Classification solutions for the Microsoft Office platform. Titus Labs
solutions are fully interoperable with the new Windows Server 2008 R2 FCI.

    Information classification is the critical first step in managing data
based on its business value. When the information value is understood,
organizations can apply security policies to reduce the risk of
information leakage. The new FCI in Windows Server 2008 R2 enables
organizations to protect data by automatically classifying files and
applying policy.

    Classification solutions from Titus Labs extend the Windows 2008 R2 FCI
by:

    - Automatically classifying files based on user attributes such as their
role

    - Applying classification information to document headers, footers, and
watermarks

    - Offering full compatibility of their client side classification tools
with the server

    - Providing the ability to apply policy on the client

    The joint solution helps enterprise customers identify the business value
of data, raise security awareness, and protect information assets. Once
files are classified, the Titus Labs desktop solutions can help control
the distribution of sensitive files. For example, the desktop solutions
can prevent internal files from leaving the organization through email.

    "File Classification Infrastructure in Windows Server 2008 R2 provides an
extensible infrastructure for organizations to get insight into their
data so that they can manage their data based on its business value" said
Ward Ralston, Group Product Manager, Microsoft Corp. "The combined Titus
Labs and Microsoft solution will offer rich end to end capabilities for
automatic classification and policy enforcement."

    When used with existing Titus Labs Message Classification and Document
Classification solutions, the FCI enables organizations to perform
advanced classification and data management, including:

    - Intelligent defaults: Ensuring that all files start with an intelligent
default, the solution classifies based on attributes such as user role,
file content, or folder location. Optionally, users can combine the
benefits of automatic and user-based classification by overriding the
intelligent defaults with Titus Labs desktop classification tools.

    - Consistent visual labels: By automatically applying classification
labels to document headers, footers, and watermarks, the solution raises
security awareness among users and helps to ensure compliance with
marking regulations.

    - Bulk classification: The solution can apply classifications and visual
labels to thousands of documents at once. If the classification labels
change, there is no need for users to manually re-classify the files; the
updates occur automatically.

    - Data leakage prevention: The solution generates classification metadata
that can be used by other solutions to prevent data leakage, such as
internal documents slipping out in external emails.

    "We believe that Windows Server 2008 and Titus Labs classification
software will significantly enhance the ability of organizations to
better manage their information," said Charlie Pulfer vice president of
product Management for Titus Labs. "The combination of Microsoft's proven
server with Titus Labs' unique classification tools and solutions gives
enterprise industry-leading automatic classification capabilities and
high-end protection and policy enforcement."

    Availability and Pricing

    Data Classification beta evaluation copies are now available for download
at http://www.titus-labs.com/software/Classification_FCI.html. Final
product will be available 60 days after the release of Microsoft Windows
Server 2008 R2.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Monday launched a $3.75 billion debt issue, its first foray into the U.S. corporate bond market as it joined a spate of companies taking advantage of good borrowing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cash-rich, "triple-A" rated Microsoft announced its first debt authorization last September, allowing it to issue up to $6 billion in debt. The bond sale, expected to price later on Monday, has attracted about $10 billion in demand, market sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale is expected to include $2 billion of five-year notes yielding about 95 basis points over U.S. Treasuries, $1 billion of 10-year notes yielding about 105 basis points over Treasuries, and $750 million of 30-year bonds yielding about 105 basis points over Treasuries, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, has already issued about a third of its $6 billion debt authorization in the commercial paper market. It does not need financing but will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including working capital and buying back stock, according to a spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company decided to take advantage of "good market conditions and Microsoft's great credit rating," a spokesman said. The software giant is rated AAA by Moody's Investor Service and Standard  Poor's and AA-plus, one notch lower, by Fitch Ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had cash and short-term investments worth $25.3 billion at the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its shares were up 15 cents to $19.57 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is being led by JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), with Banc of America Securities (BAC.N) and Citigroup (C.N) as passive managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debt sale had sparked talk that Microsoft could be readying a bid for German business management software firm SAP (SAPG.DE), in light of a recent article in Barron's citing an analyst as saying SAP cannot remain independent forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAP Co-Chief Executive Leo Apotheker, in New York unveiling an acquisition, declined to comment on a possible Microsoft bid but did say he believes his firm should stay independent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAP's stock was up 2.85 percent in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tom Ryan and Bill Rigby; additional reporting by Dena Aubin and Walden Siew, Editing by Tim Dobbyn, Derek Caney and Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is on track to release its new Windows 7 operating system in time for the holiday shopping season, an executive said on Monday, confirming talk that it is ahead of its own conservative schedule for replacing the unpopular Vista system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company has so far been vague on specifying the timing of its new operating system, wary of disappointing customers. But it has broadly targeted the end of this year or the beginning of next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Windows 7 is tracking well for holiday availability," Bill Veghte, senior vice president of Microsoft's Windows business said at an event on Monday, citing good test results on the early version of the system released to developers and the public over the past few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Microsoft said Windows 7 was on track for launch in its fiscal year 2010, which could mean as early as July this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That inspired some hopes that Microsoft would be able to take advantage of both the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons, which usually bring a spike in computer purchases and accompanying software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last few weeks, Microsoft has been releasing an early version of Windows 7, known as a 'release candidate', to developers and the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once it makes some more adjustments to the software, the next stage is for Microsoft to release the system to PC manufacturers to install on machines that will be sold in shops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's operating systems, installed on the vast majority of the world's PCs, are still the backbone of the company, providing more than half of its $4.4 billion profit last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disappointing Vista, launched to the public in 2007, was incompatible with some low-power machines and perceived by many to be too complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Settlement includes payment, homeowner relief&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * First settlement with securitizer of mortgages
 (Adds attorney general quotes, details, byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Scott Malone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BOSTON, May 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
agreed to pay up to $60 million to settle a Massachusetts probe
into whether its subprime mortgage securitization business had
encouraged unfair loans, state officials said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman did not write mortgages but contributed to demand
for the riskiest home loans by securitizing them -- buying
mortgages, packaging them and reselling them, Attorney General
Martha Coakley told reporters. This is the first such
settlement with a subprime mortgage securitizer, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is no dispute that Goldman Sachs and other
securitizers have been involved intricately in this whole
process by which loans were made to homeowners who were
destined to fail," Coakley said. "Many of these loans were
unfair; they were destined to fail."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman will work on renegotiating the terms of existing
subprime mortgages with Massachusetts homeowners who are having
trouble making payments -- and whose home values have fallen
below their loan amounts -- but who have not yet suffered
foreclosure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will make up to $50 million in concessions to homeowners
and pay another $10 million to the state, Coakley said. No
lawsuit was filed as part of the inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally said the company was
"pleased" to have settled the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; REVISING MORTGAGE TERMS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Subprime mortgages -- loans to homebuyers with poor credit
-- played a major role in the creation of the U.S. housing
bubble earlier this decade. The deflation of that bubble was a
major contributor to the global recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reworking the terms of securitized mortgages -- which have
been resold to other investors -- has been a major sticking
point for government officials looking to prevent foreclosure
for homeowners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Although people think loans should be modified, actually
accomplishing it has been difficult," Coakley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rising unemployment and falling home values mean that many
Americans are finding themselves unable to make their regular
mortgage payments, and are also unable to refinance because
their homes are now worth less than they owe on their loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has agreed to reduce the principal due on first
mortgages by up to 35 percent and on second mortgages by 50
percent or more, Coakley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street firms generated enormous profits during the
boom years, but lawmakers and other critics have argued their
pressure on mortgage brokers to generate loans needed to feed
their securitization business helped lower standards and pumped
up the bubble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has long insisted it was a minor player in the
mortgage-backed business, relative to rivals like Bear Stearns
and Lehman Brothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industry league tables showed it climbed as high as No. 7
in issuing subprime mortgage-backed securities and was sixth in
underwriting in 2006, but quickly fell out of the top 10 by the
following year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coakley acknowledged that the $60 million in payments is a
small amount for Wall Street giant Goldman, which last year
earned $2.3 billion -- even in the midst of the worst financial
crisis the world has seen in decades. But it is a meaningful
move for the more than 700 Massachusetts residents who could
keep their homes as a result of the agreement, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "For Goldman Sachs, the amount of money is probably
negligible," Coakley said. "For those in Massachusetts, it's a
huge boost."

&lt;p&gt; * Termination to hurt earnings for the rest of 2009&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Rev loss to hurt backlog by about $140 mln&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shares fall as much as 7 pct
 (Adds details, analysts' comments)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Sakthi Prasad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BANGALORE, May 11 (Reuters) - Pride International Inc
PDE.N said it agreed with Chevron Corp (CVX.N) to terminate
the remaining contract term of a rig in West Africa, after an
inspection revealed "unacceptable" levels of corrosion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the contract driller were trading down about 7
percent, or $1.61 at $22.39 in morning trade on the New York
Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rig, Pride Venezuela, was relocated from Chevron's
drilling location to Luanda Bay, Angola for planned repairs and
a mid-period survey in March, Pride said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An inspection of a section of the hull revealed an
unacceptable level of corrosion, which will require a dry-dock
facility to conduct permanent repairs. The rig will have to be
moved out of the region as no dry-dock facility exists in
Africa for a semisubmersible rig, the company added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As to why the company delayed this announcement, Jefferies
 Co analyst Judson Bailey said, "My guess would be they have
been negotiating with Chevron to settle this amicably."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Its disappointing but it sounds like there are some
problems with the rig and Chevron is obviously within their
rights to cancel the contract given the extensive nature of the
repairs that have to be done," Bailey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said the repairs will take most of the
remaining contract term, which had been expected to conclude in
March 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is unexpected at this point. The industry has been
running hard and unfortunately when that happens some
maintenance gets neglected. Perhaps the corrosion is worse than
expected," Morgan Keegan  Co analyst Michael Drickamer said by
phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EARNINGS IMPACT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Loss of revenue resulting from termination of the remaining
contract term is expected to reduce Pride's backlog by about
$140 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The revenue loss is expected to lower second quarter
results by an estimated 3 cents a share from its previous
forecast of 66 cents to 71 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts, on average, are expecting second quarter earnings
of 71 cents a share, before items, according to Reuters
Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The third and fourth quarters each are expected to be
negatively impacted by about 13 cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts, on average, are expecting third and fourth
quarter earnings of 69 cents a share and 41 cents a share
respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jefferies' Bailey, who has a "buy" rating on the stock,
estimated the company's total revenue backlog to be about $8
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pride sees further impact to the financial results in the
second, third and fourth quarters from cost of mobilization and
repairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The rig is being idled -- that's lost revenue that will
impact the earnings, as well as additional operating costs
related to mobilising the rig and repairing the damage," Morgan
Keegan's Drickamer, who has a "market perform" rating on the
stock, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What they have provided in the press release seems
accurate," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Pradeep Kurup, Dinesh Nair)

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT May 11 (Reuters) - The chances for Pfizer (PFE.N)
to win a licensing deal for MediGene's MDGGn.DE promising
cancer drug EndoTAG-1 have improved after the German biotech
company appointed a new chief executive, two people familiar
with the matter told Reuters on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Last month MediGene's chief executive Peter Heinrich stepped
down in a surprise move. MediGene, which at the time did not
comment on the reasons for the resignation, named executive
board member Frank Mathias as Heinrich's successor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mathias is amenable to selling the global rights to
EndoTAG-1 and does not insist on retaining the European rights,
the sources said, adding that this approach looks set to
accommodate Pfizer's plans for EndoTAG-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MediGene has also been in talks with U.S. drug majors Merck
 Co (MRK.N) and Eli Lilly (LLY.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for MediGene declined to comment, saying only
that the German company was negotiating with both large and
medium-sized companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company had opened talks on EndoTAG-l in November,
shortly after the drug had shown promise as a pancreatic cancer
treatment in a Phase II clinical study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EndoTAG-1 consists of conventional chemotherapeutic agents
encapsulated by fat molecules. These globules cling on to
tumour-feeding blood vessels and destroy them, cutting off vital
oxygen and nutrient supplies to cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MediGene, which expects peak annual sales of the drug to
surpass 1 billion euros ($1.29 billion), is preparing to test
EndoTAG-1 against pancreatic cancer in the third and last trial
phase normally required for regulatory approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bulk of the drug's futures sales, however, should come
from its potential use against breast cancer, according to
MediGene.

&lt;p&gt;May 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs started coverage of U.S.

said the stocks, which have risen more than 70 percent on
average in the past month, seem fully valued this early in a

from "neutral," citing the firm's high leverage and near-term
liquidity constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe CB Richard Ellis may require additional capital
if earnings remain depressed through 2009," the analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman initiated Jones Lang LaSalle Inc (JLL.N) with a
"neutral" rating, given the real estate services firm's stable
contract-based revenue exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of CB Richard Ellis fell 12 percent to $8.20 before
recouping some losses to trade down 73 cents at $8.64 Monday
morning on the New York Stock Exchange. Chicago-based Jones
Lang LaSalle's shares fell 7 percent before recovering some
losses to trade down $1.11 at $36.65.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA, May 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Riverbed Technology (NASDAQ: RVBD), the IT infrastructure performance
company for networks, applications and storage, today announced that it
has forged a deeper relationship with Microsoft to provide enterprises
with distributed workers and offices the best possible performance for
their Microsoft-based applications and services and to simplify their IT
infrastructure. Today, customers are able to run Microsoft Windows Server
2003 and Windows Server 2008, including branch services such as Active
Directory, DNS/DHCP, Media Streaming and Print Services, on the Riverbed
Services Platform (RSP). As a natural next step, Riverbed(R) will enable
the deployment of Windows Server 2008 R2 on the RSP.

    "The relationship between Riverbed and Microsoft continues to grow. We are
able to innovate and provide enterprises with solutions that accelerate
the performance of their Microsoft environments," said Julius Sinkevicius,
director Windows Server Marketing at Microsoft. "Having the support of
Riverbed is crucial to the success of our branch office strategy. We're
both committed to working jointly to provide our customers with a
comprehensive WAN optimization offering by joining complementary
solutions."

    Microsoft introduced a feature, BranchCache, which is intended to improve
performance for Windows 7 users accessing file and Web applications hosted
on Windows Server 2008 R2 servers over the WAN. Riverbed enables the
deployment of Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 on Steelhead(R)
appliances with the RSP. Customers currently deploy Windows Server on the
RSP to consolidate services at the branch to further cut costs, including
Active Directory, DNS/DHCP, Media Streaming and Print Services. When
Windows Server 2008 R2 is released, it can be deployed on the RSP and the
BranchCache feature is a service that enterprises can use on the deployed
Windows Server.

    "As enterprises move to Windows 7, they may find a place for BranchCache
on the Steelhead appliance," said Zeus Kerravala, senior vice president,
Yankee Group. "It is apparent that Riverbed has been working with
Microsoft on a broad vision and in-depth technology integration that will
benefit their joint customers. This strategy positions Riverbed to
continue to be a market and technology leader in the WAN optimization
market."

    "We've worked closely with Microsoft on technology integration through the
POLP program and the integration of Windows Server on the RSP. Supporting
Microsoft's latest innovations is a natural next step in our
relationship," said John Martin, vice president of product management,
Riverbed. "By working with Microsoft we've been able to expand on our
core value to customers -- providing the best acceleration across the
broadest set of applications. In branch office environments the
combination of Riverbed and Microsoft will provide enterprises with a
comprehensive, optimized IT environment."

    The RSP is an extensible virtualized data services platform that allows
customers to deploy best-of-breed edge services that formerly required
dedicated servers as virtual appliances. Customers can deploy these
virtual appliances directly on Steelhead products to further minimize the
hardware infrastructure footprint at the branch office, which reduces
costs in operational overhead.

    Forward Looking Statements

    This press release contains forward-looking statements, including
statements relating to the expected demand for Riverbed's products and
services, statements relating to future functionality of the Riverbed
Services Platform, and statements relating to Riverbed's ability to meet
the needs of distributed organizations. These forward-looking statements

&lt;p&gt;Surgient Virtual Automation Platform Integration with Windows Server 2008
Hyper-V

Manages Lifecycle for Creating Virtual Environments
LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
Surgient, a leading provider of IT service delivery and virtualization
automation, today announced initiatives with Microsoft to dramatically improve
how enterprise IT services are tested and deployed. The Surgient Virtual
Automation Platform integrates with virtualized systems running on Microsoft
Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V, providing IT and Quality Assurance professionals
with self-service access to resources for testing IT services throughout the
deployment process. Surgient`s unique approach streamlines VM lifecycle
management and automates virtualized infrastructure, reducing capital and
operating costs, and increasing user productivity. 

Manual or semi-automated processes for deploying IT services are expensive and
time-consuming, and create a daunting task for IT operations. The high
rate-of-change of testing environments further exacerbates this challenge,
creating the need for consolidation of testing infrastructure with
virtualization, combined with enterprise-class lab automation, dynamic capacity
management and self-service experience. With Surgient and Microsoft software, IT
can streamline virtualized infrastructure management, automate resource
administration, and provide an easy-to-use self-service interface for virtual
resource users. With lab, lifecycle and stage management, the Surgient Platform,
with Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V, is a comprehensive solution for
optimizing virtualized infrastructure. 

"More and more companies are deploying Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V. Surgient`s
solution puts this virtual infrastructure to work by streamlining how IT
services are deployed," said Sameer Jagtap, vice president of business
development &amp; product strategy at Surgient. "Surgient helps manage and automate
virtual environments for some of the most complex and disparate global
enterprises. Our platform creates a centrally managed, virtual server pool that
can be accessed on a self-service basis by a wide variety of end users,
including testing and QA professionals." 

"The setup and teardown of complex, multi-tier test environments traditionally
takes days and even weeks. With virtualization and automation solutions from
Microsoft and Surgient, customers can easily select and deploy test
configurations in a self-service manner, often in just minutes," said Dai Vu,
director of virtualization solutions, Server and Tools Business at Microsoft
Corp. "IT departments can improve resource utilization and reduce capital costs
by consolidating virtual machines onto fewer physical resources and dynamically
managing lab infrastructure capacity." 

The solution has been tested in Microsoft`s Enterprise Engineering Center in
Redmond, Wash., against a complex, multi-tier SAP NetWeaver Architecture. For
the implementation, Microsoft and Surgient IT professionals were challenged with
the traditional issues surrounding test environment deployment: underutilized
compute capacity, difficult setup and teardown, and limited cloning and
replication. To address these challenges, existing physical infrastructure and
content was quickly virtualized using Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine
Manager and then registered with the Surgient Virtual Automation Platform. The
combination of Microsoft virtualization and Surgient automation resulted in: a
dramatically improved deployment process, further resource consolidation,
simultaneous deployment of identical multi-machine SAP configurations, and a
self-service experience for end users. 

Surgient is demonstrating its solutions in booth #430 at Microsoft TechEd North
America 2009, which is being held May 11-15 in Los Angeles. Additional
information, including a webcast presentation of the solution, is available at
www.surgient.com/microsoft.

&lt;p&gt;Solution eliminates need for shared storage for Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V
customers
SOUTHBOROUGH, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Double-Take Software (NASDAQ: DBTK) today announced a solution with Microsoft
Corp. that enables disaster recovery for virtual workloads without the cost and
complexity of shared storage or storage area network (SAN)-based data
replication. The solution uses Double-Take Software`s GeoCluster&#174; to extend the
benefits of Microsoft Windows Server 2008 failover clustering and Hyper-V
offering customers an unprecedented opportunity to have both a local and remote
availability solution for their virtual machines using a single technology.
GeoCluster provides the ability to create single site, or site-to-site, clusters
using replicated copies of virtual machines, making quick migrations possible
across geographic locations and also eliminating shared storage as a single
point of failure, ensuring the highest levels of protection for virtual
machines. 

"Virtualization is proving to be a valuable strategy to help companies manage
their costs, and with the current economic downturn, we`re seeing more companies
look for virtualization solutions that offer innovation at the right price,"
said Bob Roudebush, director of solutions engineering at Double-Take Software.
"The Double-Take Software and Microsoft solution offers Windows Server 2008
Hyper-V customers a cost-effective, highly efficient way to create
highly-available virtualized environments." 

GeoCluster integrates with Windows Server 2008 failover clustering and Hyper-V
providing the benefit of double-duty performance as a local availability
solution and as a disaster recovery solution. GeoCluster offers customers the
ability to deploy clustered Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V hosts using local copies
of clustered virtual machines rather than storing those clustered virtual
machines on a SAN. This approach ensures that there are multiple copies of
virtual machines available at any given time, significantly reducing the risk of
data loss from a site-wide disaster or other catastrophe. Keeping local copies
of clustered virtual machines data up to date with replication also allows
customers to keep copies of virtual machines in different geographic locations
-functionality not available with shared storage solutions. 

"Tough economic times are prompting IT organizations to reduce costs through
smart virtualization solutions," said Dai Vu, director of virtualization
solutions, Server and Tools Business at Microsoft Corp. "The remote site
recovery solution from Double-Take Software and Microsoft is a smart
virtualization solution because it eliminates SAN complexity and cost making it
easier to deliver high availability and disaster recovery for virtualized
environments."

&lt;p&gt;JINAN, China--(Business Wire)--
Pansoft Company Limited (NASDAQ: PSOF) today announced that it signed a Solution
Provider Agreement (SPA) with Microsoft China, Co., Ltd, (Microsoft) to develop
a centralized financial and accounting solution for Microsoft`s Dynamics AX, a
comprehensive ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) software on May 11,2009. Both
companies will jointly host a press release conference to announce the
cooperation and promote the new solution together in the vast ERP market in
China. Pansoft is the first and only Chinese company selected by Microsoft
Business Solutions (MBS) group to be a Solution Partner for Dynamics` core and
general solutions. The partnership with Microsoft highlighted Pansoft`s cutting
edge technology and capability of providing unique ERP software solutions for
world-class organizations. In addition, the business relationship with Microsoft
should help the company gain visibility. It is also a significant milestone for
Pansoft`s business development effort in new markets and industries. 

Pansoft, the dominant player in the ERP service market for China`s energy
industry, has the expertise and best practices in developing large-scale and
sophisticated ERP solutions. It designed and developed the first centralized
financial and accounting application for PetroChina (NYSE: PTR), which
successfully brought PetroChina`s multiple branches and legal entities that had
been using different accounting principles and calculated in various foreign
currencies into one system and one platform. Implemented in over 2,000
PetroChina`s subsidiaries, the centralized financial and accounting system built
by Pansoft received exceptional recognition by the Vice Minister of the Commerce
Ministry in China. 

Leveraging the expertise in developing ERP solutions and understanding of
Chinese companies and business users, Pansoft will create the new centralized
financial and accounting application that will be a major part of Microsoft`s
Dynamics AX total solution. Pansoft`s centralized financial and accounting
solution will offer various distinctive features including consolidations,
financial analysis, financial reporting and budgeting, which can significantly
enhance operating efficiency and simplify financial and accounting procedures.
The application is also highly scalable and can be utilized for a medium Chinese
firm with a single organization as well as a large business with various
subsidiaries and overseas offices. 

Dynamics AX 

Microsoft Dynamics AX is a flexible ERP solution, offers powerful
functionalities for enterprises to streamline their business processes, reduce
operating costs, manage internal and external compliance issues and drive the
decision-making process. It also enables users to better manage complex
financial and supply-chain development. Microsoft Dynamics AX is viewed as a
competitive ERP platform in the global markets. With the centralized financial
and accounting application developed by Pansoft, Dynamics AX should increase its
competitive advantage and expand its customer base in the ERP market. 

Mr. Hugh Wang, Chairman of Pansoft, commented on the agreement, "It is our
privilege to work with Microsoft, a world-class software company. Pansoft`s
superior technical expertise with developing sophisticated financial and
accounting software applications have been successfully showcased on mega-size
enterprises including Sinopec (NYSE: SNP) and PetroChina. Our ERP software
solution, viewed as one of the best financial and accounting applications, has
been implemented with thousands of end users in the Chinese oil giants.
Pansoft`s extensive experience with Chinese clients and a deep understanding of
their management issues such as fund management, online settlement, budget
control and internal process control are another reason that Microsoft selected
the company to be its partner for the software solution development. We believe
Pansoft`s partnership with Microsoft to develop the centralized financial and
accounting solution for Dynamics AX demonstrated Pansoft`s outstanding ability
in offering robust ERP software solutions for enterprise users not only for the
energy industry in China but also for other markets. In the wake of fast
recovery of China`s economy after the impact of the world wide recession and
financial crisis, there should be a strong demand for the ERP system and
accounting system for multiple operations. With Microsoft`s excellent brand
awareness and Pansoft`s strong local knowledge and expertise, Dynamics AX with
the centralized financial and accounting solution should reach large audiences
China in the near future."

&lt;p&gt;ASR Builds on DataCore`s Universal Storage Virtualization Software to Switch IT
Operations from a Central Site to One or More Distributed Contingency Locations
and Back
LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
DataCore Software, the leading provider of storage virtualization, is using
Microsoft Tech-Ed to preview its ground-breaking Advanced Site Recovery (ASR)
capabilities. This new component of DataCore`s comprehensive business continuity
portfolio allows central IT organizations to cost-effectively spread disaster
recovery (DR) responsibilities among several smaller sites. Furthermore, the
solution makes no distinction between virtual and physical servers, unifying
their restoration in a common, automated process. DataCore is also using the
occasion to demonstrate how expanded 64-bit features in the newest releases of
SANmelody and SANsymphony benefit Microsoft users. 

"The industry is conditioned to think of DR as a one-to-one proposition. They
place unreasonable demands on a single recovery site, asking them to suddenly
take over much larger workloads under very stressful conditions," argues James
Price, vice president channel and product marketing, DataCore Software. 

"But most organizations aren`t structured that way. They look more like a hub
and spoke, with smaller branches emanating from the central data center. For
this reason, DataCore`s Advanced Site Recovery distributes the disaster recovery
workloads among these smaller entities, allowing each of them to accept a more
manageable role in keeping the business going." 

Distributed DR

DataCore`s unique one-to-many approach fits well within the networking,
computational and storage capacity constraints found in branch locations. And it
also factors in staff and real estate limitations. 

Same for Virtual and Physical Systems

As importantly, the solution is not confined to virtual servers. It operates
identically with the many physical systems that make up large part of IT
infrastructures today. Offering a congruent DR method for all of these
environments eliminates catastrophic misalignments that plague divergent
processes. 

Central Site Restoration Built-in

DataCore`s Advanced Site Recovery (ASR) software also addresses the rapid
restoration of the central IT site from the widely dispersed branches through
ongoing bi-directional replication. Other DR alternatives don`t account for this
critical aspect and end up prolonging the crippling effects of an outage long
after the central machines could take over their original chores. 

Universal Coverage for Heterogeneous Scenarios

ASR works whether the servers are purely physical, or have been virtualized with
Citrix XenServer, Microsoft Hyper-V, VMware or other popular hypervisors.
Moreover, it supports the use of dissimilar storage devices between the data
center and its branches. In contrast, lack of such heterogeneous features in
competing, and much pricier, disk array-based replication products makes them
unsuitable for many customers. 

DataCore: Essential to Microsoft Hyper-V Configurations

DataCore yields the highest availability, fastest performance and fullest
utilization from storage assets, making it an essential element of Microsoft
Hyper-V configurations.

* The newest, 64-bit versions of DataCore`s flagship SANmelody and SANsymphony
storage virtualization solutions include advances in performance, migration,
thin provisioning, and high-availability. 
* Among the new features in SANmelody 3.0 and SANsymphony 7.0 that will
certainly serve to benefit the demanding needs of Microsoft users are large
`mega caches` to accelerate SAN performance, non-stop high-availability,
universal storage controllers that are Windows Server 2008-based, a simple and
fast `Transporter` option, and `waste-free reclamation` of storage space.

For more details on these newest versions of DataCore`s high-performance storage
solutions, please visit: www.datacore.com/software2009. 

ASR Availability, Pricing and More Information

Advance Site Recovery implementation services will be available through DataCore
ASR-certified implementation partners beginning June 2009. 

The ASR implementation services for DataCore`s storage virtualization start at
$20,000 for a site pair. DataCore`s standard high availability (HA) and disaster
recovery (DR) packages (www.datacore.com/SANpackages) are the prerequisite
software that would be installed to support ASR at the central and remote sites.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, May 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Providing higher quality experiences and lower cost video delivery, Qumu,
Inc., a proven innovator in rich media streaming video solutions for the
enterprise, today announced a new capability for live video broadcast
using multicast networking technologies for the Microsoft Silverlight
platform.

    The new Multicast Plug-in for Silverlight, developed by Qumu in
cooperation with Microsoft Corp., allows enterprises for the first time
to deliver live video broadcasts via multicast across the network to
thousands of Silverlight-based players simultaneously. Multicast delivery
reduces the network traffic normally required to stream live video to
desktops. With this new Silverlight extension companies can now manage
and administer one streaming infrastructure that delivers live,
re-broadcast and video-on-demand content using the same streaming
infrastructure based on Microsoft Windows Media Services. The new
Multicast plug-in for Silverlight is available at no cost as open source
via Codeplex, Microsoft's open source project hosting web site
(http://projectstarlight.codeplex.com/).

    Organizational Demand for Live Broadcasts

    Live video broadcast is an important technology at many organizations
because it enables company executives, managers and thought leaders to
reach large audiences that command attention and deliver important and
relevant information at very low cost. Live Intranet video broadcast can
take advantage of the use of multicast technology to minimize impact of
thousands of simultaneous video streams on corporate networks.

    Qumu's products are designed for corporate communication professionals and
executive leaders who want to harness the power and cost-savings of
enterprise video to communicate with both internal and external audiences
and cost effectively meet the increased need for video creation and
distribution -- especially in today's economy. Qumu developed the new
Multicast application for Silverlight in response to enterprise customers
and long term users of Windows Media Services who desire to move to the
new Silverlight player for ease of use and sophistication and flexibility
of controls.

    "The Polycom Video Media Center 1000 video content management solution is
leveraging Silverlight technology, which delivers superior video
experience for recorded and live video collaboration sessions streamed
from the Polycom Recording and Streaming Server 2000. We're pleased to
see this new plug-in enhance the ability to reach larger audiences," said
Joseph A. Sigrist, Senior VP and General Manager, Video Solutions
Division at Polycom.

    "It's exciting to see a Silverlight partner like Qumu innovate on the
Silverlight platform to extend its capabilities," said Steve Sklepowich,
group product manager of Silverlight at Microsoft. "We designed
Silverlight from the ground up to be extensible by third parties, and
this is great evidence of how companies like Qumu can add value and
enable new content scenarios for enterprise video scenarios."

    The New Multicast Plug-In For Silverlight Provides:


--  Multicast Support  of live video broadcasts using Silverlight
--  Downloaded by developers from Codeplex for use &amp; integration within
    their products to build rich media players based on Microsoft Silverlight
--  Multibrowser support - Safari, Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer on
    Mac and Microsoft Windows platforms.
--  Transparent operation to the end user - only initiated when a
    multicast stream file is sent to the Silverlight player
--  Failover for both server and client side play list supported
--  Low footprint
    

    
 "This is a clear step forward for enterprise video experience and
delivery. Enterprise and organizational users demand customizability and
performance in their video applications, while IT departments want
Multicast streaming capability. Together with Microsoft Silverlight, Qumu
delivers both," said Ray Hood, CEO of Qumu, Inc. "The new Qumu Multicast
Plug-In for Silverlight enables online viewers to participate and create
more meaningful experiences and to participate more directly in
organizational change, growth and communication while at the same time
reducing the network overhead from video."

    Pricing and Availability

    The new Silverlight browser plug-in is available at no cost via the
Codeplex Open Source Community website and is consistent with the terms of
the Microsoft Public License. The cross-browser plug-in works with all
Silverlight-compatible versions of Internet Explorer, Safari and Firefox
for Mac and Windows, providing the ability to receive a multicast
broadcast from a Windows Media server. Both source and binary code is
available on Codeplex, along with code samples to connect the plug-in to
the Silverlight runtime, technical documentation and sample players. Qumu
will be demonstrating the new Multicast Plug-in for Silverlight with
Microsoft at the Streaming Media East Conference and Exhibition in New
York, May 12-13. Qumu will also showcase its latest developments with
Silverlight, including the new employee generated content interface and
new Qumu Capture Studio 2 which includes Microsoft Expression Encoder and
Silverlight player. For more information on Streaming Media East, visit

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. bank regulators filed court papers this week seeking dismissal of a Texas lawsuit that claims JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) tried to gain an unfair advantage in its $1.9 billion purchase of Washington Mutual Inc's WAMUQ.PK bank last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In documents filed on Monday in federal court in Galveston, Texas, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp said the WaMu stakeholders who brought the lawsuit are trying to circumvent the FDIC claims process, and that the suit should be dismissed or moved to a court in Washington D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WaMu collapsed last year, in the largest U.S. bank failure in history.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 12 (Reuters) - U.S. bank regulators filed
court papers this week seeking dismissal of a Texas lawsuit
that claims JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) tried to gain an unfair
advantage in its $1.9 billion purchase of Washington Mutual
Inc's WAMUQ.PK bank last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In documents filed on Monday in federal court in Galveston,
Texas, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp said the WaMu
stakeholders who brought the lawsuit are trying to circumvent
the FDIC claims process, and that the suit should be dismissed
or moved to a court in Washington D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WaMu collapsed last year, in the largest U.S. bank failure
in history. The bank was seized by U.S. bank regulators on
Sept. 25 and the FDIC immediately sold its deposits to
JPMorgan. The surviving holding company filed for bankruptcy
protection a day later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the stakeholders' lawsuit filed in February claims
that Washington Mutual's crown jewels were sold to JPMorgan at

in the Texas suit "lack merit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FDIC, which was not originally named in the investors'
complaint, said it has sought to intervene in the case because
it could be held liable for JPMorgan's costs in the litigation
and that it needed to protect the FDIC receivership process
used to take control of failed banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the stakeholders have said their lawsuit is
independent of the receivership process, the FDIC said in its
court filing this week that the suit should be dismissed
because it is "especially important here to prevent the
chilling effect that impermissible suits such as this one could
have in deterring potential buyers of failed bank assets in the
future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When the FDIC became the receiver for Washington Mutual
Bank it said it agreed to protect JPMorgan Chase Bank from
costs, losses, liabilities and expenses brought by WaMu's
pre-receivership creditors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FDIC also said that JPMorgan Chase Bank sent a letter
in March notifying the FDIC-Receiver "of its intention to seek
indemnification" in this case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is American National Insurance Co v. JP Morgan
Chase  Co, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Texas

&lt;p&gt;As expected, Microsoft today patched a six week-old critical vulnerability in PowerPoint, the presentation maker that's part of the popular Office suite, using a single security update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that one update patched 14 separate vulnerabilities, 11 of which were rated "critical," Microsoft highest threat ranking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, while Microsoft patched all still-supported Windows editions of Office -- including Office 2000, Office XP, Office 2003 and Office 2007 -- it was not able to complete fixes for the three vulnerabilities that also affect Office 2004 and Office 2008 on Macs. Fixes for those editions were not ready, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first time that Microsoft has issued patches, but not plugged holes in every affected version, a fact the company itself acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We normally do not update one supported platform before another, but given this situation of a package available for an entire product line that protects the vast majority of customers at risk within the predictable release cycle, we made a decision to go early with the Windows packages," said Jonathan Ness, an engineer with the Microsoft Security Response Center, in a post to a company blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"None of the [PowerPoint] exploit samples we have analyzed will reliably exploit the Mac version, so we didn't want to hold the Windows security update while we wait for Mac packages," added Ness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, Microsoft said it would "issue updates on the regular bulletin release cycle for these product lines when testing is complete." Microsoft's next regularly-scheduled patch day is June 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Schultze, the chief technology officer at patch management vendor Shavlik Technologies, said Microsoft made the right call to push out Windows patches now. "It makes perfect sense," said Schultze, "since the zero-day attacks only worked on Windows."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early April, when Microsoft admitted that PowerPoint contained at least one vulnerability, it also noted that attack code was already circulating, at least in small numbers. Hackers exploited that flaw, and could do so with the others, by duping a user into opening a malformed PowerPoint file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 14 vulnerabilities Microsoft fixed in PowerPoint, the majority -- 10 all told -- were reported or co-reported by VeriSign iDefense, one of the two companies that pays bounties to bug hunters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The 14 was a shocker to us, too," said Rick Howard, the intelligence director at iDefense. "We generally get one a month, sometimes we get two. Many times we don't get any [in Microsoft's monthly bulletins]. We've never had this many attributed to us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 10 bugs iDefense reported to Microsoft, seven came from outside researchers, who were paid for their work, while the other three were rooted out by an internal staffer, one of half-a-dozen vulnerability researchers iDefense employs. "He's written exploit code for all three," said Howard. "The exploits aren't 100% reliable, but he thinks that with a little more work, they could be made reliable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;iDefense does not release internally-crafted exploits to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As has long been the trend with Office, older software -- in this case PowerPoint 2000 -- is much more vulnerable than newer editions. PowerPoint 2000 is affected by 11 of the 14 vulnerabilities, all rated critical. The same 11 vulnerabilities in PowerPoint 2002 and PowerPoint 2003, meanwhile, were considered only "important" or "moderate" threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"New software is better," said Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Network Security. "If anyone needed a business case to justify upgrading, the Excel vulnerabilities of February and the PowerPoint vulnerabilities from April are it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storms also downplayed the number of individual patches bundled within the single update. "You have to look beyond the 14," said Storms. "For the majority of users, the 14 won't mean much. The bigger takeaway is that the publicly exploited vulnerability is patched and that you're protected from the zero-day exploits. Think of it this way: You're getting the other 13 for free."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also used the opportunity to strip support for the ancient PowerPoint 4.0 format from PowerPoint 2000 and 2002 -- something that the company had already done in PowerPoint 2003 SP2 and SP3, and PowerPoint 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you really, really, really need to open a PowerPoint 4.0 file that you trust to not be malicious, we suggest you temporarily re-enable it, open the file, save the file in a newer format and immediately disable the older format again," said Microsoft's Ness. Users need to edit the Windows registry to re-enable the older file format; Microsoft posted instructions here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers also tackled a number of issues in the PowerPoint converter code -- the tool that lets users open and save older file formats -- according to Ness. In some cases, Microsoft "back-ported" Office 2003 SP3 code to the older Office 2000 and XP. "We hope that by doing this comprehensive update and by proactively addressing security vulnerabilities, we reduce the risk and help protect our customers from future vulnerabilities," said Ness. "This is a nice chance to catch up," said Storms. "While 14 [vulnerabilities] looks daunting, there's really only one update."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But don't think that Microsoft's caught up," cautioned Schultze. "Microsoft always has vulnerabilities backed up."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow rose on Tuesday as investors scooped up defensive shares, including Pfizer (PFE.N), while energy companies' stocks climbed as oil hit a six-month high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the SP was little changed and the Nasdaq fell as financial and technology shares declined after leading the recent rally from bear market lows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Pfizer posted the biggest percentage gain in the Dow, rising 5.5 percent to $14.93, after positive comments from analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston following a meeting with the drug company's management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy shares also supported the market as U.S. crude oil futures briefly touched $60 a barrel before settling up 35 cents at $58.85 on hopes an economic recovery may bolster fuel demand. Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) rose 2.2 percent to $70.82.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But worries over whether an apparent lack of incentives to drive the market higher would put an end to the rally helped put a cap on gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're right at the precipice and people can't decide if the rally's still got room left or if we're priced about right and due for a sell-off," said Warren Simpson, managing director at Stephens Capital Management in Little Rock, Arkansas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The safe-haven mantra is back in force a bit today because obviously, we're not out of the woods yet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 50.34 points, or 0.60 percent, to 8,469.11. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index .SPX was off 0.89 points, or 0.10 percent, to 908.35. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was down 15.32 points, or 0.88 percent, at 1,715.92.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INTEL GAINS ON CEO'S COMMENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) rose 3 percent to $15.67 in extended trade after the company's chief executive said that order and billing patterns in the second quarter so far were a little better than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Pfizer's advance during the regular session, the shares of rival drugmaker and fellow Dow component Merck (MRK.N) gained 2.4 percent to $24.98.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analyst's note suggested that Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker, would likely increase its dividend payment after it completes the acquisition of smaller rival Wyeth WYE.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola (KO.N) ranked among the Dow's biggest advancers, up 3.9 percent at $44.40 as consumer staples shares also benefited from the move into defensive stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broad SP 500 is up 34.3 percent from the March low, spurred by optimism that the financial sector and economy are showing signs of stabilization. The index closed above 900 after having briefly fallen below the key support level during the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In economic news, data showed the U.S. trade gap widened in March for the first time in eight months, signaling weak overseas demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIXED VIEWS OF STOCK OFFERINGS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the downside, shares of Ford (F.N) tumbled 17.6 percent to $5.01 a day after the automaker announced an offering of 300 million shares, while the Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N) said it sold $1.2 billion of common stock and its stock lost 3.8 percent to $28.43.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors worried that the new offerings were dilutive to existing shareholders as companies tried to raise cash to stay afloat, but others noted the ability to attract capital was a positive sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The KBW Bank Index .BKX dropped 4.2 percent, but is still more than double its March 9 closing level. Bank of America (BAC.N) was the Dow's biggest drag, down 5.3 percent at $12.26. The bank sold $7.3 billion of China Construction Bank Corp (601939.SS) shares to a group of investors, according to a source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big-cap technology companies weighed on the Nasdaq, including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), which lost 4 percent to $124.42. The Nasdaq 100 technology index .NDXT fell 1.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trading was active on the New York Stock Exchange, with about 1.61 billion shares changing hands, above last year's estimated daily average of 1.49 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 2.53 billion shares traded, above last year's daily average of 2.28 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,744 to 1,270 while on the Nasdaq, decliners beat advancers by 1,747 to 975.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Jan Paschal)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds Intel after the bell and volume figures)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Leah Schnurr&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 12 (Reuters) - The Dow rose on Tuesday as
investors scooped up defensive shares, including Pfizer
(PFE.N), while energy companies' stocks climbed as oil hit a
six-month high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the SP was little changed and the Nasdaq fell as
financial and technology shares declined after leading the
recent rally from bear market lows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Pfizer posted the biggest percentage gain in the
Dow, rising 5.5 percent to $14.93, after positive comments
from analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston following a
meeting with the drug company's management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Energy shares also supported the market as U.S. crude oil
futures CLc1 briefly touched $60 a barrel before settling up
35 cents at $58.85 on hopes an economic recovery may bolster
fuel demand. Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) rose 2.2 percent to
$70.82.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But worries over whether an apparent lack of incentives to
drive the market higher would put an end to the rally helped
put a cap on gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're right at the precipice and people can't decide if
the rally's still got room left or if we're priced about right
and due for a sell-off," said Warren Simpson, managing
director at Stephens Capital Management in Little Rock,
Arkansas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The safe-haven mantra is back in force a bit today
because obviously, we're not out of the woods yet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 50.34 points,
or 0.60 percent, to 8,469.11. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index
.SPX was off 0.89 points, or 0.10 percent, to 908.35. The
Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was down 15.32 points, or 0.88
percent, at 1,715.92.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; INTEL GAINS ON CEO'S COMMENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) rose 3 percent to
$15.67 in extended trade after the company's chief executive
said that order and billing patterns in the second quarter so
far were a little better than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition to Pfizer's advance during the regular
session, the shares of rival drugmaker and fellow Dow
component Merck (MRK.N) gained 2.4 percent to $24.98.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An analyst's note suggested that Pfizer, the world's
largest drugmaker, would likely increase its dividend payment
after it completes the acquisition of smaller rival Wyeth
WYE.N. For details, see [ID: nN12338153].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola (KO.N) ranked among the Dow's biggest advancers,
up 3.9 percent at $44.40 as consumer staples shares also
benefited from the move into defensive stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The broad SP 500 is up 34.3 percent from the March low,
spurred by optimism that the financial sector and economy are
showing signs of stabilization. The index closed above 900
after having briefly fallen below the key support level during
the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In economic news, data showed the U.S. trade gap widened
in March for the first time in eight months, signaling weak
overseas demand. [ID:nN12305876]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MIXED VIEWS OF STOCK OFFERINGS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the downside, shares of Ford (F.N) tumbled 17.6 percent
to $5.01 a day after the automaker announced an offering of
300 million shares, while the Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N)
said it sold $1.2 billion of common stock and its stock lost
3.8 percent to $28.43. [ID:nN12311784].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors worried that the new offerings were dilutive to
existing shareholders as companies tried to raise cash to stay
afloat, but others noted the ability to attract capital was a
positive sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The KBW Bank Index .BKX dropped 4.2 percent, but is
still more than double its March 9 closing level. Bank of
America (BAC.N) was the Dow's biggest drag, down 5.3 percent
at $12.26. The bank sold $7.3 billion of China Construction
Bank Corp (601939.SS) shares to a group of investors,
according to a source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Big-cap technology companies weighed on the Nasdaq,
including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), which lost 4 percent to $124.42.
The Nasdaq 100 technology index .NDXT fell 1.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trading was active on the New York Stock Exchange, with
about 1.61 billion shares changing hands, above last year's
estimated daily average of 1.49 billion, while on Nasdaq,
about 2.53 billion shares traded, above last year's daily
average of 2.28 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by
1,744 to 1,270 while on the Nasdaq, decliners beat advancers
by 1,747 to 975.

&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO May 12 (Reuters) - Cia. Brasileira de Meios de
Pagamento, the Brazilian unit of Visa Inc known as VisaNet,
filed to sell shares, resuming plans it put off last September
amid the fallout in global credit markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; VisaNet hired Bradesco BBI, the investment banking unit of
Brazil's second largest private sector bank, to manage the
offering of an undisclosed amount of common shares, the company
said in a securities filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would be the first company to go public in Brazil since
June 2008, when energy company OGX Petroleo e Gas (OGXP3.SA)
sold shares in an initial public offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VisaNet is controlled by Bradesco (BBDC4.SA), with a 39
percent stake, Banco do Brasil (BBAS3.SA), with 31 percent, and
Spain's Santander (SAN.MC), which has a 14 percent stake. Visa
International, a unit of Visa (V.N), is also part of the
control group with a 10 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock offering would be the second in Brazil this year,
after the Citigroup (C.N) sale of a stake in its credit card
unit Redecard RDCD3.SA, which was already publicly listed.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) shares rose more than 5 percent, outpacing its pharmaceutical rivals, after an analyst note suggested the world's largest drugmaker would likely increase its dividend payment after it completes the acquisition of smaller rival Wyeth WYE.N.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse analyst Catherine Arnold, after a meeting with Pfizer management, said in a research note "expectations for future cash flow suggest to us that it would be surprising if Pfizer didn't raise the dividend in the future," post Wyeth deal closure and early integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arnold, who has an "outperform" rating on Pfizer shares, also said the company may be able to finance the Wyeth deal at lower than expected interest rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the major drugmakers saw shares rise on Tuesday, with the American Stock Exchange Pharmaceutical Index .DRG up 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caris  Co analyst David Moskowitz said investors are realizing any comprehensive healthcare reform that could bring price controls and hurt drug company stocks is not imminent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're talking about implementing healthcare reform that could take as long as 2013," Moskowitz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are other priorities. It's a complex system and there's plenty of time for lobbyists to get in" to try to influence thinking, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares closed up 78 cents, or 5.5 percent, at $14.93 on the New York Stock Exchange after rising as high as $15.21 earlier in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON May 12 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on
Tuesday that hackers are seeking to attack users of its
PowerPoint presentation software for Windows PCs and released
patches to protect them against the threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The world's No. 1 software maker said that a version of
PowerPoint for Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) Mac computers is also
vulnerable, though it has yet to find any evidence that hackers
are actively seeking to exploit it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft defined the threat as "critical" -- the most
severe on the scale by which it ranks vulnerabilities to its
software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hackers are seeking to exploit the vulnerability in
PowerPoint by persuading the intended victim to open a tainted
PowerPoint file -- that they either download from a Website or
receive in an email, according to Symantec Corp (SYMC.O), the
world's top maker of security software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At that point, the attacker would then have complete
control over everything the user's account has permission to do
on the system," said Alfred Huger, a senior researcher with
Symantec.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huger said that Symantec has so far only observed a limited
number of hacker attempts to exploit the vulnerability in
PowerPoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft did not release a patch for Mac computers, though
company spokesman Christopher Budd said that one is in

&lt;p&gt;Former Advisor to Vice President Gore and President of FasterCures to Lead
Pfizer Worldwide Policy


NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc announced today that Greg Simon has joined the company as Senior Vice
President, Worldwide Policy. He comes to Pfizer from the presidency of
FasterCures, where he led efforts to reform policies governing biopharmaceutical
discovery and development, with the goal of bringing a greater number of
lifesaving medicines more quickly to doctors and patients. 

"Greg and his record of leadership are well-known to us at Pfizer," said Jeffrey
B. Kindler, chairman and chief executive officer of Pfizer. "He shares our
commitment to good health and great science, and to shaping policies that
unleash the power of innovation so that more people can gain greater access to
safe and effective new treatments. He joins us at a pivotal time as we advocate
comprehensive health care reform in the United States; move into new therapies,
such as vaccines; and bring forward a host of new treatments, including many for
cancer, to clinical trials." 

He will report to Sandy Beaty, who is currently responsible for policy and
government relations at Pfizer. Mr. Simon will assume responsibility for counsel
and action on health care, science and technology policy issues. 

"In my six years at FasterCures, I came to realize that the future of health,
both in the U.S. and around the world, depends on all sectors of society -
government, industry, academia and nonprofits - working together," said Mr.
Simon. "Having worked in government and the nonprofit sector, I believe I will
bring a unique perspective to Pfizer as it shapes its global health policy for
the future. I am thrilled to work with the excellent team at Pfizer to address
the most important issue of our time -bringing better health care and health
cures to people everywhere." 

Mr. Simon joined FasterCures, an independent, nonpartisan organization, in 2003.
A center of the California-based Milken Institute, FasterCures proposes and
pursues improvements in the biomedical research and development process. Last
October, Mr. Simon was named by the journal Nature Medicine as one of "Ten
People to Watch" in health care policy, noting that he was among "a handful of
influential people who quietly keep the wheels of biomedical science turning." 

Michael Milken, Chairman of the Milken Institute, said, "Under Greg`s
leadership, FasterCures has grown from an innovative idea to an effective
reality. He and his team have begun to change the process of medical research,
an effort that will accelerate improved treatment outcomes for people everywhere
and will produce more lifesaving cures." 

Mr. Simon was chief domestic policy advisor to Vice President Al Gore from 1993
to 1997. In that capacity, he oversaw a number of key initiatives, including
programs at the National Institutes of Health, the National Cancer Institute,
the Food and Drug Administration, and the Human Genome Project. He was also
instrumental in crafting the regulatory framework that is now the foundation for
the biotechnology industry. From 1985 to 1991, Mr. Simon was Staff Director of
the Investigations and Oversight Subcommittee of the U.S. House of
Representatives Committee on Science, Space and Technology. He served as Sen.
Gore`s Legislative Director from 1991 to 1993. 

Immediately prior to joining FasterCures, Mr. Simon was CEO of Simon
Strategies/Mindbeam, a consulting firm focusing on science and technology
issues. 

He received his law degree from the University of Washington in 1983. He has a
B.A. in history from the University of Arkansas.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. should give Windows Vista Ultimate owners a free upgrade to Windows 7, an analyst said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'd like to see a free upgrade [to Windows 7] for Vista Ultimate users," said Michael Cherry, an analyst with Directions on Microsoft. "It would buy them a lot of good will, and I don't think it would cost them much."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cherry cited Microsoft's failure to deliver on the promise of "Ultimate Extras" as his reason for urging the company to compensate users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimate Extras was one of the features Microsoft cited in the months leading up to the early-2007 release of Windows Vista Ultimate to distinguish it from lower-priced versions. According to Microsoft's marketing, Extras was to regularly provide "cutting-edge programs, innovative services and unique publications" only to Ultimate users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But users quickly took Microsoft to task for too few add-ons and a too-slow release pace. Five months after Vista's launch, critics began complaining and Microsoft said that it would do better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months later, users again blasted Microsoft as the company's self-imposed deadline for delivering more add-ons came and went without any new downloads. The last time Microsoft delivered Extras was in September 2008, when it released a puzzle game, some sound effects and three screensavers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last February, in fact, Microsoft announced that it would drop the concept from Windows 7's Ultimate edition. "Our new approach to planning and building Windows doesn't have the capacity to continue to deliver features outside the regular release cycle," a company spokeswoman said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cherry's suggestion that Microsoft give users a free upgrade to Windows 7 would be welcomed by some Ultimate owners. "Like an idiot I purchased Vista Ultimate expecting the 'extras' only Ultimate users would receive," said a Computerworld reader identified as "Garygfd" in a comment on a February story about Extras. "How-freakin'-ever, all I got was useless crap that I wouldn't download anyway. What Microsoft should do is give us Ultimate idiots a big break on Windows 7."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has not yet disclosed the pricing for Windows 7's editions, although the company will reportedly offer free or discounted upgrades to users who buy Vista PCs after July 1. According to those reports, people who buy Vista Ultimate after that date will be upgraded to Windows 7 Ultimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pricing is always the last thing for them to decide," Cherry said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Advances in semiconductor technology, favorable spectrum policy and demand for
gigabit throughput capabilities have created an opportunity for millimeter wave
radio technology to prosper. 

Applications in the mobile backhaul and consumer electronics markets in
particular will drive the creation of an over $1.5 billion dollar market for
upper millimeter-based technology in 2014, up from nearly $50 million in sales
today, according to a new Visant Strategies report. 

One of the best emerging markets for upper millimeter radio vendors is backhaul
on the E-band for growing LTE, WiMAX, and HSPA+ wireless networks, according to
report findings. Nearly 50 times the number of 60 GHz and E-Band point-to-point
radios are due to be shipped in 2014 compared to 2008, according to "Upper
Millimeter Microwave Radio: Ready to Compete 2009." 

"Use of the E-band spectrum, rapidly becoming available in most of the world,
can be looked at for connecting many mobile network elements," said Andy Fuertes
of Visant Strategies. "Prices have fallen substantially, reliability has
increased and 3.5/4G networks provide demand for E band PTP radios." 

"Mobile backhaul will be one success area, but several application areas for
upper millimeter use will grow quite significantly during the next five years,"
said Larry Swasey of Visant Strategies. WirelessHD, a silicon-based radio
operating on 60 GHz, could, in a best-case-scenario, account for nearly a
half-billion dollars in sales in 2014, the report finds, and it could parallel
the success of Bluetooth technology in the future. 

The study examines the 60 GHz, E, Q and W bands and evaluates systems above 100
GHz. Existing and future applications such as mobile backhaul, wireless
enterprise bridges, wireless fiber lateral emulations and government and public
safety networks are studied. Also examined is use within automotive collision
avoidance, security/airport imaging applications and within personal area
networks, particularly within WirelessHD. 

All application segments are quantified in either shipments, revenues or both
through 2014 and the world market for mobile backhaul utilizing upper millimeter
radio is segmented by year by region through 2014.

&lt;p&gt;REDWOOD SHORES, Calif. &amp; CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Saba Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:SABA) and IBM today announced that they are working
together to help businesses harness and develop talent. 

The companies are combining expertise to offer organizations a threefold
approach to people management. This includes human capital management services
and consulting from IBM and advanced enterprise learning solutions from Saba. In
addition, IBM will offer a new Learning Accelerator for WebSphere Portal that is
based on Saba Learning. 

The combination of IBM and Saba can help businesses save time and money by
reusing the same IT infrastructure for learning that is used for their corporate
intranet and extranet. In addition, enterprises can capitalize on the many
opportunities for informal and formal learning created by the "always on,"
collaborative and social-networking-focused culture of today`s businesses. By
combining learning opportunities with portal-based collaboration, employees,
customers and partners can participate in broader informal learning channels
making them more effective and productive. 

"Effective human capital management strategies and tools are critical to
improving the employee skill base and facilitating team collaboration, which
ultimately helps an organization align workforce and business strategy to create
high-performance people, while managing administrative costs," said Tim Ringo,
global leader, IBM Human Capital Management practice. 

"IBM`s approach of combining our industry leading portal software and Human
Capital Management consulting services with Saba`s world-class learning software
is a winning combination for our customers," added Larry Bowden, vice president
of portals and mashups, IBM Lotus. 

"Saba looks forward to expanding our relationship with IBM to offer our proven
learning management solutions and expertise to the Lotus community," said Bobby
Yazdani, chairman and CEO for Saba. "With Saba, Lotus customers will have a
robust platform to improve key business processes, increase revenues and reduce
costs." 

As part of Saba`s unified people management platform, Saba Learning is a
comprehensive management system for formal and informal learning that enables
organizations to identify, manage, develop and measure the capabilities and
knowledge of people throughout an enterprise, as well as empower them to connect
and contribute their expertise. Saba Learning provides organizations with
leading capabilities for catalog and curriculum management; compliance,
continuing education, and competency management; for-profit training; content
development and management; virtual learning; informal learning; and
collaboration. 

IBM Global Business Services` worldwide human capital management practice

&lt;p&gt;  BELMONT, CA, May 12 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
FaceTime Communications, the leading provider of solutions enabling the
safe use of Web 2.0 and unified communications in the enterprise, today
introduced key new capabilities for its IMAuditor security and compliance
software. IMAuditor now monitors SMS messages sent by corporate
BlackBerry users and provides real-time visibility and logging of group
chats conducted via Microsoft's Office Communications Server (OCS).

    FaceTime IMAuditor ensures security, management and compliance for
unified communications -- from presence and instant messaging to
conferencing and voice -- and has been continually developed to meet new
challenges since its debut in 2001.

    Support for BlackBerry Messaging

    The new IMAuditor version 9.7 integrates with BlackBerry Enterprise Server
to capture SMS and PIN messages (PIN allows users to send messages between
BlackBerry devices based on their personal identification numbers). This
enables managers to monitor messages sent by corporate BlackBerry users,
an increasingly important requirement for companies in regulated
industries such as financial services, healthcare and energy. For
example, regulations in the financial services sector, such as the US's
SEC and the UK's FSA as well as other regional financial services
authorities, demand that all electronic records -- including
communication sent via instant messaging and SMS -- be logged and
archived.

    Beyond the financial services sector, the advent of broad-based
regulations, such as PCI, Sarbox and e-Discovery requirements, makes it
increasingly important to monitor, control and archive enterprise
messaging. The growing popularity of BlackBerries represents a new
messaging channel that needs to be addressed.

    "As mobile devices -- led by the BlackBerry platform -- become more widely
deployed, a greater proportion of corporate data will be sent from and to
these devices," said Michael Osterman, President of Osterman Research,
Inc. "Organizations that do not adequately manage and archive the content
on these devices run the risk of creating serious regulatory, legal and
data management problems that they could easily avoid."

    "President Obama, a well-known BlackBerry user, announced his running mate
using SMS, clearly demonstrating that this form of communication is both
highly effective and an accepted professional tool," said Kailash Ambwani,
chief executive officer for FaceTime. "Yet, many companies can't allow
their employees to use any communication tool that cannot be tracked. With
IMAuditor 9.7, we enable our customers to use SMS and PIN messages on
their corporate BlackBerries -- safely increasing productivity."

    IMAuditor 9.7 also provides real-time monitoring and compliance
capabilities for group chats within Microsoft's OCS. This functionality
was recently introduced in OCS Release R2 and allows users to create
topic-based chat rooms. IMAuditor gives visibility into who joined and who
left a particular chat room, and when. Management can therefore determine
exactly who was privy to certain parts of the conversation. While group
chat is a new feature in OCS, it's been available as a stand-alone
application for several years and has developed a large user-base over
time, hence the need for a solution to monitor these electronic
conversations. As a Gold Level ISV Partner of Microsoft, FaceTime is the
only vendor that provides this capability.

    IMAuditor is used by Fortune 1000 companies including nine of the top 10
U.S. banks and the majority of global financial services firms to secure
and manage real-time communications. IMAuditor ensures that instant
messaging and unified communications platforms can be safely used without
compromising security, allowing information leakage or impacting
productivity. IMAuditor is also used to meet  regulatory and corporate
requirements, including e-Discovery, which demand logging, archiving and
easy retrieval of messaging communications.

    About IMAuditor

    FaceTime IMAuditor is a full-featured proxy that secures and manages all
public and enterprise unified communications use over an organization's
network. The IMAuditor, which resides on the Local Area Network, scans the
system and applies established policies to all the popular types of files
transferred over unified communications platforms. This includes Microsoft
OCS and IBM Lotus Sametime, as well as public networks such as AIM, Yahoo!
Messenger, GoogleTalk, Windows Live (MSN), and now BlackBerry messaging.

    The software analyzes and detects sensitive or confidential information in
both messages and file attachments, prevents transmission of the
information, and warns users about established company policy regarding
the sharing of corporate intellectual property.

    IMAuditor maintains an integrated trust relationship with FaceTime's
secure Web gateway appliance, the  Unified Security Gateway (USG).
Working together, IMAuditor and USG deliver complete end-to-end security,
management and compliance for real-time communications in the enterprise,
ensuring that corporate data is protected both from outside threats such
as spyware, viruses and worms, as well as from intentional or
unintentional information leakage from within the company.

    IMAuditor 9.7 is available now from FaceTime and authorized distributors,
resellers and partners worldwide. For pricing and additional information,
call 1-888-349-3223 or visit www.facetime.com.

&lt;p&gt;Long, Short Range RFID and Sensors Enabled for Improving Business Intelligence
DALLAS--(Business Wire)--
Axcess International Inc. (OTCBB: AXSI), a leader in automated identification,
tracking and sensing solutions, announced today that it successfully implemented
its patented Micro-Wireless system into the Microsoft BizTalk Server platform.
BizTalk Server 2009 provides a solution that allows organizations to more easily
connect disparate systems, and then process the composite of information through
pre-defined rules to automate new areas of business operations. The
collaboration between Axcess and Microsoft Corp. will enable the collection of
previously unavailable real-time business activity information through Axcess`
"active" RFID system which wirelessly enables assets, personnel and sensors. The
strategic relationship results in an expanded set of tools that customers can
use to drive productivity. BizTalk Server is used by ninety percent of the
Global 100, including the majority of retailers, hotel chains and the largest
U.S. companies in pharmaceuticals, chemicals, railroads, telecommunications and
aerospace and defense, opening additional sales avenues to Axcess. 

Including over 25 multi-platform adapters and a robust messaging infrastructure,
BizTalk Server provides connectivity between core systems inside and outside
your organization. In addition to integration functionality, BizTalk Server also
provides strong durable messaging, a rules engine, EDI connectivity, Business
Activity Monitoring (BAM), RFID capabilities and IBM Host/Mainframe
connectivity. BizTalk Server 2009 helps organizations meet the challenges of
integrating diverse systems. Most organizations have a multitude of systems and
technologies that are required for their daily operations. By bringing these
technologies together in an agile and scalable way, BizTalk Server 2009 can help
unleash the potential of your existing infrastructure. 

Axcess` systems for business and government use specialized Micro-Wireless
technology to wirelessly enable "things" for real time business activity
automation solutions. The systems directly increase productivity, security,
safety and offer short term ROI`s in traditional industries. Via its
Micro-Wireless communications, Axcess transforms common manual identification
products into wireless devices capable of automated identification, tracking and
sensing. Axcess turns manual property labels, bar codes, etc. into wireless
asset tags capable of automating enterprise asset management. Axcess has
numerous reference solutions in automatic asset inventory, locating, tracking
and protection. Axcess turns manual access control badges into wireless
personnel credentials for advanced workforce management, safety and security.
These include such applications as contractor time and attendance data
collection, visitor tracking for security and compliance, safety tracking and
compliance reporting, and workforce time and motion data collection and
productivity management. Systems are also used for advanced worker location
determination and emergency evacuation management. 

"Microsoft BizTalk Server provides a simple, consistent interface into
enterprise systems to enable customers to more easily unleash new business
productivity automation solutions," said Allan Griebenow, President and CEO of
Axcess International. "Micro-Wireless technology opens a whole new horizon of
automation opportunities." 

Micro-Wireless communications has been proven to represent the technological
sweet spot where autonomous wireless identification and data transfer are best
enabled in very small, low cost battery-powered devices. Regardless of their
hardware platform or form factor, devices or tags commonly called DotsTM,
operate in their own wireless frequency. This unlicensed frequency is
characterized by the FCC for "remote control devices," yet it is recognized as a
standard frequency worldwide. Dot message formats, air data transmission
protocol and receiver infrastructure are designed specifically for the unique
need, independent from interference and unobtrusive to backbone networks. 

The unique aspect of Axcess` Micro-Wireless technology is that the powered
wireless devices attached to assets and personnel autonomously collect their
exact location ID and status that can be provided directly to Microsoft BizTalk
Server without a central processing element required by RFID and RTLS systems.
Micro-Wireless also eclipses other wireless technologies such as cell phones,
EPC-RFID, Ultra-Wideband (UWB), Zig-Bee, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth which are not
suited to the automated monitoring of personnel and assets in the enterprise
because of unacceptable cost, size, reliability, infrastructure and power
consumption constraints. 

Axcess will present a free webinar on May 19 from 9:00 to 10:00 a.m. (CDT) that
focuses on the opportunities unveiled by the Microsoft and Axcess strategic
relationship. Register through the Web site at www.axcessinc.com, or click to

Automated Wireless People Management Systems.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN DIEGO, CA, May 12 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Green Star Alternative Energy, Inc. (PINKSHEETS: GSAE) announces
negotiations with 'GE Energy' Development Group for South East Europe.
Executives from 'GE Energy' met with Green Star's Serbian partner --
Notos -- in Belgrade for an exchange of experience and knowledge in the
area of wind data collection, and to consider the future of wind power
development in the Republic of Serbia.

    The two day meeting was initiated by GE and organized within the context
of the GE 'Strategy for South Eastern Europe.' The appropriate and skilled
expansion of wind energy into the South East European electricity market
was the foremost topic on the agenda. This focus will provide the
foundation for GE to work in partnership with Notos in establishing the
necessary framework for the development and execution of future
alternative energy projects.

    GE intends to do so specifically "... by increasing the cooperation
between experts from GE and Notos in evaluating and organising the
platform from which the projects will be executed. This shall be achieved
with close cooperation with the Serbian government and Ministry of
Energy." Mr. Neven Pecotic, Director of the GE Energy Development Group
for South East Europe, elaborates, "After several years of preparatory
activities and cooperation with the Balkan State Members, GE has been
instrumental in helping them develop balanced national energy strategies,
set up inter-ministerial coordination mechanisms, and create national
focal points and energy information networks. Now, we distinguish in
Notos, a young company with the necessary qualities and management acumen
to see projects through the development phases on to completion."

    Preparations are currently underway for the follow-up meeting which will
take place in Belgrade during the month of May. Notos and the expert group
from GE will chart the course of action on the implementation of renewable
energies, in South East Europe, from 2009 onwards.

    Mike Andric, CEO of Green Star Alternative Energy, stated: "I believe GE
values our Serbian expertise, and I look forward to furthering our
discussions on the development of alternative energy in the region."

    About Green Star Alternative Energy (GSAE.PK)

    Green Star Alternative Energy is an environmentally conscious, renewable
energy company working to develop more than 300 MW (megawatts) of clean
electricity through wind energy. The corporate revenue model is two-fold:
the use of a renewable resource allows not only for the creation of
environmentally friendly energy, but the granting of carbon (greenhouse
gas) emission credits which may be traded and sold. Green Star is
pursuing a significant opportunity to provide clean energy to the growing
Republic of Serbia and neighbouring European countries. Through a joint
venture with key wind farm and power trading company Notos, Green Star
will become the nation's first developer of wind power. GSAE is focused
on green technology and sustainable energy programs like wind turbines,
hydro electric power generation, and other renewable electricity models.

    About GE Energy

    GE Energy is a multinational American technology and services
conglomerate, and one of the world's largest companies. "GE is one of the
world's leading wind turbine suppliers. With over 10,000 worldwide wind
turbine installations comprising more than 15,000 MW of capacity, our
knowledge and expertise spans more than two decades." (Source:

&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp Chief Executive Steve Ballmer on Tuesday said speculation the company may buy German software firm SAP was a 'random rumor.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I have nothing to say about rumors of acquisitions ... positively or negatively," he told reporters in Mumbai, when asked about an acquisition of SAP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It strikes me as a random rumor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's top software firm, on Monday sold a $3.75 billion debt issue, sparking talk that it could be readying a bid for the German firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAP's Co-Chief Executive Leo Apothekar said on Monday he believed the business software maker should stay independent, following the fresh speculation in European markets that Microsoft could bid for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rumors have periodically surfaced that either IBM or Microsoft might acquire the German firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAY-OFFS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said Microsoft's plan to lay off 5,000 people globally over 18 months to save $1.5 billion annually, was mostly completed, as long as the economy did not markedly deteriorate further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Assuming the economy only stays as bad as it is and doesn't get dramatically worse we will finish our plan, but if it gets dramatically worse again, which I guess is conceivable, we will debate again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said Microsoft was hiring in some areas, although he would not be drawn on whether staff numbers in India would rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are global additions and it is a little hard to separate our work globally from our work in India."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has about 5,000 employees in India, the largest workforce outside the United States, a situation that was unlikely to change, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by John Mair)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 12 (Reuters) - Rochdale Securities analyst Richard Bove
raised his price targets on Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
saying it stands to benefit from volume increases, and on
Morgan Stanley (MS.N) citing its new balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "The world has changed dramatically in the past two months.
The month of April was a substantial improvement for financial
companies compared to a very dismal March. May is better than
April," the veteran banking analyst wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He raised his price target on Goldman Sachs' stock to $200
from $152 and that on Morgan Stanley to $35 from $30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bove said it appears that the volume of activity has risen
in the equity markets and merger activity is about to start
again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman stands to benefit as it is involved in the large
MA deals and as volumes will increase, the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This quarter may be well above street expectations while
(Goldman) stock is ready to make another run higher," Bove
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, the analyst said Morgan Stanley has reduced the
size of its balance sheet by $570 billion to a level of $625
billion in the past 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley now has larger dependence on deposits and
long-term debt and also continues to add common equity raising
$4.0 billion more in the past few days, putting it in a strong
defensive position, Bove said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Based on its new balance sheet structure, the firm is
likely to take a more aggressive stance in trading and
investment banking," the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares, which have surged 45 percent over the past
three months, closed at $135.78 Monday on the New York Stock
Exchange. Morgan Stanley shares closed at $26.07.

ICICI Bank Limited (NYSE: IBN), India`s second-largest Bank and India`s largest

relationship that will enable ICICI`s New York Branch to issue Visa Debit cards
in the U.S., extending the convenience and worldwide acceptance of Visa Debit
cards to the bank`s increasingly global customer base.

customers to pay securely and conveniently for every type of purchase. Visa
Debit makes an important contribution to enhancing our relationship with our
most valued customers." 

The Global Indian Account provides customers with simultaneous access to a US$
Checking account at the Bank`s New York Branch for use in the U.S. and a Rupee
NRE account at ICICI Bank Limited for their use in India. The US$ Checking
account will come with a Visa Debit card that can be used at millions of
merchant locations and ATMs worldwide; the accounts will have Internet banking
capabilities for electronic fund transfers - including cross border remittances
- and will primarily be targeted at the large Indian expatriate community
working in the U.S. 

"This new debit offering reflects ICICI`s commitment to finding innovative ways
to meet the evolving payment needs of its growing and geographically-distributed
customer base," said Stacey Pinkerd, head of global consumer debit products,
Visa Inc. "We look forward to continuing to work closely with ICICI in
identifying new opportunities to tailor Visa`s highly versatile debit platform
to serve their customers and grow their global business," he concluded.

ICICI Bank`s New York branch focuses on corporate banking, including working
capital, treasury solutions, trade finance and long-term lending focusing on
India-US business linkages, and the local banking needs of non-resident Indians.

&lt;p&gt; * Hopes of stable govt spark short covering after 2-day
fall

 (Updates to close)

 By Pratish Narayanan

 MUMBAI, May 12 (Reuters) - Indian shares snapped a two-day
fall and rallied 4.1 percent on Tuesday to their highest close
in more than seven months as investors began betting the
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led group, which is seen as market
friendly, would win national elections.

 Traders said the market was boosted by hopes the next
government would not need the support of communists, who had
stalled reforms when they allied with the ruling Congress
party-led coalition for most of its five-year term.

 "There is speculation that the election will result in the
formation of a stable government that excludes the left," said
T.S. Harihar, senior vice president at ICICI Securities.

 The BJP-led group, which suffered a shock election defeat
in 2004 and was trailing for weeks in the month-long elections,
may now be gaining momentum against a fumbling ruling Congress
party coalition thanks to some savvy alliance building.
[ID:nISL443528]

 Exit polls will be announced after the last round of voting
ends on Wednesday and the election results are due on Saturday.

 The process of coalition formation following the election
results could be chaotic, Credit Suisse analyst Nilesh Jasani
said in a note. "The only thing predictable in such events is
the unpredictability," he said.

 The 30-share BSE index .BSESN rose 4.07 percent, or
475.04 points, to 12,158.03, its highest close since Oct. 3.
All but one of its components advanced, after choppy trading
through the first half of the session, with the benchmark
falling as much as 0.5 percent at one stage.

 Energy giant Reliance Industries (RELI.BO) and leading
lenders such as State Bank of India (SBI.BO), ICICI Bank
(ICBK.BO) and HDFC Bank (HDBK.BO) led the gains.

 The BSE index, which had fallen more than 3.5 percent in
the previous two sessions, has jumped 51 percent since hitting
a 2009 low in early March and is up 26 percent this year after
slumping 52 percent in 2008.

 Analysts said the market would likely see more volatility
when exit polls are released.

 "Short-term investors will trade on the exit polls. Those
with a longer-term view will wait for the actual results to
come out," Anand Shah, head of equities at Canara Robeco Mutual
Fund, said.

 Traders said investors shrugged off weak economic data.

 Industrial output fell at its steepest annual pace in at
least 14 years in March, leaving the door open for further
interest rate cuts by the central bank.

 Factory output in March fell 2.3 percent from a year
earlier, the third fall in the past four months and much
sharper than market expectations of a 0.5 percent decline.
[ID:nDEL155586]

 Analysts said the economy was still set for recovery from
late 2009.

 "We still believe the economy is set for a rebound in the
second half of the 2009/10 fiscal year due to fundamental
reasons such as fiscal stimulus packages, monetary actions,
extra oil and gas output later this year and falling commodity
prices and robust domestic demand, " said Robert
Prior-Wandesforde, Senior Asian Economist at HSBC in Singapore.

 Reliance Industries, which has the biggest weight in the
main index, rose 5.3 percent to 1,958.30 rupees, its best close
in almost 7-   months.

 Private-sector lender ICICI Bank gained 6.7 percent to
558.65 rupees, while rival HDFC Bank climbed 3.9 percent to
1,189.70 rupees. Government-run State Bank of India advanced
2.8 percent to 1,295.45 rupees.

 No. 2 outsourcer Infosys rose 5.5 percent to 1,597.95
rupees.     In the broader section, gainers led losers 1,410 to
1,106 on relatively moderate volume of 423 million shares.

 The 50-share NSE index .NSEI rose 3.6 percent to
3,681.10.

 MAIN TOP 3 BY VOLUME

 * Unitech (UNTE.BO) on 30.2 million shares

 * Suzlon Energy (SUZL.BO) on 21.6 million shares

 * HDIL (HDIL.BO) on 11.1 million shares

 STOCKS THAT MOVED

 * Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd (MOFS.BO) leapt 18.3
percent to 115.60 rupees after the financial services firm
posted a 23 percent rise in March quarter net profit after
market hours on Monday.

 * United Breweries (UBBW.BO), India's largest beer maker,
gained 5 percent to 122.55 rupees after a newspaper report said
it would bottle and distribute Heineken (HEIN.AS) brands in the
country and get a one-time fee of 3 billion rupees ($60.5
million). [ID:nBOM18891]

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, more quotes, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Janaki Krishnan  Bharghavi Nagaraju&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI May 12 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) Chief
Executive Steve Ballmer on Tuesday said speculation the company
may buy German software firm SAP (SAPG.DE) was a 'random
rumour.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I have nothing to say about rumours of acquisitions ...
positively or negatively," he told reporters in Mumbai, when
asked about an acquisition of SAP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It strikes me as a random rumour."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, the world's top software firm, on Monday sold a
$3.75 billion debt issue, sparking talk that it could be
readying a bid for the German firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAP's Co-Chief Executive Leo Apothekar said on Monday he
believed the business software maker should stay independent,
following the fresh speculation in European markets that
Microsoft could bid for it. [ID:nN11524386]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rumours have periodically surfaced that either IBM (IBM.N)
or Microsoft might acquire the German firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LAY-OFFS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer said Microsoft's plan to lay off 5,000 people
globally over 18 months to save $1.5 billion annually, was
mostly completed, as long as the economy did not markedly
deteriorate further.
 "Assuming the economy only stays as bad as it is and doesn't
get dramatically worse we will finish our plan, but if it gets
dramatically worse again, which I guess is conceivable, we will
debate again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer said Microsoft was hiring in some areas, although
he would not be drawn on whether staff numbers in India would
rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These are global additions and it is a little hard to
separate our work globally from our work in India."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has about 5,000 employees in India, the largest
workforce outside the United States, a situation that was
unlikely to change, he said.

&lt;p&gt;Estudo da Harvard Kennedy School e da International Finance Corporation
divulgado hoje avalia o modelo de centros de distribui&#231;&#227;o manual da Coca-Cola na
&#193;frica
ATLANTA, Ge&#243;rgia, EUA--(Business Wire)--
Durante debate na Institui&#231;&#227;o Brookings, realizado hoje, o ex-presidente Bill
Clinton, Muhtar Kent, presidente e diretor executivo da The Coca-Cola Company, e
Pat Woertz, chairman, diretora executiva e presidente da Archer Daniels Midland
Company, discutiram meios de a empresa criar valor tanto para os acionistas
quanto para a sociedade. Eles enfatizaram o valor de aproveitar as principais
atividades da empresa para promover o crescimento e o desenvolvimento,
especialmente nos mercados emergentes. 

O programa do Centro de distribui&#231;&#227;o manual (Manual Distribution Center - MDC)
do sistema Coca-Cola na &#193;frica foi mencionado como exemplo de solu&#231;&#227;o inovadora
que promove tanto as metas da empresa quanto o cronograma de desenvolvimento
internacional. A abordagem da Coca-Cola para a distribui&#231;&#227;o de seus produtos em
&#225;reas urbanas e de periferia de dif&#237;cil acesso da &#193;frica utiliza pequenas
empresas que entregam os produtos da Coca-Cola manualmente para pequenos
varejistas locais. O programa MDC &#233; respons&#225;vel por mais de oitenta por cento
das vendas da empresa no Leste Africano, criando assim oportunidades de
participa&#231;&#227;o de pequenas empresas e empregos para um n&#250;mero crescente de novos
empres&#225;rios e mulheres. At&#233; hoje, o sistema Coca-Cola criou mais de dois mil e
quinhentos desses Centros na &#193;frica, empregando mais de doze mil pessoas e
gerando mais de US$ 500 milh&#245;es em receitas anuais. 

"Para a Coca-Cola, os Centros de Distribui&#231;&#227;o Manual s&#227;o um &#243;timo exemplo de
como as empresas podem ter como foco o atendimento das necessidades dos clientes
e consumidores enquanto apoiam a sustentabilidade das comunidades", declarou
Muhtar Kent, chairman e diretor executivo da The Coca-Cola Company. "H&#225; muito
tempo, tem sido nossa filosofia encarar nosso sistema de neg&#243;cios holisticamente
e determinar onde podemos conseguir maior impacto com iniciativas de progresso,
iniciativas essas cr&#237;ticas para as comunidades e os investidores de quem
dependemos". 

A empresa se comprometeu a aumentar gradualmente o n&#250;mero de centros na &#193;frica
desde que se uniu &#224; "Chamada para a A&#231;&#227;o" das empresas, uma iniciativa que
mobiliza grandes empresas para ajudar a atingir as metas de desenvolvimento do
mil&#234;nio, canalizando as principais compet&#234;ncias das empresas. Para determinar o
melhor m&#233;todo de ampliar seu modelo, a Coca-Cola solicitou &#224; Iniciativa de
responsabilidade social corporativa da Harvard Kennedy School e &#224; International
Finance Corporation (IFC) uma an&#225;lise da sua abordagem. 

Durante o ano de 2008, foi realizada uma an&#225;lise das opera&#231;&#245;es atuais do modelo
de centros de distribui&#231;&#227;o manual em Dar es Salaam, Tanz&#226;nia e Addis Ababa,
Eti&#243;pia. 

"Cresce o reconhecimento nas comunidades corporativas e de desenvolvimento
internacional de que a contribui&#231;&#227;o mais sustent&#225;vel que as empresas podem
oferecer para reduzir a pobreza &#233; realizar suas principais atividades de
neg&#243;cios de modo lucrativo, respons&#225;vel e inclusivo", disse Jane Nelson da
Harvard Kennedy School. 

"Nossa an&#225;lise dos Centros de distribui&#231;&#227;o Manual na Tanz&#226;nia e na Eti&#243;pia
demonstra o potencial de grandes corpora&#231;&#245;es para a cria&#231;&#227;o de conex&#245;es de
neg&#243;cios economicamente vi&#225;veis com pequenas empresas em suas cadeias de valor,
que tamb&#233;m podem trazer benef&#237;cios para o desenvolvimento", declarou o Diretor
do IFC, Toshiya Masuoka. 

A pesquisa identificou uma s&#233;rie de oportunidades para melhorar ainda mais o
enfoque dos centros, incluindo: 1) investir em melhorias cont&#237;nuas do modelo
principal de neg&#243;cios atrav&#233;s de maior acesso a financiamentos e a treinamento
ampliado e melhorado e melhorado; 2) ampliar as oportunidades socioecon&#244;micas
para os propriet&#225;rios e funcion&#225;rios dos centros atrav&#233;s de oportunidades de

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska May 13 (Reuters) - Settlement talks with
the state of Alaska are under way to resolve differences over
Point Thomson, an Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) manager said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Point Thomson is a long-dormant oil and gas field on the
eastern North Slope where Alaska officials have started the
process of yanking leases but where oil companies are waging a
legal battle to keep the properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Point Thomson holds hundreds of millions of crude oil and
natural gas liquids, along with an estimated 8 trillion to 9
trillion cubic feet of natural gas, according to Alaska
officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; State officials have been pushing for years for Exxon and
its partners -- BP (BP.L), Chevron (CVX.N) and ConocoPhillips
(COP.N) -- to start producing the liquids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil, the operator of the disputed oil field, and
its partners have been engaged in settlement discussions with
the state that should produce an agreement "this year," said
Craig Haymes, Alaska production manager for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We look forward to working with them to resolve all
issues. I think we'll get a result," Haymes told reporters
after speaking at an annual Alaska Oil and Gas Association
forum. "I'm optimistic we can resolve this. We need to,
otherwise we risk impacting first production."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Displeasure over the companies' pace of work led the
Department of Natural Resources in 2005 to start the process of
revoking leases for nonperformance. Some of the leases date
back to the 1960s, before the discovery of oil at Prudhoe Bay,
and Exxon and its partners had reneged on contractual
obligations of diligent development, the state argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  An interim administrative decision issued in January by
Natural Resources Commissioner Tom Irwin allowed Exxon and its
partners to hold on to two of Point Thomson's 45 leases and to
drill two wells there through 2010. They will be the first
wells drilled at Point Thomson since 1982, according to state
officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon and its partners now plan to start production of at
least 10,000 barrels a day of liquids by 2014, and have pledged
to spend $1.3 billion on the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After building a 50-mile ice road and an ice airstrip and
mobilizing a huge drill rig and other equipment over the past
three months, Exxon last Friday started drilling one of the
wells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If an agreement can be reached with the state, Exxon will
quickly expand the development plan from two wells to five,
Haymes said. The additional wells, to be drilled in 2012 and
2013, would target oil but could be converted to natural-gas
producers if needed, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Point Thomson development has been stymied by challenging
conditions -- extremely high reservoir pressure, thick oil and
remoteness -- as well as the legal disputes over the leases,
Haymes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Drilling there requires a specially designed rig larger
than the Statue of Liberty, and the two wells in the current
plan will cost Exxon and its partners nearly $500 million,
compared to the $6 million to $8 million cost of drilling a
typical Prudhoe Bay well, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's nothing like it in the world," he said of Point
Thomson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nonetheless, he told the industry audience, Exxon is
optimistic about its prospects in Alaska. The company this year
is spending over $1 billion in the state, which is 10 percent
to 15 percent more than last year's spending levels, he said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) reaffirmed its earnings outlook for this year and 2010, saying its focus on high-margin software and its geographic diversity would help buffer the impact of a weak economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Sam Palmisano said on Wednesday that International Business Machines Corp is still targeting earnings of $10 to $11 per share for 2010, slightly above the average analyst estimate of around $9.90, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also repeated its earnings forecast of "at least $9.20" per share in 2009. That compared with the average analyst forecast of $9.11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said IBM's targets were possible even if revenue at constant currency, which excludes the impact of currency fluctuations, fell 7 percent in 2009, or was flat in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, IBM has been shifting its focus to software and services from increasingly commoditized hardware. Palmisano said this means it can rely on a steadier stream of revenue, rather than more volatile equipment sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software and services account for around 80 percent of IBM's revenue, compared to around 50 in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are not like the other companies in the IT industry," Palmisano said at an annual meeting with analysts in New York. "We don't have the dependency."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's first-quarter revenue fell 11 percent, or around 4 percent at constant currency, from a year earlier, but cost cuts helped limit the fall in net profit. Analysts are expecting revenue to fall 7.5 percent in 2009 and rise 2.1 percent in 2010, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palmisano also believed it was now a perfect opportunity to invest in future growth, but the company would not do "crazy deals." The priority of any acquisition would be successful integration rather than deal size, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not about size, it's about success odds -- can we integrate this, can we get the financial returns," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM last month failed to clinch a deal for server and software maker Sun Microsystems Inc JAVA.O, which agreed to be bought by Oracle Corp ORCL.O instead for more than $7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares fell 1.62 percent to $102.26 on the New York Stock Exchange, a more moderate decline for key U.S. indices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ritsuko Ando; Editing by Dave Zimmerman, Andre Grenon, Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds quote, details on projects)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LA JOLLA, Calif. May 13 (Reuters) - OPEC-related output
cuts at Chevron's (CVX.N) oil fields in Venezuela have held
steady at between 50,000 and 70,000 barrels per day in recent
months, a company executive said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ali Moshiri, head of Chevron's Latin American operations,
said 20,000 to 40,000 bpd of the gross cuts were at the Boscan
field and 30,000 bpd were at its Petropiar development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Venezuela definitely follows the OPEC quota," Moshiri told
reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has enjoyed a better relationship with the
Venezuelan government than other U.S. companies and it is
looking at opportunities to expand its heavy oil upgrading
joint-venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Petropiar project, formerly known as Hamaca, is one of
four heavy oil production and upgrading projects that pump
crude oil from Venezuela's vast Orinoco heavy oil belt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are three or four basins in Latin America that you
can't ignore: the basins in Mexico, the basins in Venezuela and
the basins in Brazil. Those are the basins that can change the
portfolio of a company," Moshiri said in a speech at a
conference organized by the Institute of the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Venezuela recetly said it would nationalize the oil
services industry leading to speculation that political risk in
the OPEC nation was on the rise again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Moshiri said he was confident Chevron's existing
investments in the country were secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The problem in Venezuela is not what we have. The
challenge for Venezuela is where do we go from here," Moshiri
said.

&lt;p&gt;Builds on existing agreement to provide reload services for all AccountNow card
programs
MINNEAPOLIS &amp; SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
MoneyGram International (NYSE: MGI), a leading provider of global payment
services, and AccountNow, the innovative award-winning prepaid card marketer,
today announced an agreement to launch a new Visa-branded prepaid card available
at select MoneyGram agent locations starting in June 2009. The agreement builds
on an existing relationship wherein MoneyGram is providing consumers with the
convenience of adding funds to their AccountNow reloadable prepaid cards at any
of its 40,000 MoneyGram ExpressPayment&#174; locations across the United States.

card to our customer base. And, MoneyGram, with its 40,000 locations in the
United States, brings a new level of convenience to AccountNow customers." 

Matt Montes, founder of AccountNow, said: "The value of working with MoneyGram
on this co-brand card will be realized everyday by the thousands of consumers
who sign up for this card. Consumers will save money and time with every use.
This partnership fits perfectly with AccountNow`s strategy to work only with the
world`s best organizations that share our philosophy of providing services to
truly benefit our customers." 

Brian Triplett, head of global prepaid products, Visa Inc., added: "At a time
when more consumers are focused on managing their finances, prepaid products can
be a helpful budgeting tool, while empowering consumers with a better way to
make everyday purchases, pay bills and receive payroll deposits. Prepaid is a
key priority for Visa, and we are excited to work with MoneyGram and AccountNow
to extend access to prepaid products and services to financially underserved
consumers."

&lt;p&gt;Data across 9 Compounds Targeting Multiple Tumor Types to Be Presented
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer will present new data highlighting the company`s commitment to a
personalized approach to oncology clinical research, which includes the use of
targeted agents in specific patient populations in several advanced and
difficult-to-treat cancers. These data will be presented later this month at the
45th Annual American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting in
Orlando from May 29 to June 2. 

"Pfizer Oncology is building upon the foundation of our marketed agents Sutent,
Camptosar, and Aromasin. Our research is focused on bridging new insights into
cellular targets and causative pathways with therapies designed to inhibit those
processes. In this way, we hope to bring the right drug to the right patient at
the right time. Presentations made at this year`s ASCO meeting will demonstrate
the progress that we are making towards that goal," said Dr. Mace Rothenberg,
senior vice president of clinical development and medical affairs for Pfizer`s
Oncology Business Unit. 

Pfizer will present data evaluating PF-002341066 (Abstract #3509; May 30), an
investigational oral medicine that is a dual inhibitor of mesenchymal epithelial
transition growth factor (c-Met), a receptor commonly altered in human cancers
across a variety of solid tumor types, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK).
Results from an expansion cohort of a Phase 1 study in patients with non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC), carrying ALK fusion genes, will be presented. ALK
fusion genes have a unique genetic feature, including the echinoderm
microtubule-associate protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK translocation. PF-002341066 is
the first agent in clinical development that selectively targets this unique
genetic feature present in some NSCLC patients. 

Pfizer will also present data (Abstract #8072; May 30) from a Phase 2 study of
figitumumab (CP-751,871), an investigational fully-human monoclonal antibody
against the Insulin-like Growth Factor type 1 receptor (IGF-1R), in squamous
cell lung cancer, which accounts for approximately 25 to 30 percent of all NSCLC
cases. The IGF-1R pathway is thought to be one of the fundamental signaling
pathways that leads to uncontrolled growth and survival of tumor cells and may
represent an important resistance mechanism against epidermal growth factor
(EGFR) inhibitors. 

Prognostic and Predictive Factors

Additional Pfizer data will focus on prognostic and predictive factors which may
help identify sub-groups of patients who may be most likely to benefit from
various treatments.

* Prognostic factors for overall survival among patients with first-line
metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) treated with Sutent&#174;(sunitinib malate)
(Abstract #5042; May 29) 
* Diastolic blood pressure and pharmacokinetics as possible predictors of
activity in mRCC patients treated with axitinib, an investigational agent
(Abstract #5045; May 29) 
* Phase 1b/2 study results evaluating serum markers of the IGF-1R pathway
inhibition in NSCLC patients treated with figitumumab plus paclitaxel and
carboplatin (Abstract #3539; May 29)

Additional Presentations of Pfizer Data

NSCLC

* Phase 1 study of axitinib plus chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC
and other solid tumors (Abstract #3559; May 30) 
* Phase 2 data examining the safety and efficacy of PF-00299804, an oral,
selective, irreversible pan-HER inhibitor, in patients with advanced NSCLC who
have failed at least one chemotherapy treatment and prior treatment with
erlotinib (Abstract #8063; May 30)

Genitourinary Tumors

* A sub-analysis of a Phase 3 study evaluating the quality of life with Sutent
versus interferon-alfa in patients with previously untreated mRCC (Abstract
#6529; May 31) 
* Phase 2 data evaluating Sutent plus docetaxel and prednisone in patients with
previously untreated metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC)
(Abstract #5166; May 31)

Data on the following compounds and investigational agents will also be
presented: CDX-110 (glioblastoma multiforme), Camptosar&#174; (irinotecan HCI)
(colorectal cancer), and tremelimumab (melanoma, NSCLC, RCC and advanced breast
cancer).

By working collaboratively with academic institutions, researchers, governments,
and licensing partners, Pfizer Oncology strives to transform treatment by
targeting the right drug for the right patient at the right time. 

For more information please visit www.Pfizer.com.

About Sutent (sunitinib malate)

Sutent is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of
gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) after disease progression on or
intolerance to imatinib mesylate and advanced / metastatic RCC. 

Sutent works by blocking multiple molecular targets implicated in the growth,
proliferation and spread of cancer. Two important Sutent targets, vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor
receptor (PDGFR), are expressed by many types of solid tumors and are thought to
play a crucial role in angiogenesis, the process by which tumors acquire blood
vessels, oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. Sutent also inhibits other
targets important to tumor growth, including KIT, FLT3 and RET. 

Important Sutent (sunitinib malate) Safety Information

Women of child bearing age who are (or become) pregnant during therapy should be
informed of the potential for fetal harm while on Sutent. 

Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below the lower limit
of normal (LLN) have been observed. Patients with concomitant cardiac conditions
should be carefully monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of congestive
heart failure. 

Patients should be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with
standard antihypertensive therapy. Complete blood counts (CBCs) with platelet
count and serum chemistries should be performed at the beginning of each
treatment cycle for patients receiving treatment with Sutent. 

The most common adverse reactions in advanced RCC and GIST clinical trials were
fatigue, asthenia, diarrhea, nausea, mucositis/stomatitis, vomiting, dyspepsia,
abdominal pain, constipation, hypertension, rash, hand-foot syndrome, skin
discoloration, altered taste, anorexia and bleeding. 

For more information on Sutent and Pfizer Oncology, including full prescribing
information for Sutent (sunitinib malate), please visit www.pfizer.com. 

About Aromasin (exemestane tablets)

Aromasin is the only aromatase inhibitor indicated for sequential therapy in
postmenopausal women with HR positive early breast cancer after 2-3 years of
tamoxifen for a total of 5 years of adjuvant therapy. The use of Aromasin in
this setting is supported by the landmark IES trial. Aromasin is also indicated
for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose
disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy. 

Important Aromasin (exemestane tablets) Safety Information

Aromasin should not be used in women who are premenopausal, are nursing or
pregnant, have a known hypersensitivity to the drug, or are taking
estrogen-containing agents. Dose modification is recommended for patients who
are receiving certain medications, including strong CYP 3A4 inducers. In
patients with early breast cancer, elevations in bilirubin, alkaline
phosphatase, and creatinine were more common in those receiving Aromasin than
either tamoxifen or placebo. 

About Camptosar(irinotecan HCI injection)

Camptosar is indicated as a component of 1st line therapy in combination with
5-FU/LV for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Camptosar is also
indicated for patients with mCRC whose disease has recurred or progressed
following initial FU-based therapy. 

Important Camptosar (irinotecan HCI injection) Safety Information

With Camptosar, both early and late forms of diarrhea can occur and may be life
threatening. Late diarrhea should be managed promptly with loperamide and
supportive care including antibiotics as needed. Camptosar can induce severe
myelosuppression. Depending on the severity of neutropenia, dose delay, dose
reduction, or use of a colony-stimulating factor should be considered. 

Particular caution should be exercised in monitoring the effects of Camptosar in
the elderly (&gt;65), in patients who have previously received pelvic/abdominal
irradiation, in patients with performance status of 2 or higher, and in patients
known to be homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele. Rare cases of ileus,
complicated colitis, or renal impairment have been observed. It is recommended
that patients receive premedication with antiemetic agents. Prophylactic or
therapeutic administration of atropine should be considered in patients
experiences cholingeric symptoms. Provided intolerable toxicity does not
develop, treatment with additional courses may be continued indefinitely as long
as patients continue to experience clinical benefits. Thromboembolic events have
been observed but the specific cause has not been determined. Camptosar should
not be used in patients with severe bone marrow failure. Vaccination with a live
vaccine should be avoided in patients receiving irinotecan due to the potential
for serious fatal infections. In addition, patients with hereditary fructose
intolerance should not be given Camptosar, as this product contains sorbitol.

informed of the potential for fetal harm while on Sutent. 

Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below the lower limit
of normal (LLN) have been observed. Patients with concomitant cardiac conditions
should be carefully monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of congestive
heart failure. 

Patients should be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with
standard antihypertensive therapy. Complete blood counts (CBCs) with platelet
count and serum chemistries should be performed at the beginning of each
treatment cycle for patients receiving treatment with Sutent. 

The most common adverse reactions in advanced RCC and GIST clinical trials were
fatigue, asthenia, diarrhea, nausea, mucositis/stomatitis, vomiting, dyspepsia,
abdominal pain, constipation, hypertension, rash, hand-foot syndrome, skin
discoloration, altered taste, anorexia and bleeding.

About Aromasin (exemestane tablets)

Aromasin is the only aromatase inhibitor indicated for sequential therapy in
postmenopausal women with HR positive early breast cancer after 2-3 years of
tamoxifen for a total of 5 years of adjuvant therapy. The use of Aromasin in
this setting is supported by the landmark IES trial. Aromasin is also indicated
for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose
disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy. 

Important Aromasin (exemestane tablets) Safety Information

Aromasin should not be used in women who are premenopausal, are nursing or
pregnant, have a known hypersensitivity to the drug, or are taking
estrogen-containing agents. Dose modification is recommended for patients who
are receiving certain medications, including strong CYP 3A4 inducers. In
patients with early breast cancer, elevations in bilirubin, alkaline
phosphatase, and creatinine were more common in those receiving Aromasin than
either tamoxifen or placebo. 

About Camptosar(irinotecan HCI injection)

Camptosar is indicated as a component of 1st line therapy in combination with
5-FU/LV for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Camptosar is also
indicated for patients with mCRC whose disease has recurred or progressed
following initial FU-based therapy. 

Important Camptosar (irinotecan HCI injection) Safety Information

With Camptosar, both early and late forms of diarrhea can occur and may be life
threatening. Late diarrhea should be managed promptly with loperamide and
supportive care including antibiotics as needed. Camptosar can induce severe
myelosuppression. Depending on the severity of neutropenia, dose delay, dose
reduction, or use of a colony-stimulating factor should be considered. 

Particular caution should be exercised in monitoring the effects of Camptosar in
the elderly (&gt;65), in patients who have previously received pelvic/abdominal
irradiation, in patients with performance status of 2 or higher, and in patients
known to be homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele. Rare cases of ileus,
complicated colitis, or renal impairment have been observed. It is recommended
that patients receive premedication with antiemetic agents. Prophylactic or
therapeutic administration of atropine should be considered in patients
experiences cholingeric symptoms. Provided intolerable toxicity does not
develop, treatment with additional courses may be continued indefinitely as long
as patients continue to experience clinical benefits. Thromboembolic events have
been observed but the specific cause has not been determined. Camptosar should
not be used in patients with severe bone marrow failure. Vaccination with a live
vaccine should be avoided in patients receiving irinotecan due to the potential
for serious fatal infections. In addition, patients with hereditary fructose
intolerance should not be given Camptosar, as this product contains sorbitol.

&lt;p&gt;Harvard Kennedy School and International Finance Corporation Study Released
Today Assesses Coca-Cola`s Manual Distribution Center Model in Africa
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
In a panel discussion today at the Brookings Institution, President Bill
Clinton, Muhtar Kent, Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company, and Pat Woertz,
Chairman, CEO and President of Archer Daniels Midland Company, discussed ways
business can play a role in creating value for both shareholders and society.
They emphasized the value of leveraging core business activities to foster
growth and development, especially in emerging markets. 

The Coca-Cola system`s Manual Distribution Center (MDC) program in Africa was
referenced as an example of an innovative solution that advances both business
goals and the international development agenda. Coca-Cola`s approach to
distributing its products in hard-to-reach urban and peri-urban areas in Africa
utilizes small businesses that deliver Coca-Cola products manually to local
small-scale retailers. The MDCs account for over 80 percent of the company`s
sales in East Africa while creating small-business ownership opportunities and
jobs for an increasing number of first-time entrepreneurs and women. To date,
the Coca-Cola system has created over 2,500 MDCs in Africa employing over 12,000
people and generating over $500 million in annual revenues. 

"For Coca-Cola, the Manual Distribution Centers are a wonderful example of the
way business can focus on meeting its consumers` and customers` needs while
supporting the sustainability of communities," said Muhtar Kent, Chairman and
CEO of The Coca-Cola Company. "It has long been our philosophy to look at our
business system holistically and determine where we can have the greatest impact
on advancing initiatives that are critical to the communities and stakeholders
that we rely on." 

The Company has been committed to scaling-up the number of MDCs in Africa since
joining the Business Call to Action, an initiative that mobilizes large
companies to help reach the Millennium Development Goals by harnessing core
business competencies. To determine how best to scale-up its model, Coca-Cola
asked the Corporate Social Responsibility Initiative at the Harvard Kennedy
School and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to review the approach. 

During 2008, a review of the current operations of the MDC model in Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia was conducted. 

"There is a growing recognition in the corporate and international development
communities that the most sustainable contribution companies can make to poverty
alleviation is to carry out their core business activities in a profitable,
responsible and inclusive manner," said Jane Nelson of the Harvard Kennedy
School. 

"Our review of Manual Distribution Centers in Tanzania and Ethiopia demonstrates
the potential of large corporations to build economically viable business
linkages with small enterprises in their value chains, which can also have
development benefits," said IFCDirector Toshiya Masuoka. 

The research study identified a number of opportunities to further enhance the
MDC approach. These include: 1) investing in continuous improvement of the core
business model through improved access to finance and expanded and enhanced
training; 2) broadening socio-economic opportunity for MDC owners and employees
through life skills and further education opportunities; 3) promoting small
business development and entrepreneurship more widely by supporting
entrepreneurship education and advocacy for small enterprise development, 4)
exploring how the business model could distribute social products or messages;
and 5) undertaking participatory evaluation and action-based learning. 

The study is available at
http://www.hks.harvard.edu/m-rcbg/CSRI/publications/other_10_MDC_report.pdf.
Coca-Cola is currently in discussion with potential development partners to
assist in pursuing some of these opportunities to further strengthen the model. 

The Coca-Cola Company is the world`s largest beverage company, refreshing
consumers with nearly 500 sparkling and still brands. Along with Coca-Cola,
recognized as the world`s most valuable brand, the Company`s portfolio includes
12 other billion dollar brands, including Diet Coke, Fanta, Sprite, Coca-Cola

&lt;p&gt;  MADISON, NJ, May 13 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Cocaine use among U.S. employees and job applicants in the general U.S.
workforce declined sharply in 2008, according to the annual Quest
Diagnostics Drug Testing Index(TM) (DTI), based on 5.7 million urine drug
tests performed last year by Quest Diagnostics (NYSE: DGX), the nation's
leading provider of drug testing services. In addition, methamphetamine
use in the general workforce declined year over year, yet positive urine
tests for amphetamine showed an uptick in worker use of this stimulant
drug.

maps, click http://newsinfusion.com/audio_details
 .php?audioId=203.

    "We now know that the implementation of workplace drug testing programs
has significantly reduced drug abuse in worker populations subject to drug
testing," according to Robert Willette, Ph.D., President of Duo Research
and former Chief of the Research Technology Branch of the National
Institute on Drug Abuse. "This impact is evidenced in a variety of surveys
and other data sources, one of the most valuable being the Quest
Diagnostics Drug Testing Index. While many substances are showing declines
in use, a significant trend upward that will be important to watch is the
rise in amphetamine positives. This coincides with survey and emergency
room data, and could be tied to the significant increase in drugs
prescribed for Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Similar
trends are seen with the increased use and abuse of pain medications."

    Employers that implement drug testing programs do so for a variety of
reasons, most often to protect the health and well-being of employees and
avert business risk associated with drug-induced judgments. The 2008 DTI
summarizes 7.3 million urine drug test results of the U.S. workforce,
including both the general U.S. workforce and federally mandated
safety-sensitive workforce, which includes pilots, bus drivers, and
nuclear power plant operators. The DTI looks at 'recent use,' as measured
by laboratory analysis of a urine sample, which detects drug use within
the prior one to three days.

    Sustained drop in overall drug use

    Overall recent drug use in the combined U.S. workforce has sustained a
19-year decline since Quest Diagnostics first published the Drug Testing
Index in 1989, summarizing data from 1988, when 13.6 percent of workers
tested positive for drug use. In 2008, 3.6 percent of the combined U.S.
workforce tested positive in a urine drug test compared to 3.8 percent in
2007. Experts credit effective drug testing programs with positively
influencing worker behavior and, in recent years, have cited law
enforcement's impact on the decreased availability and increasing costs of
illicit substances as a factor in recent drug use declines.

    Cocaine and methamphetamine use decline sharply; amphetamine use increases

    Positivity rates of recent use of cocaine in the general U.S. workforce
dropped 29 percent (0.58 percent of all urine drug tests in 2007 to 0.41
percent in 2008) continuing a steep decline. In 2006, 0.72 percent of
urine tests showed recent use of cocaine. While methamphetamine
positivity in the general U.S. workforce also dropped 21 percent (0.14
percent in 2007 to 0.11 percent in 2008), the positivity rate for
amphetamine increased more than 12 percent, from 0.40 percent to 0.45
percent.

    Cocaine, methamphetamine and amphetamine are each a type of stimulant,
typically used to increase alertness and relieve fatigue. Stimulants are
also used for euphoric effects or may be used to counteract the "down"
feeling of tranquilizers or alcohol. Possible side effects of stimulants
include increased heart and respiratory rates, elevated blood pressure,
dilated pupils and decreased appetite. High doses may cause irregular
heartbeat, loss of coordination or collapse. Indications of possible
misuse may include excessive activity, talkativeness, irritability or
nervousness.

    Random drug testing programs appear to deter use

    Random drug testing programs appear to deter drug use, DTI data show. In
the federally mandated safety-sensitive workforce, where employees expect
random drug testing, the drug positivity rate is far lower than the rate
of positivity among job applicants in that same workforce. However, in the
general workforce, where employees are far less likely to expect random
drug testing, the drug use positivity rate is dramatically higher than
that of job applicants.

    "At first, it may not be surprising that in the safety-sensitive workforce
random drug test positivity is nearly 18 percent lower than pre-employment
positivity," according to Barry Sample, Ph.D., Director of Science and
Technology for Quest Diagnostics' Employer Solutions Division.
"Pre-employment drug testing is an important frontline filter to help
ensure a drug-free workforce. However, we see a more complex story when
these rates are compared to the general workforce, where employees are far
less likely to expect random drug testing. Here, the random urine test
positivity rate is 47 percent higher than the pre-employment urine test
positivity rate."

    Random urine test positivity among safety-sensitive workers was 1.4
percent, according to the 2008 DTI, nearly 18 percent lower than the
pre-employment positivity rate of 1.7 percent. Those employed in the
safety-sensitive workforce understand that they can be subject to a random
drug test at any time. In the general workforce, where random urine
testing is not typically required of employees nor expected, the random
urine test positivity rate was 47 percent higher than that workforce's
pre-employment positivity rate. The general U.S. workforce pre-employment
urine testing positivity rate reached 3.6 percent, while the general U.S.
workforce random urine testing positivity rate reached 5.3 percent.

    About the Drug Testing Index(TM) (DTI)

    The Quest Diagnostics Drug Testing Index is published as a public service
for government, media and industry and has been considered a benchmark for
national trends since its inception in 1988. It examines positivity rates
-- the proportion of positive results for each drug to all such drug tests
performed -- among three major testing populations: federally mandated,
safety-sensitive workers; the general workforce; and the combined U.S.
workforce. Federally mandated, safety sensitive workers include pilots,
bus and truck drivers, and workers in nuclear power plants, for whom
routine drug testing is mandated by the U.S. Department of Transportation
and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

&lt;p&gt;May 13 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs removed SunTrust Banks Inc

"neutral," saying the bank's stress test capital need was
smaller than what the brokerage had expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; SunTrust Banks had a $2.2 billion capital shortfall,
according to the U.S. government's stress test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, U.S. regulators, after conducting "stress
tests," told top banks to raise $74.6 billion to build a
capital cushion officials hope will restore faith in financial
firms and set a course out of the deepest recession in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Southeast regional bank may pursue a number of
options to fill its capital need including capital raises,
business sales such as asset management, preferred stock

&lt;p&gt;Enterprise Random Password Manager and Random Password Manager Tightly Integrate
with Microsoft System Center to Securely Manage Privileged Accounts for GRC
Compliance


LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
Lieberman Software`s privileged account password management packages for
Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager and Microsoft System Center
Operations Manager enable enterprise organizations to meet the stringent
password update and identity management standards of regulatory compliance
regulations. 

Administrative, super user, root, fire call, and other privileged accounts are
pervasive in any organization. More numerous than personal passwords, these
"keys to the kingdom" grant access to programs and files containing an
organization`s most sensitive data. If they are not properly protected and
managed, they represent a significant security and compliance risk to the
organization via sabotage or theft of proprietary information. Security
compliance regulations - such as Sarbanes-Oxley, PCI DSS, HIPAA and NERC/FERC -
call for frequent changes to privileged account passwords to prevent
unauthorized personnel from being able to access mission-critical systems. 

"IT auditors recognize that unmonitored, uncontrolled access to privileged
accounts leaves an organization wide open to data theft, privacy breaches, and
fraud and must be properly secured and managed," said Chris Stoneff, product
manager at Lieberman Software. "By integrating our privileged identity
management solutions Enterprise Random Password Manager and Random Password
Manager into the GUI shell of System Center Operations Manager and System Center
Configuration Manager, access to privileged accounts is secure and easily
managed from a centralized console." 

System Center Integration

Lieberman Software products integrate seamlessly with System Center Operations
Manager to alert administrators to what users and the Help Desk are doing with
privileged accounts from a single console. The integrations address critical
security information event management (SIEM) issues. 

Enterprise Random Password Manager and Random Password Manager feed events to
Systems Center based on password change, password verification, and password
check-in/check-out job results. These events can be used by customers to
automatically open and close trouble tickets based on end-user behavior and
system responses to password management tasks. This allows Systems Center to
take immediate action should the system encounter security misuse or operational
readiness issues. 

In addition, by enabling Enterprise Random Password Manager and Random Password
Manager to be managed and monitored by System Center Operations Manager through
a management pack provided by Lieberman Software, mutual customers can meet the
burden of regulatory compliance by:

* Receiving real-time security events and alerts should external factors, such
as network or database problems, cause disruptions to regulatory-based Service
Level Agreements (SLA) requirements. 
* Automatically changing local, domain, and service account passwords on every
system in the enterprise at regular intervals. 
* Creating an audit trail of privileged account password changes. 
* Maintaining strict, delegated controls for users with privileged account
access. 
* Automatically managing the RunAs credentials within System Center.

The announcement was made at Microsoft Tech-Ed 2009 where Lieberman Software is
exhibiting in booth 217.

&lt;p&gt;OBERHAUSEN, Germany--(Business Wire)--
The global chemical company Oxea announced today that is has signed an agreement
to acquire ExxonMobil`s ester plant in Amsterdam. The acquisition, expected to
be closed in July 2009, will significantly strengthen Oxea`s position in
specialty chemicals and provide both an extension of its value chain as well as
broadening its application basis. Oxea plans to use the facility to extend its
ester capacities and also produce specialties used as precursors for lubricants,
flavors and fragrance, pharmaceuticals and high performance plasticizers. 

"The products produced in Amsterdam will complement the existing Oxea product
portfolio. Not only will we be able to offer new products. We will also achieve
more flexibility that will result in higher security of supply for existing Oxea
esters", said Miguel Mantas, member of the Oxea Executive Board. "The new plant
will allow us to better service our customers and support their growth", he
concluded. 

Dr. Martina Fl&#246;el, spokesperson for the Executive Board of Oxea, commented on
the acquisition: "Our major advantage is that we produce the base materials for
ester production ourselves. This makes us independent and further improves our
supply capability. The new Oxea site is therefore an important step in our
strategic plan of expanding further into growth markets while optimizing and
enhancing our own value chain and product portfolio." 

The Amsterdam ester plant commenced operations in 1995. With 19 employees this
state-of-the-art plant produces a wide range of esters. 

The acquisition is subject to completion of the consultation process with
ExxonMobil`s works council. Both parties agreed not to disclose further details
of the transaction. 

Oxea is a global supplier of solvents, polyols and oxo derivatives such as
carboxylic acids, esters and amines. These products are used for the production
of high-quality coatings, lubricants, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products,
flavorings and fragrances, printing inks and plastics. Oxea has annual sales
worth about EUR 1.2 billion and employs approximately 1,300 people in Germany
and the United States.

&lt;p&gt;May 13 (Reuters) - The biggest real-estate fund of Goldman
Sachs (GS.N) is discussing debt restructuring with its lenders
for its investments in Nevada casinos, German office buildings
and a U.S. hotel chain, the Wall Street Journal reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; One of the main lenders on those deals is Goldman Sachs
itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors were warned about potential conflicts of interest
when they put money into this group of real-estate vehicles,
which use the Whitehall name, the Journal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Such funds were billed as "opportunity funds", huge, highly
leveraged investments funded directly by Goldman, its employees
and a group of outside investors, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman spokesman was not immediately available for
comment outside business hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whitehall's biggest fund, Whitehall Street Global Real
Estate Limited Partnership 2007, wrote down $2.1 billion of the
$3.7 billion invested between May 2007 and August 2008, the

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM Corp is set to begin selling a long-awaited software aimed at helping companies analyze real-time data, ranging from traffic data to manufacturing processes, to find more efficient ways to run their business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM, which has shifted its focus from computers to higher-margin software and services over the past decade, said the new software, named IBM System S, will be available from Friday following six years of development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software is designed to analyze streams of real-time data and could help financial institutions monitor transactions and analyze risks, or help hospitals monitor patients to detect problems early, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could also help chipmakers, for example, monitor the entire manufacturing process which often involves 500-1,000 steps. IBM said the software could pinpoint errors to solve them before they multiply or lead to serious losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nagui Halim, head of IBM's stream computing project, said the software can be used for "anything that has a situation where vast amounts of data are available at real-time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As businesses go more and more online, as more and more of what they do becomes available digitally, with cars, equipment and sensors ... there's this rising tide of information," Halim told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Generally people store the data, and they try to understand it later.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, updates with company statement, adds economic
background; adds byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Erwin Seba&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON May 14 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) is
considering halting production at its 54,000 barrel per day
(bpd) refinery in Honolulu, Hawaii, but plans to continue
supplying fuel to the island state, the company said on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron is conducting an internal study to assess options
for its refinery in Hawaii," company spokesman Lloyd Avram said
in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The study is a normal part of our ongoing, global asset
review process," Avram said. "We are undertaking the study
because the refining industry continues to undergo significant
changes driven by a variety of factors, including regulations
and global market trends."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Honolulu Advertiser reported that Chevron told
employees refining operations may be halted to make way for a
refined products terminal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The recession has crushed U.S. demand for motor fuels. Last
month, Sunoco Inc SUN.N agreed to sell its 85,000 bpd Tulsa,
Oklahoma, refinery to Holly Corp HOC.N after announcing it
would convert the plant to a terminal if a buyer could not be
found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In January, Big West LLC suspended operations at its 66,000
bpd Bakersfield, California, refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Chevron refinery is the smaller of two on the island of
Oahu in the Hawaiian chain. Tesoro Corp (TSO.N) operates a
93,500 bpd refinery in Kapolei, Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike most U.S. refineries which concentrate production on
gasoline, most of Hawaii refinery production goes to making jet
fuel and diesel for airlines and U.S. military installations
like the naval base at Pearl Harbor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Demand for refined products in Hawaii has remained
relatively flat for years, studies funded by the state have
shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hawaii consumers have struggled with some of the highest
retail fuel prices in the nation for decades. The state
financed the construction of the refinery Tesoro now owns in
the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2002, the state Legislature passed a law capping
gasoline prices, sending prices to the highest levels then seen
in the United States. The law was suspended in 2006.

&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company unveiled today a new plastic bottle made partially from
plants. The "PlantBottle" is fully recyclable, has a lower reliance on a
non-renewable resource, and reduces carbon emissions, compared with
petroleum-based PET plastic bottles. 

"The `PlantBottle` is a significant development in sustainable packaging
innovation," said Muhtar Kent, Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company. "It
builds on our legacy of environmental ingenuity and sets the course for us to
realize our vision to eventually introduce bottles made with materials that are
100 percent recyclable and renewable." 

Traditional PET bottles are made from petroleum, a non-renewable resource. The
new bottle is made from a blend of petroleum-based materials and up to 30
percent plant-based materials. 

"The Coca-Cola Company is a company with the power to transform the marketplace,
and the introduction of the `PlantBottle` is yet another great example of their
leadership on environmental issues," said Carter Roberts, President and CEO of
World Wildlife Fund, U.S. "We are pleased to be working with Coke to tackle
sustainability issues and drive innovations like this through their supply
chain, the broader industry and the world." 

The "PlantBottle" is currently made through an innovative process that turns
sugar cane and molasses, a by-product of sugar production, into a key component
for PET plastic. Coca-Cola is also exploring the use of other plant materials
for future generations of the "PlantBottle." 

Manufacturing the new plastic bottle is more environmentally efficient as well.
A life-cycle analysis conducted by Imperial College London indicates the
"PlantBottle" with 30 percent plant-base material reduces carbon emissions by up
to 25 percent, compared with petroleum-based PET. 

Another advantage to the "PlantBottle" is that, unlike other plant-based
plastics, it can be processed through existing manufacturing and recycling
facilities without contaminating traditional PET. So, the material in the
"PlantBottle" can be used, recycled and reused again and again. 

Coca-Cola North America will pilot the "PlantBottle" with Dasani and sparkling
brands in select markets later this year and with vitaminwater in 2010. The
innovative bottles will be identified through on-package messages and in-store
point of sale displays. Web-based communications will also highlight the
bottles` environmental benefits. 

"The `PlantBottle` represents the next step in evolving our system toward the
bottle of the future," said Scott Vitters, Director of Sustainable Packaging of
The Coca-Cola Company. "This innovation is a real win because it moves us closer
to our vision of zero waste with a material that lessens our carbon footprint
and is also recyclable." 

The Coca-Cola Company - the first company to introduce a beverage bottle made
with recycled plastic - has been focused on ensuring the sustainability of its
packaging for decades. It has put resources behind creating packaging that is
recyclable and investing in recycling infrastructure to ensure that its packages
are collected, recycled and re-used. Earlier this year, the Company opened the
world`s largest plastic bottle-to-bottle recycling plant in Spartanburg, S.C.
The plant will produce approximately 100 million pounds of recycled PET plastic
for reuse each year - the equivalent of nearly 2 billion 20-ounce Coca-Cola
bottles. These efforts are all focused on helping "close the loop" on packaging
use and produce truly sustainable packages for consumers.

Forward-Looking Language

This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to
the safe harbor provisions of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. These statements speak only as of the date of this press release and are
made on the basis of management`s views and assumptions regarding future events
and business performance. Words such as "believe," "anticipate," "expect" and
similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements (including oral representations) involve risks and
uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from any future
results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such statements.
These risks and uncertainties are based on a number of factors, including but
not limited to: reductions in the number of our access lines and high-speed
internet subscribers; the effects of competition from cable, wireless and other
wireline carriers (through voice over internet protocol (VOIP) or otherwise);
reductions in switched access revenues as a result of regulation, competition
and/or technology substitutions; the effects of greater than anticipated
competition requiring new pricing, marketing strategies or new product offerings
and the risk that we will not respond on a timely or profitable basis; the
effects of changes in both general and local economic conditions on the markets
we serve, which can impact demand for our products and services, customer
purchasing decisions, collectibility of revenue and required levels of capital
expenditures related to new construction of residences and businesses; our
ability to effectively manage service quality; our ability to successfully
introduce new product offerings, including our ability to offer bundled service
packages on terms that are both profitable to us and attractive to our
customers; our ability to sell enhanced and data services in order to offset
ongoing declines in revenue from local services, switched access services and
subsidies; changes in accounting policies or practices adopted voluntarily or as
required by generally accepted accounting principles or regulators; the effects
of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry as a result
of federal and state legislation and regulation, including potential changes in
state rate of return limitations on our earnings, access charges and subsidy
payments, and regulatory network upgrade and reliability requirements; our
ability to effectively manage our operations, operating expenses and capital
expenditures, to pay dividends and to reduce or refinance our debt; adverse
changes in the credit markets and/or in the ratings given to our debt securities
by nationally accredited ratings organizations, which could limit or restrict
the availability and/or increase the cost of financing; the effects of
bankruptcies and home foreclosures, which could result in increased bad debts;
the effects of technological changes and competition on our capital expenditures
and product and service offerings, including the lack of assurance that our
ongoing network improvements will be sufficient to meet or exceed the
capabilities and quality of competing networks; the effects of increased
medical, retiree and pension expenses and related funding requirements; changes
in income tax rates, tax laws, regulations or rulings, and/or federal or state
tax assessments; further declines in the value of our pension plan assets, which
could require us to make contributions to the pension plan beginning in 2010, at
the earliest; the effects of state regulatory cash management policies on our
ability to transfer cash among our subsidiaries and to the parent company; our
ability to successfully renegotiate union contracts expiring in 2009 and
thereafter; our ability to pay a $1.00 per common share dividend annually, which
may be affected by our cash flow from operations, amount of capital
expenditures, debt service requirements, cash paid for income taxes (which will
increase in 2009) and our liquidity; the effects of significantly increased cash
taxes in 2009 and thereafter; the effects of any unfavorable outcome with
respect to any of our current or future legal, governmental, or regulatory
proceedings, audits or disputes; the possible impact of adverse changes in
political or other external factors over which we have no control; and the
effects of hurricanes, ice storms or other severe weather. These and other
uncertainties related to our business are described in greater detail in our
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including our reports
on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. There also can be no assurance that the proposed
transaction will in fact be consummated. We undertake no obligation to publicly
update or revise any forward-looking statement or to make any other
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise unless required to do so by securities laws.

&lt;p&gt;WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind.--(Business Wire)--
Purdue Research Foundation has joined an international program that provides up
to three years of Microsoft software to information technology startup companies
for free. 

"When a company is launched, every penny counts, and buying software and other
technology can be a drain on an entrepreneur's budget," said Joseph B. Hornett,
Purdue Research Foundation senior vice president, treasurer and COO. "The
BizSpark program by Microsoft is a terrific way to help companies during the
critical first three years, and we wanted to be a sponsor." 

Microsoft programs available through BizSpark include Microsoft Windows Server,
Microsoft Office SharePoint Portal Server, Visual Studio, SQL Server and more. 

A company does not have to be based at the Purdue Research Park to be sponsored
by the foundation. For example, the foundation sponsors The Scarborough Group
Inc. of Naperville, Ill., which is developing a service called The Driver's Log
to help car enthusiasts organize automobile maintenance information. 

Company President Tom Scarborough Jr. said BizSpark provides The Scarborough
Group with access to Microsoft software without using capital from lenders. 

"Appealing to lenders for startup capital is an arduous process," Scarborough
said. "Because of BizSpark, we are able to immediately work on the application
and not worry about startup costs to develop our core system. When we need
capital to hire staff or advertise, we can show our product to a lender and
explain what we need for the next step. Bank officials can see the product at
that point, which can help them make their decision." 

To be eligible for the BizSpark program, companies must have a software-based
product or service at the core of their current or future business, be privately
held, be in business for fewer than three years and earn less than $1 million in
annual revenue. They also must have a sponsor. A company may take part in the
program for three years unless it goes public or is acquired. There are no
initial fees to join, but $100 is due from the company when it exits the
program. 

Startup company officials can solicit the Purdue Research Foundation to be their
BizSpark sponsor by visiting http://www.prf.org/bus_dev/BizSpark.asp.

&lt;p&gt;  WASHINGTON, DC, May 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Citizens of other countries represent an important segment of the U.S.
home buying market, and now new special visa categories that allow
foreign nationals to gain U.S. residency can help facilitate that
process. By using these visa categories correctly, Realtors(R) will be
able to help many more buyers from overseas purchase property in the U.S.

    Toward this end, Realtors(R) from across the country met today with
experts in immigration issues and international economics at the joint
International and Resort and Second Home Real Estate Forums at the 
Realtors(R) Midyear Legislative Meetings &amp; Trade Expo.

    "We know that business of real estate today is truly borderless, and the
National Association of Realtors(R) has recommended steps toward
facilitating and streamlining international real estate transactions for
some time," said NAR President Charles McMillan, a broker with Coldwell
Banker Residential Brokerage in Dallas-Fort Worth. "Knowing how to
properly apply immigration rules can help Realtors(R) add value to
international property transactions, benefiting both domestic sellers and
international buyers."

    International real estate purchases in the U.S. continue to be a
significant share of business for many Realtors(R), according to the 2008
NAR Profile of International Home Buying Activity. Of the Realtors(R)
surveyed for the profile, 26 percent served international clients in the
past year and about half of those clients ended up purchasing a home.
Recent research conducted by the Harris Research Group for NAR reveals
that 7.1 percent of potential overseas buyers surveyed would definitely or
possibly consider a retirement location in the U.S. This equates to a
market in excess of one million potential buyers, according to real estate
economist and author John Tuccillo, who spoke to the forum.

    Stephen H. Davis, a leading immigration attorney, explained how various
U.S. visa programs, including the E-2, EB-5 and L-1 visas, help foreigners
purchase homes in the U.S. "These different visa programs will help
attract individual investors from other countries," Davis said. "One
long-term visa program helps investors attain a conditional lawful
permanent residence status by investing $500,000 in a limited partnership
at various government-maintained regional centers. Another program
involves an investment of $l million to create 10 new full-time positions
for U.S. workers."

    There are also visas for people who manage various types of enterprises
and businesses in the U.S., including rental properties, condominiums and
franchises; people in the export and import business; and foreign
executives who manage U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies. All of these
can facilitate international investment in U.S. real estate.

    Realtors(R) can help their international clients buy second homes,
vacation or future retirement homes by knowing how to use the appropriate
special visa categories. "NAR research shows the increasingly
international nature of real estate markets and how foreign buyers are
responding to opportunities to acquire homes in this country," said
Davis. "After all, a piece of America is worth its weight in gold, and
buyers from overseas recognize this. Understanding how the visa
categories work can be a useful tool for Realtors(R) in unlocking this
important new market segment."

    The National Association of Realtors(R), "The Voice for Real Estate," is
America's largest trade association, representing 1.2 million members
involved in all aspects of the residential and commercial real estate
industries.

    Information about NAR is available at www.realtor.org. This and other news
releases are posted in the News Media section. Statistical data, tables
and surveys also may be found by clicking on Research.

    REALTOR(R) is a registered collective membership mark which may be used
only by real estate professionals who are members of the NATIONAL
ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS(R) and subscribe to its strict Code of Ethics. Not
all real estate agents are REALTORS(R). All REALTORS(R) are members of
NAR.

&lt;p&gt;Multiplatform Environmental Initiative on Disney Channel, Disney XD, Radio
Disney and Disney.com Features Star-Studded Lineup of Disney's Young Talent
PledgingEnvironmental Stewardship and Encouraging Other Kids to Do the Same

Kids' Votes Determine How Disney Will Divide $1 Million in Donations Among
Environmental Causes


BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
The Walt Disney Company today announced Disney`s Friends for Change: Project
Green (www.Disney.com), a multiplatform environmental initiative that will help
kids help the planet. Disney stars Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez, the Jonas Brothers
and Demi Lovato are among the 29 young stars participating in outreach messages
to debut on Disney Channel, Disney XD, Radio Disney and Disney.com. The Disney`s
Friends for Change: Project Green initiative invites young people to join
together to help the environment across four key areas: climate, water, waste
and habitats. Kids will learn practical ways to preserve the planet, track their
collective impact and have the opportunity to vote on how $1 million in
donations from Disney will be divided and invested in various environmental
causes over the course of a year. 

"With Disney`s Friends for Change, we`re empowering kids to tap into the
potential that lies within each and every one of them to make a difference,"
said Bob Iger, president, The Walt Disney Company. "Building on our recently
announced environmental goals, this program highlights what is possible as we
leverage Disney`s reach to educate and inspire environmental stewardship in
others." 

Beginning Friday, May 15, Disney Channel and Radio Disney will air the first in
a year-long series of on-air messages that will feature Disney Channel stars
challenging kids to join them in registering and pledging environmental
stewardship by making small changes in their daily actions that can positively
impact the world around them. 

"We were inspired by the outpouring of enthusiasm from our family of talent to
enact real environmental change by connecting with other kids, fans and friends
on an entirely new level," said Rich Ross, president, Disney Channels Worldwide.
"Friends for Change is about the power of friendship - when we all work
together, anything is possible." 

If 500,000 kids participate in Disney Friends for Change: Project Green events,
together they can:

* Prevent approximately 100,000 tons of CO2 per year from polluting the air by
adjusting their home thermostats. 
* Save 5 million gallons of water in a single day by reducing shower times. 
* Prevent 1 million pounds of waste from entering landfills by bringing
trash-free lunches for a week. 
* Create new habitats for local animals by planting 500,000 trees.

Kids can pledge to join online at Disney.com where they`ll commit to take simple
everyday actions, such as turning off the lights and switching to reusable water
bottles, and find out more about why these actions matter. Through the online
community, kids will be able to invite friends to join, interact with one
another and take pride in the results of their efforts as their collective
impact on the planet is tallied and their votes determine the distribution of
charitable contributions. 

Climate, water, waste and habitat will each be highlighted for three months,
culminating in quarterly events where on a designated day, kids will be
encouraged to act in unison on a single task such as adjusting home thermostats
or reducing water usage. These events will be tracked online and on air as kids
report back on their actions. Kids will also help determine how Disney will
donate $1 million to environmental organizations over the course of a year to
plant trees, preserve the rainforest, help endangered animals and support
alternative energy among other causes.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds background, updates bond spreads)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 14 (Reuters) - A $2.5 billion issue of notes
sold by JP Morgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) on Wednesday weakened in
secondary trading on Thursday in the latest sign that a
corporate bond rally is starting to sputter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yield spreads on the five-year notes widened by about 7
basis points to 282 basis points more than Treasuries,
according to MarketAxess. They had traded as wide as 295 basis
points over Treasuries earlier in the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The JP Morgan deal is the latest of several corporate bond
sales to trade poorly in recent weeks after a glut of supply
gave the market a heavy tone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors have turned more cautious on corporate bonds
after a massive tightening in yield spreads left less upside in
the market, especially as weak economic data signals that no
quick end to the recession is in sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I just think the tone out there has drastically changed
and for the most part people are a little jumpy," said Richard
Lee, head of fixed income at New York broker-dealer Wall Street
Access. "There's still a lot of supply in the pipeline. As
issues trade poorly, the buyside gets jumpy and they demand a
much bigger discount to get into the next deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whereas companies a few weeks ago were able to sell new
bonds with just a 10 to 15 basis-point yield premium over
outstanding issues, that will likely grow to 50 to 60 basis
points or more as new issues trade poorly, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors began to feel cautious about a six-week rally in
corporate bonds after a bond sale by Dow Chemical (DOW.N) last
week turned in a poor performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spreads on Dow's new 10-year notes have widened by 69 basis
points from where they were issued to 594 basis points over
Treasuries, while its five-year notes have widened 58 basis
points to 608 basis points, according to MarketAxess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The longer-dated portions of a three-part bond sale by
Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) have also traded poorly. Spreads on a
30-year bond have widened by 12 basis points to 117 basis
points, while 10-year notes have widened by 2 basis points to
107 basis points, according to MarketAxess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Technology companies in general are weakening in the
corporate bond market amid worries that customers will cut
orders as the recession drags on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spreads on IBM's (IBM.N) 7.625 percent notes due in 2018
have widened to 229 basis points after starting the week at 185
basis points, according to MarketAxess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I like corporate spreads in general but I do think we're
going to have a very, very choppy market for a while," said Lee
of Wall Street Access.

&lt;p&gt;Education Program for 500,000 Physicians Across the U.S on the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act, Healthcare Stimulus and EHRs
BURLINGTON, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Nuance Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: NUAN), a leading supplier of speech
solutions, today announced that in conjunction with other leading healthcare
technology companies, it is co-launching an alliance aimed at educating 500,000
US physicians about opportunities aligned with the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. The Electronic Health Record (EHR) Stimulus
Alliance, spearheaded by Allscripts, includes Cisco, Citrix, Dell, Intel,
IntuitMicrosoft and Nuance, and aims to deliver hundreds of virtual and physical
education programs for physicians in cities across the U.S. 

"The EHR Stimulus Alliance is a unified movement toward turning the national
dialogue surrounding the EHR transition into action," said John Shagoury,
president, Nuance Healthcare. "Each of the partners involved has unique
solutions that are crucial to EHR implementation. In our case, because most
doctors speak at least three times faster than they type, speech recognition
technology helps increase the meaningful use and efficiency of EHRs by
decreasing physician reliance on the keyboard and mouse. By providing speech
recognition as an EHR documentation option, medical records are more complete
with detailed patient history and a care plan; additionally, they are not
reduced to only point-and-click templates void of physician narrative." 

The EHR Stimulus Tour will provide actionable information for physicians via
executive briefings, roundtables, trade show presentations, webcasts and local
meetings with Alliance experts and medical groups that have already successfully
adopted EHRs. Surveys indicate that many physicians do not understand the
details of the federal EHR incentive program, including how much money they are
eligible to receive, when it will be allocated and how they can qualify. The
Tour will answer these questions, as well as provide opportunities for
clinicians to learn about complementary EHR capabilities enabled by speech
technology that can extend the value in an EHR investment. 

"Speech has already proven to be a key component in the success of the
electronic healthcare revolution by streamlining the adoption process for new
EHR users who are accustomed to dictating patient documentation. As a pioneer in
this space, Nuance will lend a wealth of information and expertise to the
Alliance that will directly benefit the 500,000 physicians we hope to reach,"
said Glen Tullman, chief executive officer, Allscripts. "Now, more than ever,
it`s critical that healthcare industry leaders and innovators join forces, share
ideas, collaborate and educate to ensure that physicians not only take advantage
of the stimulus incentives, but successfully utilize electronic health records
to improve our healthcare system." 

Speech Recognition Technology and the EHR Transition

Speech recognition technology is increasingly recognized as an essential
component to a successful EHR rollout and has been proven to make clinicians up
to 25 percent more efficient with an EHR compared to using a non-voice-enabled
system. As the Health and Human Services Department works to define "meaningful
use" of an EHR, Nuance believes that speech recognition software can help
physicians and organizations move toward complying with what will ultimately be
considered "meaningful" EHR use, by ensuring that clinicians actually utilize
the EHR and that the physician narrative is not completely lost during the
documentation process. Today, more than 20 percent of physicians in North
America use both background and real-time speech solutions from Nuance to
generate over 800 million electronic health records per year. 

To further optimize the EHR experience for physicians using real-time speech
recognition, Nuance recently announced its Dragon Medical EHR Certification
Program. EHR vendors such as Allscripts that participate in the program complete
a Nuance-managed evaluation and work with Nuance engineers to ensure seamless
Dragon Medical workflow within their EHR. By adding this additional layer of
interoperability, physicians and healthcare organizations can confidently make
their EHR migration, knowing speech recognition is not only possible, but has
been pre-tested and optimized for utmost clinician efficiency. 

According to a survey completed by 1,255 physicians who have adopted Nuance`s
Dragon Medical software:

* 83 percent said that it improved the quality of their electronic patient
notes, 
* 81 percent said that it significantly reduced transcription spending, and 
* 69 percent said it made their EHR faster and easier to use.

&lt;p&gt;Oil Company Scrambling after Media Coverage Exposes Environmental Damage Left
Behind in Ecuador
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
Chevron today is taking part in a "Green Technology" roundtable in an apparent
attempt to deflect some of the harm caused by its increasingly high profile as a
corporate polluter in Ecuador, where it faces a potential $27 billion clean-up
tab for dumping billions of gallons of toxic waste into the Amazon, campaigners
who monitor the company said today. 

The meeting, entitled "Green Technology and the Developing World: Global Energy
Challenges, Economic Development and the Deployment of Green Technologies," is
being held just a week after CBS News` 60 Minutes aired a story highlighting the
extensive toxic contamination that the company left behind in Ecuador`s Amazon
rainforest. Kristen Thorne, a Corporate Advisor on Global Issues and Policy for
Chevron, is expected to participate in the roundtable discussion to introduce
members of Congress to the company`s so-called "green" energy policies. 

Chevron`s participation in the event is little more than an attempt to distract
Congress from damaging reports regarding the environmental disaster Chevron left
behind in Ecuador, including a report aired on CBS News` 60 Minutes, according
to Kevin Koenig, a corporate campaigner with Amazon Watch, a group that monitors
Chevron`s environmental record. 

"Chevron`s participation in a `green` energy roundtable discussion is
laughable," said Koenig. "This so-called discussion by one of the world`s worst
corporate polluters is just the latest example of the company trying to deceive
the public while it uses Ecuador as its trash bin." 

Chevron faces a potential liability of $27 billion in a 15-year class action
lawsuit over the environmental damage in Ecuador, which experts have called the
"Amazon Chernobyl". The lawsuit, being heard in Ecuador at Chevron`s request,
alleges that Texaco (now Chevron) dumped more than 18 billion gallons of toxic
waste into a pristine area of rainforest that was once home to six thriving
indigenous groups. 

Texaco also gouged more than 900 large, unlined pits out of the jungle floor to
store oil sludge left over from exploration and well maintenance that are still
leaching toxins into soils and groundwater, according to an independent court
expert in the case. 

A decision in the case is expected later this year. 

Attempting to brand itself as an environmentally conscious company is becoming
more difficult for Chevron as the company`s toxic legacy in Ecuador has garnered
extensive news coverage by large media outlets in the past few weeks. Reports
about the pollution have appeared in the Wall Street Journal, New York Times,
Washington Post and on National Public Radio, among others. 

Chevron`s failure to clean-up the pollution in Ecuador led recently to the
company being named to two separate "Worst of 2008" lists by corporate and
environmental watchdog groups. 

About the Amazon Defense Coalition

The Amazon Defense Coalition represents dozens of rainforest communities and
five indigenous groups that inhabit Ecuador`s Northern Amazon region. The
mission of the Coalition is to protect the environment and secure social justice
through grass roots organizing, political advocacy, and litigation. Two of its
leaders, Luis Yanza and Pablo Fajardo, are the 2008 winners of the prestigious
Goldman Environmental Prize.

&lt;p&gt;Employees Inspire Plan to Help People Continue Pfizer Therapy During
Unprecedented Economic Times
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc announced today that it will launch an innovative program to help
eligible unemployed Americans and their families who have lost their health
insurance maintain access to their Pfizer medicines for free. The inspiration
for the new program, called MAINTAIN (Medicines Assistance for Those who Are in
Need), was generated by Pfizer employees who were witnessing friends, family and
neighbors struggle to make ends meet after losing their jobs. 

"We all know people who have been laid off recently and have lost their health
insurance, making it difficult for them to pay for health care," said Dr. Jorge
Puente, Pfizer`s regional president of Worldwide Pharmaceuticals, a leading
champion of the initiative. "We thought there must be some way we could help
recently unemployed people who are taking Pfizer medicines to continue treatment
during these challenging economic times." 

The program, which applies regardless of prior family income, will be open for
enrollment through December 31, 2009 and applies to eligible Americans who have
become unemployed since January 1, 2009. It is designed to help recently
unemployed Americans and their families who have lost their insurance and who
are taking Pfizer medicines to continue treatment for free for up to one year.
Nearly 46 million Americans lack health insurance coverage, and that number is
increasing as unemployment rates reach their highest levels in 25 years. 

Pfizer employees proposed the idea of MAINTAIN to the company`s senior
leadership team just within the last month. Pfizer employees also asked to be
able to do their part by donating their own money to the program, and the Pfizer
Foundation will match their donations. 

"The current economic environment has added considerable new stress to the daily
life of millions of hard-working Americans, and our colleagues are responding to
help their neighbors in the communities where they reside," said Jeffrey B.
Kindler, chairman and chief executive officer of Pfizer. "The speed with which
we created and approved this program is proof of our commitment to help people
access the medicines they need to live healthier lives. With the launch of this
initiative, which I am proud to say was proposed by our colleagues, we are doing
what we can to ensure that recent loss of employment does not preclude people
from managing their health." 

Eligibility requirements of the new program include:

* Loss of employment since January 1, 2009 
* Prescribed and taking a Pfizer medicine for at least 3 months prior to
becoming unemployed and enrolling in the program 
* Lack of prescription drug coverage 
* Can attest to financial hardship

People who qualify will receive their Pfizer medicines for free for up to 12
months or until they become re-insured (whichever comes first). More than 70
Pfizer primary care medicines will be available through the program. 

To make it easy for people to apply, the program will be integrated into
Pfizer`s existing family of patient assistance programs called Pfizer Helpful
Answers. A single point of entry makes it easy to get help:

* All of Pfizer`s patient assistance programs, including the new program, can be
reached by calling a single phone number (1-866-706-2400) or by visiting
www.PfizerHelpfulAnswers.com
* Those who contact Pfizer Helpful Answers in need of medicines made by another
company will be directed to the Partnership for Prescription Assistance, a
pharmaceutical industry initiative that serves to raise awareness of, and boost
enrollment in, more than 475 public and private patient assistance programs.

The new program will be fully operational on July 1, 2009. However, people in
need now can call 1-866-706-2400 for help. MAINTAIN is a part of Pfizer Helpful
Answers, a joint program of Pfizer Inc and the Pfizer Patient Assistance
Foundation.

&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company unveiled today a new plastic bottle made partially from
plants. The "PlantBottle" is fully recyclable, has a lower reliance on a
non-renewable resource, and reduces carbon emissions, compared with
petroleum-based PET plastic bottles. 

"The `PlantBottle` is a significant development in sustainable packaging
innovation," said Muhtar Kent, Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company. "It
builds on our legacy of environmental ingenuity and sets the course for us to
realize our vision to eventually introduce bottles made with materials that are
100 percent recyclable and renewable." 

Traditional PET bottles are made from petroleum, a non-renewable resource. The
new bottle is made from a blend of petroleum-based materials and up to 30
percent plant-based materials. 

"The Coca-Cola Company is a company with the power to transform the marketplace,
and the introduction of the `PlantBottle` is yet another great example of their
leadership on environmental issues," said Carter Roberts, President and CEO of
World Wildlife Fund, U.S. "We are pleased to be working with Coke to tackle
sustainability issues and drive innovations like this through their supply
chain, the broader industry and the world." 

The "PlantBottle" is currently made through an innovative process that turns
sugar cane and molasses, a by-product of sugar production, into a key component
for PET plastic. Coca-Cola is also exploring the use of other plant materials
for future generations of the "PlantBottle." 

Manufacturing the new plastic bottle is more environmentally efficient as well.
A life-cycle analysis conducted by Imperial College of London indicates the
"PlantBottle" with 30 percent plant-base material reduces carbon emissions by up
to 25 percent, compared with petroleum-based PET. 

Another advantage to the "PlantBottle" is that, unlike other plant-based
plastics, it can be processed through existing manufacturing and recycling
facilities without contaminating traditional PET. So, the material in the
"PlantBottle" can be used, recycled and reused again and again. 

Coca-Cola North America will pilot the "PlantBottle" with Dasani and sparkling
brands in select markets later this year and with vitaminwater in 2010. The
innovative bottles will be identified through on-package messages and in-store
point of sale displays. Web-based communications will also highlight the
bottles` environmental benefits. 

"The `PlantBottle` represents the next step in evolving our system toward the
bottle of the future," said Scott Vitters, Director of Sustainable Packaging of
The Coca-Cola Company. "This innovation is a real win because it moves us closer
to our vision of zero waste with a material that lessens our carbon footprint
and is also recyclable." 

The Coca-Cola Company - the first company to introduce a beverage bottle made
with recycled plastic - has been focused on ensuring the sustainability of its
packaging for decades. It has put resources behind creating packaging that is
recyclable and investing in recycling infrastructure to ensure that its packages
are collected, recycled and re-used. Earlier this year, the Company opened the
world`s largest plastic bottle-to-bottle recycling plant in Spartanburg, S.C.
The plant will produce approximately 100 million pounds of recycled PET plastic
for reuse each year - the equivalent of nearly 2 billion 20-ounce Coca-Cola
bottles. These efforts are all focused on helping "close the loop" on packaging
use and produce truly sustainable packages for consumers.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Chevron comment)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANKARA May 14 (Reuters) - Turkey has been unable to agree
on a deal for oil and gas exploration in the Black Sea with U.S.
oil major Chevron (CVX.N), and talks with German firm RWE had
stalled, Turkish petrol company TPAO said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two companies have been in talks with Ankara to carry
out exploration in the Black Sea region, which Turkey believes
holds some 10 billion barrels of oil and 1.5 trillion cubic
metres of natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are topics on which we could not agree with Chevron,
and Chevron has officially announced it is not interested in
petrol exploration in the Black Sea at this time," TPAO General
Manager Mehmet Uysal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Chevron official however said the company is still
interested in the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron remains interested in Black Sea exploration and
looks forward to further discussions with TPAO," said the
source, speaking on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Uysal did not elaborate on the disagreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Uysal also said talks had stalled with RWE (RWEG.DE) on
exploration in the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon (XOM.N) and Petrobras (PETR4.SA) are continuing work
on exploration in the Black Sea. TPAO has said if oil is found
in the Black Sea by 2010, production will be able to start
between 2015 and 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Turkey imports most of its gas and oil needs.

&lt;p&gt;Product categories vary from consumer and industrial packaging to consumer,
health and automotive applications


GUANGZHOU, China--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Chemical will showcase its broad product portfolio at Booth D41 in
Hall 10.2 at ChinaPlas 2009 International Exhibition at the Pazhou Exhibition
Complex in Guangzhou. 

"With demand for petrochemicals growing throughout China, ChinaPlas is the ideal
place for ExxonMobil Chemical to showcase its global leadership in technology
and innovation," said John Verity, vice president, polyolefins, ExxonMobil
Chemical. "We`ve been here for nine consecutive years to demonstrate our
continued commitment to our customers and the Asian market." 

ExxonMobil will specifically be highlighting its specialty elastomers,
polyethylene and polypropylene-based products. Vistamaxx specialty elastomers,
Santoprene, Enable mPE, Exxtral Performance Polyolefins and Jayflex will be
among the brands on display. 

Among the specialty elastomers on display, Vistamaxx specialty elastomers and
Santoprene thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs) can improve flexibility in
polyolefin-based compositions. 

Santoprene TPVs are flexible, ready-to-use compounds ideal for electrical
insulation and jacketing applications. They exhibit excellent resistance to
ozone, chemicals and UV light; resistance to extreme temperatures; better low
temperature flexibility than thermoplastic polyolefins, good oil resistance;
outstanding electrical performance; and, excellent wet electrical properties. 

Vistamaxx specialty elastomers offer ease of processing and compatibility with a
wide variety of polymers - meaning customers enjoy the flexibility of using them
in a wide variety of new and innovative market applications. These specialty
elastomers can be processed in a number of ways including cast film, blown film,
extrusion coating and injection molding, among others. They provide a gateway to
new, innovative product designs, often at lower costs. 

Along with lower costs, waste reduction and energy consumption are focal points
for many customers. ExxonMobil Chemical`s recently introduced new metallocene
polyethylene product, Enable mPE, which was launched at last year`s ChinaPlas,
has that potential for a broad spectrum of film applications. Its innovative
design reduces the amount of raw materials needed because the films are thinner
but equal in strength. Enable mPE also generates less process waste than resins
used in existing applications, and it is recyclable. Its transparency and
toughness makes Enable mPE ideal for packaging and well-suited for agricultural
greenhouse films. 

ExxonMobil Chemical continues to be at the forefront of innovation to respond to
new demands from consumers, new requirements from manufacturers and new
specifications from equipment makers. For example, Exxtral Performance
Polyolefins are being certified for various automotive applications. The grade
slate joins an extensive portfolio of neat and impact copolymer products widely
used in a variety of interior, exterior and under-the-hood applications. Another
example involves the introduction of a series of innovations that enable the
production of polypropylene fabrics that have cotton-like softness, excellent
drapability and solid abrasion resistance. 

During the show, visitors will be able to see how ExxonMobil Chemical`s products
are used in the manufacturing process. They have teamed up with several machine
manufacturers at the exhibition to demonstrate various applications on the
manufacturing lines. 

The company also will conduct seminars at the Guangzhou International Convention
and Exhibition Center on the innovative solutions to film applications,
broadening the limits with specialty elastomer blends, and the next generation
of metallocene polyethylene solutions from ExxonMobil. 

"Our technological advances continue to bring higher valued products to markets
such as China in the hope of improving the quality of life for each and every
citizen," Verity said. "We continually seek opportunities to respond to
customers` needs and are fully committed to being a reliable, global supplier
and technology leader."

&lt;p&gt;ANKARA May 14 (Reuters) - Turkey has been unable to agree
on a deal for oil and gas exploration in the Black Sea with U.S.
oil major Chevron (CVX.N), and talks with German firm RWE had
stalled, Turkish petrol company TPAO said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The two companies were in talks with Ankara to carry out
exploration in the Black Sea region, which Turkey believes holds
some 10 billion barrels of oil and 1.5 trillion cubic metres of
natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Chevron official declined to comment on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are topics on which we could not agree with Chevron,
and Chevron has officially announced it is not interested in
petrol exploration in the Black Sea at this time," TPAO General
Manager Mehmet Uysal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Uysal did not elaborate on the disagreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Uysal also said talks had stalled with RWE (RWEG.DE) on
exploration in the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon (XOM.N) and Petrobras (PETR4.SA) are continuing work
on exploration in the Black Sea. TPAO has said if oil is found
in the Black Sea by 2010, production will be able to start
between 2015 and 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Turkey imports most of its gas and oil needs.

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
Cypress Bioscience, Inc. (NASDAQ: CYPB), Forest Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE: FRX),

Pfizer (NYSE: PFE).

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Cypress Bio Banks on Savella

Cypress Bioscience, Inc. (NASDAQ: CYPB) reported financial results for the first
quarter 2009 on May 11, 2009. Total revenues for the quarter were $7.9 million,
and consisted primarily of collaborative payments from Savella development
partner, Forest Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE: FRX). This was generally in-line with
our $8.2 million forecast. 

Net loss for the quarter was $9.2 million -- and significantly greater than our
expectations -- due to approximately $5.0 million in R expense associated with
a $3.0 million milestone payment to a licensor, Pierre Fabre, upon NDA approval
of Savella and a $2.0 million payment in connection with an asset purchase
transaction for a technology to diagnose and monitor Lupus. Earnings per share
(EPS) for the first quarter equated to ($0.24). Cypress Bio exited the first
quarter with $160.4 million in cash. 

Allied Irish Banks Improves

In its first quarter trading update, Allied Irish Banks, p.l.c. (NYSE: AIB)
announced that operating profits before bad debt provisions were higher than the
year-ago quarter, reflecting strong performance of its Capital Markets and
Global Treasury divisions. 

However, AIB's other operating divisions are experiencing year-over-year
declines in operating profits as loan demand continues weak, current account and
deposit funding contract, and net interest margins shrink. The decline in the
net interest margin principally reflects highly competitive markets, the low
interest-rate environment, and higher wholesale funding costs, partly offset by
better margins on lending. 

Baxter: More Heparin Problems

Not long after reporting a decent first quarter, Baxter International (NYSE:
BAX) has made headlines once again for its heparin product. 

A renewed heparin-related scare began over the weekend, with two deaths
announced and a third patient suffered complications. The common link between
all three patients is the administration of heparin. Initial reports indicate
that the pharmaceutical ingredients were sourced in North America, likely from
Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). The contaminant from the Chinese factory during the 2008
scare (over-sulfated chondroitin sulfate) was not found in the recently tested
samples.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research picks Transocean Ltd. (NYSE: RIG) as Bull of the Day and
Gerdau S.A. (NYSE: GGB) as Bear of the Day. In addition, the analysts at Zacks
Equity Research discuss the latest on Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS), JP Morgan Chase
(NYSE: JPM)and US Bancorp (NYSE: USB). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at: http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678

Bull of the Day

Transocean Ltd. (NYSE: RIG) reported strong first-quarter 2009 results driven by
solid contribution from the high-specification floaters and significant cost
control measures. Transocean continues to generate significant cash flows
supported by a $36 billion backlog, which is of a very high credit quality. 

The company is deploying its ample cash flows to strengthen its balance sheet
and invest in its newbuild program. 

Our Buy recommendation remains unchanged, though we have lowered our estimates
to reflect a relatively softer outlook for the mid-water and jack-up fleet. Our
new 2009 and 2010 EPS estimates are $13.10 and $12.85, down from $14.26 and
$14.95, respectively. 

Bear of the Day

We are maintaining our Sell recommendation on Gerdau S.A. (NYSE: GGB) based on
poor first quarter results and a huge decrease in demand for steel worldwide. 

The huge decline in steel prices and the international economic slowdown creates
a more challenging business environment for the steel industry. The company`s
strategy to grow through acquisitions based on debt is contributing to the
negative news. 

Moreover, huge exposure to the U.S. market during a recession is a major
concern. Our target price is $5.75 per share. 

Recent Analysis from the Analyst Blog

New Financial Sector Pay Rules

New compensation rules are likely to be issued as a part of broader
financial-markets regulation reforms that the Treasury is currently working on.
Earlier this year, the government had issued guidelines limiting salaries for
top executives at firms that received bailout funds from the Troubled Asset
Relief Program (TARP). 

Currently many banks, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS), JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:
JPM)and US Bancorp (NYSE: USB) are preparing to repay TARP funds mainly to
escape the government restriction and oversight on compensation. New rules would
bring back these companies under government oversight on compensation. 

An era of deregulation and a compensation structure that rewarded excessive
risk-taking created the financial mess that we are in. While micromanagement of
the financial sector by the government is undesirable, we certainly need to
prevent any excessive risk taking behavior in the future, as also ensure that
incentives are tied to long-term performance.

&lt;p&gt;(Adds quote, Hong Kong exchange response, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Samuel Shen and George Chen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI/HONG KONG May 14 (Reuters) - Charles Li, a
long-time Wall Street veteran and top boss of JPMorgan (JPM.N) in
China, on Thursday confirmed media reports that he would leave
the bank to pursue other interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When contacted by Reuters seeking confirmation of a media
report that he was leaving, Li, JPMorgan China chairman said by
telephone: "That's only part of the story."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Li declined to disclose his next job or comment further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier on Thursday, Hong Kong newspaper Ming Pao reported
that Li was expected to replace Paul Chow as the new chief
executive of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (0388.HK),
which operates the Hong Kong stock market, a popular destination
for China IPOs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The process of selecting a new CEO is now in the final stage
and the exchange will announce the results in due course, the
exchange said in an e-mailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A JPMorgan spokeswoman in Beijing declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Li joined JPMorgan in March, 2003, previously working at
Merrill Lynch and law firms Davis Pok  Wardwell and Brown 
Wood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Li joined Merrill in 1994 and become China president in 1999.
At Merrill, Li played a role in helping China's first batch of
state-owned enterprises to list overseas.

&lt;p&gt;Eine heute ver&#246;ffentlichte Studie der Harvard Kennedy School und der
International Finance Corporation begutachtet das Modell der manuellen
Distributionszentren von Coca-Cola in Afrika
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
An einer Podiumsdiskussion an der Brookings Institution haben der ehemalige
US-Pr&#228;sident Bill Clinton, Muhtar Kent, der Chairman und CEO der Coca-Cola
Company, und Pat Woertz, Chairman, CEO und President der Archer Daniels Midland
Company, &#252;ber die M&#246;glichkeiten gesprochen, mit denen Wirtschaftsunternehmen
sowohl f&#252;r ihre Aktion&#228;re als auch f&#252;r die Gesellschaft wertsch&#246;pfende Ma&#223;nahmen
treffen k&#246;nnen. Sie betonten dabei den Einsatz von Kernt&#228;tigkeiten der
Unternehmen zur F&#246;rderung von Wachstum und Entwicklung in Schwellenl&#228;ndern. 

Das System von Coca-Cola mit manuellen Distributionszentren (Manual Distribution
Centers, MDC) in Afrika wurde als Beispiel f&#252;r eine innovative L&#246;sung genannt,
mit der sowohl Unternehmenszwecke als auch internationale Entwicklungsziele
gef&#246;rdert werden k&#246;nnen. Mit dem Ansatz von Coca-Cola beim Vertrieb von
Produkten in schwer erreichbaren st&#228;dtischen und stadtnahen Gebieten in Afrika
werden Kleinunternehmen eingesetzt, die die Produkte von Coca-Cola manuell an
lokale Kleinh&#228;ndler verteilen. Diese MDCs machen &#252;ber 80 Prozent des
Unternehmensumsatzes in Ostafrika aus, bieten dabei einer wachsenden Zahl von
Jungunternehmern die Gelegenheit, ihr eigenes kleines Gesch&#228;ft zu gr&#252;nden und
schaffen auch Arbeitspl&#228;tze f&#252;r Frauen. Bisher wurden in Afrika durch das System
von Coca-Cola &#252;ber 2500 MDCs mit mehr als 12.000 Angestellten geschaffen, die
einen Jahresertrag von &#252;ber 500 Millionen US-Dollar erwirtschaften. 

&#8222;F&#252;r Coca-Cola sind diese manuellen Distributionszentren ein wunderbares
Beispiel daf&#252;r, wie ein Unternehmen sich auf die Erf&#252;llung der Bed&#252;rfnisse
seiner Verbraucher und Kunden konzentrieren und dabei gleichzeitig etwas f&#252;r die
Zukunft der lokalen Gemeinschaften tun kann", sagte Muhtar Kent, Chairman und
CEO der Coca-Cola Company. &#8222;Unsere Philosophie beruht schon lange darauf, unser
Unternehmenssystem ganzheitlich zu betrachten und dann zu bestimmen, wo wir
wichtige Ma&#223;nahmen ergreifen k&#246;nnen, die den gr&#246;&#223;ten Einfluss auf &#246;rtliche
Gemeinschaften sowie auf unsere Interessengruppen haben, denn wir sind auf beide
angewiesen." 

Das Unternehmen setzt sich daf&#252;r ein, die Anzahl an MDCs in Afrika zu erh&#246;hen,
seit es dem sogenannten Business Call to Action beigetreten ist, einer
Initiative zur Mobilisierung gro&#223;er Firmen, die durch Nutzbarmachung ihrer
Kernkompetenzen zum Erreichen der UN-Millenniumsziele beitragen sollen. Um
bestimmen zu k&#246;nnen, wie dieses Modell am besten zu erweitern ist, bat Coca-Cola
die Abteilung f&#252;r unternehmerische Gesellschaftsverantwortung (Corporate Social
Responsibility Initiative) an der Harvard Kennedy School und die International
Finance Corporation (IFC) um eine Begutachtung des Ansatzes. 

Im Jahr 2008 wurde eine Untersuchung der gegenw&#228;rtigen Betriebsabl&#228;ufe im Rahmen
des MDC-Modells in der tansanischen Hauptstadt Dar es Salaam und in der
&#228;thiopischen Hauptstadt Addis Abeba durchgef&#252;hrt. 

&#8222;Wirtschaftskreise und internationale Entwicklungshelfer erkennen mehr und mehr,
dass der nachhaltigste Beitrag von Unternehmen zur Armutsminderung darin
besteht, ihre Kernt&#228;tigkeiten auf gewinnbringende, verantwortliche und
integrierende Weise auszu&#252;ben", sagte Jane Nelson von der Harvard Kennedy
School. 

&#8222;Unsere Untersuchung der manuellen Distributionszentren in Tansania und
&#196;thiopien deutet auf das Potenzial hin, das f&#252;r gro&#223;e Konzerne beim Aufbau von
Gesch&#228;ftsverbindungen mit Kleinunternehmen innerhalb ihrer Wertsch&#246;pfungskette
besteht, was auch f&#252;r die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung vorteilhaft sein kann",
sagte der Leiter der IFC, Toshiya Masuoka. 

Die Forschungsstudie ermittelte auch eine Reihe von M&#246;glichkeiten zur Vertiefung
des MDC-Ansatzes. Dazu geh&#246;ren: 1.) Investitionen in die stetige Verbesserung
des Gesch&#228;ftsmodells durch bessere Finanzierungsgelegenheiten sowie mehr und
bessere Ausbildungsm&#246;glichkeiten; 2.) Verbesserung des sozio&#246;konomischen Status
von MDC-Inhabern durch Vermittlung von Sozialkompetenzen und
Weiterbildungsm&#246;glichkeiten; 3.) F&#246;rderung der Entwicklung von Kleinunternehmen
und Unternehmertum durch Unterst&#252;tzung von unternehmerischen Ausbildungen und
Eintreten f&#252;r die Weiterentwicklung von Kleinunternehmen; 4.) Untersuchung von
M&#246;glichkeiten zur Verbreitung von sozialen Produkten und Botschaften &#252;ber das
Gesch&#228;ftsmodell; und 5.) Durchf&#252;hrung von partizipativer Evaluation und
aktionsorientierten Lernmethoden.

Coca-Cola f&#252;hrt gegenw&#228;rtig Gespr&#228;che mit potenziellen Entwicklungspartnern, mit
denen einige dieser M&#246;glichkeiten zur St&#228;rkung des Modells gemeinsam verfolgt
werden sollen. 

Die Coca-Cola Company ist der weltweit gr&#246;&#223;te Getr&#228;nkehersteller und bietet den
Verbrauchern beinahe 500 erfrischende Marken mit oder ohne Kohlens&#228;ure. Neben
Coca-Cola, die als wertvollste Marke der Welt gilt, enth&#228;lt das Portfolio des
Unternehmens zw&#246;lf weitere Milliardenmarken, zu denen unter anderen Coca-Cola
light, Fanta, Sprite, Coca-Cola Zero, vitaminwater, POWERADE, Minute Maid und
Georgia Coffee geh&#246;ren. Wir sind weltweiter Anbieter Nummer eins von
kohlens&#228;urehaltigen Erfrischungsgetr&#228;nken, Fruchts&#228;ften und Fruchtsaftgetr&#228;nken
sowie trinkfertigen Tee- und Kaffeegetr&#228;nken. &#220;ber das weltweit gr&#246;&#223;te
Getr&#228;nkeverteilsystem kommen Verbraucher in &#252;ber 200 L&#228;ndern t&#228;glich in den
Genuss von knapp 1,6 Milliarden Getr&#228;nkeportionen von unserem Unternehmen. Mit
unserem anhaltenden Einsatz f&#252;r die Entwicklung von nachhaltigen Gemeinschaften
setzen wir uns f&#252;r Ma&#223;nahmen zum Schutz der Umwelt, zur Schonung von nat&#252;rlichen
Ressourcen und zur wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung der Gemeinschaften in unserem
Einflussgebiet ein. Weitere Informationen &#252;ber unser Unternehmen entnehmen Sie

ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Au cours d'une discussion en groupe men&#233;e aujourd'hui &#224; la Brookings
Institution, le pr&#233;sident Bill Clinton, Muhtar Ken, le pr&#233;sident-directeur
g&#233;n&#233;ral de la soci&#233;t&#233; Coca-Cola et Pat Woertz, le pr&#233;sident-directeur g&#233;n&#233;ral de
la soci&#233;t&#233; Archer Daniels Midland, ont d&#233;battu des fa&#231;ons dont l'entreprise
pouvait jouer un r&#244;le pour pr&#233;server au mieux les int&#233;r&#234;ts de ses actionnaires
et ceux de la communaut&#233;. Ils ont soulign&#233; l'int&#233;r&#234;t d'exploiter les activit&#233;s
de base de l'entreprise pour stimuler la croissance et le d&#233;veloppement,
notamment sur les march&#233;s &#233;mergents. 

Le programme de Centre de distribution manuelle (Manual Distribution Center,
MDC) de Coca-Cola en Afrique a &#233;t&#233; cit&#233; comme un exemple de solution innovante
satisfaisant &#224; la fois les objectifs de l'entreprise et le calendrier de
d&#233;veloppement international. La m&#233;thode utilis&#233;e par Coca-Cola pour distribuer
ses produits dans les zones urbaines et p&#233;ri-urbaines difficiles d'acc&#232;s en
Afrique est de faire appel &#224; de petites entreprises qui d&#233;livrent manuellement
les produits Coca-Cola aux petits d&#233;taillants locaux. Les MDC repr&#233;sentent plus
de 80 pour cent des ventes de la soci&#233;t&#233; en Afrique de l'Est tout en cr&#233;ant des
opportunit&#233;s de cr&#233;ation de petites entreprises et d'emplois pour un nombre
croissant de futurs entrepreneurs et de femmes. &#192; ce jour, le syst&#232;me Coca-Cola
a cr&#233;&#233; plus de 2 500 MDC en Afrique qui emploient plus de 12 000 personnes et
g&#233;n&#232;rent plus de 500 millions de dollars de recettes annuelles. 

&#171; Pour Coca-Cola, ces centres de distribution manuelle sont un magnifique
exemple de la fa&#231;on dont une entreprise peut cibler au mieux les besoins de ses
consommateurs et de ses clients tout en concourant &#224; la survie de communaut&#233;s &#187;
a d&#233;clar&#233; Muhtar Kent, le pr&#233;sident-directeur g&#233;n&#233;ral de la soci&#233;t&#233; Coca-Cola. &#171;
Notre philosophie, depuis tr&#232;s longtemps, est de consid&#233;rer notre syst&#232;me
commercial d'un point de vue holistique et de d&#233;terminer o&#249; nous pouvons avoir
le plus grand impact, en avan&#231;ant des initiatives qui profitent aux communaut&#233;s
et aux partenaires dont nous d&#233;pendons. &#187; 

La soci&#233;t&#233; s'est engag&#233;e &#224; augmenter le nombre de MDC en Afrique depuis son
adh&#233;sion &#224; Business Call to Action (appel &#224; l'action des entreprises),
initiative mobilisant les grandes entreprises afin de contribuer &#224; atteindre les
objectifs du mill&#233;naire pour le d&#233;veloppement, en exploitant les comp&#233;tences
professionnelles de base. Pour d&#233;terminer la meilleure fa&#231;on de faire passer son
mod&#232;le &#224; la dimension sup&#233;rieure, Coca-Cola a demand&#233; &#224; l'Initiative pour la
responsabilit&#233; sociale des entreprises (Corporate Social Responsibility
Initiative) de la Harvard Kennedy School et &#224; la Soci&#233;t&#233; financi&#232;re
internationale (International Finance Corporation, IFC) de revoir son approche. 

Au cours de 2008, ont &#233;t&#233; examin&#233;es les actuelles op&#233;rations du mod&#232;le MDC &#224; Dar
es Salaam, en Tanzanie, et &#224; Addis Abeba, en &#201;thiopie. 

&#171; On reconna&#238;t de plus en plus au sein des entreprises et des communaut&#233;s pour
le d&#233;veloppement international que la contribution la plus durable pouvant &#234;tre
apport&#233;e par les entreprises pour diminuer la pauvret&#233; est de mener leurs
activit&#233;s de base d'une fa&#231;on rentable et responsable qui favorise l'int&#233;gration
&#187; a d&#233;clar&#233; Jane Nelson de la Harvard Kennedy School. 

&#171; Notre examen des centres de distribution manuelle en Tanzanie et en &#201;thiopie
d&#233;montre le potentiel des grandes entreprises &#224; b&#226;tir des liens commerciaux
&#233;conomiquement viables avec les petites entreprises dans le cadre de leurs
cha&#238;nes logistiques, qui peuvent &#233;galement porter leurs fruits au niveau du
d&#233;veloppement &#187; a d&#233;clar&#233; le directeur d'IFC, Toshiya Masuoka. 

Cette &#233;tude a identifi&#233; plusieurs opportunit&#233;s pour am&#233;liorer l'initiative MDC.
Ce sont : 1) investir dans l'am&#233;lioration continue du mod&#232;le de fonctionnement
de base par un acc&#232;s am&#233;lior&#233; au financement et une extension et une
am&#233;lioration de la formation, 2) accro&#238;tre l'opportunit&#233; socio-&#233;conomique
ouverte aux g&#233;rants et aux employ&#233;s des MDC par l'acc&#232;s aux connaissances
&#233;l&#233;mentaires et de meilleures opportunit&#233;s d'apprentissage, 3) promouvoir plus
largement le d&#233;veloppement des petites entreprises et l'entrepreneuriat, en
soutenant la formation sur l'entrepreneuriat et en d&#233;fendant le d&#233;veloppement
des petites entreprises, 4) explorer la fa&#231;on dont ce mod&#232;le de fonctionnement
pourrait aider au d&#233;ploiement de produits ou de messages sociaux et 5) mettre en
&#339;uvre l'&#233;valuation participative et un apprentissage ax&#233; sur l'action. 

Cette &#233;tude est disponible sur le site
http://www.hks.harvard.edu/m-rcbg/CSRI/publications/other_10_MDC_report.pdf.
Coca-Cola est actuellement en pourparlers avec des partenaires de d&#233;veloppement
potentiels pour l'aider &#224; poursuivre certaines de ces opportunit&#233;s afin de
renforcer encore le mod&#232;le. 

La soci&#233;t&#233; Coca-Cola est le plus grand producteur de boissons au monde et
propose aux consommateurs, pour se rafra&#238;chir, plus de 500 marques de boissons
gazeuses et non gazeuses. Outre Coca-Cola, reconnue comme la marque la plus
pris&#233;e dans le monde, le catalogue de la soci&#233;t&#233; comprend 12 autres marques qui
lui valent des milliards de dollars, telles que Diet Coke, Fanta, Sprite,
Coca-Cola Zero, vitaminwater, POWERADE, Minute Maid et Georgia Coffee. C'est le
num&#233;ro un mondial des boissons p&#233;tillantes, des jus de fruits et boissons &#224; base
de jus de fruit et des th&#233;s et caf&#233;s pr&#234;ts &#224; boire. &#192; travers le plus grand
syst&#232;me de distribution mondial, des consommateurs de plus de 200 pays se
r&#233;galent des boissons de Coca-Cola au rythme d'environ 1,6 milliard d`unit&#233;s par
jour. Mue par un engagement tenace envers la cr&#233;ation de communaut&#233;s durables,
la soci&#233;t&#233; privil&#233;gie les initiatives qui prot&#232;gent l'environnement, pr&#233;servent

&lt;p&gt;Un estudio realizado por la Corporaci&#243;n Financiera Internacional y Harvard
Kennedy School publicado hoy, eval&#250;a el modelo de los centros de distribuci&#243;n
manual de Coca-Cola en &#193;frica.
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Hoy, en una mesa redonda realizada en Brookings Institution, el presidente Bill
Clinton; Muhtar Kent, presidente y director ejecutivo de The Coca-Cola Company;
y Pat Woertz, presidente y director ejecutivo de Archer Daniels Midland Company,
debatieron acerca de la importancia de las empresas al momento de crear valor
tanto para los accionistas como para la sociedad. Enfatizaron el valor de
aprovechar sus principales actividades comerciales para promover el crecimiento
y el desarrollo, en especial en los mercados emergentes. 

El programa de centros de distribuci&#243;n manual (Manual Distribution Center, MDC)
del sistema de Coca-Cola desarrollado en &#193;frica fue mencionado como ejemplo de
una soluci&#243;n innovadora que anticipa tanto metas comerciales como la agenda de
desarrollo internacional. El enfoque de Coca-Cola para distribuir sus productos
en &#225;reas urbanas y periurbanas de dif&#237;cil acceso en &#193;frica utiliza peque&#241;as
empresas que distribuyen productos de Coca-Cola manualmente a los peque&#241;os
minoristas de la zona. Los MDC representan m&#225;s del ochenta por ciento de las
ventas de la compa&#241;&#237;a en &#193;frica Oriental y, a su vez, ofrecen la oportunidad de
formar peque&#241;as empresas y crear empleos para un n&#250;mero cada vez mayor de
emprendedores principiantes y mujeres. A la fecha, el sistema de Coca-Cola ha
creado m&#225;s de 2.500 MDC en &#193;frica, lo que gener&#243; empleo para m&#225;s de 12.000
personas y una ganancia anual de m&#225;s de US$ 500 millones. 

"Para Coca-Cola, los centros de distribuci&#243;n manual constituyen un ejemplo
excelente para demostrar la forma en que las empresas pueden concentrarse en
satisfacer las necesidades de sus consumidores y clientes y, al mismo tiempo,
apoyar la sostenibilidad de las comunidades", coment&#243; Muhtar Kent, presidente y
director ejecutivo de The Coca-Cola Company. "Nuestra filosof&#237;a siempre ha sido
considerar nuestro sistema comercial de manera integral y determinar d&#243;nde
podemos tener el mayor impacto en el adelanto de iniciativas que son
fundamentales para las comunidades y para los accionistas de los que
dependemos". 

La empresa se ha dedicado a ampliar la cantidad de MDC que existen en &#193;frica
desde que se uni&#243; a Business Call to Action, una iniciativa que moviliza a las
grandes empresas para que, aprovechando sus principales competencias
comerciales, ayuden a alcanzar los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio. Para
determinar la mejor forma de ampliar su modelo, Coca-Cola solicit&#243; a la
Iniciativa de Responsabilidad Social Corporativa de Harvard Kennedy School y a
la Corporaci&#243;n Financiera Internacional (International Finance Corporation, IFC)
que examinaran el enfoque. 

Durante el a&#241;o 2008, se llev&#243; a cabo una revisi&#243;n de las operaciones actuales
del modelo de MDC en Dar es Salaam, Tanzania y en Addis Ababa, Etiop&#237;a. 

"Se reconoce cada vez m&#225;s en las comunidades de desarrollo internacional y
empresarial que la forma m&#225;s sostenible en que las empresas pueden contribuir
con la disminuci&#243;n de la pobreza es llevar a cabo sus principales actividades
comerciales de manera rentable, responsable e inclusiva", expres&#243; Jane Nelson de
Harvard Kennedy School. 

"La revisi&#243;n de los centros de distribuci&#243;n manual de Tanzania y Etiop&#237;a
demuestra el potencial de las grandes empresas para construir nexos comerciales
econ&#243;micamente viables con peque&#241;as empresas en sus cadenas de valor, lo que
tambi&#233;n pueden sumar beneficios de desarrollo", afirm&#243; Toshiya Masuoka, director
de la IFC. 

En el estudio de investigaci&#243;n, se identificaron diversas oportunidades para
mejorar a&#250;n m&#225;s el enfoque de los MDC. Estas oportunidades incluyen: 1) invertir
en el progreso continuo del principal modelo comercial mediante un acceso
perfeccionado al financiamiento y capacitaci&#243;n ampliada y mejorada; 2) ampliar
oportunidades socioecon&#243;micas para los propietarios y empleados de los MDC a
trav&#233;s de habilidades para desenvolverse en la vida y m&#225;s oportunidades
educativas; 3) promover la iniciativa empresarial y el desarrollo de las
peque&#241;as empresas de manera m&#225;s extensa, apoyando la educaci&#243;n y la defensa de
la iniciativa empresarial para el desarrollo de las peque&#241;as empresas, 4)
analizar la forma en que el modelo comercial podr&#237;a distribuir mensajes o
productos sociales; y 5) asumir una evaluaci&#243;n participativa y un aprendizaje
basado en la acci&#243;n. 

El estudio se encuentra disponible en
http://www.hks.harvard.edu/m-rcbg/CSRI/publications/other_10_MDC_report.pdf.
Actualmente, Coca-Cola est&#225; negociando con posibles socios de desarrollo para
ayudar a aprovechar algunas de estas oportunidades y, de esa manera, afianzar el
modelo aun m&#225;s. 

Coca-Cola Company es la empresa de bebidas m&#225;s grande del mundo, que refresca a
consumidores con aproximadamente 500 marcas de bebidas con y sin gas. Junto con
Coca-Cola, reconocida como la marca m&#225;s preciada del mundo, la cartera de la
compa&#241;&#237;a incluye otras doce marcas de mil millones de d&#243;lares, entre ellas, Diet
Coke, Fanta, Sprite, Coca-Cola Zero, vitaminwater, POWERADE, Minute Maid y

quanto para a sociedade. Eles enfatizaram o valor de aproveitar as principais
atividades da empresa para promover o crescimento e o desenvolvimento,
especialmente nos mercados emergentes. 

O programa do Centro de distribui&#231;&#227;o manual (Manual Distribution Center - MDC)
do sistema Coca-Cola na &#193;frica foi mencionado como exemplo de solu&#231;&#227;o inovadora
que promove tanto as metas da empresa quanto o cronograma de desenvolvimento
internacional. A abordagem da Coca-Cola para a distribui&#231;&#227;o de seus produtos em
&#225;reas urbanas e de periferia de dif&#237;cil acesso da &#193;frica utiliza pequenas
empresas que entregam os produtos da Coca-Cola manualmente para pequenos
varejistas locais. O programa MDC &#233; respons&#225;vel por mais de oitenta por cento
das vendas da empresa no Leste Africano, criando assim oportunidades de
participa&#231;&#227;o de pequenas empresas e empregos para um n&#250;mero crescente de novos
empres&#225;rios e mulheres. At&#233; hoje, o sistema Coca-Cola criou mais de dois mil e
quinhentos desses Centros na &#193;frica, empregando mais de doze mil pessoas e
gerando mais de US$ 500 milh&#245;es em receitas anuais. 

"Para a Coca-Cola, os Centros de Distribui&#231;&#227;o Manual s&#227;o um &#243;timo exemplo de
como as empresas podem ter como foco o atendimento das necessidades dos clientes
e consumidores enquanto apoiam a sustentabilidade das comunidades", declarou
Muhtar Kent, chairman e diretor executivo da The Coca-Cola Company. "H&#225; muito
tempo, tem sido nossa filosofia encarar nosso sistema de neg&#243;cios holisticamente
e determinar onde podemos conseguir maior impacto com iniciativas de progresso,
iniciativas essas cr&#237;ticas para as comunidades e os investidores de quem
dependemos". 

A empresa se comprometeu a aumentar gradualmente o n&#250;mero de centros na &#193;frica
desde que se uniu &#224; "Chamada para a A&#231;&#227;o" das empresas, uma iniciativa que
mobiliza grandes empresas para ajudar a atingir as metas de desenvolvimento do
mil&#234;nio, canalizando as principais compet&#234;ncias das empresas. Para determinar o
melhor m&#233;todo de ampliar seu modelo, a Coca-Cola solicitou &#224; Iniciativa de
responsabilidade social corporativa da Harvard Kennedy School e &#224; International
Finance Corporation (IFC) uma an&#225;lise da sua abordagem. 

Durante o ano de 2008, foi realizada uma an&#225;lise das opera&#231;&#245;es atuais do modelo
de centros de distribui&#231;&#227;o manual em Dar es Salaam, Tanz&#226;nia e Addis Ababa,
Eti&#243;pia. 

"Cresce o reconhecimento nas comunidades corporativas e de desenvolvimento
internacional de que a contribui&#231;&#227;o mais sustent&#225;vel que as empresas podem
oferecer para reduzir a pobreza &#233; realizar suas principais atividades de
neg&#243;cios de modo lucrativo, respons&#225;vel e inclusivo", disse Jane Nelson da
Harvard Kennedy School. 

"Nossa an&#225;lise dos Centros de distribui&#231;&#227;o Manual na Tanz&#226;nia e na Eti&#243;pia
demonstra o potencial de grandes corpora&#231;&#245;es para a cria&#231;&#227;o de conex&#245;es de
neg&#243;cios economicamente vi&#225;veis com pequenas empresas em suas cadeias de valor,
que tamb&#233;m podem trazer benef&#237;cios para o desenvolvimento", declarou o Diretor
do IFC, Toshiya Masuoka. 

A pesquisa identificou uma s&#233;rie de oportunidades para melhorar ainda mais o
enfoque dos centros, incluindo: 1) investir em melhorias cont&#237;nuas do modelo
principal de neg&#243;cios atrav&#233;s de maior acesso a financiamentos e a treinamento
ampliado e melhorado e melhorado; 2) ampliar as oportunidades socioecon&#244;micas
para os propriet&#225;rios e funcion&#225;rios dos centros atrav&#233;s de oportunidades de
aprendizado de habilidades cotidianas e educa&#231;&#227;o ampliada; 3) promover de forma
mais ampla o desenvolvimento de pequenas empresas e do empreendedorismo atrav&#233;s
do apoio &#224; educa&#231;&#227;o para o empreendedorismo e da promo&#231;&#227;o do desenvolvimento das
pequenas empresas; 4) verificar como o modelo de neg&#243;cios pode distribuir
produtos ou mensagens sociais; e 5) assumir a avalia&#231;&#227;o participativa e o
aprendizado com base na a&#231;&#227;o. 

O estudo est&#225; dispon&#237;vel em
http://www.hks.harvard.edu/m-rcbg/CSRI/publications/other_10_MDC_report.pdf. A
Coca-Cola est&#225; atualmente desenvolvendo conversa&#231;&#245;es com potenciais parceiros de
desenvolvimento para auxiliar a buscar algumas dessas oportunidades e fortalecer
ainda mais o modelo.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Venture-capital investments have been falling in a depressed economy but this is not necessarily stifling technology start-ups, as it becomes easier to get firms off the ground without outside investment, Microsoft says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"With the advent of relatively cheap computing, relatively cheap bandwidth for communications, the cost of setting up a start-up has gone down," the head of Microsoft's emerging business team, Cliff Reeves, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of companies are making their start without investors," said Reeves, speaking as Microsoft announced this week it was partnering with HSBC bank and telecoms provider BT to expand its entrepreneur-support network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Hendershott, a professor of private equity and entrepreneurship at Santa Clara University, has also argued recently that venture capital is becoming less relevant for entrepreneurs starting Web companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a paper to be published in the next issue of the International Review of Entrepreneurship, he writes that many founders can now finance companies using just savings, money from family and friends or credit-card debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investments in start-ups in the United States more than halved in the first quarter to $3 billion, according to the MoneyTree Report by the National Venture Capital Association and PricewaterhouseCoopers based on data from Thomson Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. software VC investments dropped to $614 million from $1.38 billion a year earlier, telecom investments fell to $110 million from $436 million, and Internet investments fell to $556 million from $1.32 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;QUALITY INVESTMENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reeves argues, however, that serious investors are not going away: "The people who have solid investment portfolios are staying in the market, so while there's maybe a little reduction in investment, the quality of the investments remains high."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds: "Valuations have come down a little, so when a company comes to take an investment they're going to give up a little more equity, which makes the investment more attractive, so it's gotten better for good companies and good investors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has no VC fund of its own, but it launched an initiative last November with dozens of partners to support entrepreneurs with resources in kind and expertise.

 WHAT:          A very special screening of "the boys: the sherman brothers` story" - a feature-length documentary about the Sherman Brothers, the astoundingly prolific Academy Award-winning songwriting team whose successful professional collaboration in family entertainment masked the brothers' escalating personal differences throughout their six-decade partnership.

The Academy Award-winning brothers, Richard and Robert Sherman, arguably defined family musical entertainment with unforgettable songs like "Chim Chim Cher-ee" and "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" from "Mary Poppins"; "I Wanna Be Like You" from "The Jungle Book"; the score to "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" and the most translated song ever written, "It`s a Small World (After All)" from the popular Disneyland attraction.

While their songs were cherished by both audiences and Walt Disney himself, outside the public eye, the boys` personal relationship with each other was far less harmonious. In the feature length documentary "the boys: the sherman brothers` story," a wide array of notable celebrities, professional peers, close friends, family members and the brothers themselves describe the Shermans` eight-decade journey through love and partnership, loyalty and estrangement. "the boys: the sherman brothers` story" is a unique, yet universal story of two brothers pursuing true passion,  
                battling personal differences and working as a team to, ultimately, walk with giants.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Venture-capital investments have been falling in a depressed economy but this is not necessarily stifling technology start-ups, as it becomes easier to get firms off the ground without outside investment, Microsoft says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"With the advent of relatively cheap computing, relatively cheap bandwidth for communications, the cost of setting up a start-up has gone down," the head of Microsoft's emerging business team, Cliff Reeves, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of companies are making their start without investors," said Reeves, speaking as Microsoft announced this week it was partnering with HSBC bank and telecoms provider BT to expand its entrepreneur-support network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Hendershott, a professor of private equity and entrepreneurship at Santa Clara University, has also argued recently that venture capital is becoming less relevant for entrepreneurs starting Web companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a paper to be published in the next issue of the International Review of Entrepreneurship, he writes that many founders can now finance companies using just savings, money from family and friends or credit-card debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investments in start-ups in the United States more than halved in the first quarter to $3 billion, according to the MoneyTree Report by the National Venture Capital Association and PricewaterhouseCoopers based on data from Thomson Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. software VC investments dropped to $614 million from $1.38 billion a year earlier, telecom investments fell to $110 million from $436 million, and Internet investments fell to $556 million from $1.32 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;QUALITY INVESTMENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reeves argues, however, that serious investors are not going away: "The people who have solid investment portfolios are staying in the market, so while there's maybe a little reduction in investment, the quality of the investments remains high."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds: "Valuations have come down a little, so when a company comes to take an investment they're going to give up a little more equity, which makes the investment more attractive, so it's gotten better for good companies and good investors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has no VC fund of its own, but it launched an initiative last November with dozens of partners to support entrepreneurs with resources in kind and expertise. HSBC is its biggest financial partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, for example, provides free software development tools and a platform for start-ups to run the applications they create with those tools for three years, at the end of which they pay a fee of $100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reeves acknowledges that firms are extremely unlikely to switch to other software after three years of building their business around Microsoft -- but says the software giant's motivation is to help ensure future generations of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HSBC says the partnership will help it differentiate itself from other banks in appealing to technology start-ups, which account for 8 percent of all the start-ups to which it lends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This program gives us something unique to target a sector that we're very, very interested in," HSBC's global head of small-business marketing, Rupert Bedell, told Reuters. "Tech start-ups have a higher prosper ratio than most."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HSBC recently created a new $5 billion fund for small businesses, on top of its normal lending, of which 1 billion pounds ($1.5 billion) is earmarked for Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Rupert Winchester)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, updates stock movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 15 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded the U.S.
specialty chemical sector to "attractive" from "neutral,"
citing a more constructive outlook for the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have increased confidence that the global economy is
approaching bottom and green shoots of a cyclical rebound are
emerging," analyst Robert Koort said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst cited stabilizing demand and customer inventory
rebuilds in markets such as housing and electronics, easing
credit conditions and positive macro economic data from China,
the United States and UK for his global economic outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst added paint and coatings maker Valspar Corp
(VAL.N) to the Americas Conviction Buy List, as he sees a
"meaningful" earnings rebound for the company, helped by its
exposure to the Chinese market and falling raw material costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Koort downgraded Ecolab Inc (ECL.N), a provider of cleaning
supplies and services, to "neutral" from "buy," as he expects
other specialty chemical companies to outperform Ecolab over
the next several quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Ecolab should remain a core holding for long-term
growth investors, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Koort removed paint maker Sherwin-Williams Co (SHW.N) from
the Americas Sell List and replaced it with Cytec Industries
Inc (CYT.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst upgraded Sherwin-Williams to "neutral" from
"sell," saying recent positive developments in the U.S. housing
market and low raw material costs could drive fundamental
improvement as the year progresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Top picks in the sector are Air Products and Chemicals Inc
(APD.N), Nalco Holding Co NLC.N and Albemarle Corp (ALB.N),
he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Valspar were trading up 4 percent at $23.59,
while those of Ecolab were down 2 percent at $36.14 Friday
afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Alcoa Inc (AA.N) shares rose nearly 7 percent on Friday after Goldman Sachs resumed coverage of the aluminum producer with a "buy" rating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a note to investors, Goldman said that despite challenging aluminum fundamentals, the stock represented an "attractive risk-reward for medium- to long-term investors," and the firm set a share price target of $13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Alcoa stock was up 59 cents, or 6.8 percent, at $9.33.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Alcoa reported a second consecutive quarterly net loss as metal prices and global aluminum demand slumped in the economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Alcoa's recent capital raise has mitigated balance sheet concerns and positions shares for upside," Goldman's note said. "Cost control measures will help the company weather what we believe is the toughest environment the industry has ever faced."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improving U.S. macroeconomic data and indications of China's economic re-inflation should gradually alleviate weak aluminum fundamentals, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve James; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)&lt;/p&gt;

four-time medalist in women`s gymnastics from the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games,

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO May 15 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Japan group refiner
TonenGeneral Sekiyu (5012.T) said on Friday its oil product
exports for January-March rose 5 percent from a year earlier,
led by a 22 percent gain in middle distillate exports, in the
face of declining domestic demand.
TonenGeneral, Japan's second-biggest oil refiner by
capacity, did not give detailed volumes, but said exports would
keep growing, though Japanese rivals may be expanding exports
much faster, the company's managing director W. J. Bogaty told
Reuters after announcing its first quarter results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(For table on earnings, click: nT156XG9E9]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many Japanese refiners have been raising export capacity in
recent years to increase seaborne sales in the face of declining
demand at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Japan's oil product exports last year increased 123 percent
last year to 34 million kilolitres (584,000 barrels per day),
equal to about 12 percent of the nation's refining capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TonenGeneral's refinery run rate averaged 79 percent in
January-March, down slightly from the same period a year ago,
Bogaty added.

 (Changes attribution, new throughout, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Steve Eder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 18 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc,
(GS.N)  Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and other banks have applied to
repay billions of dollars they borrowed under the U.S.
government's Troubled Asset Relief Program, sources familiar
with the situation said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. banks are scrambling to repay TARP money as soon as
possible, in an effort to signal their strength to the market
and to avoid the tighter regulation that comes with government
funds, particularly limitations on compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks began gearing up to repay government funds soon after
the U.S. government announced the results of stress tests on
May 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sources asked to remain anonymous because they were not
permitted to talk about the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Financial Times reported on Monday that Goldman Sachs,
JPMorgan Chase  Co, and American Express Co (AXP.N) were
expected to be in the first wave of major lenders allowed to
return TARP funds. The government's stress tests said none of
the three needed to raise capital, even among the most negative
economic scenario that regulators considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has said that if
regulators certify that a bank would be sound without
government help, the Treasury would gladly take the money back.
But he also told lawmakers last month that his role was to
ensure the soundness of the entire financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wayne Abernathy, an executive at the American Bankers
Association and a former Treasury official, told Reuters
earlier on Monday that he expected the Treasury would act soon
to let large banks repay TARP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I would think we're talking a matter of weeks, and
probably just a few weeks, because I think Treasury wants the
money, or at least some of it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The amount of money the government could get back could be
substantial. Morgan Stanley and Goldman borrowed $10 billion
under TARP in October, while JPMorgan took $25 billion.
American Express received $3.4 billion in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs declined to
comment. All three banks have previously expressed interest in
repaying TARP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; American Express said last week it had filed a request with
the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury to repay its TARP funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RAISING CAPITAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the government disclosed stress test results publicly
earlier this month, banks began a flurry of stock and bond
offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley, which was required by regulators to raise
$1.8 billion, issued more than $4 billion of stock after the
test results were announced, and sold $4 billion of
non-government guaranteed debt. Morgan Stanley also announced
on Monday that it was selling its remaining stake in MSCI, an
investment analysis and market index company, [ID:nBNG504188]
in a deal that should help it raise about $650 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase sold $2.5 billion of nonguaranteed debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) sold $2.5 billion of shares, while
Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) sold $1.55 billion. Other
banks have sold shares as well, or announced plans to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some banks did not even wait for the results of the stress
test. Goldman Sachs sold more than $5 billion of shares last
month, and $2 billion of non-guaranteed debt.

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Leading Mexican broadcaster Televisa has launched a new advertising scheme to lift lagging spending from regional broadcast clients in a new bid to counter tough economic times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Vivelo" will invite advertisers to sponsor cross-media contests where participants can win extreme and unique experiences like helicopter rides with sexy soap opera actors and bungee jumping wedding proposals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gerardo Jean, head of Televisa's Regional Digital unit (ReD), told Reuters the project is being launched in six regional markets including Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterrey and central Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa's broadcasting business has faced hard times in recent quarters as national and regional advertisers cut spending because of the economic slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jean said regional sales have met budget targets "but with twice the effort. We have struggled."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vivelo" will also be promoted on 10 Televisa-owned magazine titles and the company's Internet sites.

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NV, May 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Disney's award-winning Broadway phenomenon, THE LION KING, celebrated its
Las Vegas premiere at Mandalay Bay Theatre Friday evening. Several
members of the original creative team were in attendance to launch the
show, including director/creator Julie Taymor; book writers Roger Allers
and Irene Mecchi; choreographer Garth Fagan; scene designer Richard
Hudson; and Thomas Schumacher, producer and president of Disney
Theatrical Group.

    THE LION KING at Mandalay Bay joins the seven other highly successful
companies of THE LION KING currently running all over the world, including
New York, London, Hamburg, Paris, Tokyo and Fukuoka, as well as the North
American National Tour. The show is performed Monday through Thursday
evenings at 8 p.m. with Saturday and Sunday matinees at 4 p.m.

    Mandalay Bay's production of THE LION KING is virtually identical to the
other companies seen around the globe and is staged with all of the same
spectacular music, sets, and costumes that have made it a worldwide
phenomenon, reaching more than 45 million people in 11 countries.

    "The Las Vegas production is every bit the equal of the spectacular
Broadway experience," said Thomas Schumacher, producer and president of
Disney Theatrical Group. "From the stunning procession of animals that
fill the aisles during 'Circle of Life' and the wildebeest stampede to the
show's climactic battle, all of the magic of the original vision will be
realized onstage at Mandalay Bay."

    "Mandalay Bay is known for offering its guests exciting and spectacular
entertainment options," said Bill Hornbuckle, president and chief
operating officer of Mandalay Bay. "The addition of THE LION KING, one of
the most successful production shows in history, continues this
tradition. We are certain THE LION KING's international appeal will be
embraced by Las Vegas locals and visitors alike."

    For Las Vegas, Disney hand-selected an international cast of performers
who have won acclaim in productions of THE LION KING across the globe,
including Broadway, Taipei, South Africa, London, Los Angeles, Australia,
Toronto, Shanghai, Paris and Holland.

seven productions of THE LION KING, including London, Sydney, Melbourne,
Shanghai, South Africa, Taipei and the national tour; her credits also

previously performed in the national tour. Mufasa's son, "Simba," is
played by Clifton Oliver, who is an alumnus of Douglas Anderson School of
Arts and has numerous theatre credits including featured roles in THE

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

Diminished Capacity

It is not a coincidence that in the first quarter Investment fell to its lowest
percentage of GDP on record (since 1947) and did so by a very wide margin.
Investment made up just 11.22% in the first quarter; the next closest low point
for investment share of the economy came all the way back in 1949 and was at
12.77%. The long-term average is 15.99%. 

If you have a factory with 30 of your 100 lathes sitting and collecting dust,
are you really going to go out and buy more of them? This is very bad news for
firms that sell factory equipment, ranging from Applied Materials (Nasdaq: AMAT)
to firms like Ingersoll Rand (NYSE: IR). If mines are not working at capacity,
it means that they will have idle equipment, and are not likely to place new
orders with Joy Global (Nasdaq: JOYG) or Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT). 

Looking a bit more closely, capacity utilization in Manufacturing dipped to
65.7% from 65.8% in March and is down from 77.0% a year ago. Mine utilization
tumbled to 82.5% from 85.2% in March and 90.9% a year ago. Utility utilization
ticked up to 80.7% from 80.5%; a year ago it was at 85.1%. 

Chevron`s Ecuador Problem

Burnishing Chevron Corp.`s (NYSE: CVX) environmental credentials must be a
fairly difficult job in and of itself, particularly in the current environment
of concerns about global warming and carbon footprints. 

But it gets close to impossible when this card-carrying member of the Big Oil
club is accused of destroying pristine rainforest and endangering the lives of
countless people in Ecuador`s Amazonian frontier. This story has been playing
over and over in the media, including in today`s New York Times. 

Chevron has been sued in an Ecuadorean court, with $27 billion in potential
damages, with a decision expected by the end of the year at the earliest. But
that will hardly be the end of the case. Aside from lobbying efforts in DC,
Chevron is expected to go through the appeals process, ultimately to
international arbitration, if it comes to that.

&lt;p&gt;Financial sales expert to lead growth of community payment network provider
PALO ALTO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Bling Nation, a local payments network provider for community banks nationwide,
announced today the addition of Shannon Goldman as head of sales. In this
position, Goldman will spearhead market expansion efforts for the company`s
Community Payments Service. Through its payments network, Bling Nation enables
financial institutions to more profitably support payments between their local
demand deposit account (DDA) customers and their merchant customers by bypassing
the current global debit payment model and replacing it with an efficient,
cost-effective and local payment network. 

"Today, it is critical for community banks to find better ways to minimize
operating costs and payment network interchange fees, while providing commercial
and personal banking customers with instant and optimal service," said Wences
Casares, co-chief executive officer of Bling Nation. "Shannon is a great
addition to our team, and her successful track record bodes well for the
continued acceptance of our local payments network." 

Goldman brings more than twenty years of sales and leadership experience within
the financial services industry to the Bling Nation`s executive staff. In every
previous position, Goldman and her teams exceeded revenue goals and maintained
excellent customer retention rates. 

Goldman spent more than a decade in multiple roles at San Antonio-based Harland
Clarke, a provider of a broad range of marketing, integrated payment and
technology solutions. As group vice president of Sales, Goldman represented the
Liberty Sales Organization during its 2005 acquisition by John H. Harland
Company. During the integration, Goldman was named vice president of Sales and
worked with a staff of 75 sales personnel who successfully exceeded client
retention, revenue and profitability goals. She represented her organization
again upon Harland`s subsequent acquisition by Clarke American in 2007. Goldman
has a bachelor of science degree in Marketing from Pennsylvania State
University. 

About Bling Nation

Bling Nation provides a local payment network, which allows banks to convert
potential on-us debit transactions into actual on-us debit transactions by
offering consumers secure contactless payments at the point of sale. Bling
Nation`s proprietary technology enables transactions to be processed more
efficiently than a traditional credit or debit card network, delivering value
for the bank, merchants and consumers through its Community Payments Service.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co and several other banks eager to escape the restrictions and stigma linked to government bailout funds may get the chance to do so in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulators are talking to big banks that want to repay funds received under the government's $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, a Federal Reserve official said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No announcements on returning funds will come until around June 8, the official added. The Fed official spoke on condition of anonymity because the application process is continuing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Tuesday, JPMorgan Chief Executive James Dimon told shareholders he expects regulators will let a few strong banks repay TARP funds within weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon made it clear that he was eager to escape strict regulations on compensation and other areas for TARP participants. In particular, he called restrictions under the program on banks hiring foreign-born workers "a complete and utter disgrace."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar concerns have been voiced by other TARP recipients Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Morgan Stanley, which like JPMorgan recently submitted applications seeking permission to repay TARP funds, people familiar with the situation told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not going to be a big deal stock-price wise, but it is a huge deal competitively that they can use to their advantage," said Greg Donaldson, director of portfolio strategy at Donaldson Capital Management in Evansville, Indiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repaying the government funds will "take the handcuffs off the management of these companies," agreed Brad Hintz, analyst with Sanford C Bernstein in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What I've told my clients is: 'You want to be the first one out of TARP and you certainly don't want to be the last one,'" Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares closed down 3.9 percent at $35.81 on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are so many banks talking about repaying TARP that it's already priced in," Donaldson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp, the largest U.S. bank, which has said it hopes to fully repay TARP funds within the next couple of years, priced an offering of about 800 million shares, raising some $8 billion after the market closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock sale may help the Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender raise capital, after regulators told it to bolster its finances following a government "stress test" of its ability to handle a deep recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TAKING DOWN TARP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last October, the Treasury stepped in with $125 billion of bailout funds for nine of the largest U.S. banks, part of a plan to stabilize a system rocked by the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Regulators wanted banks to have enough capital to lend during one of the worst recessions since the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks asking to repay TARP are among the 19 institutions that submitted to the stress tests to determine their ability to withstand a sharp economic downturn, the Fed official said. Supervisors will seek more information from the banks and then recommend to Treasury whether to approve repayments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recommendations will be made in batches, not on a case-by-case basis, the official said. Going forward, supervisors will make repayment recommendations to the Treasury on a monthly basis, the official added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before they make repayments, banks must show they can raise funds from private sources without any government guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These conditions have sparked a wave of stock and debt sales in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government officials have expressed concern that banks, in their eagerness to sever government ties, may return the capital too soon, only to need it again later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which received $25 billion in funds in October, and Goldman, which received $10 billion, were found by the stress tests to have sufficient capital. Morgan Stanley received $10 billion in October and had a small capital shortfall under the stress tests, quickly erased by stock and debt sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as banks line up to repay TARP funds, the U.S. Federal Reserve widened its safety net for downtrodden credit markets by making older commercial property loans eligible for an emergency program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move could help banks who are trying to move such loans off their balance sheets and allow borrowers to refinance existing loans on better terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp is looking to launch its June pilot sale of banks' distressed loans without using TARP money to help private investors buy up the loans, a source familiar with government plans told Reuters on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDIC is looking to do a test sale to make sure that investors, banks and the public are comfortable with the mechanics -- without the complication of government co-investment -- before rolling out the full program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some potential investors have expressed concern that loan purchases done in partnership with government money from the TARP could expose them to executive pay restrictions and other TARP conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joseph Giannone; Additional reporting by Elinor Comlay, Jonathan Stempel, Karey Wutkowski and Steve Eder; editing by John Wallace, Carol Bishopric and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging Leaders Program to Provide Management Training for Young African Women
in the Financial Services Sector
OAK BROOK, Ill.--(Business Wire)--
Opportunity International today announced it is partnering with Goldman Sachs to
develop the Emerging Leaders Program under the 10,000 Women Initiative. The
program will help train hundreds of promising young African women for careers in
management in financial institutions serving the poor in Africa. 

The 10,000 Women Emerging Leaders Program will begin in Ghana, Kenya, Malawi and
Mozambique. The program`s best and brightest graduates will assume positions of
leadership at Opportunity International or alliance partner financial
institutions. 

"10,000 Women is a global network of partners all focused on tapping the
incredible economic and social potential of business and management education
for women," said Dina Habib Powell, managing director and global head of
corporate engagement, Goldman Sachs. "We are proud to be working with
Opportunity International, which has an impressive track record of increasing
access to capital in underserved markets." 

The 10,000 Women Emerging Leaders Program includes three training tracks.
Selected female managers at Opportunity and its alliance partners will
participate in an intensive three-week professional development program to
improve their skills and increase their impact. In addition, recent graduates
from 10 universities will be chosen for management development training, which
includes an internship, four-week course and job placement as entry-level
supervisors. Other candidates will receive initial training to become loan
officers. 

"Opportunity International is thrilled to be working with Goldman Sachs to
provide career opportunities for the best and brightest women now working at
financial institutions or studying at African universities," said Kadita "A.T."
Tshibaka, president and CEO, Opportunity International. "By entering into
management positions, participants in the 10,000 Women Emerging Leaders Program
will not only have challenging and rewarding careers, they will be making a real
difference for people living in poverty across Africa." 

The 10,000 Women Emerging Leaders Program has formed strategic partnerships with
Strathmore University in Nairobi, Kenya, as host for the training program and
the Microfinance Management Institute (MFMI) for assistance with curriculum
development. Internships will begin in June 2009 and the first management
training course will be held at Strathmore in January 2010.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Dealmaking is very much in the cards for IBM (IBM.N), Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on Tuesday, after the company recently lost an opportunity to buy Sun Microsystems Inc JAVA.O to Oracle Corp ORCL.O.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I go through a deal review every week," Loughridge said at the Reuters Global Technology Summit in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And every week we go through what our strategies are and how we're going to roll them out, and fundamentally move the corporation into new opportunities and value spaces."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With about $12 billion of cash on its books and plummeting values of potential target companies, International Business Machines Corp can afford to go on an acquisition spree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2000, IBM has spent $20 billion on more than 100 companies, said Loughridge, who was named senior vice president and CFO in 2004. On average, that works out to more than 12 deals a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loughridge declined to say if IBM will continue or step up that pace this year, but said the economic climate provides a "fertile" hunting ground for acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Valuations are attractive," he said, adding that cash-rich companies have an advantage over other buyers because they do not need to take on debt to do deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology investors may be cheering that thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You've got a lot of cash, you're faced with the prospect of slowing double-digit growth," Richard Parower, portfolio manager of the Seligman Global Technology Fund, said of tech giants like IBM, Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) and Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N). The two factors make dealmaking inevitable, he told Reuters last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Parower expects mostly small and medium-sized deals below $500 million in the next few months, as companies adjust to the downturn and make cautious overtures. He said IBM could be interested in a security company such as Symantec Corp (SYMC.O) or McAfee Inc MFE.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loughridge said deal sizes for his company could range anywhere between $50 million and $100 million for technology startups, to multibillion-dollar acquisitions such as IBM's 2007 purchase of business analytics company Cognos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM had offered roughly $7 billion to buy Sun earlier this year, but talks between the two companies fell apart on deal guarantees and the fear of extended regulatory scrutiny, sources told Reuters earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Oracle swooped in at the last moment to seal a deal with Sun for $7.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has focused on buying companies that flesh out its software offerings in recent years, and Loughridge said it would continue to do so. But deals could also cut across the other categories -- hardware and services -- that IBM does business in, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite IBM's aggressive stance on dealmaking, the company maintains "strong discipline" when making the decision to buy, said Loughridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology bankers who have sold companies to IBM before say Big Blue is among a handful of tech titans, including Cisco, that are especially diligent about examining a company's books, fit and culture before buying it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"'Know your candidate' is a bit of a mantra for us," said Loughridge, who has been at IBM for more than 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For summit blog: blogs.reuters.com/summits/)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anupreeta Das, editing by Tiffany Wu and Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) will boost profit margins this year, seek acquisitions and introduce new cloud computing products, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loughridge said the economy remains tough and it is too early to say if there were signs of a broad recovery, but that cost cuts and share buybacks would help International Business Machines Corp achieve its profit targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will continue to see good margin improvements," Loughridge told the Reuters Global Technology Summit in New York, saying he believed IBM could increase its pretax operating margin to more than 20 percent in coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the first quarter, IBM boosted that key profit measure by 1.3 percentage points from the year-ago period to 14.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loughridge reiterated that IBM's 2009 earnings forecast of at least $9.20 per share can be achieved even if its revenue falls 7 percent in constant currency terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street analysts, on average, expect the company to report full-year profit of $9.12 a share. Loughridge said he expects those estimates to rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you look at the $9.20, that's an at-least number. It's funny how many times people look at that and say 'That's the forecast.' That's not the forecast," said Loughridge, a 32-year company veteran who has been CFO since 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, IBM has been shifting its focus to software and services, selling off divisions that sell increasingly commoditized hardware products such as personal computers and printers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software and services account for around 80 percent of IBM's revenue, compared with around 50 percent in 2000. Its rivals include Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), EMC Corp (EMC.N) and Oracle Corp ORCL.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would not trade my book of business for anybody else's in the tech sector in this kind of environment," he said. "I feel very confident in our ability to deliver our objectives that we see in '09 and '10."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loughridge said those forecasts do not assume the economy will start growing again next year. "It's too early to say that we're seeing signs of recovery," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he expressed some optimism that government efforts in the United States, Europe and Asia will be helpful, with credit markets already improving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the stimulus actions on a global basis have similar constructive contribution, it ought to have the capability to help us stabilize this thing," the CFO said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLOUDBURST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loughridge said IBM plans to introduce new cloud-computing products, including a bundle of hardware, software and services dubbed CloudBurst that large corporations can use to build private clouds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He declined to go into details on the offering, but said IBM will provide more information in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM, the world's biggest technology services company and top maker of mainframe computers, has lagged behind companies such as Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) in offering cloud-computing products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing uses Internet technologies to let companies and consumers access computers and information at large-scale remote data centers, allowing them to enjoy efficiencies of scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loughridge declined to discuss IBM's failed attempt to acquire Sun Microsystems Inc JAVA.O before Oracle wooed it away with an offer worth more than $7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he said that valuations of potential acquisition targets are attractive. IBM has spent some $20 billion buying more than 100 companies since 2000, paying prices that range from as little as $50 million up to $5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is tremendous opportunity in the acquisition space," said Loughridge. "Valuations are attractive. It's a very robust opportunity set out there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loughridge, who earned an engineering degree at Stanford University and an MBA at the University of Chicago, said that he reviews the pipeline of potential deals every week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We look at everything. We analyze everything," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares rose 0.89 percent to close at $105.51 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. The stock has risen 25 percent in the year to date, outperforming the SP IT index's 17 percent increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For summit blog: blogs.reuters.com/summits/)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ritsuko Ando, Jim Finkle and Alexei Oreskovic; Editing by Derek Caney, Brian Moss, Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court reinstated a claim by a JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) credit card holder accusing the bank of failing to properly disclose risk factors that allow it to suddenly raise rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit said the bank failed to make "clear and conspicuous disclosure" of the annual percentage rates it could impose, as required under the federal Truth in Lending Act, by burying the reason for an increase in the fine print of a cardholder agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a three-judge panel, Chase had been charging Cheryl and Walter Barrer an 8.99 percent annual rate, when the amount suddenly "skyrocketed" to 24.24 percent, a level that was "close to a non-preferred or default rate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chase would maintain that it raised the rate after learning from a credit agency that the Barrers had too many loans and accounts, a conclusion they did not dispute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, wrote that Chase's justification for the rate increase appeared on pages 10 and 11 of the Barrers' card agreement, "five dense pages after the disclosure of the APR."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said this was "buried too deeply in the fine print" for a reasonable cardholder to realize the bank could raise the APR not just for events of default, but for "any reason at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel returned the case to federal district court in Oregon, which had dismissed the Barrers' claim, for further proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chase spokeswoman Stephanie Jacobson said the New York-based bank does not comment on pending litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling was announced on the same day the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly approved a bill to curb sudden rate increases on credit cards. The House of Representatives approved a similar bill last month. President Barack Obama is expected to sign the measure into law later in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Barrer v. Chase Bank USA, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, No. 07-35414.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PORT HARCOURT (Reuters) - Nigerian security forces clashed with militants on Tuesday close to an oil flow station in the western Niger Delta operated by U.S. energy giant Chevron (CVX.N), an army spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclosure Follows Investigation by New York Attorney General into Shareholder
Complaints
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
A highly-criticized study financed by Chevron to "prove" that the dumping of
billions of gallons of toxic waste into Ecuador`s rainforest did not cause
cancer failed to disclose that the study was conducted by a company tied to a
member of Chevron`s Board of Directors, say representatives of the Amazon
Defense Coalition. 

Samuel Armacost, a member of Chevron`s Board of Directors since the early 1980s,
is the largest individual shareholder in Exponent Inc., a pro-industry
scientific consulting firm that was paid by Chevron to perform the study of
cancer rates in Ecuador`s Amazon region where Texaco (now Chevron) was the
exclusive operator of an oil concession from 1964 to 1990. Chevron faces a $27
billion liability in a long-running trial over pollution stemming from Texaco`s
operations, including roughly $9 billion to compensate the region for 1,401
cancer deaths tied to pollution, according to an independent court expert in
Ecuador. 

The disclosure comes after New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo opened a probe
of Chevron on allegations the company has misled shareholders about the Ecuador
liability, according to news reports. Chevron management`s handling of the
Ecuador issue is expected to be a major topic at Chevron`s annual meeting on May
27, where a shareholder resolution on Ecuador will be voted on. 

The Chevron-financed cancer study -- entitled "Cancer Mortality and Oil
Production in the Amazon Region of Ecuador, 1990-2005" -- purported to find that
cancer rates in the highly contaminated 1,700 sq. mile area where Texaco
operated were consistent with cancer rates in the rest of the country, and even
lower than cancer rates in Quito, the nation`s capital. Critics quickly noted
that the study was flawed in that it used death certificates to measure cancer
in an isolated area of rainforest where the vast majority of deaths never get
recorded, and where most sick people never see a doctor. 

By basing the study on mortality rates which are incomplete, Chevron was able to
undercount the number of cancer deaths and thereby "conclude" that cancer rates
had not increased. The Chevron study contradicts numerous other studies of the
region, all done independently and published in peer-reviewed journals, that
have concluded cancer rates had increased in the area by a significant factor
due to oil contamination. 

"Chevron`s cancer study in Ecuador is an example of a industry-biased study
conducted to further the interests of Chevron rather than to better understand
the health problems faced by the people," said Douglas Beltman, a former EPA
scientist who consults with several Amazon communities suing Chevron for
clean-up. 

"By failing to disclose the ties of the authors to Chevron`s Board of Directors,
the peer review process was undermined because the article could not be tested
for bias by the reviewers," said Andrew Woods, an American advisor to the Amazon
communities who is familiar with Chevron`s scientific studies. 

The Chevron study, whose lead author is Exponent consultant and UCLA adjunct
professor Michael Kelsh, was published in the International Archives of
Occupational and Environmental Health in July 2008. The article has a small
notation at the end saying the work was financed by Chevron but it does not
reveal the ties to Armacost or the Chevron Board. 

Exponent advertises itself as offering a service to companies that produces
"science" that generally downplays the risks of exposure to chemicals, thereby
enabling industry to better fight government regulations designed to protect the
public from the health effects of pollution. Kelsh is known as a pro-industry
scientist and is listed prominently on Exponent`s website. 

Armacost is one of the largest individual shareholders of Chevron and the
largest individual shareholder of Exponent. He owns approximately $3.1 million
in Chevron stock and approximately $4 million in Exponent stock, according to
public records. He is member of the Board of Directors of both companies.

said the paint maker's balance sheet and long-term investment
fundamentals were strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, which said it views Sherwin-Williams as a
"higher quality equity than the average of its group of
comparables," also raised its price target on the stock by $10
to $63 on higher earnings expectations and improved industry
multiples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage increased its 2009 earnings forecast for the
company to $3.70 per share from $3.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe, however, that Sherwin has its work cut out in
2009 given the weakness in the domestic residential and
commercial construction markets," JP Morgan said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sherwin-Williams shares were up $1.28 at $57 Tuesday
morning on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Partnership with DimpleDough and Dynamic Card Solutions Enables Members to
Upload Personal Photo for the Ultimate Custom Card
AUSTIN, Texas--(Business Wire)--
United Heritage Credit Union today announced the launch of their new custom
image SmartDesign VISA Debit card program through a partnership with Dynamic
Card Solutions (DCS), the leading instant card issuance and PIN selection
provider for financial institutions; and DimpleDough, the technology leader in
card customization products and services. The SmartDesign VISA Debit card is the
first known program currently available to the marketplace that offers
cardholders an unembossed, instantly issued debit card that can be printed in
real time with a member's personal photo. 

Personalized unembossed cards are made possible with DCS' patented CardWizard
instant issue software and new FCP 20/20 flat card printers, integrated with
DimpleDough's card management platform. Located at each branch, the technology
combination instantly issues a personalized unembossed debit card to United
Heritage's members at the time of their visit, eliminating the typical wait time
to receive a card through the mail. DCS' CardWizard software transfers all
personalization data to the FCP 20/20 where the highly personalized card is
securely and immediately printed in brilliant, high-definition color onto both
sides of white blank card stock. 

"Today's consumers expect more convenience, flexibility and choice than ever
before," said Ron Zanotti, senior vice president of DCS. "By combining instant
card issuance and personal background image selection, United Heritage is simply
giving that to their members. DCS is extremely pleased that our instant issue
technology is working in conjunction with DimpleDough's card customization
platform to allow United Heritage the capability to offer their members an
innovative, personalized, top-of-wallet debit card." 

"Personalization and instant issuance are among the best relationship tools that
credit unions can employ to start or maintain strong customer relationships,"
added Shawn Barrieau, CEO of DimpleDough. "DimpleDough is proud to be working
with DCS to provide United Heritage members with convenient, easy-to-use, highly
secure technology for this first-in-class program." 

Instant issuance proved to be an asset during the Heartland Payment Systems data
breach earlier this year; upwards of 45 percent of affected United Heritage
members were instantly reissued new debit cards. "Being able to instantly
reissue cards provides unprecedented member service, increased security and
tremendous cost savings as branches only have to secure and balance a single
cardstock," stated Michael Ver Schuur, executive vice president and CFO of
United Heritage. 

United Heritage began participation in the VISA pilot program for unembossed
debit cards in early 2008, and on Sept. 23, 2008, VISA officially announced that
they will be supporting the instant issuance of unembossed cards in the U.S.
With the conclusion of their successful pilot program, United Heritage began the
next step of development for a customized card program with "Software as a
Service" (SaaS) company, DimpleDough. DimpleDough's card customization platform,
embedded in United Heritage's website, enables members to upload their own
personal photo on debit card templates which include the Credit Union logo and
card information. 

"The functionality of uploading your own photo online made our SmartDesign VISA
Debit cards a reality," said Sebrina Verburgt, senior vice president of
operations and COO of United Heritage. "During pre-launch testing, staff
commented on the simple-to-use program and the convenience of not having to wait
weeks to receive their card. The SmartDesign VISA Debit card is definitely going
to be one of our most popular products." 

Here's how it works: members can simply go to www.uhcu.org/smartdesign to upload
and size their image to fit one of the available templates. The DimpleDough
software then works cohesively with DCS' CardWizard software and the Credit
Union's core processor during the approval process of the card image. Once it is
approved, members may visit any full service location to have their custom
SmartDesign card printed instantly via DCS' FCP 20/20 printers. 

"This process has been easier for staff to adapt to versus when we were offering
embossed cards that involved more than four additional steps," Juliet Craven,
assistant vice president of operations of United Heritage. "The SmartDesign VISA
Debit card is going to enable front line staff to spend that extra, valuable
time with the member."

&lt;p&gt;  SAN MATEO, CA, May 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IntelePeer Inc., a leader in hosted on-demand rich media communications,
announced today that its ReachLive application has been recognized by
Microsoft as a Best Solution Design for Communications as a Service
within Microsoft(R) Windows(R) Live. IntelePeer received the award at the
Seventh Annual Microsoft Enterprise Developer and Industry Solutions
Conference 2009, held at the New York Marriott Marquis.

    "IntelePeer ReachLive taps into the true power of Microsoft Windows Live
Services and the IntelePeer AppworX Open Communications Platform, and this
award illustrates that potential," said Charles Studt, vice president of
product management for IntelePeer. "IntelePeer AppworX strips away the
complexities of telecom for developers. Applications like ReachLive allow
Web developers to quickly bring communications-enabled business services
to market that reduce operational costs, drive productivity and open new
revenue opportunities."

    IntelePeer's ReachLive application allows Windows LiveID users to reach
their contacts by phone or SMS as quickly and intuitively as instant
messaging. This Web-based communication mash-up extends the reach of
Microsoft Live Services to business or personal groups in a familiar Live
Messenger-like interface. Users reach their contacts using the phone of
their choice, SMS text messaging or live chat, and the user includes media
or other rich content. With the powerful IntelePeer network and open
communications platform, ReachLive easily brings contacts together in an
ad-hoc conference call or as recipients of a SMS message or voice blast.

    "By demonstrating the ability to combine Web services from multiple
providers and hosting the application on a dynamically scaling
infrastructure, IntelePeer was able to show how cloud computing will
impact communications enabled applications in the not-so-distant future,"
said Joseph Hofstader, architect, Microsoft Communications Sector group.

    ReachLive combines a scalable network capable of reaching thousands of
users with existing contact lists from Windows Live Services. For
ReachLive users, phone numbers are removed and the user decides which
phone number of theirs to ring. Phone calls are initiated like chats,
which enables instant notification or collaboration with individuals and
offers many of the benefits of cloud computing, including cost savings,
flexibility and speed of deployment.

    IntelePeer was honored alongside three other companies at the awards
ceremony, which focused on computing at the speed of the cloud as well as
what cloud computing offers: flexibility, low entry costs, and access to
services and applications beyond the traditional computer loaded with
applications. Winners of Microsoft's award were named visionaries, taking
cloud computing and designing ways to harness its potential.

    About IntelePeer

    IntelePeer, www.IntelePeer.com, a leader in hosted on-demand rich media
communications, enables carriers, businesses and software vendors to
easily deliver voice and multimedia capabilities to any phone or
network-connected device -- without incurring up-front capital costs.

IntelePeer AppworX(TM), our SuperRegistry(TM) and our extensive peering
grid, we provide our customers with the platform to offer high-quality
interactive voice, video, SMS, data and other rich-media services while

applications. Business professionals who use customer relationship
management (CRM) software and common desktop applications such as
calendaring and contact management also rely on us for instant access to
bridge-to-services, voice blast, video blast, text-to-speech, conferencing
and other features that enable communications-enhanced business processes
that drive efficiency and deliver cost savings. Based in San Mateo,
Calif., we operate our own carrier-grade network carrying more than 7
billion minutes, with worldwide coverage delivered through an IP and TDM

&lt;p&gt;  SANTA CLARA, CA, May 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
BLADE Network Technologies, Inc. (BLADE), the trusted leader in data
center networking, announced that the company has joined the  Microsoft
Virtualization Solution Partner Program. BLADE's VMready for its 1-10
Gigabit Ethernet switches enables Microsoft's Hyper-V for dynamic "live"
migration of virtual machines (VMs).

    "We are delighted to participate in the Microsoft Virtualization Solution
Partner Program to help enterprises that have been understandably wary of
enabling their production application workloads for mobility and live
migration in virtual machine environments," said Dan Tuchler, Vice
President of Strategy and Product Management, BLADE Network Technologies.
"BLADE's VMready Ethernet switches work with Windows Server 2008 and
Hyper-V to enable a virtualization-enriched network that is not
jeopardized by security vulnerabilities as virtual machines migrate, does
not introduce performance bottlenecks and is easy to manage without
continual manual intervention."

    Microsoft is actively promoting BLADE's VMready through its
virtualization-related marketing efforts. Microsoft's extensive partner
ecosystem of independent software, hardware and storage vendors
complements and extends Microsoft's virtualization toolset with products
for desktops, servers, applications, storage, and networks. Together with
its partners, Microsoft delivers robust, complete solutions for the
virtualized infrastructure. For more information, visit
http://www.microsoft.com/virtualization/partners/.

    Data center architects can use BLADE's VMready switches to overcome
network-based obstacles. The inability for security policies to move in
concert with the VM is inhibiting broader adoption of server
virtualization in the enterprise data center. VMready watches the Virtual
Machine environment to ensure that when a live VM moves from one physical
host to another, the destination network has been prepared in advance --
preserving essential security, access and performance policies.

    The industry's first and only Virtual Machine aware networking solution
shipping today, VMready is part of BLADE SmartConnect(TM) switch-resident
software that runs on BLADE's Ethernet switches. BLADE's VMready switches
will work with Microsoft's Hyper-V as well as other leading server
virtualization offerings and releases.

    About BLADE Network Technologies

    BLADE Network Technologies is the leading supplier of Gigabit and 10G
Ethernet network infrastructure solutions that reside in blade servers and
"scale-out" server and storage racks. BLADE's new "Virtual, Cooler and
Easier" RackSwitch family demonstrates the promise of "Rackonomics" -- a
revolutionary approach for scaling out data center networks to drive down
total cost of ownership. The company's customers include more than 300 of
Fortune 500 companies across 26 industry segments, and an installed base

&lt;p&gt;  BOXBOROUGH, MA, May 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Digital Reef (www.digitalreefinc.com), developer of the first massively
scalable unstructured data management platform, today announces a
technology collaboration with FAST, a Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) subsidiary
and the leading global provider of search technologies. By working with
FAST, Digital Reef will provide FAST ESP and Microsoft Office SharePoint
Server 2007 customers with "out-of-the-box" capabilities to support
eDiscovery, compliance, Office SharePoint Server 2007 management, data
security, and storage initiatives. The combined solution includes a user
interface that provides a single, actionable view across all data stores,
allowing users to easily locate, understand, and leverage enterprise
information.

    "We rely on our partners to build vertical functionality on top of our
powerful search technology," stated Nate Treloar, Principal Search
Technology Evangelist of FAST/Microsoft. "In the case of Digital Reef,
their unstructured data management platform complements our goal of making
search actionable by extending FAST and Office SharePoint Server 2007 with
powerful tools that target critical enterprise challenges like
eDiscovery."

    FAST's enterprise search platform provides a customizable foundation for
elevating an organization's search capabilities. The collaboration
augments those facilities with Digital Reef's powerful data analysis tools
for addressing critical enterprise challenges like eDiscovery.
Organizations with discovery challenges must not only find all documents
related to a particular issue, they must be able to cull this dataset down
to only those documents which are responsive (relevant). To address this
and other eDiscovery challenges, Digital Reef will complement FAST's
advanced search platform with capabilities such as:


--  Analytic tools that significantly reduce the amount of content that
must be manually reviewed -- including identification of duplicates and
near duplicates and the ability to search for content by
example.


--  Automatic classification of documents to quickly identify responsive
(relevant), confidential, and junk content. 


--  Management capabilities that allow for the transformation of content
into different format types, as well as the mass movement of documents to
produce a dataset for review by counsel. 


--  A single browser-based user interface that allows users to see and act
upon content across multiple SharePoint (and other) repositories.

    
In addition to providing advanced legal discovery capabilities for
Office SharePoint Server 2007 and all other major server types, Digital
Reef's unstructured data management platform is used by enterprises to
achieve a single, actionable view of unstructured and semi-structured
data assets across the enterprise data center; mitigate data risk; enable
knowledge reuse; and drive strategic storage initiatives. Digital Reef
partners include search, content management, eDiscovery, and data security
technology vendors as well as electronic data discovery (EDD) processing
and other service companies.

    "We are very pleased to have formed a partnership with FAST," said Steve
Akers, President and CEO of Digital Reef. "Office SharePoint Server 2007
is rapidly becoming standard infrastructure in many of the enterprises we
talk to, and FAST's indexing and search capabilities combined with Digital
Reef's scalable unstructured data management platform provide the tools
companies need to execute and manage legal discovery, compliance,
security, and storage initiatives for Office SharePoint Server 2007."

    Digital Reef is a Microsoft Enterprise Search Group Technology Partner.
The Digital Reef solution with FAST search capabilities will be generally
available in Q3 2009. For more information, please contact Digital Reef at
978-893-1000, info@digitalreefinc.com or visit
http://www.digitalreefinc.com.


  About Digital Reef

&lt;p&gt;Investment Will Help Williams Capital Management Achieve Scale, Reach New
Customers
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Williams Capital Management, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Williams
Capital Group, L.P., announced today that The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc (NYSE:GS)
selected Williams Capital to manage $1 billion of U.S. treasury and government
agency securities. 

The investment will provide Williams Capital with a significant increase in its
assets under management. Because many prospective investors require that
managers have a minimum amount of assets under management before they invest,
this investment is expected to be very significant in helping Williams Capital
grow its business. 

Chris Williams, CEO of The Williams Capital Group, said, "Goldman Sachs`
investment will enable us to bring our conservative investment strategies to a
wider group of prospective clients who had previously been unable to consider
investing with us." 

Goldman Sachs Treasurer Liz Beshel commented, "Our balance sheet is very liquid.

&lt;p&gt;  SANTA CLARA, CA, May 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
BLADE Network Technologies, Inc. (BLADE), the trusted leader in data
center networking, announced that the company has joined the  Microsoft
Virtualization Solution Partner Program. BLADE's VMready for its 1-10
Gigabit Ethernet switches enables Microsoft's Hyper-V for dynamic "live"
migration of virtual machines (VMs).

    "We are delighted to participate in the Microsoft Virtualization Solution
Partner Program to help enterprises that have been understandably wary of
enabling their production application workloads for mobility and live
migration in virtual machine environments," said Dan Tuchler, Vice
President of Strategy and Product Management, BLADE Network Technologies.
"BLADE's VMready Ethernet switches work with Windows Server 2008 and
Hyper-V to enable a virtualization-enriched network that is not
jeopardized by security vulnerabilities as virtual machines migrate, does
not introduce performance bottlenecks and is easy to manage without
continual manual intervention."

    Microsoft is actively promoting BLADE's VMready through its
virtualization-related marketing efforts. Microsoft's extensive partner
ecosystem of independent software, hardware and storage vendors
complements and extends Microsoft's virtualization toolset with products
for desktops, servers, applications, storage, and networks. Together with
its partners, Microsoft delivers robust, complete solutions for the
virtualized infrastructure. For more information, visit
http://www.microsoft.com/virtualization/partners/.

    Data center architects can use BLADE's VMready switches to overcome
network-based obstacles. The inability for security policies to move in
concert with the VM is inhibiting broader adoption of server
virtualization in the enterprise data center. VMready watches the Virtual
Machine environment to ensure that when a live VM moves from one physical
host to another, the destination network has been prepared in advance --
preserving essential security, access and performance policies.

    The industry's first and only Virtual Machine aware networking solution
shipping today, VMready is part of BLADE SmartConnect(TM) switch-resident
software that runs on BLADE's Ethernet switches. BLADE's VMready switches
will work with Microsoft's Hyper-V as well as other leading server
virtualization offerings and releases.

    About BLADE Network Technologies

    BLADE Network Technologies is the leading supplier of Gigabit and 10G
Ethernet network infrastructure solutions that reside in blade servers and
"scale-out" server and storage racks. BLADE's new "Virtual, Cooler and
Easier" RackSwitch family demonstrates the promise of "Rackonomics" -- a
revolutionary approach for scaling out data center networks to drive down

BERWYN, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
arcplan, an established independent business intelligence solution provider,
today announced the launch of arcplan Edge&#174; (www.arcplan.com/edge), the next
generation of arcplan`s budgeting and planning solution. arcplan Edge bundles
arcplan`s web-based and SOA driven budgeting and planning solution with
Excel-based reporting, budgeting and forecasting applications. 

This powerful offering, comes from the recent acquisition of LumenSoft
Corporation and its innovative Excel-based technology for the budgeting and
planning process closing the gap between web-based and excel-based technologies
satisfying all the analytic needs of organizations. arplan Edge includes
prebuilt solutions for revenue, expense, labor and capital planning that contain
best practice functionality to dramatically reduce implementation time. The
result is time saving solutions, combined with the flexibility of arcplan
allowing the development and rollout process to be measured in weeks, not
months, with application functionality that will meet and exceed business
requirements and user expectations. 

"Over the last 15 years, we have earned a very successful track record for
meeting even the most specific and unique interface and workflow requirements
for web-based budgeting &amp; planning solutions. At the same time we learned from
working with hundreds of clients that finance professionals want and will
continue to use Excel for some of the modeling that goes into the budgeting and
planning processes," explained Detlef Kamps, CEO of arcplan. "By combining
LumenSoft`s enterprise scalable Excel solution with the SOA-driven arcplan
budgeting, planning and forecasting solution set and our federated query,
analysis and write-back technology, customers are essentially getting the best
of both worlds. They now have the options needed to meet various user groups`
requirements" he continued. 

Many budgeting and planning solutions on the market attempt to replace existing
Excel spreadsheet or other legacy environments used for budgeting and planning
purposes. arcplan Edge on the other hand permits financial professionals to
retain and enhance the look, functionality and feel of existing Excel or
non-Excel based applications while at the same time adding required data-access,
analysis, collaboration, security, and control and workflow elements.
Furthermore, the native integration of arcplan Edge with products such as Oracle
Essbase and any ODBC compliant relational data source, including Oracle,
Microsoft SQL Server and Access and IBM DB2 ensures that customers can leverage
their existing IT infrastructure, thereby avoiding costly implementation cycles.

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT), Sony (NYSE: SNE),
Anthracite Capital (NYSE: AHR) and BlackRock (NYSE: BLK). 

Get the most recent insight from Zacks Equity Research with the free Profit from
the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=4579

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

GameStop Underperforming Market

The S 500 is up 33% from its March 9 low, but GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME)
shares are up just 14%. This weak relative performance is not justified. GME is
trading at just 9 times consensus 2009 EPS estimates, it is one of the few
retailers that will increase its sales this year, and the company`s earnings are
expected to grow about 23% this year and 12% in 2010. 

It appears that market expects the video game industry, which has held up well
during the economic downturn, to finally succumb to the macro environment.
Recent data from the NPD Group support that view. Last week, the NPD Group
reported that video game sales in April were soft. Sales of consoles Microsoft`s
(Nasdaq: MSFT) Xbox 360, Sony`s(NYSE: SNE) PlayStation 3, and Nintendo`s Wii
declined 8% from April 2008, while sales of new video games fell 23%. For April,
console sales totaled $392 million and new video game sales were $511 million. 

Before hitting that "sell"-button on your GME shares, look at the April sales
report in some context. The year-on-year sales drop was due to a weaker release
schedule. In April 2008, Grand Theft Auto IV and Mario Kart were big hits, and
there were no comparable releases in April 2009. This year, game developers and
publishers are waiting until the second half 2009 to release their best games to
take advantage of the holiday season. For video games (and most retailers), it
is much smarter to disappoint in the spring than in the fall, when sales are
much higher. 

Anthracite Gets New Life

Anthracite Capital (NYSE: AHR) announced that it had extended the expiration of
its credit facilities until September 30th, 2010. AHR has about $365 million
outstanding with several banks. 

The company had tripped covenants on its credit facilities and has been
negotiating an amendment. In addition, AHR received an extension on another
smaller facility until June 30th, which had been breached, with a subsidiary of
its parent company, BlackRock (NYSE: BLK). 

This announcement gives the company some breathing room; it eliminates all
mark-to-market provisions, the right to make future margin calls, and scheduled
amortization payments. Instead, the company will follow a cash management plan
which will pay interest and principle on its outstanding loans.

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NV, May 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
INTEROP LAS VEGAS 2009 - BLADE Network Technologies, Inc. (BLADE), the
trusted leader in data center networking, announced today its new 10
Gigabit Ethernet switch for IBM BladeCenter, the industry's first
converged networking switch for blade servers. The new 24-port all-10G or
1/10G BLADE switch equips network environments to support BLADE's Cloud
Ready Network Architecture with a single fabric for data and storage, 100
Gigabits per second (Gbps) of data center connectivity and up to 480Gbps
of extremely low-latency bi-directional throughput.

    The BLADE switch performs at 10G line-rate throughput with no packet loss
as required by Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) and Converged Enhanced
Ethernet (CEE) standards for open unified networking. BLADE's newest
switch for IBM BladeCenter consumes less power than a standard light bulb
-- up to 75 percent less than external switches -- and will support
BLADE's SmartConnect(TM) with VMready(TM) software for the dynamic
migration of "live" virtual machines in Q3 2009. Hybrid 1/10G server and
uplink connectivity protects investments in existing Gigabit Ethernet
servers and uplinks so data centers can migrate to 10 Gigabit Ethernet as
requirements demand.

    The new BLADE switch will be showcased for the first time at BLADE's booth
1175 at Interop, May 18-21, 2009, in Las Vegas.

    "IBM's work with BLADE has resulted in world-class networking products for
our BladeCenter customers, including BLADE's industry-first blade switch
for converged data and storage networks," said Alex Yost, vice president,
IBM Systems &amp; Technology Group. "BLADE's new 10GbE switch for IBM
BladeCenter provides our clients with the ultimate investment protection,
while helping them reduce operating and capital expenses."

    "Our new BLADE switch enables enterprises to take an open approach to
unifying their data and storage networks without requiring an
over-engineered solution that calls for them to rip out and replace their
existing data center infrastructures," said Vikram Mehta, President and
CEO, BLADE Network Technologies. "BLADE, one of the industry's top three
providers of 10 Gigabit Ethernet switches*, has provided the essential
data center networking for almost one million IBM servers to date. Now,
our new 10 Gigabit Ethernet switch for IBM BladeCenter enables
enterprises to deploy a Cloud Ready network while reducing switch costs
by up to 50 percent, cabling costs by up to 90 percent and energy costs
by up to 75 percent, along with an easy transition from 1G to 10G
Ethernet."

    BLADE's new BNT 10-port 10G Ethernet Switch Module for IBM BladeCenter
(H/HT) combines Cloud Ready network performance with an unsurpassed set of
"Virtual, Cooler and Easier" advantages:

    Cloud Ready Networking:


--  Simple firmware update for open FCoE/CEE unified networking that
    includes support for priority-based flow control, enhanced transmission
    selection, bandwidth allocation per priority group, Fibre Channel
    initialization protocol, end-point discovery and jumbo frames for Fibre
    Channel payloads.
--  Ten external SFP+ uplinks combine with 14 internal ports for up to
    480Gbps of extremely low-latency bi-directional throughput.
--  For those needing support for existing blades with Gigabit Ethernet,
    the BLADE switch supports either Gigabit or 10 Gigabit Ethernet for
    seamless migrations.
--  Up to 50 percent less expensive than data center networks implemented
    using external 10GbE switches.
--  Up to 800G of full-duplex, low-latency uplink bandwidth eliminates the
    need for InfiniBand in HPC clusters.  With support for four switches per
    chassis, a BLADE switch environment is capable of up to 1.92 Tbps bi-
    directional throughput.
--  Pricing at well under $500 per port enables mainstream adoption of 10
    Gigabit Ethernet.
    

    Virtual:

--  Planned support for BLADE's SmartConnect and VMready network
    virtualization software along with IBM Open Fabric Manager will enable
    seamless integration into Virtual Machine environments with dynamic policy
    migration for live VM mobility.
--  Easy transition to FCoE/CEE converged networks that are far less
    complex than Cisco Nexus/DCE Unified Computing Networks.
    

    Cooler:

--  Power consumption equivalent to a standard light bulb.
    

    Easier:

--  Future-proof investment protection for data centers that are
    transitioning from Gigabit to 10 Gigabit Ethernet servers and uplinks,
    enabling an easy transition to 10GbE by simply replacing uplink
    transceivers.
--  Support for SFP+ and Direct Attach Cables (twinax cables) reduces
    cabling costs and infrastructure complexity by up to 90 percent.
--  Full Layer 3 support for OSPF and BGP routing at no additional cost
    and seamless interoperability with Cisco core networks.
    

    
"The vast majority of organizations in North America are making real
and lasting changes in their data center architecture. Customers are
choosing networking products that support virtualized data center
environments and provide a compelling total cost of ownership analysis,"
said Lucinda Borovick, Research Vice President, Datacenter Networks for
IDC. "BLADE's new switch delivers the FCoE-ready 10 Gigabit Ethernet
connectivity designed for cloud-ready I/O-intensive converged networking
environments."

    BLADE's BNT 10-port 10G Ethernet Switch Module is available from IBM in
June (Part number: 46C7191) for IBM BladeCenter H/HT.

communications and collaboration solution. 

As part of their Frontline Partnership, the two companies expect to invest up to
an additional $180 million in product development, professional services, as
well as joint sales and marketing, to help organizations lower costs and improve
productivity. 

The solution, which is planned to span software, hardware, networking and
services, would enable customers to improve business output and reduce travel,
telecom and IT operating costs. This would be accomplished by streamlining
communications across messaging, video and voice with connected applications and
devices. HP and Microsoft also plan to provide the flexibility and control
customers need to manage their communications infrastructure efficiently. 

Demand for unified communications and collaboration technologies is growing
rapidly. According to an independent report from Forrester Research, 84 percent
of enterprises in North America and Europe are currently evaluating, piloting or
implementing unified communications and collaboration solutions, and the market
is expected to grow at a rate of 35.9 percent through 2015.(1)

"Customers can lower costs and rapidly enhance employee productivity with
unified communications and collaboration from HP and Microsoft," said Ann
Livermore, executive vice president, Technology Solutions Group, HP. "We provide
customers with solutions that are rich, intuitive and accessible from anywhere
on nearly any device." 

HP and Microsoft share a vision for business productivity solutions built on
open, software-based platforms that work with the applications and systems
people know and use today. 

"Together, we are offering the extensive breadth of capabilities of our
respective technologies to deliver a truly unified communications and
collaboration solution to help our customers improve business productivity,"
said Stephen Elop, president, Microsoft Business Division, Microsoft. "This
means one click to communicate, one click to conference, one click to
collaborate." 

"Microsoft`s approach to unified communications and collaboration solutions,
combined with HP`s global technology and services, will help us drive innovation
and growth in our business," said Tina Atkinson, program sponsor, New Ways of
Working, Cathay Pacific Airways. "Cathay Pacific Airways followed a detailed
tender process and chose Microsoft and HP because they best met our requirements
for a flexible and comprehensive approach to unified communications and
collaboration, tailored to our needs."

&lt;p&gt; * Whole complex in full operations in second half 2009
 (Adds background on demand, inventories)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BEIJING May 19 (Reuters) - A joint venture between Exxon
Mobil (XOM.N), Saudi Aramco and China's Sinopec Corp (0386.HK),
said on Tuesday it had started trial runs at its new Fujian
refinery on China's southeastern coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The whole complex, which includes a 240,000-barrel-per-day
refinery and an 800,000-tonne-per-year ethylene complex, will
enter full operations in the second half of 2009, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An industry source told Reuters earlier this month that the
refinery, expanded from an 80,000 bpd plant, started pumping
crude into the new 160,000-bpd crude processing unit in late
April and could enter normal operations as early as July.
 The start-up of the new refinery comes at a time when Chinese
fuel demand appears to be improving as brimming inventories have
thinned and state oil firms have replenished stocks by raising
April's crude imports to their second-highest on record on a
daily rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The $5 billion venture is 50 percent owned by top Asian
refiner Sinopec Corp and 25 percent each by Exxon Mobil and Saudi
Aramco. The Saudi state oil firm will supply crude to the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Chen Aizhu, Editing by Jacqueline Wong0

&lt;p&gt; * Chevron urges 'no' vote on environment report proposal

 By Braden Reddall

 SAN FRANCISCO, May 20 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N)
criticized a shareholder proposal for an environmental
protection report as part of a "trial lawyer"-led campaign to
force the company to settle a long-running case over oil
pollution in the Ecuadorean jungle.

 Chevron is fighting a $27 billion claim in court in Ecuador,
with a ruling expected this year. That case is among a few cited
in the proposal, which is also backed by U.S. state and
municipal funds and will face a vote at the company's
shareholder meeting next week.

 In a letter on Wednesday urging investors to vote it down,
Chevron said proposal backer Trillium Asset Management, a
Boston-based manager of socially responsible funds, had waged
carefully orchestrated media campaigns every year over the past
half-decade.

 "In their campaign for this year's annual stockholder
meeting, the plaintiffs' lawyers and their colleagues have added
a new dimension to their pressure strategy: a campaign to
generate fear in the investment community," Chief Governance
Officer Lydia Beebe wrote in the letter filed with regulators.

 Two days earlier, Trillium filed with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission a report from late April by public
policy specialist Potomac Research Group flagging the risks to
Chevron of a U.S. congressional spotlight on the Ecuador case.

 Potomac also said Chevron lobbying efforts to alter
Ecuador's trade status in response were unlikely to be
well-received by the administration of President Barack Obama
because in 2006 Obama had written a letter to the U.S. Trade
Representative in favor of letting the case play out.

 Separately, in a letter to Chevron this month, New York
Attorney General Andrew Cuomo had asked the company to disclose
information to investors about its potential liability in
Ecuador. [ID:nN07374919]

 "This is their first filing on the issue with the SEC since
Cuomo opened his investigation, and they don't even mention it,"
Steven Donziger, a lawyer for the Ecuador plaintiffs, said of
Chevron's letter, which he called "misleading."

 Chevron had said it would respond to Cuomo's letter but
argued that it had "communicated fully" with its shareholders.

 Trillium could not be immediately reached for comment.

 PROTECTION BY PROXY

 The shareholder proposal, or item 10 on the proxy statement,
calls for a report on the protection of people and the
environment wherever Chevron operates. [ID:nN08517735]

 Chevron has said that votes on similar issues at meetings in
the past garnered support of 8 to 10 percent.

 The shareholder group, holding about 20 million of Chevron's
2 billion-plus shares, includes pension funds from the city and
state of New York, Pennsylvania's treasury, and Amnesty
International.

 The annual meeting will take place on May 27 at Chevron
headquarters in San Ramon, California, about 30 miles (48 km)
east of San Francisco.

 Plaintiffs in the Ecuador case, first brought by local
peasants in the early 1990s, say Texaco -- bought by Chevron in
2001 -- polluted the jungle and damaged their health by dumping
billions of gallons of contaminated water from 1972 to 1992.

 Chevron, in its letter, repeated its arguments that public
denouncements of the company by Ecuador President Rafael Correa
make a fair trial impossible; that the $27 billion claim could
not be enforced because Chevron had "virtually no assets" in the
country; and that the claim is based on a retroactive law.

 Donziger countered by saying Chevron had sought to move the
case to Ecuador from the United States, and argued that a
country's president can discuss a case without influencing it.

 "Ultimately, it will be a court that determines whether
Chevron is liable, not Chevron itself," Donziger said.

&lt;p&gt;$600,000 Replants More than 1,800 Acres at Cuyamaca Rancho and Chino Hills
SAN DIEGO--(Business Wire)--
The "Reforest California" campaign (www.reforestcalifornia.com) today announced
that it raised $600,000 to replant more than 1 million trees in state parks
recently burned by wildfires. A unique public-private partnership between
California State Parks, Stater Bros. Supermarkets and the Coca-Cola Bottling
Company of Southern California, the campaign will plant native trees over the
next four years at Cuyamaca Rancho State Park near San Diego and Chino Hills
State Park in San Bernardino County. 

"Wildfire has significantly impacted our natural resources in recent years but
the Reforest California campaign - the largest reforestation project to date at
state parks - will help replant damaged parklands and restore forest areas to
healthy levels," said Mike Chrisman, Secretary for Natural Resources. "This
caliber of stewardship would not be possible without the tremendous
public-private partnership between parks, Coca-Cola, and Stater Bros." 

The campaign was funded by tax-deductible consumer and employee donations at
Stater Bros. Supermarkets as well contributions from a percentage of
participating Coca-Cola sales, donated by the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of
Southern California. 

The campaign wraps up on May 21 with a dedication by Secretary Chrisman at
Cuyamaca Rancho State Park to dedicate 19,000 pine trees, which will be planted
to honor the 19,000+ members of the Stater Bros. "Family" of employees who
played a critical role in the campaign`s success. Each employee will be
recognized with a tree for their help in promoting the campaign at 166 Stater
Bros. Supermarkets in Southern California. 

At the event, Jack H. Brown, Stater Bros. chairman and CEO, and Terence Fitch,
vice president and general manager of the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Southern
California, will present a $600,000 check to the state of California to
underwrite the reforestation program. Part of those funds will be used for fire
prevention educational signage at five California state parks: Cuyamaca Rancho,
Chino Hills, Silverwood Lake, Mount San Jacinto and Palomar Mountain State
Parks. 

The four-year Cuyamaca Rancho reforestation project funded by the "Reforest
California" campaign will be studied as a carbon offset reduction project
between the California State Parks, CAL FIRE and graduate students at San Diego
State University.

&lt;p&gt;WILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) - A bankruptcy court judge on Wednesday said she may rule by next month on efforts by Washington Mutual Inc to get back more than $4 billion in cash deposits to which it lost access when the bank was sold to JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary Walrath said at a brief court hearing in Wilmington, Delaware, that she may decide on Washington Mutual's request for summary judgment on the matter before a June 24 scheduled court hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual contends in court papers that JPMorgan is withholding deposits without any legitimate basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual Bank was closed by the U.S. government in September, in one of the largest bank failures in U.S. history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its banking assets were sold the same day to JPMorgan for $1.9 billion, and the parent holding company filed for bankruptcy protection a day later in Delaware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WaMu has said that JPMorgan improperly claims it acquired the $4 billion in deposits as part of the takeover but that this money should have been treated like any other deposit at the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WaMu has said it needs access to that cash to come up with its Chapter 11 plan, and that by withholding the deposits, JPMorgan could be earning as much as $200 million per year in interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan Chase spokesman said the company had no comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was filed as an adversary proceeding to WaMu's main bankruptcy case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy case is In re: Washington Mutual, Inc.

JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary Walrath said at a brief court
hearing in Wilmington, Delaware, that she may decide on
Washington Mutual's request for summary judgment on the matter
before a June 24 scheduled court hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Washington Mutual contends in court papers that JPMorgan is
withholding deposits without any legitimate basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Washington Mutual Bank was closed by the U.S. government in
September, in one of the largest bank failures in U.S.
history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its banking assets were sold the same day to JPMorgan for
$1.9 billion, and the parent holding company filed for
bankruptcy protection a day later in Delaware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WaMu has said that JPMorgan improperly claims it acquired
the $4 billion in deposits as part of the takeover but that
this money should have been treated like any other deposit at
the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WaMu has said it needs access to that cash to come up with
its Chapter 11 plan, and that by withholding the deposits,
JPMorgan could be earning as much as $200 million per year in
interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A JPMorgan Chase spokesman said the company had no
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit was filed as an adversary proceeding to WaMu's
main bankruptcy case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bankruptcy case is In re: Washington Mutual, Inc. U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware, No.  08-12229.

&lt;p&gt;Firm is an Industry Leader in the Development and Adoption of New Messaging
Standard
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
J.P. Morgan`s Treasury Services business, a full-service provider of cash
management, trade finance and treasury solutions, today announced it is offering
ISO 20022 payment initiation and reporting capabilities. J.P. Morgan is amongst
the industry leaders adopting this new messaging standard format that allows
clients to integrate core treasury, payable and receivable applications with
banking and other financial partners. 

J.P. Morgan`s ISO 20022 capabilities enable clients to send and receive messages
in XML format. This ISO standard meets the regional and global integration
requirements of shared services centers, payment factories, centralized payables
and treasury functions, and is rapidly being embraced as an effective means for
sending payment information, reviewing remittance information, reconcilement and
gathering critical cash positioning data. 

"J.P. Morgan`s ISO 20022 payment initiation and reporting capabilities address a
growing demand from clients for an industry standard that enables a uniform
integration process," said Louise Gorman, managing director and product
executive, J.P. Morgan Treasury Services. "ISO 20022 is a prime example of J.P.
Morgan`s ongoing efforts to provide leadership in the development and
implementation of new industry standards. Such efforts are a clear reflection of
our industry commitment to provide our clients with the tools they need to
succeed." 

The bank`s ISO 20022 payment initiation and reporting capabilities deliver key
benefits, such as:

* Improved straight-through processing, allowing clients to communicate
consistently across all of their banks. 
* Standardized access to the global payments landscape, incorporating new
services such as those in the Single Euro Payment Area (SEPA) in Europe 
* Straight-through processing with the communication of full remittance
information from remitter to beneficiary 
* Improved cash position management and reconciliation with the provision of
real-time data

Introduced by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the
world`s largest developer of technical standards, ISO 20022 is the core message
standard for SEPA and represents the next generation of SWIFT message
formatting. This new message format incorporates payment initiation and
reporting capabilities of several leading standards into a single, unified
standard, and is increasingly being incorporated into financial applications at
banks and corporations worldwide. J.P. Morgan has been at the forefront of the
development of ISO 20022 through its involvement in the Registration Management
Group (RMG), the governing body for financial services messaging standards. Bob
Blair, executive director, J.P. Morgan, is a senior member of RMG.

CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
NASCAR legend and three-time winner of the Coca-Cola 600 Bobby Allison will
serve as the Grand Marshal for the 50th running of the Coca-Cola 600 at famed
Lowe`s Motor Speedway. Joining him as race officials for the Memorial Day
weekend extravaganza are South Carolina U.S. Senator Jim DeMint as Honorary
Starter and Alabama House Speaker Seth Hammett as Honorary Race Director. 

A spectacular pre-race show honoring members of America`s Armed Forces will
precede the Memorial Day weekend Sprint Cup classic, one of the largest sporting
events in the nation. 

"We are really excited about having three-time Coca-Cola 600 winner Bobby
Allison serve as Grand Marshal for this year`s race-the 50th running of the
Coca-Cola 600," said Coca-Cola Consolidated spokesman Lauren Steele. "In
addition, we are honored to have such distinguished public servants and American
leaders like Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina and Alabama Speaker Seth
Hammett serve as race officials." 

"Again this year, preceding the race there will be a special tribute to our
nation`s men and women in our Armed Forces," Steele added. "All of us at
Coca-Cola join NASCAR fans across the nation in expressing our thanks and
support for the members of the United States Armed Forces who are serving to
protect our freedoms in Iraq, Afghanistan and throughout the world. It is only
appropriate on Memorial Day weekend that we pay a special tribute to America`s
military." 

More than 1,500 members of the military will participate in the pre-race show.
Soldiers from Fort Bragg will utilize Chinook and Blackhawk helicopters as well
as ground artillery to conduct military maneuvers and secure the frontstretch
for a special delivery. In addition, more than 100 relatives of active soldiers
will unfurl a giant American flag in the shape of the United States. 

As race officials, Allison, DeMint and Hammett will be honored at a pre-race
event, attend the official drivers meeting, address the crowd of nearly 180,000
fans, participate in the pre-race spectacular and present the trophy in Victory
Lane. As Honorary Race Director, Speaker Hammett will ride in the official pace
car while Senator DeMint, as Honorary Starter, will wave the green flag over the
43-car field to start the longest NASCAR race and one of the largest sporting
events in the world. 

Bobby Allison is one of NASCAR`s most beloved stars, with 84 total wins, a
Winston Cup Championship and three Coca-Cola 600 victories. Named one of the
sport`s 50 Greatest Drivers in 1998, he also received the Most Popular Driver
Award six times. 

Jim DeMint was elected to the U.S. Senate from South Carolina in 2004 and has
quickly established himself as one of the most effective conservative leaders in
Washington. He is a tireless advocate for smaller government, individual
liberty, a strong national defense and traditional values. DeMint is a former
businessman from Greenville. He is married and has four grown children. 

"It is a real honor to serve as Honorary Starter of the Coca-Cola 600," DeMint
said. "NASCAR fans are traditionally strong supporters of our military and the
values that have made America great. I`m looking forward to this chance to
represent the thousands of South Carolinians who will be at Lowe`s Motor
Speedway for what is sure to be an exciting race." 

Seth Hammett has served as Speaker of the Alabama House of Representatives since
1999. An Air Force veteran, Hammett has distinguished himself as a legislator,
businessman and educator. He has served as chairman of both the Southern
Legislative Conference and the National Speakers Conference. He and his wife
live in Andalusia and have two grown children. 

"Alabama is NASCAR country and has a long history with this truly American
sport," Hammett said. "It is a great honor to serve as a Race Official with
Senator DeMint and my friend from Alabama Bobby Allison. It is a great honor to
serve as Honorary Race Director for the 50th running of the Coca-Cola 600."

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Chemical will demonstrate its global leadership and commitment to the
nonwovens industry at booth 1H15 at ANEX 09 + SINCE 09 in Shanghai from May
20-22, 2009. A new resin, ExxonMobil PP 3885E1 polypropylene, will be
introduced, while ExxonMobil Chemical`s broad portfolio of Vistamaxx specialty
elastomers and its polypropylene (PP) solutions for nonwoven applications will
also be on display. 

ExxonMobil PP 3885E1 resin offers a unique opportunity to improve productivity,
reduce waste caused by fabric defects, increase line capacity, and change line
configuration while maintaining fabric properties. 

The novel molecular design of ExxonMobil PP 3885E1 resin provides efficient
processing on the latest generation of spunbond equipment. Spunbond production
can be increased by more than 15 percent without increasing the amount of
hard-spot fabric defects. Compared with conventional PP, ExxonMobil PP 3885E1
resin produces finer fibers, which can provide better fabric uniformity and a
softer feel. 

Award winning Vistamaxx specialty elastomers continue to accelerate into a
growing range of nonwoven applications including hygiene absorbent products
(HAP), such as diapers, as well as medical, filtration and industrial products.
To support this growth, in addition to increased demand for PP, ExxonMobil
Chemical is building a second world-scale petrochemical complex in Singapore,
which will include a 500,000 tons-per-year PP unit and a 300,000 tons-per-year
specialty elastomers unit. ExxonMobil Chemical recently broke ground on a
technology center in Shanghai to provide product application support for its
growing business in the China and Asia Pacific markets. Reinforcing ExxonMobil
Chemical`s long-term commitment to China and the region, the new investment will
support growing sales of premium products by providing innovative solutions to
customer needs. 

Vistamaxx specialty elastomers exhibit versatile benefits and product qualities
including good elasticity, toughness, the ability to bond easily with other
materials for advanced processing, design flexibility, and a high coefficient of
friction for slip resistant applications. Vistamaxx specialty elastomers enable
nonwovens producers to make an elastic fabric in a single step using a variety
of spunmelt equipment. In the past, this was possible only in a multistep
process. Eliminating steps in the process can reduce total system cost while
achieving the required performance. Vistamaxx specialty elastomers also allow
increased capability in multi-beam processing lines to include elasticity in
multi-layer fabrics. When blended with PP, Vistamaxx specialty elastomers
provide additional softness to nonwoven fabrics, helping converters to meet the
increasing market needs for softer products in baby diapers and feminine care
hygiene applications. 

ExxonMobil Chemical`s broad portfolio of PP solutions for nonwovens includes
ExxonMobilTM PP 3155E3 polypropylene and its meltblown grades. ExxonMobil PP
3155E3 polypropylene is an industry standard for spunbond applications providing
robust spinning and operability. 

About ExxonMobil Chemical

ExxonMobil Chemical is one of the world`s premier petrochemical companies with
manufacturing, technology, and marketing operations around the world. The
company delivers a broad portfolio of products and solutions efficiently and
responsibly, with a commitment to create outstanding customer and shareholder
value. ExxonMobil Chemical endorses the principles of sustainable development,

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc announced today that it has entered into licensing agreements with
two pharmaceutical companies based in India, strengthening its position in
emerging markets and significantly expanding its portfolio of medicines in its
Established Products Business Unit. 

Off-patent medicines, including branded generics, represent one of the fastest
growth segments in the global pharmaceutical market. This is especially true in
emerging markets where costs and access are primary drivers of off-patent
medicine growth. 

"Today`s announcement demonstrates Pfizer`s commitment to improving the global
public health landscape by making needed quality medicines - in a range of
disease areas - accessible to underserved populations worldwide," said Jeff
Kindler, chairman and CEO of Pfizer. "The off-patent marketplace worldwide too
often suffers from quality and supply reliability issues. With our broad
established medicines portfolio and our world-class manufacturing capabilities,
Pfizer is in an ideal position to supply high-quality medicines at affordable
prices to people around the world." 

Emerging Markets: Reaching New Patients

Pfizer`s expanded agreements with Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. will grow its product
portfolio within emerging markets to reflect the diverse and often unique market
dynamics and commercial interests of more than 70 countries. 

"This deal illustrates the types of innovative partnerships which will help to
advance Pfizer`s presence in developing markets and enhance access to needed
medicines for billions worldwide," said Jean-Michel Halfon, president and
general manager of Pfizer`s Emerging Markets Business Unit. "The expansion of
our product portfolio from this deal provides a foundation for us to
commercialize branded generics based on patient needs within specific regions." 

Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer has acquired rights to 55 solid oral
dose products and 5 sterile injectable products for patients in more than 70
emerging market countries. These medicines include antibiotics and
anti-infectives, and cover a broad range of disease areas like cardiovascular
and central nervous system disorders. Pfizer will commercialize the 60 products
in phases tailoring its approach for different regions. Financial terms of the
deal were not disclosed. 

Developed Markets: Expanding Generic Offerings

Pfizer entered into agreements with Claris Lifesciences Ltd. ("Claris") to
commercialize sterile injectable medicines after the products are no longer
patent protected, and have lost market exclusivity in North America, Europe,
Australia and New Zealand. The Claris agreements advance Pfizer`s Established
Products strategy, which focuses on the commercialization of products where
market exclusivity has been lost. Pfizer`s global annual sales of established
products are approximately $10 billion. 

Under the terms of the agreements, Pfizer has acquired rights to 15 injectable
products covering a broad range of therapeutic areas including anti-infectives
and pain. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. 

"These agreements advance our goals to expand our steriles portfolio and provide
hospitals and patients with a wide offering of affordable medicines they can
trust. Pfizer`s reputation for high quality and supply reliability is unrivaled
in the industry, and this is critical in the area of sterile injectables," said
David Simmons, president and general manager of Pfizer`s Established Products
Business Unit. 

Pfizer also expanded agreements with Aurobindo in developed markets, adding
products in the US and Europe. 

To date, 128 non-Pfizer products - 98 solid oral dose and 30 sterile injectables
- have been added to the Company`s existing diversified portfolio of established
brands.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) has struck licensing agreements with two Indian-based companies, as the world's largest drugmaker seeks new avenues of growth in generics and emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deals announced by Pfizer on Wednesday with Aurobindo Pharma Ltd (ARBN.BO) and Claris Lifesciences Ltd substantially increase Pfizer's offerings in medicines that have lost patent protection in markets around the world. Financial terms of the deals were not released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer will gain rights to 60 products to be sold in developing markets, where it is seeking to add $3 billion in annual sales by 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the developed world, Pfizer is seeking to add $1 billion by 2012 for its established products unit, which includes its off-patent medicines. The deals are expected to add products that will contribute to more than half of that revenue goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The world of off-patent medicines we think is poorly served," David Simmons, president of Pfizer's established products unit, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're making a major drive in that direction to increase the portfolio of high quality medicines we bring at affordable prices," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, which posted $48 billion in revenue last year, faces severe sales declines in the coming years from patent expirations to its own products, including its blockbuster Lipitor cholesterol treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker struck a $68 billion deal in January to acquire U.S. rival Wyeth WYE.N to help shore up profits. It has also restructured its operating model around separate units -- such as for established products, which includes its generic drugs, and emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pharmaceutical companies are increasingly turning their attention to developing nations as they face tougher conditions in more mature markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Aurobindo deal expands on an existing collaboration between the companies that earlier this year launched Pfizer more deeply into selling generic versions of other companies' medicines in the United States and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the expanded deal, Pfizer gains rights to 55 generic pills and five injectable products in more than 70 emerging market countries in Latin America, Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medicines include anti-infectives, and drugs for cardiovascular disease and central nervous system disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal shows how Pfizer is using partnerships to grow its emerging markets presence, said Jean-Michel Halfon, president of Pfizer's emerging markets unit. Halfon said Pfizer should reach the 2012 revenue goal by maintaining a 4 percent market share in emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer also gains U.S. and European rights to a number of generic pills in the expanded Aurobindo deal, adding to a larger clutch of medicines to which it gained rights in a March deal announced with the Indian firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Claris agreement, Pfizer acquires rights to 15 injectable generic medicines for pain, infections and other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has prioritized making licensing deals to expand its injectables business, in which it believes there are relatively few rivals and maintains it has a competitive cost structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All told, Pfizer now has rights to off-patent versions of 128 non-Pfizer products, including 98 pills and 30 injectable medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt; * Expands Aurobindo partnership to developing countries&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Deal with India-based Claris for injectables&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Lewis Krauskopf&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) has struck
licensing agreements with two Indian-based companies, as the
world's largest drugmaker seeks new avenues of growth in
generics and emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deals announced by Pfizer on Wednesday with Aurobindo

annual sales by 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the developed world, Pfizer is seeking to add $1 billion
by 2012 for its established products unit, which includes its
off-patent medicines. The deals are expected to add products
that will contribute to more than half of that revenue goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The world of off-patent medicines we think is poorly
served," David Simmons, president of Pfizer's established
products unit, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're making a major drive in that direction to increase
the portfolio of high quality medicines we bring at affordable
prices," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, which posted $48 billion in revenue last year,
faces severe sales declines in the coming years from patent
expirations to its own products, including its blockbuster
Lipitor cholesterol treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drugmaker struck a $68 billion deal in January to
acquire U.S. rival Wyeth WYE.N to help shore up profits. It
has also restructured its operating model around separate units
-- such as for established products, which includes its generic
drugs, and emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pharmaceutical companies are increasingly turning their
attention to developing nations as they face tougher conditions
in more mature markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Aurobindo deal expands on an existing collaboration
between the companies that earlier this year launched Pfizer
more deeply into selling generic versions of other companies'
medicines in the United States and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the expanded deal, Pfizer gains rights to 55 generic
pills and five injectable products in more than 70 emerging
market countries in Latin America, Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa
and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The medicines include anti-infectives, and drugs for
cardiovascular disease and central nervous system disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal shows how Pfizer is using partnerships to grow its
emerging markets presence, said Jean-Michel Halfon, president
of Pfizer's emerging markets unit. Halfon said Pfizer should
reach the 2012 revenue goal by maintaining a 4 percent market
share in emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer also gains U.S. and European rights to a number of
generic pills in the expanded Aurobindo deal, adding to a
larger clutch of medicines to which it gained rights in a March
deal announced with the Indian firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the Claris agreement, Pfizer acquires rights to 15
injectable generic medicines for pain, infections and other
conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer has prioritized making licensing deals to expand its
injectables business, in which it believes there are relatively
few rivals and maintains it has a competitive cost structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All told, Pfizer now has rights to off-patent versions of
128 non-Pfizer products, including 98 pills and 30 injectable
medicines.

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Jumping Through the TARP Hoops

Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS), JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS)
and American Express (NYSE: APX) are "champing at the bit" to repay funds
received from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), in order to avoid
tighter regulations associated with these funds (i.e compensation limitations)
and as a way to signal to investors the company`s financial strength. The
government will receive repayment, but there are some caveats. 

First and foremost, no institution will be allowed to repay TARP until 10 of the
19 biggest banks present plans to boost their capital under the government's
stress tests -- by early June 2009. These institutions will have to pass another
stress test, as well as issue non-government guaranteed debt, thereby
demonstrate the ability to self-fund in the market. Then, if the regulators will
certify that an institution is sound without government help, groupings will be
permitted to repay TARP funds. 

Digital River Surging

Shares of Digital River (Nasdaq: DRIV) have climbed approximately 8% since our
last update on the company on April 15. Today, DRIV is up nearly 3% and the
company is presenting at a sell-side firm research conference in San Francisco,
CA. 

The company`s Q1 results beat our/consensus estimates by a decent margin. The
upside was driven mainly by a ramp in the Consumer Electronic (CE) segment and
new client wins, both of which offset the effect of current global economic
downtrend. However, Q2 guidance fell short of our non-GAAP estimates, while
revenues are expected slightly higher than our current expectation. 

We were expecting the company to report $95 million in revenue (guidance is at
$96 million) with non-GAAP EPS of $0.44 (guidance is at $0.41). Higher capex and
lower margins from the new CE customers are likely to dampen bottom-line
performance in Q2. Nevertheless, DRIV shares have continued their upward
momentum, likely reflecting 2H performance from both the CE and Software
segments.

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

FASB Changes Accounting Rule

The rules will certainly improve the transparency of the banks` balance sheets.
In the stress tests recently conducted, the Federal Reserve had estimates of
assets likely to be brought onto the balance sheet as a result of these
amendments. It is estimated that 19 banks subjected to stress tests would have
to bring about $900 billion of assets onto their balance sheets. 

In their latest regulatory filings, Citigroup (NYSE: C) estimated that the rule
change would result in consolidation of $165.8 billion in additional assets, and
JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) estimated it to be $145 billion. 

We think that the new rule is a very positive move by FASB, after the much
criticized and much debated revision allowed by it (under intense pressure from
Congress) on mark-to-market accounting recently. 

Pacific Ethanol Subsidiaries Bankrupt

Pacific Ethanol (Nasdaq: PEIX) disclosed that lenders agreed to $20 million in
debtor-in-possession financing. 

Kinergy is the ethanol sales and distribution arm of Pacific Ethanol. It sells
ethanol made by Pacific Ethanol as well as ethanol made by Midwestern producers.
Pacific AG sells wet distillers feed grain to California's big dairy industry.
The grain is a byproduct of producing ethanol, made after the fermentation
process. 

Pacific Ethanol is at a disadvantage to many of its rivals. It had to buy most
of its corn from the Midwest, which raised its operating costs. The company also
buys some corn in California. Pacific Ethanol said it plans to sell its ethanol
and feed production under existing agreements. 

As recently as 2007, the ethanol industry had a bullish outlook. However, with
high corn prices it's become a very difficult market for ethanol producers.
There are currently 10 other ethanol producers in bankruptcy, including VeraSun
Energy (OTC: VSUNQ) and Aventine Renewable Energy (OTC: AVRNQ).

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Companhia Energetica de Minas Gerais, or CEMIG
(NYSE: CIG) as the Bull of the Day and Motorola (NYSE: MOT) the Bear of the Day.
In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Goldman Sachs (NYSE:
GS), E-Trade (Nasdaq: ETFC) and Charles Schwab (Nasdaq: SCHW). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

We are keeping our Buy recommendation on Companhia Energetica de Minas Gerais,
or CEMIG (NYSE: CIG). Although the company posted lower-than-expected results
for the first quarter of 2009, those results were impacted by a few
non-recurring items. 

However, the short-to-medium term outlook remains promising as demand for
electricity in Brazil keeps growing. Despite the global credit crunch, we still
have a reasonably positive outlook for the Brazilian economy in the short term. 

Finally, CEMIG has a solid dividend payout, and we believe that the stock is
quite undervalued compared to other international electric utilities. 

Bear of the Day: 

While we maintain our Sell rating for Motorola (NYSE: MOT), we have adjusted our
valuation target higher based on current market conditions. MOT is a leading
manufacturer of mobile handsets, network infrastructure, and cable products. 

Revenue in the last reported quarter was significantly below our estimates due
to continued weakness of the mobile handset sales. We are not convinced that a
turnaround will take place without a major restructuring initiative as the
company is exposed to lingering economic headwinds, lower overall worldwide
demand for its handsets, a lack of high-end competitive PDA wireless devices,
and reduced visibility for near-term revenue improvement. 

However, stringent cost control measures taken by the management and development
of new smart-phone devices are some initial positive indicators that will be
monitored for longer-term rating consideration.

A Modest Proposal

Today, the NYSE will probably trade about 5 billion shares. The average price of
a S 500 stock is about $33. Thus, on the NYSE alone, $165 billion is changing
hands in a single day. If there were a transaction fee of 0.1% on that, it would
raise $165 million a day, or with about 250 trading days a year, about $41.25
billion per year. If similar fees were levied at the Nasdaq and on options, the
total could reach the vicinity of $100 billion. That is not enough to close the
fiscal gap, but not exactly chopped liver either. 

Long-term investors would hardly notice the tax, but speculating day traders
would quickly start to feel the bite. Encouraging people to take a long-term
view and actually invest -- rather than engage in pure speculation in little
pieces of paper that just happen to represent real companies -- would be a good
thing, in my view. 

The tax would fall on the Financial sector, and would be a way that that sector
ends up repaying the lavish subsidies that it has recently received. Since
wealth is even more unequally distributed in this country than is income -- and
the wealthy hold much more of their wealth in equities than do the middle class
-- the tax would be highly progressive. In effect, the tax would be like a
slightly higher commission charge. 

This, at the margin, might hurt firms that do a lot of trading particularly for
their own account, like Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS). For firms that trade mostly
for their clients like E-Trade (Nasdaq: ETFC) and Charles Schwab (Nasdaq: SCHW),
I suspect that the fee would be passed along to the customer, especially since
it could not be avoided by moving your account to another broker.

&lt;p&gt;McAfee`s CEO and Investor Relations Department Recognized Among the Best in
Public Companies
SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
McAfee, Inc. (NYSE:MFE) today announced that President and Chief Executive
Officer Dave DeWalt has been named one of the top five CEOs of publicly traded
software companies. McAfee`s investor relations team has also been named best IR
team - second only to Microsoft - in the software category. 

For the seventh consecutive year, Institutional Investor magazine surveyed the
world`s largest shareholders and 900 buy-side investment professionals from more
than 460 institutions to reveal who they regard as the best CEOs. This is the
second year for the investor relations survey. 

Dave DeWalt joined McAfee in April 2007 and has led the company to double-digit
sales growth each quarter, poising the company to become the leading security
vendor. From 2007 to 2008, McAfee grew sales 20 percent. Revenue grew to $1.3
billion in 2008. 

DeWalt has also become a leading authority on cybercrime. He recently spoke at
the World Economic Forum in Davos about global cyber threats, and at the
security industry`s largest conference, RSA, about McAfee`s vision for digital
security. 

"I am proud to lead a company that is fighting cybercriminals and making the
Internet safer for businesses, consumers and government," said DeWalt. "2008 was
a banner year for McAfee and I`m very proud of what we have accomplished. We
have continued to fight for a noble cause: protecting our customers from the bad
guys and looking for new ways to stay ahead." 

The McAfee investor relations team was ranked second in the software category by
Institutional Investor. Buy-side analysts and investors judged McAfee`s investor
relations as second only to Microsoft.

&lt;p&gt;First Large, Placebo-Controlled Study to Demonstrate Efficacy of Lyrica as
Add-on Therapy Strategy in Difficult-to-Treat GAD Patients
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


The addition of Pfizer`s Lyrica (pregabalin) capsules CV to other generalized
anxiety disorder (GAD) treatments significantly improved the symptoms of the
condition in patients who responded only partially to previous treatments,
according to a study presented today at the American Psychiatric Association
annual meeting in San Francisco, Ca. In this study, patients treated with Lyrica
showed significant improvements in both their psychological and physical
symptoms of anxiety. 

Generalized anxiety disorder is a chronic, debilitating anxiety disorder
affecting nearly seven million Americans and is characterized by persistent,
excessive, uncontrollable worry about everyday things. Patients also frequently
experience physical symptoms such as muscle tension, fatigue, sleep disturbance,
and other aches and pains. 

The condition is complex and often difficult to treat, with 40 percent to 60
percent of patients failing to achieve remission after six months of treatment
in clinical studies with serontonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) - two common classes of FDA-approved
GAD treatments. 

"These data are very encouraging for the high percentage of GAD patients who
still struggle with debilitating symptoms despite treatment," said Dr. Rakesh
Jain, one of the study`s investigators and director, adult and child
psycho-pharmacology research, R/D Clinical Research, Inc. "It is clear we need
additional effective, well-tolerated options to address this difficult to treat
condition." 

This is the first large, placebo-controlled trial to demonstrate the efficacy of
an add-on therapy strategy in patients who had failed to respond to two
different courses of GAD monotherapy with a SSRI, SNRI or benzodiazepine. 

The study found that patients treated with Lyrica in addition to their baseline
SSRI/SNRI therapy had a significantly greater improvement in overall anxiety
symptoms as well as individual psychological and physical symptoms compared to
baseline therapy alone as measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A), an
interview scale that measures the severity of a patient's anxiety. Over the
eight week treatment period, patients receiving add-on Lyrica therapy had, on
average, an anxiety score that was 1.2 points lower on the HAM-A compared to
baseline therapy alone (P=0.012). 

Significantly more patients receiving add-on Lyrica treatment (50 percent)
showed at least a 50 percent reduction in their anxiety symptoms compared to
SSRI/SNRI treatment alone (37 percent) (P=0.023). Lyrica was also shown to be
well tolerated as an add-on therapy in this study. 

About the Study

This study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial designed to
evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjunctive Lyrica in 353 patients with a
primary diagnosis of GAD. To be included in the study, patients had to have a
HAM-A score greater or equal to 22, and to have not responded, or only minimally
responded, to treatment with a SSRI, SNRI or benzodiazepine prior to the study. 

These patients were then treated with a different SSRI/SNRI for eight weeks. At
the end of the eight week open-label treatment period, patients who had shown
only a partial response to treatment (as defined by a HAM-A score of greater
than or equal to 16, less than 50 percent decrease in HAM-A score, and a
Clinical Global Impression Improvement score of less than 3) were then
randomized to an additional eight weeks of double-blind treatment with either
Lyrica (150 to 600 mg/day) or placebo while continuing treatment with the
existing background SSRI or SNRI therapy. 

The primary endpoint was the mean change score on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating
Scale. The SSRIs and SNRIs used in this study included escitalopram, paroxetine
and venlafaxine XR.

The most common side effects in the study compared to other GAD treatments plus
placebo were dizziness (11.7 percent vs. 5.7 percent), headache (9.4 percent vs.
4 percent), and somnolence (8.3 percent vs. 3.4 percent). 

This study was sponsored by Pfizer, Inc. 

About Lyrica

In the United States, Lyrica is approved for the management of fibromyalgia,
painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia (pain after
shingles), and for the adjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures (a type of
epilepsy) in adults. Lyrica is not approved for GAD in the U.S. 

Outside of the United States, Lyrica is indicated in adults for the management
of peripheral and central neuropathic pain, treatment of generalized anxiety
disorder, and adjunctive therapy for partial seizures with or without secondary
generalization. 

Important Safety Information

Treatment with Lyrica may cause dizziness, somnolence, peripheral edema or
blurred vision. Other most common adverse reactions include dry mouth, weight
gain, constipation, euphoric mood, balance disorder, increased appetite and
thinking abnormally. There have been post-marketing reports of angioedema and
hypersensitivity. Like other anti-epileptic drugs, Lyrica may cause suicidal
thoughts or actions in a very small number of people.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Chemical`s affiliate ExxonMobil Yugen Kaisha (EMYK) announced today
that Japan Butyl Co. Ltd. will increase its butyl rubber production capacity by
18,000 tons per year at the Kawasaki Plant. This expansion will increase its
capacity to 98,000 tons per year when the project is completed in late 2010. 

This expansion will incorporate ExxonMobil`s recent advances in process
technology. One such new proprietary technology advancement allows for the butyl
polymerization reaction, which normally occurs at -95&#176;C, to operate at -75&#176;C.
This new technological advancement will provide significant energy and capital
investment savings. 

"These advancements are part of ExxonMobil Chemical`s longstanding commitment to
the butyl process, product and applications technology development," said Art
Sullivan, vice president, Global Butyl Polymers Business Unit, ExxonMobil
Chemical Company. 

"In addition to these new process technology advancements, we also have begun
working with our customers on a new product for tire innerliners, called Exxcore
DVA resin, which allows for significant tire weight reduction while improving
air retention." 

"Recently, we also demonstrated success in our pilot facilities to produce the
next generation of butyl rubber utilizing nanocomposite technology. Using this
latest innovation at our facilities will reduce the amount of material our
customers require for existing applications, effectively doubling the volume of
tire innerliner applications that ExxonMobil could serve from each plant." 

Market testing is expected to commence in 2010. Each of these efforts is aimed
at supporting the high growth of the butyl rubber segment. 

ExxonMobil Chemical is an industry leader in the development and application of
premium products that add value through enhanced product performance, energy
efficiency, pollution prevention and greenhouse gas emission reduction.
Continuing to address the growth needs of the butyl rubber industry, the Japan
Butyl Co. Ltd. expansion is the latest of several recent company expansions to
serve the growing butyl market. 

In 2008, ExxonMobil expanded halobutyl capacity at its Baytown, Texas plant by
60 percent. This was preceded by the 2006 expansion of Japan Butyl Co., Ltd.`s
halobutyl capacity at its Kashima plant by 17,000 tons per year.

SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Chevron is facing a shareholder rebuke at its annual meeting next week over the
company`s $27 billion Ecuador liability with the announcement that the nation`s
largest public pension fund in California is defying the recommendation of
company management and voting for a resolution on the issue. 

CalPERS, which owns an estimated $600 million of Chevron stock and controls $170
billion in assets, announced on its website today that it will vote for a
resolution calling on Chevron to examine whether it complies with host country
laws and environmental regulations. Chevron has been heavily criticized for
violating such laws in Ecuador, leading to a humanitarian crisis among
indigenous and farmer communities in an area of rainforest where Texaco admitted
to dumping billions of gallons of toxic waste from the mid-1960s to the early
1990s. 

New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has also opened an investigation of
Chevron to determine if it is misleading shareholders about the financial risks
the company faces in Ecuador. 

"The CalPERS vote is a significant announcement that puts enormous pressure on
Chevron`s management in the investor community," said Dan Orlow, a private
American investor who is advising the Amazonian communities. "It demonstrates
that important pension funds are now lining up against Chevron on Ecuador." 

CalPERS and the two New York funds - the state`s Common Retirement Fund and the
Employees Retirement System of New York City -- are three of the largest public
pension funds in the U.S. and together control more than $1 billion of Chevron
stock. Other public pension funds that have announced their support of the
resolution include those of Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and the pension
funds of firefighters and police in Detroit and other large cities. 

Funds from three large unions -- the AFL-CIO, Teamsters, and AFSCME -- have
announced their support of the resolution along with several smaller private
funds, such as Trillium Asset Management in Boston. 

The Ecuador liability, featured earlier this month on 60 Minutes in an
unflattering report for Chevron, stems from the dumping by Texaco (now Chevron)
of billions of gallons of toxic waste in the rainforest when it operated an oil
concession from 1964 to 1990. Thousands of rainforest residents have been
fighting a legal battle against the company for clean-up since 1993. 

The case is in Ecuador at Chevron`s request after it was initially filed by the
communities in U.S. federal court. The company agreed to be subject to
jurisdiction and be bound by any ruling in Ecuador as a condition of the case
being transferred out of U.S. court, which makes the enforceability of a
judgment out of Ecuador likely despite what the company is saying to
shareholders, said Steven R. Donziger, an American legal advisor to the
Amazonian communities. 

The liability appears to be the largest ever faced by an oil company for
environmental damage, and almost surpasses the $31 billion price tag paid by
Chevron to purchase Texaco in 2001. Chevron`s management has announced it
expects an adverse judgment in the case but has said it would appeal, while the
plaintiffs have announced they plan to ask the court to hold the amount of any
judgment in escrow pending appeals - a move that could severely hinder the
company`s cash position in a time of relatively low oil prices, according to
analysts. 

Previously, the Securities and Exchange Commission denied an attempt by Chevron
management to prevent the Ecuador resolution from coming to a vote. 

The announcement by CalPERS comes the same week that Chevron`s management filed
with the SEC an open letter to shareholders urging them to vote against the
Ecuador resolution. That letter - signed by Chevron Corporate Secretary Lydia I.
Beebe - contains incorrect and misleading information and appeared to backfire,
said Donziger. 

"Each assertion in the Beebe letter is either false, materially misleading, or
incomplete except for the part where the company admits it might lose the legal
case," said Donziger. 

"Our team is being contacted repeatedly by shareholders and analysts who are
concerned that Chevron management is not fully and honestly disclosing the
company`s exposure in Ecuador," said Orlow. "There is a real concern that
Chevron is not playing it straight and that it might have overpaid for Texaco." 

The Cuomo investigation is being brought under New York`s Martin Act, which
allows for both civil and criminal liability for fraud. Several New York-based
shareholders, including Amnesty International, had requested the probe to
determine if the company`s public disclosures complied with securities
regulations. 

The annual meeting is scheduled for May 27 at Chevron headquarters in San Ramon,
CA. Indigenous leaders from Ecuador`s Amazon are expected to attend and confront
Chevron`s management about Ecuador. 

In past annual meetings, Chevron CEO David O`Reilly occasionally has treated the
Ecuadorian visitors with a discourteous tone and shut down the microphone when
they attempted to speak, said Donziger.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS May 21 (Reuters) - U.S. software company Microsoft
(MSFT.O) has withdrawn its request for an oral hearing into EU
charges that it sought to thwart rivals by tying its Web browser
to its Windows operating system, EU regulators said on Thursday.
"We will now consider Microsoft's reply to the statement of
objections without a hearing," European Commission spokesman
Jonathan Todd said.
The Commission, tasked with ensuring that companies do not
abuse their market dominance in the 27-country European Union,
had set out its charges, the so-called "statement of
objections", against Microsoft (MSFT.O) on Jan. 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The European Union executive had earlier this month set an
oral hearing for June 3 to 5 in response to the company's
request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said it had subsequently asked for the hearing to
be rescheduled to another date because the date set by the
Commission coincided with an International Competition Network
meeting in Zurich at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe that holding the hearing at a time when key
officials are out of the country would deny Microsoft our
effective right to be heard and hence deny our "rights of
defense" under European law," Dave Heiner, Microsoft's vice
president, wrote on the company's blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the Commission's hearing officer turned down
Microsoft's request for another date, the company "reluctantly
notified the Commission that we will not proceed with a hearing
on June 3-5", he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By bundling its Internet Explorer with Windows, Microsoft
shielded its Internet Explorer browser from head-to-head
competition with rival products, harming innovation and reducing
customer choice, the Commission had said in its charge sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Internet Explorer's global market share in February was 67.4
percent, with the Mozilla foundation's Firefox browser a distant
second at about 22 percent, according to market research firm
Net Applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has said the Commission may order it and computer
makers to require users to choose a particular browser when
buying a computer or that multiple browsers be made available on
new Windows-based computers. It could also get a hefty fine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft was fined 899 million euros ($1.2 billion) in
February on charges it used high prices to thwart rivals and for
not complying with a previous antitrust decision by the
Commission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Double click on the newslinks below for the following

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
World Wildlife Fund and IBM today announced that IBM is furthering its
participation in the WWF Climate Savers program, committing to a second
generation Climate Savers goal to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by an
additional 12 percent below 2005 levels by 2012. IBM expects the reductions will
build upon the company's prior success in cutting carbon emissions by nearly 2.7
million metric tons between 1990 and 2005-equivalent to 40 percent of the
company`s 1990 global greenhouse gas emissions-and saving over $270 million
through its annual energy conservation actions. 

"As one of two original members of the Climate Savers program, we`ve had the
opportunity to share measurable results and best practices and demonstrate the
benefits -- both to business and the environment -- of taking early actions to
address the challenges of climate change," said Wayne Balta, IBM`s vice
president for Corporate Environmental Affairs and Product Safety. "This new
commitment with WWF will not only address our own global operations but also
extend our technologies and services to clients." 

IBM also announced its intention to offer energy and greenhouse gas emissions
management solutions to other Climate Savers companies to assist them in
addressing climate challenges and achieving their emission reduction goals. IBM
will provide these services at the request and expense of participating Climate
Savers companies. 

"IBM has been a great partner and a pioneer in voluntary emission reductions to
address climate change," said Jason Clay, WWF`s senior vice president for
markets. "In order to ensure that the Earth`s resources are utilized
sustainably, we need to partner with businesses that are primary users of those
resources. Through collaborations like our partnership with IBM, we identify
win-win opportunities that results in long-term environmental and economic
benefits."

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Today the first annual Pollard Award for Innovation in Business Ethics was
awarded to The Coca-Cola Company by The Executives Breakfast Club, a
Chicago-based non-profit organization made up of more than 100 members, from a
mix of international and local companies, dedicated to advancing ethical
business practices. 

"The Pollard Award recognizes businesses that are leading the way in embedding
ethics in their organizations, and, this year, we are proud to honor Cola-Cola,"
said Donald Clark, chairman of the award committee and president of Micron
Industries. "The company has demonstrated its commitment by having local ethics
officers in each business unit, enforcing ethical expectations with its business
partners and conducting anti-bribery audits across its global operations." 

Coca-Cola is also leveraging its resources to conserve and protect natural
resources throughout the world. For example, through its partnership with the
World Wildlife Federation, Coca-Cola is working to measurably conserve seven key
watersheds; improve the efficiency of the its water use, including its
agricultural supply chain; decrease its carbon dioxide emissions and energy use;
and inspire a global movement by uniting industries, conservation organizations
and others in the conservation and protection of freshwater resources around the
world. By reducing and recycling the water used in manufacturing - and
replenishing water as a vital resource - these efforts are yielding important
social, environmental and economic benefits. 

"It is an honor to accept this recognition on behalf of The Coca-Cola Company,"
said Kevin P. Morris, vice president of Public Affairs and Communications,
Coca-Cola Enterprises. "We are committed to the highest standards of ethics and
moral responsibility. Our business depends on consumers choosing to invite us
into their lives, and we understand that consumers only issue those invitations
to companies and brands they trust and respect." 

The company also recently expanded its earlier goal to recycle or reuse the
equivalent of 100 percent of its plastic bottles to include aluminum cans. It
has invested in recycling initiatives, including curbside collection programs
and the world`s largest bottle-to-bottle recycling plant in Spartanburg, South
Carolina. 

Named after C. William Pollard, the former CEO of ServiceMaster and a highly
respected leader in the area of business ethics, the Pollard Award recognizes an
entire U.S. based company, rather than an individual. There are no maximum or
minimum criteria for the company`s number of employees, operating budget, yearly
profit margin, etc. 

Select U.S. institutes dedicated to the study of business ethics submitted
nominees to a nine-person panel composed of leading academics in the field,
prominent members of the business media and select members of The Executives
Breakfast Club. Then the general membership of the Executives Breakfast Club
voted to choose the final recipient. 

Nominees for this year`s award included Anglo American, General Electric,
Starbucks, Target, USAA and Xerox. Of those, Anglo American and General Electric
were chosen as finalists, along with Coca-Cola. Each of these companies was
chosen based on an innovative model, practice, service or product that has
demonstrated originality, viability and broad applicability. 

About the Executives Breakfast Club

The Executives Breakfast Club is a 40-year-old non-profit organization
headquartered in suburban Chicago. Originally a general business forum -
addressed by U.S. presidents, foreign heads of state, CEOs and celebrities - the
Club shifted its focus in 2007 to business ethics and has hosted in-depth public
discussions on ethics and news, politics, healthcare, investing, diversity,
transportation and the environment. The Club is guided by chief executives at
more than 20 organizations, ranging from leading international companies to
prominent local businesses. Each is committed to preparing participants to make
ethical business decisions and to promoting sound ethical business practices
everywhere.

&lt;p&gt;PHILADELPHIA--(Business Wire)--
Coca-Cola`s famous curvy contour bottle hits Philadelphia store shelves this
week, and it is bigger and better than ever! The Philadelphia market is the
first in the northeastern U.S. to introduce the convenient two-liter version of
the iconic package. After successful pilots in Birmingham, AL and Chattanooga,
TN, the curvy bottle was rolled out in several southern cities last year. 

The new two-liter form of Coca-Cola`s famous package was preferred over the
straight wall two-liter bottle overwhelmingly in consumer tests* and offers a
significant advantage beyond its classic good looks - it is also easier to hold
and easier to pour. The new Coca-Cola two-liter contour plastic bottle will be
available in stores throughout the Philadelphia area beginning this week. All
Coca-Cola trademark brands will be available in the new two-liter contour
package, including Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Caffeine Free Coca-Cola and
Caffeine Free Diet Coke. Importantly for customers, research conducted by
Coca-Cola North America (CCNA) with consumers suggests that the two-liter
contour package has the potential to re-energize sparkling beverage sales in
their stores as well**. 

"Along with Coca-Cola`s one-of-a-kind real cola taste, the iconic shape of the
contour bottle is what people love most about the brand. They are both a part of
its timeless magic," said Hendrik Steckhan, president and general manager,
Sparkling Beverages, CCNA. "We want to offer our brands to consumers in a
special way that fits their needs for all contemporary beverage occasions. When
you enjoy your family meal together, sharing an ice-cold Coke from a contour
bottle is just `the real thing`." 

"Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Company is pleased to introduce the new version
of Coca-Cola`s iconic bottle to our consumers and customers," said Francis X.
McGorry, president and CEO, Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Company. "Consumers
love this package innovation, and we feel that it will directly benefit our
customers by creating additional interest and demand among their shoppers for
our two-liter portfolio of brands. I am particularly proud of the leadership
that the launch team from Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Company and CCNA has
demonstrated as we worked together to bring this innovative opportunity to our
customers and consumers." 

Nearly 92 years after its creation, the contour bottle remains a symbol of
innovation, instantly differentiating the world`s best known sparkling beverage
from all other products. Widely recognized as a pioneering example of
package-driven branding, the contour bottle is one of the few packages to ever
receive a trademark from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Leveraging
Coca-Cola`s iconic shape to further differentiate its two-liter package is one
part of CCNA`s ongoing efforts to revitalize the sparkling beverage category. 

In addition to the new two-liter Coca-Cola contour bottle, CCNA`s other
sparkling beverage brands will also have new two-liter versions of their
proprietary packages as part of the Philadelphia launch. The familiar shapes of
Sprite`s signature bottle and the distinctively shaped bottle for CCNA`s brands
like Fanta, Fresca, Seagram`s and others will all be offered in a two-liter
package. The launch is supported with in-store media, out-of-home and newspaper
advertising.

consumers with nearly 500 sparkling and still brands. Along with Coca-Cola,

&lt;p&gt;  CRAIGAVON, NORTHERN IRELAND, May 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Almac Diagnostics has today announced a collaborative study between
Almac, Pfizer and the PETACC3 Translational Research Working Party (PTRW)
The study involves gene expression profiling of formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples from the Pan-European Trials in Adjuvant
Colon Cancer (PETACC 3) trial using Almac Diagnostic's unique Colorectal
Cancer DSA(TM) research tool to identify molecular subtypes, biomarkers
and drug targets.

    Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in both men
and women in the United States and Europe and is the second most common
cause of cancer mortality in both sexes.

    The samples to be used in the study are taken from the PETACC 3 study, an
international randomized, prospective trial of adjuvant chemotherapy in
patients with stage II and III colon cancer. This study represents a
unique resource in advancing the molecular understanding of colon cancer.

    Prof. Paul Harkin, President and Managing Director of Almac Diagnostics
stated "As understanding grows of the heterogeneity of cancer, it is
becoming increasingly clear that molecular subtypes are important both in
patients' prognosis and in predicting their response to chemotherapy.
This has already been shown in breast cancer, and the study to be led by
Almac, Pfizer and PTRW aims to examine this in colorectal cancer".

    The aims of the study are to identify molecular subtypes in colorectal
cancer and to identify new drug targets in treatment resistant patients.

Penney and Nordstrom</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights IBM Corporation (NYSE: IBM) as the Bull of the
Day and Align Technology (Nasdaq: ALGN) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks
Equity Research provides analysis on Zions Bancorporation (Nasdaq: ZION), J.C.
Penney (NYSE: JCP) and Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

As a result of its large non-US revenue base, IBM Corporation (NYSE: IBM) has
been better insulated from the recent weakness in the U.S. economy than many of
its peers. IBM's Q109 results indicate its strong position in emerging markets,
which should continue to help drive growth. 

Moreover, the company has focused on driving its bottom line through cost
cutting efforts. It re-affirmed EPS guidance for the full year of 2009 and 2010.
Although, revenue is not expected to grow by much, we expect margin improvements
in 2009. 

The company's long-term prospects look brighter as it maintains a strong
position in the software and services market. We maintain our Buy rating on IBM
shares and maintain our price target of $120.00. 

Bear of the Day: 

Align Technology (Nasdaq: ALGN) is engaged in the design, manufacture, and
marketing of a proprietary system, Invisalign, for the treatment of crooked
teeth. The company's business fundamentals are negatively affected by the
current economic turbulence. 

As such, we expect revenue to decline in FY09. Furthermore, we think that the
earnings quality could become an issue as management finds it difficult to meet
growth targets. 

We are recommending a Sell rating for this stock. We think that the shares
deserve to trade at 10% discount to the comparable mean. This equates to a P/S
multiple of approximately 2.0x and to a target price of $8.80.

Fed Minutes: Signs of Improvement

The Fed revised its forecast for economic growth to reflect a comparatively more
optimistic outlook. The central bank expects real GDP to "edge higher in the
second half and then increase moderately next year." 

However, the Fed also warned that growth would be restrained over the
foreseeable future. It particularly cited financial services and housing as
sectors that "might well account for a smaller share of the economy in coming
years." This is not good news for companies like Zions Bancorporation (Nasdaq:
ZION), target areas hardest hit by the housing bust. 

Furthermore, the Fed predicted that the unemployment rate could continue to rise
into the early part of 2010. This would have a dampening effect on consumer
spending and would be a negative for retailers such as J.C. Penney (NYSE: JCP)
and Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN).

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Credit Card Reform Passes Senate

On Tuesday May 19, 2009, the Senate overwhelmingly voted to curtail credit card
rate increases and excessive fees, in an attempt to give consumers (i.e. voting
constituents) some latitude amid the current recession. It appears all that is
needed is to have the executive branch sign off on it. 

If enacted into law, the players in the credit card industry -- such as, but not
limited to, Visa (NYSE: V), MasterCard (NYSE: MA), American Express (NYSE: AXP)
and Capital One (NYSE: COF) -- would have less than a year to make changes.
These changes would include card lenders having to post their credit card
agreements on the Internet, and permit all customers the ability pay their bills
online or by phone without an added fee, rationalize over-the-limit fees and
provide 45 days notice and an explanation before interest rates are increased. 

Petrobras in Brazilian Politics

Petrobras (NYSE: PBR) is now the target of a Congressional commission in Brazil
(CPI) in order to investigate supposed mismanagement. The main allegations are
that (i) there were above normal expenses in the refinery project in the State
of Pernambuco, North East Brazil, and (ii) some questionable accounting
practices adopted by Petrobras during 2008 made it possible for the company to
save around BRL4 billion (US$1.95 billion) in taxes. 

As we have been saying for quite some time, as a state owned company, Petrobras
is always a target for a political fight and short-term electoral interests that
have nothing to do with corporate matters. In the particular case of this
Congressional commission, what is really under discussion are the 2010
presidential elections.

&lt;p&gt;Event featuring 1,320-ft grill celebrated the official start of summer BBQ
season

Celebrity Chef Tyler Florence and NASCAR drivers serve up free food and fun for
race fans
CONCORD, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
Ladies and gentlemen, start your grills! Coca-Cola ignited the summer BBQ season
Memorial Day weekend by firing up the nation`s longest grill at the site of
NASCAR`s longest race, the Coca-Cola 600 at Lowe`s Motor Speedway. 

Requiring more than 7,000 pounds of Kingsford Charcoal, the monster-sized ring
of fire measured an astonishing 1,320 feet and would span more than four
football fields in length if stretched end to end. The colossal grill was used
to cook up a feast for fans attending the "Coca-Cola Quarter-Mile Cookout" on
Friday, May 22. 

"Nothing goes better on a hot summer day than a great meal and the delicious
taste of an ice-cold Coca-Cola," says Bill Kelly, Sr. Vice President, Coke
Trademark Brands. "We think the `Coca-Cola Quarter-Mile Cookout` was the perfect
way to mark the official kickoff of summer." 

The oval-shaped quarter-mile grill - assembled on part of the racetrack`s
frontstretch and pit road - was manned by celebrity chef and Food Network star
Tyler Florence, host of "Tyler`s Ultimate" and author of "Dinner at My Place"
and "Stirring the Pot." Joining Chef Florence were some of NASCAR`s most popular
drivers, including Clint Bowyer, Bobby Labonte, Kyle Petty, and racing legend
Bobby Allison, all of whom traded their firesuits for "track aprons" as they
helped grill up lunch for thousands of fans. 

The event was free and open to all ticket and annual credential holders for the
historic 50th running of the Coca-Cola 600. The menu featured hamburgers and
hotdogs, along with Betty Crocker Suddenly Salad pasta salads, Food Lion Potato
Chips and Betty Crocker Original Supreme brownies. 

Entertainment included Q sessions with Chef Florence and the NASCAR drivers in
attendance, as well as prize giveaways and cool photo opportunities with the
actual Coca-Cola-sponsored 1969 Mercury Cyclone Bobby Allison drove to a victory
in the 1971 Coca-Cola 600, and the Toyota Camry Hybrid pace car that will lead
the field on May 24. 

"Throughout our celebration of our 50th year, we've created new ways to add
value for our ticketholders," said Marcus Smith, president and general manager
of Lowe's Motor Speedway. "This was a terrific family event for our Coca-Cola
600 customers and a chance for both the speedway and Coca-Cola to thank them for
their loyal support." 

For those looking to host their own family barbeques this summer, a collection
of free recipes, grilling tips and suggestions created by Chef Florence are
available at MyCokeRewards.com. Also included on the website are summer party
planning tips, shopping lists, suggestions for fun backyard games and much more.
A special section showcases favorite foods enjoyed by the Coca-Cola Racing
Family of NASCAR drivers when grilling at home or at the racetrack. 

"Like many Americans, Memorial Day weekend marks the official start of the
summer grilling season for me and my family, so I`m excited about kicking it off
in a big way this year with Coca-Cola," said Chef Tyler Florence. "Although most
cookouts don`t include the excitement of a quarter-mile grill, the same
principles apply whether you`re feeding thousands or just a few friends. The
tips, recipes and other resources I`ve put together for MyCokeRewards.com/summer
will help people create a successful backyard barbeque of any size this summer."


Just in time for Memorial Day weekend, Coca-Cola limited-edition summer
collector cans have hit store shelves. For the first time, five different
designs synonymous with summertime - including a BBQ grill, surfboard, beach
ball, sunglasses and stars &amp; stripes - will be featured on packaging for
summer`s iconic refreshment, Coca-Cola. New designs will debut every few weeks
through Labor Day. Consumers also can take advantage of convenient summer
grilling bundles featuring savings on some of America`s favorite brands at
summer-themed Coca-Cola displays in participating supermarkets and convenience
stores across the U.S. 

The Coca-Cola 600 is the longest continuous race sponsorship in NASCAR.
Traditionally the Coca-Cola 600 attracts approximately 180,000 fans to Lowe`s
Motor Speedway on Memorial Day weekend. This year`s race will be broadcast live
on FOX at 5 p.m. on Sunday, May 24. Tickets for the Coca-Cola 600 are available
online at www.lowesmotorspeedway.com or by calling 1-800-455-FANS. 

Coca-Cola is the Official Sparkling Beverage of NASCAR. A signature part of
Coca-Cola`s innovative NASCAR program is the Coca-Cola Racing Family - a group
of top drivers that includes Greg Biffle, Clint Bowyer, Jeff Burton, Denny
Hamlin, Kevin Harvick, Bobby Labonte, Jamie McMurray, Kyle Petty, David Ragan,
Elliott Sadler, Tony Stewart, Michael Waltrip, Aric Almirola and Joey Logano.

&lt;p&gt;Informe de ciudadan&#237;a corporativa de 2008 Detalles de los resultados l&#237;deres de
la industria

* ExxonMobil es l&#237;der de la industria en seguridad de la fuerza laboral. 
* ExxonMobil reduce las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero. 
* El vicepresidente de relaciones p&#250;blicas ser&#225; el anfitri&#243;n de un debate en
l&#237;nea sobre el Informe de ciudadan&#237;a corporativa.

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) emiti&#243; hoy su Informe de ciudadan&#237;a
corporativa de 2008, que detalla las medidas para mejorar el desempe&#241;o
ambiental, econ&#243;mico y social, mientras proporciona la energ&#237;a para cubrir la
creciente demanda mundial. 

El informe detalla la manera en que ExxonMobil redujo las emisiones de gases de
efecto invernadero, lider&#243; la industria en t&#233;rminos de seguridad de los
trabajadores y prevenci&#243;n de derrames de petr&#243;leo y contribuy&#243; con las econom&#237;as
del mundo con un monto equivalente a m&#225;s de ocho veces sus ingresos (un r&#233;cord
de USD 402.000 millones) a trav&#233;s de grav&#225;menes y compras de bienes y servicios.


"El rol de ExxonMobil es proveer energ&#237;a para mantener y mejorar los niveles de
vida de las personas de todo el mundo y, a la vez, ofrecer una ganancia a los
accionistas", afirma Rex W. Tillerson, presidente y director ejecutivo. "Nos
comprometemos a enfrentar este desaf&#237;o de una manera que refleje nuestra cultura
de integridad y, a la vez, equilibre los elementos de la sostenibilidad: el
crecimiento econ&#243;mico, el desarrollo social y la protecci&#243;n ambiental". 

El informe detalla c&#243;mo ExxonMobil:

* Es el l&#237;der de la industria en seguridad de la fuerza laboral con una
reducci&#243;n del 12% en promedio en la tasa de incidentes que provocan p&#233;rdida de
tiempo cada a&#241;o desde 2000. 
* Redujo las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero directas de sus
operaciones. 
* Invirti&#243; m&#225;s de USD 1.500 millones en los &#250;ltimos 5 a&#241;os para aumentar la

* Logr&#243; eliminar por completo los derrames de los buques marinos operados o
alquilados a largo plazo por ExxonMobil en 2008 y reducir la cantidad de
derrames mayores de un barril en un 60% desde 2001. 
* Fortaleci&#243; la gesti&#243;n corporativa al realzar el rol del director principal. El
director principal tiene la autoridad para convocar y presidir sesiones
ejecutivas de directores no empleados y preside todas las reuniones de
directorio en ausencia del presidente del directorio. El director principal
revisa los temas, la agenda y el programa de la reuni&#243;n de directorio con el
presidente antes de que se comuniquen al directorio, formado por un empleado y
10 personas no empleadas. 
* Proporcion&#243; USD 225 millones en donaciones corporativas mixtas, que incluyen
dinero en efectivo, bienes y servicios en todo el mundo. 
* Utiliz&#243; distintos programas de incentivo y apoyo econ&#243;mico para el desarrollo
de la capacidad, que se conocen en conjunto como desarrollo de contenido
nacional. En Angola, por ejemplo, ExxonMobil mejor&#243; la capacidad local a trav&#233;s
del desarrollo comercial y gastos en bienes y servicios locales que alcanzaron
un total de USD 1.500 millones.

&lt;p&gt;2008 Corporate Citizenship Report Details Industry Leading Results

* ExxonMobil leads the industry in workforce safety. 
* ExxonMobil reduces greenhouse gas emissions. 
* Vice President of Public Affairs to host online discussion of Corporate
Citizenship Report.

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) today issued its 2008 Corporate Citizenship
Report detailing actions to improve environmental, economic and social
performance, while providing energy to meet the worlds` growing demand. 

The report details how ExxonMobil reduced greenhouse gas emissions, led the
industry in worker safety and oil-spill prevention, and contributed more than
eight times its earnings -- a record $402 billion -- to economies around the
world through taxes and purchases of goods and services. 

"ExxonMobil`s role is to provide energy to sustain and improve standards of
living for people worldwide while delivering a return to our shareholders," said
Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer. "We are committed to
taking on this challenge in a manner that reflects our own culture of integrity
while balancing the components of sustainability - economic growth, social
development and environmental protection." 

The report details how ExxonMobil:

* Leads the industry in workforce safety with a 12 percent reduction in
lost-time incident rate on average, each year since 2000. 
* Reduced direct greenhouse gas emissions from its operations. 
* Invested more than $1.5 billion in the past five years to increase energy
efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
* Achieved zero spills from ExxonMobil-operated and long-term chartered marine
vessels in 2008 and reduced the number of spills greater than one barrel by 60
percent since 2001. 
* Strengthened corporate governance by enhancing the role of the presiding
director. The presiding director has the authority to call and chair executive
sessions of non-employee directors, and chairs all board meetings in the absence
of the chairman. The presiding director reviews board meeting topics, agendas
and schedules with the chairman prior to distribution to the board, which
consists of one employee and 10 non-employees. 
* Provided $225 million in combined corporate giving in the form of cash, goods
and services worldwide. 
* Employed a variety of economic support and incentive programs for capacity
building - collectively referred to as national content development. In Angola
for example, ExxonMobil enhanced local capacity through business development and
expenditures on local goods and services which totaled $1.5 billion.

In a new initiative this year, ExxonMobil invited a group of experts in
non-financial reporting and corporate citizenship to review and provide feedback
on the reporting process. The panel provided guidance and comments which
reinforced the effectiveness of the ExxonMobil reporting process in addressing a
wide range of challenging issues. The panel also provided feedback on areas for
future improvement, such as the inclusion of a more detailed description of
future action plans and broader discussion of the challenges faced in balancing
the drivers of sustainability. 

"In all areas of corporate citizenship, we listen to others in order to
understand different perspectives, to regularly assess our progress, and to know
where we need to improve," Tillerson said. "While proud of our achievements in
2008 we are not complacent. That is why we retain a relentless focus on all key
indicators of our performance." 

To underscore the importance of community engagement as a critical component of
good corporate citizenship, Ken Cohen, ExxonMobil`s vice president of Public
Affairs will be available for an online web chat to answer questions about
ExxonMobil`s 2008 Corporate Citizenship Report. The online discussion will take
place at 2:30 pm, Central Time on Friday, June 5 at Live Q on the
washingtonpost.com. Questions can be submitted live during the event or in the
lead up to the event.

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day

stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
Merck &amp; Co. (NYSE: MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), Schering-Plough Corp

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

J Mounts Remicade Challenge

In a Schedule 14A proxy statement filed on May 20, 2009 Merck &amp; Co. (NYSE: MRK)
disclosed that it had received notification from Johnson &amp; Johnson`s (NYSE: JNJ)
Centocor subsidiary of its intention to terminate, through arbitration, the
distribution agreement with Schering-Plough Corp (NYSE: SGP) for Remicade and
golimumab (Simponi). As we detailed in prior reports and blogs, we had expected
some sort of challenge from J, so the recent news comes as no surprise. 

In March 2009 Merck and Co. and Schering-Plough announced a merger agreement
whereby the companies would combine in a deal currently valued at approximately
$48.8 billion. The deal was structured as a "reverse-merger" with
Schering-Plough being the surviving entity. Merck believes that the
"reverse-merger" structure will avoid triggering a change-of-control provision
in Schering-Plough`s agreement with J relative to rights to Remicade and
golimumab. 

J discovered both compounds and licensed ex-U.S. marketing rights to
Schering-Plough. If it was deemed that there indeed was a change of control of
Schering-Plough, J would have the right to reclaim 100% of the rights to both
compounds. 

Coke Goes "Green" with New Bottle

The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) has introduced a new plastic bottle which is
partially made from renewable, recyclable, plant-based plastic. The PlantBottle
is more environmentally-friendly version of the traditional petroleum-based PET
plastic bottle. Ultimately, Coca-Cola hopes to have bottles that are 100%
recyclable and renewable. 

The PlantBottle is made from a blend of petroleum-based materials and up to 30%
plant-based materials, which are derived from the by-products of sugar
production, specifically sugar cane and molasses. Also, the manufacturing
process using the plant-based materials reduces carbon emissions by up to 25%
compared with the petroleum-based PET manufacturing process. 

Also, a major retailer is utilizing its Power as a Buyer. Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:
WMT) has introduced a packaging scorecard, which rates suppliers on the
environmentally-friendliness of their packaging. Many food and beverage
companies are being influenced by this retailer`s moral suasion by reducing the
size of packages and making the packages more environmental friendly.

&lt;p&gt;SOFIA May 22 (Reuters) - Bulgaria and U.S. company IBM
(IBM.N) signed an agreement on Friday to develop nano
technologies -- shrinking manufacturing to the molecular level
-- in the Balkan country, as part of Bulgaria's drive to boost
competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Earlier this year, the Bulgarian government decided to set
up a nanotechnology research centre with capital of 50 million
levs ($35.26 million) -- the first of its kind in central and
eastern Europe, it said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nano-scale technologies, 100,000 times smaller than the
width of a human hair, are now used in hundreds of ordinary
items from car fuel lines, bed sheets, cosmetics and even
sunscreens, where tiny zinc oxide particles are used to absorb
dangerous UV light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nano technologies are fast evolving into a
multi-million-dollar market around the globe, with research
stretching from diamond production to use in food and health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "IBM will play a key role in assisting Bulgaria in the
development of this centre and ... will provide know-how
equipment and an overall know-how to make this project
successful," said Marcelo Lema, IBM's manager for Central and
Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM, the world's second-largest software maker, is also a
leader in nanotechnology research and holds more than 10,000
patents in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Bulgarian-based centre will focus on the research and
development of nano- and micro-machines and nano materials, the
government's statement said, but did not give details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The global economic crisis has put an end to Bulgaria's boom
years of credit growth and foreign investment mainly in real
estate, construction and related financial services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government now wants to make the European Union newcomer
attractive for the development of high technologies.

to drill the well at the Jetta prospect later this year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate said "limited quantities

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney is readying a relaunch of the 1986 sci-fi adventure movie "Flight of the Navigator." It has hired "Wild Hogs" scribe Brad Copeland to write the remake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original movie told the story of a 12-year-old boy (Joey Cramer) who is abducted by an alien spacecraft in 1978 and reappears eight years later, still the same age and with no memory of what happened. NASA scientists discover a connection between the boy and a downed spacecraft and try to exploit the boy, who ultimately escapes with the ship and attempts to reunite with his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The movie, which also featured Sarah Jessica Parker and Paul Reubens, grossed only $17 million theatrically, but was later rediscovered on VHS, becoming a cult hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Dean Goodman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Eve of Showdown At Annual Meeting, Letter Explains How Management Puts Out
False and Misleading Information

Former Sen. Sam Nunn Cited for Failing to Listen to Concerns
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Chevron`s management and Board of Directors are failing to adequately discharge
their fiduciary duties relating to a potential $27 billion liability in Ecuador
for environmental damage caused by Texaco when it operated an oil concession in
the Amazon from 1964 to 1990, the environmental group Amazon Watch charged today
in an open letter to the company`s shareholders. 

For a copy of the letter, please see
http://chevrontoxico.com/assets/docs/AW_letter_to_shareholders_May_2009.pdf

The six-page letter asserts that Chevron`s management is providing "false,
misleading, and incomplete" information about the Ecuador liability in its
public filings and that Chevron`s Board of Directors is "passive" and had shown
no inclination to independently vet management`s handling of the enormous
Ecuador liability. 

"Shareholders should realize that Chevron`s massive liability in Ecuador can be
placed squarely on the failings of its management and Board of Directors to
discharge their fiduciary duties," said Atossa Soltani, the executive director
of Amazon Watch, based in San Francisco. 

The letter also charges that Chevron never adequately vetted Texaco before it
purchased the company in 2001 for $31 billion, or just $4 billion more than its
current financial exposure in Ecuador. "If this liability holds up, it will be
clear Chevron`s management overpaid for Texaco by billions of dollars and
thereby diminished shareholder value through its own negligence," Soltani said. 

Chevron`s management is expected to be confronted Wednesday by leaders from
Ecuador`s Amazon over the Ecuador issue, said Mitch Anderson, who has monitored
the trial for the organization. Attending the shareholder`s meeting will be an
indigenous leader whose people are severely impacted by oil pollution left by
Texaco, which used a variety of sub-standard practices in Ecuador that had been
prohibited at the time in the U.S. 

Chevron is charged in the 15-year lawsuit with dumping more than 18 billion
gallons of toxic waste into Amazon waterways and abandoning more than 900
unlined waste pits covering an area the size of Rhode Island. The pollution has
caused a spike in cancer rates and decimated the cultures of various indigenous
groups in the area, according to the lawsuit. 

The letter asks Chevron`s shareholders to consider various examples of what
Amazon Watch calls Chevron management`s failings in reference to the company`s
potential Ecuador liability:

* Chevron has failed to disclose to the SEC that it is under a fraud
investigation by the New York State Attorney General to determine if it is
misleading shareholders about the Ecuador liability. In it own letter to
shareholders filed last week with the SEC, Chevron omitted this critical fact.
The New York statute used to investigation Chevron for fraud can potentially be
used to bring both civil and criminal charges. 
* There is increasing evidence that Chevron`s Board of Directors never
adequately vetted its purchase in 2001 of Texaco for the environmental liability
in Ecuador, even though it had been warned at its 2001 annual meeting - before
the merger was approved -- that it would face a large liability for Texaco`s
dumping of toxic waste. 
* Chevron`s Board is shirking its fiduciary duties by failing to independently
assess management`s handling of the Ecuador matter, which could amount to the
largest civil judgment in history. Not a single member of Chevron`s Board has
visited Ecuador to conduct a firsthand inspection of the damage and the court
process and there is no evidence the Board has sought information independent of
management - the same flawed information that prompted the Cuomo investigation. 
* Chevron`s open letter to shareholders, dated May 20 and signed by corporate
secretary Lydia Beebe, contains numerous assertions that are false, misleading,
or incomplete.

"It is becoming increasingly evident that Chevron`s Board is asleep at the
switch," said Kevin Koenig, who is on the Amazon Watch staff in Ecuador. "There
is no evidence at all they have done anything meaningful to challenge company
management over what is clearly a gathering storm called Ecuador." 

Koenig cited as an example the fact that former Senator Sam Nunn, who heads the
Chevron Board`s policy committee, refused to meet with several shareholders who
had toured the Ecuador disaster. 

The Amazon Watch letter urged shareholders to vote for a resolution that would
require management to assess Chevron`s compliance with the environmental laws in
countries where it operates. The resolution, sponsored by several large public
pension funds, stems from Texaco`s clear failure to comply with Ecuador`s
environmental laws when it operated in that country, said Koenig. 

An independent, court-appointed team of experts assessed damages at up to $27
billion. The total includes approximately $9 billion to cover an estimated 1,401
deaths from cancer related to oil contamination, according to the experts. 

Chevron has vowed to appeal any adverse judgment, while representatives of the
Amazon communities have said they intend to seek enforcement of any court
decision on damages immediately given Chevron`s abuse of various laws and court
proceedings in an effort to delay the trial. The letter emphasizes that any
court judgment in Ecuador against Chevron will be enforceable in countries where
the company has assets. 

The legal case was filed in 1993 in U.S. federal court and transferred to
Ecuador at Chevron`s request. The company at the time filed 14 expert affidavits
praising Ecuador`s courts as fair and adequate, although in recent months - as
the evidence turned against it -- Chevron began to attack the court process as
biased. 

Evidence at trial demonstrates that 100% of Texaco`s former oil production sites
in Ecuador are highly contaminated with cancer-causing toxins, according to a
team of independent experts appointed by the court to assess damages.

&lt;p&gt;LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigerian militants launched their first major strike against the oil industry since the start of a 10-day old military offensive late on Sunday, bombing a Chevron (CVX.N) pipeline and shutting 100,000 barrels per day of output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds comment from military, paragraph 3) LAGOS, May 25 (Reuters) - Nigeria's main militant group said on Monday it had attacked major oil pipelines in the Niger Delta in order to prevent five flow stations feeding a facility operated by U.S. firm Chevron (CVX.N) from functioning. The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) said in an emailed statement the attacks had affected flow stations at Alero Creek, Otunana, Abiteye, Makaraba and Dibi feeding a Chevron facility in Delta state. Colonel Rabe Abubakar, spokesman for the military taskforce in the Niger Delta, said he could not confirm any such attacks. Nigerian state oil firm NNPC and Chevron also had no immediate confirmation. At about 0200 (GMT) today, fighters from MEND destroyed major trunk lines to effectively put ... flow stations that feed the Chevron tank farm located in Delta state out of operation, the statement said. The military began its biggest offensive for years 10 days ago, bombarding militant camps around Warri in Delta state from the air and sea and sending three battalions of soldiers to hunt down rebels believed to have fled into surrounding communities. MEND repeatedly warned of new attacks on the oil industry in response but its threats had so far failed to materialise. Production had continued and global oil markets had last week largely shrugged off the unrest. The security forces say they destroyed rebel camps in the Chanomi Creek area around Warri and that they are now in control of the ground in the surrounding creeks. But industry and security sources say it is virtually impossible to fully protect hundreds of kilometres of pipeline running through remote and largely unpopulated areas, leaving the industry exposed to hit-and-run guerrilla attacks.(For full Reuters Africa coverage and to have your say on the top issues, visit: af.reuters.com/ )   (Reporting by Nick Tattersall)

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 26 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) plans
to launch a new version of its Zune portable media player later
this year in the United States, incorporating high-definition
video, touch screen technology and Wi-Fi connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said on Tuesday the new Zune, its answer to Apple
Inc's (AAPL.O) popular iPod digital music player, will also
come with an Internet browser and a built-in HD radio receiver
that offers higher-quality sound than traditional radio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It did not give a price or a specific date except to say it
was due in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company added new features to Zune's music service last
year, enabling users to download music wirelessly and buy songs
they hear on the device's built-in FM radio.

&lt;p&gt;PERTH May 27 (Reuters) - Caltex Australia Ltd (CTX.AX),
the country's largest refiner, will buy ExxonMobil Corp's
(XOM.N) petrol service stations in Australia for about A$300
million ($233.6 million), Caltex said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The two firms have agreed the sale of Exxon's retail fuels
business, comprising 302 service stations mostly located along
Australia's populous east coast, Caltex said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No Mobil sites are being acquired in Western Australia,
Tasmania or the Northern Territory states, Caltex said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caltex said the acquisition cost includes estimates for
inventories and other settlement costs, and added that it would
take on more than  1,700 staff under this deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The acquisition is a good strategic fit for Caltex. It
will enable Caltex to grow its business consistent with its
long-term strategy of being a marketing-led business," Caltex
Managing Director Des King said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon said in a separate statement it was now a relatively
small player in the fuels retail market after recent
consolidation. It described the sector as "highly competitive
and challenging".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "By selling Mobil's retail business as a going concern we
are endeavouring to preserve jobs for most of those employed in
this business," Paul Real, fuels director of Exxon's Australian
unit, said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon said the proposed transaction did not affect its oil
and gas production operations in Australia and its refining,
chemicals and wholesale marketing business would also stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal is subject to approvals by the Australian
Competition and Consumer Commission and the Foreign Investment
Review Board review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caltex said it expected the transaction to take about a
year to complete.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON May 27 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) has earmarked $3
billion to finance so-called smart infrastructure projects in
Europe and Asia likely to receive government stimulus support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The move, announced on Wednesday, follows a similar
announcement of $2 billion the computer consulting and
technology company is making available in the United States as
it seeks to win business for which government funds may not
immediately be forthcoming. [ID:nN29246083]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM Global Financing had $36 billion tied up in projects as
of end-2008, in the form of measures like project and
commercial financing and asset leasing in the public and
private sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its most recent push comes as other infrastructure
providers such as telecommunications equipment suppliers
Ericsson (ERICb.ST) and ZTE (0763.HK) are increasingly
providing vendor financing for cash-strapped customers amid
global recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM is now offering low interest rates, deferred payments
and structured credit for projects such as the development of
congestion-charge schemes in inner urban areas, or
health-information technology, as well as for smaller
ventures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The financing is also available for non-IBM products and
services, where they are part of projects in which IBM
technology is involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The $3 billion is split between $2 billion for Europe and
$1 billion for Asia-Pacific. The $2 billion previously
announced for the United States will also be extended to
Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These stimulus projects and other government projects for
more sustainable industries are a huge opportunity for us," IBM
Global Financing's head of marketing, Nick Gallop, told Reuters
by telephone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Government funding, with the best will in the world ...
takes time. we can make decisions rapidly now and let companies
get started," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We can use financing to make things much more affordable
and bring forward the break-even point of the project."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 26 (Reuters) - A proposed shift in the way
U.S. commercial mortgage bonds are rated could dent the impact
of a Federal Reserve plan to stabilize the U.S. real estate
market, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Rating company Standard  Poor's on Tuesday said changing
its ratings model would likely result in downgrades to 90
percent of the best commercial mortgage-backed securities made
in 2007, when underwriting standards were at their loosest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP's announcement surprised investors who have been buying
the top, "AAA" rated CMBS since March on expectations that the
bonds carry enough protection against rising defaults, and
after the Fed included the securities in a program to renew
lending in the sector ailing from a dearth of credit and the
U.S. recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Fed expanded its Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan
Facility, or TALF, this month to encourage investors to
purchase bonds from the $700 billion CMBS market that are
weighing down bank balance sheets and hindering credit. The
program, under which investors obtain Fed financing for the
debt, was limited to "AAA" rated bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is fairly remarkable to us that SP's announcement
would be released one week after terms for TALF for legacy CMBS
were released, especially given the fairly extensive lead time
a methodology change like this requires, JPMorgan analysts said
in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP said the revisions as planned could also lead it to cut
ratings on about 25 percent and 60 percent of the most-senior
parts of CMBS issued in 2005 and 2006, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said it appears that a bond downgraded from "AAA"
would be ineligible for TALF, but noted the Fed could modify
rules to include CMBS that initially carried the top rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analysts said the Fed's efforts to restart lending in
the commercial real estate market could be at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Ultimately, in the unlikely case in which investors'
confidence fades, liquidity abates and investors begin to
'panic' sell, TALF for new issue CMBS would suffer as well,"
the analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indexes tied to "AAA" rated CMBS dropped nearly 5 points,
countering a recent rally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP said it will issue a follow-up report after evaluating
the impact of its proposed changes on all CMBS.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'AA' rating to Pfizer Inc.'s (Pfizer) proposed
public issuance of senior unsecured Euro- and Pound-based notes comprising four
tranches. 

The debt offering comprises four-year, seven-year, and 12-year Euro-denominated
notes as well as 29-year Pound-based notes. Proceeds from the senior unsecured
debt are expected to be used for general corporate purposes and to partially
finance the acquisition of Wyeth. Pfizer's credit ratings are as follows. 

--Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'AA'; 

--Senior unsecured debt rating 'AA'; 

--Bank loan rating 'AA'; 

--Short-term IDR of 'F1+'; 

--Commercial paper 'F1+'. 

Fitch placed Pfizer on Rating Watch Negative on Jan. 26, 2009. 

Pfizer's credit profile will be pressured by the incremental debt used to
complete the Wyeth transaction. Fitch will utilize the new information
pertaining to the tenure of the new debt and clarification of Pfizer's plans to
address the higher leverage in the intermediate term to finalize the rating
level. Preliminary calculations using pro forma financials, excluding synergies,
puts total debt leverage around 1.75 times (x) and net debt leverage at 0.80x at
closing, which is expected in the third or fourth quarter. 

Pfizer stated that annual synergies totaling around $4 billion would be targeted
for three years after the completion of the transaction. The deal synergies are
incremental to ongoing cost efficiency programs at Pfizer and Wyeth.
Additionally, the company halved its dividend to $0.16 per share, saving over $4
billion of cash annually. Wyeth's product portfolio, strongly centered on
biologics and vaccines, does not significantly overlap Pfizer's offerings,
increasing the probability of anti-trust clearance of the acquisition. 

Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on
the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com. Published ratings, criteria and
methodologies are available from this site, at all times. Fitch's code of
conduct, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, affiliate firewall, compliance

&lt;p&gt;Oppenheimer Warns Ecuador Problem Could "Depress" Chevron Stock; RiskMetrics
Urges Greater "Transparency" From Oil Giant
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
In another setback to Chevron management, a leading investment advisory group is
urging the oil giant to disclose more details of a potential $27 billion
environmental liability in Ecuador just before what is expected to be a major
showdown on the issue at the annual shareholder`s meeting May 27th in
California. 

The statement by RiskMetrics follows the announcement of a probe by the New York
State Attorney General, Andrew Cuomo, to determine if Chevron is misleading
investors about the liability, which concerns the clean-up of what experts
believe is the worst oil-related contamination on the planet. The case is on
trial in Ecuador at Chevron`s request after it was initially filed in 1993 in
federal court in New York by an estimated 30,000 rainforest residents. 

Further, analysts at both Barclay`s and Oppenheimer are now warning Chevron
investors about the Ecuador liability in their recent quarterly reports on the
company. Oppenheimer, in a report dated May 4th, said the $27 billion claim from
Ecuador "could depress the stock until a settlement is reached&#8230; the sooner this
is removed, the better off shareholders will be." Barclay`s called the Ecuador
case a "drag" on Chevron`s stock value. 

"The pressure is increasing on Chevron`s management over the uncertainty
surrounding a very significant potential environmental liability in Ecuador,"
said Dan Orlow, an investment advisor who works on the legal team that
represents the Amazonian communities. 

The lawsuit accuses Texaco (now Chevron) of dumping more than 18 billion gallons
of toxic "water of formation" into Amazon waterways and abandoning more than 900
toxic waste pits, which continue to leach hydrocarbons into rivers and
groundwater. A court-appointed team of 15 experts found that 1,401 people had
died of cancer and assessed damages, including a clean-up of a 1,700 sq. mile
area, at $27 billion. 

RiskMetrics, which provides risk management and corporate governance services to
investors, published a review of a shareholder resolution calling on Chevron to
examine whether it complies with host country laws and environmental
regulations. The resolution, which is being supported by some of the nation`s
largest pension funds, stems from criticism that Chevron violated such laws in
Ecuador. 

RiskMetrics urged shareholders to vote against the resolution, calling it too
burdensome to implement. But its analysis also contained a warning for the
company about disclosure. 

RiskMetrics stated that "it is noteworthy that [Chevron] has not made public the
amount, estimated to be $27 billion, that it may be liable to pay upon the
verdict of the Ecuadorian courts, nor any information as to how the company
plans to manage the possible outcome. It would be beneficial for the company to
increase its disclosure &#8230; and provide further details and transparency to
shareholders relating to its obligation of liability in the countries where it
operates, especially in light of recent developments regarding the company`s
liability in Ecuador." 

Public pension funds supporting the resolution on Ecuador include CaLPERS, the
largest public pension fund in the country with $170 billion in assets, and
those of New York State, Maryland, Pennsylvania and the cities of New York,
Philadelphia and Detroit. Together they own well over $1 billion in Chevron
stock. 

If the Ecuadorian judge accepts the damages assessment, it could be the largest
judgment in history for an environmental case and would almost surpass the $31
billion Chevron paid to purchase Texaco in 2001. 

Despite the specificity of the damages claim, Chevron claims in its public
filings with the SEC that it is unable to estimate a potential loss in the
Ecuador case. The company also said it believes it is not subject to the
jurisdiction of Ecuador`s courts, despite voluntarily submitting to the
jurisdiction in Ecuador as a condition of the case being transferred out of U.S.
federal court in 2002. 

"We believe there are multiple misleading or demonstrably false statements in
Chevron`s public filings that contradict facts in the trial record," said Pablo
Fajardo, the lead Ecuadorian lawyer on the legal case. "Chevron not only needs
more disclosure, Chevron needs to offer truthful disclosure which it has yet to
do based on our assessment." 

The Cuomo investigation is being brought under New York`s Martin Act, which
allows for both civil and criminal liability for fraud. Several New York
shareholders had requested the probe to determine if Chevron is complying with
state and federal securities laws. 

Separately, leaders from Ecuador`s Amazon region are expected to attend the
shareholder`s meeting and confront Chevron CEO David O`Reilly over the company`s
allegedly misleading assertions about Ecuador.

&lt;p&gt;New Questions Relating to Chevron`s Lack of Financial Disclosure of $27 Billion
Liability

Two Rainforest Residents to Confront CEO
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
A growing number of shareholders are challenging Chevron CEO and Board Chairman
David O`Reilly`s management and oversight of the environmental and human rights
policies of the nation`s third largest company at a Chevron shareholders`
meeting this week. At the meeting, shareholders will vote on a resolution that
requires Chevron to report on its environmental and human rights policies in the
company`s host countries, including Ecuador. Introduced by the New York pension
funds - the state`s Common Retirement Fund and the Employees Retirement System
of New York City - the resolution has gained support in recent days from
CalPERS, the nation`s largest pension fund, and other groups. The New York and
California pension funds control more than $1 billion of Chevron stock. Other
public pension funds that have announced their support of the resolution include
those of Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and the pension funds of
firefighters and police in Detroit and other large cities. Funds from three
large unions -- the AFL-CIO, Teamsters, and AFSCME -- have announced their
support of the resolution along with several smaller private funds, such as the
Trillium Asset Management in Boston and 36 institutional investors affiliated
with the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, led by the Wisconsin
Province of the Society of Jesus. 

This type of resolution is not likely to be approved given the control of
company management over a significant amount of the voting shares. However, the
growing support for the resolution among large institutional shareholders is
considered a major victory for shareholders interested in raising awareness
about environmental and human rights issues. 

Shareholders, along with several financial analysts, also have questioned
Chevron`s lack of financial disclosure, prompting New York Attorney General
Andrew Cuomo to launch a fraud investigation into whether Chevron has provided
accurate information and/or withheld material information from shareholders.
Financial analysts from Risk Metrics, Proxy Governance, Potomac Research, and
Oppenheimer also have raised concerns about disclosure and the potential
liability. See these links for additional information:

The Ecuador liability, featured earlier this month on 60 Minutes in an
unflattering report for Chevron, stems from the dumping by Texaco (now Chevron)
of billions of gallons of toxic waste in the rainforest when it operated an oil
concession from 1964 to 1990. Thousands of rainforest residents have been
fighting a legal battle against the company for clean-up since 1993.

&lt;p&gt; (adds guidance)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON May 26 (Reuters) - U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer
Inc. (PFE.N) has set guidance on a planned benchmark-sized
four-part bond, denominated in euros and sterling, that will
help finance its purchase of Wyeth WYE.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guidance on the four-year euro bond has been set at
mid-swaps plus 120 to 130 basis points, mid-swaps plus 155 to
165 basis points for the seven-year euro bond and mid-swaps plus
195-205 basis points for the 12-year euro bond, one of the banks
managing the deal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guidance on the 29-year sterling bond has been set at gilts
plus 195 to 205 basis points, the bank added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In March, Pfizer sold $13.5 billion of senior notes in a
five-part deal in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sale also follows recent mammoth bond deals from rivals

&lt;p&gt;Ziegfeld Theatre Among First of NEC Customers to Upgrade
SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
NEC Corporation of America, a premier provider of IT, network and identity
management solutions, today unveiled the new NEC NC2500S-A digital cinema
projector. As Hollywood studios begin requiring a higher level of brightness for
3D movie releases, NEC is the only provider to offer all pre-existing customers
this new feature in their current models with a simple upgrade. The
world-renowned Ziegfeld Theatre will be among the first of NEC`s customers to
embrace these new projectors. 

The NEC NC2500S-A`s new technical enhancement allows 3D content to utilize the
full 2K resolution of the 1.2" DMD from Texas Instruments using triple flash
technology for smooth motion. With an increase in resolution and brightness of
up to 33 percent, compared to previous generations, the boost in performance
means a greater viewing experience for theatergoers. 

"We are pleased that Clearview's legendary Ziegfeld Theatre will be one of the
first theatres to install NEC's new digital cinema projectors-which will debut
in time for the opening of Disney's latest 3D release, Up," said Doug Oines,
senior vice president and general manager for Clearview Cinemas. "Clearview is
committed to providing moviegoers with the best viewing experience and the
stunning image quality produced by NEC's projectors is another way for us to do
just that." 

The exhibitors can now display content on larger screens to bigger audiences
than ever before. Current NEC DLP cinema projector customers will be able to
make this upgrade easily and in the field. NEC is offering this service to
customers through both NEC factory engineers or through factory training
provided to the exhibitor and independent service engineers, allowing for a
flexible transition to the new NEC NC2500S-A projector. All digital cinema 3D
technologies will benefit from this upgrade. 

"NEC continues to push the limits of its digital cinema technology with the
continued promise to provide theater owners and their patrons with the very best
on-screen images," said Jim Reisteter, general manager, Digital Cinema Division,
NEC Corporation of America. "Placing the first production models in one of the
most prestigious screening theatres in the country was a given for us, and we
are so pleased with the reaction from their senior executives and are excited to
bring theater goers an even better viewing experience." 

The NEC NC2500S-A projector is available immediately for upgrade or purchase.

&lt;p&gt;-- Certeon to Showcase Real-Life Examples of How aCelera Optimizes IBM Rational
Application Performance over the WAN --
BURLINGTON, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Certeon, the first and only software-based application acceleration and WAN
optimization solution for software configuration management environments, today
announced that Charles Kraus, Senior Director of Business Development for
Certeon, will speak at the 2009 IBM Rational Conference on June 4, 2009 in
Orlando, Fla. 

On Thursday, June 4th, Mr. Kraus will present a session on optimizing Wide Area
Networks (WAN) performance for IBM Rational applications. Using real-life
performance test results and customer case studies, this session will discuss
how Certeon's aCelera application acceleration software cost-effectively reduces
IBM Rational ClearCase and ClearQuest transaction times over the WAN by as much
as 95%. 

In addition, this presentation will discuss Certeon`s Ready for IBM Rational
Software Validation effort, as well as data collected from customer evaluations.
These customer case studies show how aCelera can dramatically improve IBM
Rational developer productivity over the WAN with rapid ROI-saving over 60% in
capital and operational TCO. 

Attendees of the IBM Rational Software Conference 2009 will learn about the
solutions to drive measurable business differentiation while lowering the cost
of software and systems delivery. The 2009 conference will run from May 31 -
June 4, 2009 at the Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin Resort in Orlando,
Florida. Certeon will also be exhibiting and demonstrating its aCelera solution
at the conference in Booth #607. 

Certeon's aCelera Virtual Appliance with Application Acceleration Blueprint for
IBM Rational significantly reduces ClearCase and ClearQuest application response
time over the WAN, enabling a more reliable, real-time, and high-performance
remote development capability. Critical ClearCase and ClearQuest transactions
such as load and update view can take multiple minutes to complete with typical
WAN latencies. With Certeon aCelera virtual appliance software, users can reduce
the response time of these transactions to mere seconds. The improvement in
network bandwidth performance and IBM Rational application responsiveness cuts
down on time-consuming and costly time-outs while waiting for large documents to
synchronize. Remote source control management becomes more efficient and
reliable, increasing developers' productivity. 

About Certeon

Certeon`s aCelera software is the first and only application acceleration
virtual appliance to deliver acceleration, virtualization, and manageability
when remotely accessing applications throughout a distributed enterprise.
aCelera software reduces application response time over the WAN by more than 95
percent without proprietary hardware appliances. aCelera is optimized for
mission-critical applications such as: application virtualization and
management, software configuration management, enterprise content management,
Web-based collaboration, and wide area file services. aCelera is flexible and
easy to deploy, delivering faster, more scalable application acceleration to
more users. Certeon enables distributed enterprises to dramatically reduce their
TCO and gain a faster ROI when compared to proprietary hardware appliances.

&lt;p&gt;Paves Way for Expanded Distribution of "Campbell`s" Products in Russia
CAMDEN, N.J.--(Business Wire)--
Campbell Soup Company (NYSE:CPB) today announced it has entered into a
long-termagreement with Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company S.A. for the
distribution of "Campbell`s Domashnaya Klassika" (Campbell`s Home Classics)
concentrated broth and other soup products in Russia. 

Douglas R. Conant, Campbell`s President and Chief Executive Officer, said,
"Establishing a long-term distribution partnership with Coca-Cola Hellenic, the
largest distributor in Russia, is an important step in unlocking the potential
of the Russian soup market for Campbell. The emerging markets of Russia and
China both represent a significant growth opportunity in the business that
Campbell knows more fully than any other company in the world. These markets
will play an increasingly important role in Campbell`s future as we gain
momentum in our key areas of focus." 

Under the terms of the agreement, Campbell will be responsible for consumer and
market research, brand management, marketing, product development and
production. Coca-Cola Hellenic will be responsible for distribution, sales,
in-store marketing and trade receivables. 

Financial terms were not disclosed. 

Coca-Cola Hellenic is currently distributing "Campbell`s Domashnaya Klassika"
products in the Moscow region and in August 2009 plans to expand distribution to
over 100 cities and 12 regions of Russia, with further nationwide distribution
to follow. 

Larry McWilliams, President, Campbell International, said, "Coca-Cola Hellenic
has a world-class distribution network in Russia and its other markets,
unmatched by any other distributor. Working with Coca-Cola Hellenic, we will be
able to accelerate distribution throughout Russia, expanding more quickly into
additional markets." 

Coca-Cola Hellenic is Russia`s largest distributor and seller of beverages and
is responsible for managing the sales and distribution of an extensive range of
brands of The Coca-Cola Company and other brands. The company operates 14 plants
with distribution centers located across the country. 

Chris Delaney, President of Campbell`s Emerging Markets, added, "Campbell and
Coca-Cola Hellenic share a vision and belief in the opportunity to develop a
large commercial soup business throughout Russia. We look forward to working
together to build one of the world's great soup businesses in this market." 

Campbell entered the Russian market in 2007, launching in the Moscow region,
which has a population of approximately 17 million. Along with its parallel
launch in China, the Russian initiative is part of Campbell`s strategy to expand
the availability of its products in new geographies. 

Soup consumption in Russia is more than double that of the United States, where
U.S. consumers eat approximately 14billion soup servings per year. In Russia,
nearly 32 billion servings are consumed each year, or approximately 230 servings
per capita, which are still predominately homemade, making Russia the world`s
second largest soup consuming market after China. 

Campbell currently offers four varieties of its "Domashnaya Klassika" broth
products: Chicken, beef, mushroom and beef &amp; mushroom. Packaged in portable
pouches bearing Campbell`s iconic red and white branding, these high-quality
concentrated broths contain chunks of chicken, beef and mushroom, with
vegetables. Campbell developed these broths to meet Russian consumers` high
standards, while dramatically reducing the time it takes to prepare soup from
scratch. 

Campbell has additional distribution agreements with The Coca-Cola Company and
other bottlers of The Coca-Cola Company`s products, notably one supporting its
single-serve refrigerated beverage business in North America and another with
Swire Pacific for distribution of "Swanson" broth in China.

&lt;p&gt;
COSTA MESA, Calif., May 26, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Emulex Corporation
(NYSE:ELX) today announced that its LightPulse(r) 8Gb/s Fibre Channel CIOv
Expansion Card is optimized for use with IBM's new BladeCenter HS22 Blades.
Using the Emulex LPe1205-CIOv (IBM part number 46M6140), IBM can offer blade
server users dramatically increased dual-channel I/O throughput and CPU
efficiency, translating into increased performance and reduced power
consumption.

"Blade server popularity is a -- if not the -- key factor driving data center
evolution, and Emulex is at the forefront, providing connectivity solutions that
support these next-generation IT environments," said Steve Daheb, chief
marketing officer and senior vice president of business development, Emulex. "By
leveraging our 8Gb/s Fibre Channel adapter technology for its new HS22 Blade,
IBM can provide customers with higher bandwidth, throughput and scalability
needed to effectively and efficiently manage their blade server environments."

Emulex 8Gb/s Fibre Channel HBAs feature enterprise scalability and flexibility
through support for Message-Signaled Interrupts eXtended (MSI-X), offering end
users greater CPU efficiency, reduced system latency and improved I/O throughput
-- all of which contribute to increased blade server performance and reduced
power consumption in the HS22 Blade. Additional key features and benefits of
leveraging Emulex technology for IBM's new BladeCenter solutions include:

 * The Emulex LPe1205-CIOv utilizes the CIOv slot on HS22 -- the
   preferred slot for optimal scalability and performance in storage
   area network (SAN) infrastructures -- and does not require the
   added cost and complexity of a Multi-Switch Interconnect Module
   (MSIM) for IBM BladeCenter.
 * The expansion card is also optimized for use with the Intel(r)
   Xeon(r) processor 5500 series, which is installed on all IBM HS22
   Blades. To maximize I/O bandwidth, data center servers based on the
   Intel Xeon processor 5500 series can leverage the Emulex LPe12000
   family of 8Gb/s Fibre Channel HBAs to achieve the highest
   dual-channel I/O throughput and CPU efficiency, translating into
   increased performance and reduced power consumption.
 * Emulex HBAs extend across the wide range of operating systems that
   IBM offers -- including Windows, Linux, and VMware -- thereby
   lowering administrative costs and speeding server deployment.

&lt;p&gt;
ALISO VIEJO, Calif., May 26, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Continuing to execute
along a fast-paced trajectory to expand its industry lead in intelligent
converged networking technologies, QLogic Corp. (Nasdaq:QLGC), a leading
supplier of high performance network infrastructure solutions, today announced
IBM (NYSE:IBM) is the first tier-one system vendor to integrate QLogic's new
single chip 8100 Series converged network adapters (CNAs) for native Fibre
Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) connectivity in IBM's mainstream server portfolio.

Specifically, IBM will offer native FCoE connectivity on all IBM rack and tower
series servers, including the new Intel Xeon 5500 "Nehalem"-powered BladeCenter
and System x offerings, providing the latest in enterprise data center
connectivity options to its customers while significantly lowering power
consumption and heat dissipation across the enterprise. Optimized for blade
servers and high-density storage systems, the QLogic 8100 Series CNAs support
simultaneous storage and data networking traffic at full 10GbE line speeds,
consume only one third the power of existing CNA chip sets and are the only CNAs
on the market to completely eliminate the need for a heat sink. With today's
announcement, IBM is enabling customers to leverage the ubiquity and economics
of Ethernet while preserving the investment and strengths of Fibre Channel.

"In a period of less than 60 days, QLogic announced the availability of a next
generation, single chip CNA and announced a tier one server design win, further
capitalizing on its first mover advantage in delivering production-ready FCoE
technology," said Bob Laliberte, analyst, Enterprise Strategy Group. "As the
FCoE market develops, securing key vendor design wins and go-to-market channels
will be critical to establishing market leadership and accelerating adoption of
FCoE technology. As evidenced by this announcement, QLogic is setting the pace."

According to Dell'Oro Group, FCoE adapter revenue is expected to increase, on
average, by over 200 percent annually from 2008 to 2013 reaching nearly $400M.
"FCoE port shipments are expected to increase by an average of 300 percent
annually, reaching nearly 2 million ports shipped during the same timeframe,"
said Seamus Crehan, vice president, Dell'Oro Group.

"The new IBM BladeCenter HS22 servers represent the confluence of multiple
emerging technologies driving advances in the data center," said Alex Yost, vice
president, IBM Systems &amp; Technology Group. "The QLogic 8100 Series CNAs
complement the new generation technology by offloading all FCoE protocol
processing to the adapter, freeing up CPU cycles for even faster application
performance and increased server Virtual Machine (VM) support. With this
generation of no compromise IBM BladeCenter servers, customers can benefit from
highly virtualized systems with record levels of performance and scalability and
more flexible provisioning of enterprise resources through a single 10GbE
network."

As part of today's news, QLogic also announced the new QLogic 10Gb Converged
Enhanced Ethernet (CEE) high-speed Pass-thru Module, which provides 14
non-blocking connections between CNAs installed on IBM BladeCenter servers and
external 10GbE or 10G CEE switches and devices. The QLogic 8100 Series CNAs
provide the foundation for network convergence and work in concert with the new
QLogic 10Gb CEE Pass-thru Module to provide a complete, integrated connectivity
solution for IBM BladeCenter systems.

The QLogic 10Gb CEE Pass-thru Module is the most cost-effective way to introduce
CEE outside an IBM BladeCenter server. The module translates internal 10 Gigabit
Media Independent Interface (XAUI) connections on up to 14 CNA-enabled servers
to external SFP+ optical media ports, suitable for direct attachment to new CEE
and FCoE devices as well as to existing 10GbE LANs. Line rate connectivity is
provided without the expense or management requirements of other approaches,
enabling customers to begin their network convergence at the server level with
minimal infrastructure investment elsewhere.

"With today's announcement coming so closely on the heels of the introduction of
its breakthrough Network Plus Architecture, QLogic has just delivered a one-two
punch to its competitors," said Tom Trainer, president and founder of storage
research consultancy Analytico, Inc. "Owning your own silicon has its distinct
advantages, such as getting a product to market first and gaining market
traction much more rapidly than others trying to integrate components from
multiple suppliers."

"When it comes to delivering converged networks and advances in computing, IBM
is elevating the stature of its servers to an entirely new stratum in the data
center," said Scott Genereux, senior vice president, Worldwide Sales and
Marketing, QLogic. "The company's ability to integrate single chip FCoE
technology so rapidly across its server portfolio is an example of its seamless
product adaptability and business model flexibility. We look forward to
continuing to collaborate with IBM on converged networking solutions for its
blade servers and high-density storage systems."

"Support of native FCoE connectivity by a leading server supplier is another key
step in the adoption of converged networks," said David Vellante, co-founder and
principal contributor to Wikibon.org, a professional community of IT
practitioners. "The business case for FCoE is compelling as it utilizes the
network more efficiently and provides any-to-any connectivity by leveraging
existing SAN infrastructure and lowering network management costs."

Both the QLogic 8100 Series CNAs and Pass-Thru Modules can be used with other
products in the IBM FCoE and CEE product portfolio, including other pass-thru
modules and CNAs, respectively, to provide customers with complete flexibility
and interoperability -- and products based entirely on open standards.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Passlogix Inc. announced today that it has been named Microsoft`s UK Emerging
Identity Partner of the Year for its ability to equip enterprises with a
complete identity and access management (IAM) package integrating Microsoft`s
IAM products with Passlogix`s own v-GO Access Accelerator Suite. The combined
solution has been utilized in six projects in the UK to date, providing a
comprehensive strategy for management of digital identities. 

The v-GO Access Accelerator Suite is an integrated set of sign-on,
authentication and provisioning enablement solutions that includes the market`s
most widely adopted solution for enterprise single sign-on (ESSO). The suite
also offers the industry`s first ESSO-based solution for managing shared
passwords, the ability to provide strong authentication to applications,
desktops and networks without expensive custom integration, and a variety of
other components that help organizations improve productivity, security and
regulatory-related user access controls. 

Microsoft Identity Lifecycle Manager (ILM), Microsoft`s primary IAM platform, is
an integrated suite of products for managing the entire lifecycle of user
identities and their associated credentials, including identity synchronization,
certificate and password management, and user provisioning. Microsoft`s IAM
offerings also include associated solutions such as Microsoft Intelligent Access
Gateway (IAG), a VPN solution that provides secure remote access to corporate
applications for remote employees and business partners. 

Together, products from the two companies provide an end-to-end solution for
identity management for the extended enterprise. The v-GO On Demand Edition, for
example, extends single sign-on to remote, mobile and temporary users from any
location without the need to install any software, making it a natural
integration partner for the Microsoft IAG VPN solution while also completing the
IAG`s web single sign-on capabilities. 

"Passlogix has established partnerships with other leading identity and access
management vendors, but a year ago, they had no Microsoft identity and access
practice. Today, they offer a complete IAM solution utilizing our technologies,"
said Bruce Lynn, Head of UK Server Business Group, Microsoft UK. "This promises
to be a strong ongoing relationship that will provide a seamless IAM package for
enterprises of all sizes." 

"Identity and access management is a critical issue for organizations from both
an operational and a regulatory point of view. The more pieces of the total
solution that can be provided from a single source, the better in terms of
speed, reliability and accountability," said Sean Harris, Vice President of
Business Development, Passlogix. "Our work with Microsoft in the UK offers these
benefits and provides a dependable resource for enterprises that are upgrading
older IAM systems or launching new IAM initiatives." 

About Passlogix

Passlogix, Inc., is the developer of the v-GO Access Accelerator Suite, the
leading solution set for speeding user access to applications throughout the
extended enterprise by eliminating critical pain points in sign-on, provisioning
and authentication processes. With more than 15 million licenses sold, the v-GO
suite improves business efficiency, strengthens security and compliance, and
dramatically reduces IDM system deployment times. The company's patented
technology - launched in 1996 with the market's first usable enterprise single
sign-on solution - shortens implementation and payback cycles by adapting to any
existing infrastructure without the need for custom coding or replacing legacy
hardware or software. Passlogix is headquartered in New York City with offices
throughout the United States, United Kingdom, France and Asia. For more

&lt;p&gt;$9B in Chevron Shares Ended Up Defying Company Management
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
In the days ahead of its annual meeting, Chevron`s management engaged in a
fierce and unconventional lobbying campaign to convince shareholders to defeat a
shareholder resolution over the company`s potential $27 billion liability in
Ecuador but investors holding $9 billion in Chevron shares voted for it anyway,
officials with the environmental group Amazon Watch said today. 

The lobbying campaign apparently worked on one level, as the oil company
reported today the resolution received less than 10% support. But it failed on
another level, in that the resolution galvanized a record number of public
pension funds and investors that control more than $9 billion of Chevron stock
to challenge Chevron CEO David O`Reilly. 

"Chevron`s intense lobbying effort to defeat the resolution actually played into
the hands of shareholders in that it raised the profile of the resolution," said
Mitch Anderson, who works on corporate accountability issues for Amazon Watch, a
San Francisco-based environmental group. 

Anderson also said the result - 7% support - is a "victory" for backers of the
resolution given the "millions of dollars of resources" spent by Chevron on its
lobbying campaign and that the fact $9 billion in Chevron shares voted for it
because of the Ecuador liability. It was also clear that Chevron was calling
funds that had announced their support for the resolution to try to convince
them to change their stance. 

"Chevron has been working on this intensively for the last several days, which
is a sort of a sad commentary on the extent to which Chevron management is
threatened by shareholders," he said, noting that the SEC turned down an attempt
by Chevron to keep the resolution from even coming to a vote. 

The shareholder resolution relating to Ecuador, which called on Chevron to
examine whether it complies with host country laws and environmental
regulations, notes the Ecuadorian litigation in its recital section and was
filed by shareholders concerned about the outstanding liability. One other
resolution relating to Chevron`s human rights problems that mentioned the
Ecuador problem garnered more than 28% support, but Chevron`s management did not
actively lobby against it. 

Chevron faces a potential litigation liability of $27 billion in connection to a
landmark environmental lawsuit alleging that Texaco, which Chevron purchased in
2001, used substandard oil-extraction practices in Ecuador from 1964-1990. The
case, which is being heard in Ecuador at Chevron`s request, is expected to be
decided by the end of the year. 

Chevron has publicly stated that the company expects a significant adverse
judgment in the near future. 

Over recent days, Chevron issued a three page letter to shareholders denouncing
shareholder concerns as the result of a campaign by trial lawyers, rather than a
genuine concern about management`s handling of the Ecuador issue. Shelley Alpern
of Trillium Asset Management, a firm which co-sponsored the resolution,
responded to Chevron`s allegations by saying that the company is "trying to
shoot the messenger. The way they have handled the problem...has left them with
a black eye." 

The resolution was supported by the some of the nation`s largest pension funds,
including CalPERS, New York State, Maryland, Pennsylvania and the cities of New
York, Philadelphia and Detroit. The sovereign fund of the Netherlands also voted
in favor. 

"Chevron`s aggressive tactics are exactly the desperate, panicky maneuvers that
you see a company make when they are attempting to cover up a massive
liability," said Anderson. 

The company, which was facing five separate shareholder resolutions, had not
made similar lobbying efforts on any other resolution, despite the fact that
other resolutions would likely impose a far greater financial burden on the
company.

&lt;p&gt;Refuses to Let Board Members Answer Own Questions As Conflict of Interest
Becomes Evident
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Several large investors blasted Chevron CEO David O`Reilly today at the
company`s annual meeting for mishandling a potential $27 billion liability in
Ecuador, while O`Reilly left open the possibility he would visit Ecuador to
inspect the damage personally after being invited by a well-known local
community leader. 

In a display of control, O`Reilly refused to let Chevron`s Board members answer
their own questions about whether they had independently vetted O`Reilly`s
handling of the Ecuador matter, which has been the subject of withering
criticism this week from industry analysts, shareholders and journalists. 

Atossa Soltani, the executive director of the environmental advocacy group
Amazon Watch, asked Chevron`s Board members to explain what, if anything, they
had done to ascertain the truth about Ecuador independent of information given
them from O`Reilly and his management team. There have been charges that
Chevron`s legal department is misleading shareholders about the Ecuador suit in
its public filings, prompting a probe by New York State Attorney General Andrew
Cuomo that could impose both civil and criminal liability on the company. 

O`Reilly refused to let any Board member answer Soltani`s question
--underscoring a criticism made by her this week in an open letter to Chevron
shareholders that the company`s Board is "passive" and failing to discharge its
fiduciary duties. 

"It is clear O`Reilly rules Chevron`s Board with an iron fist to inoculate him
and other top Chevron officials from any independent critique of their
mishandling of the Ecuador matter," Soltani said after the meeting. "O`Reilly
has a conflict of interest being CEO and Chairman of the Board, and that was
clearly evident today." 

"There is no evidence that Chevron`s Board has done anything meaningful to
challenge Chevron management as it goes off the rails and continues to mislead
shareholders about its responsibility for a humanitarian crisis of epic
proportions," she added. 

Pat Doherty, a representative of several New York City pension funds that
control roughly $280 million of Chevron stock, told O`Reilly that Chevron`s
human rights problems in Ecuador, Nigeria, and Burma "threaten shareholder
value" and that it is clear the company has no "exit strategy" as regards
Ecuador. He also differed with O`Reilly on his attempt to blame the company`s
legal woes in Ecuador on the country`s President, Rafael Correa. 

Chevron has launched a multi-million dollar lobbying campaign in Washington
"punish" Ecuador`s government for letting its own citizens bring suit against
Chevron. 

"Chevron`s current strategy of attempting to demonize the democratically elected
government of Ecuador makes no sense to us and ultimately will prove to be
self-defeating," Doherty warned. 

Shelly Alpern, a representative of a private fund in Boston called Trillium
Asset Management, said in reference to Ecuador: "We believe that this is a sad
state of affairs that the [Chevron] Board is so lacking in independence and
accountability." 

Luis Yanza, who is leading the effort by 80 indigenous and farmer communities to
hold Chevron accountable in court, emphasized how there is no evidence any top
Chevron manager, Board Member, or corporate officer had visited Ecuador to see
firsthand the enormous damage done by Texaco when it operated a large oil filed
in the country from 1964 to 1990. Yanza invited O`Reilly to visit the area at
his invitation. 

O`Reilly at first ignored the invitation, but a few minutes later another
shareholder insisted he answer Yanza. O`Reilly then said he would consider it
and come with an answer within six months. 

Also speaking was Ermegildo Criollo, a leader of the Cofan indigenous group in
Ecuador that is facing extinction if the oil damage is not cleaned up. Criollo
explained how the toxic waste discharged by Texaco had decimated the traditional
lifestyle of the Cofan, who now could not use the rainforest and have no access
to clean water. 

The lawsuit charges that Texaco (now Chevron) dumped billions of gallons of
toxic waste into Amazon waterways and abandoned over 900 unlined waste pits
carved out of the jungle floor, leading to a spike in cancer rates the
decimation of the traditional lifestyles of indigenous groups.

&lt;p&gt;NICE Decision Expands Treatment Choices for Patients
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc said today that the United Kingdom`s National Institute for Health
and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has issued its final appraisal document (FAD)
recommending reimbursement for Sutent (sunitinib malate) as a second-line
treatment for patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). This
recommendation follows NICE`s recently published guidance recommending
reimbursement for Sutent for the first-line treatment of advanced kidney cancer.


The guidance states that Sutent is recommended for reimbursement as a treatment
option for patients with advanced GIST after disease progression on or
intolerance to imatinib mesylate, and who have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.* According to NICE, "the benefits
seen in time to tumor progression and progression free survival were such that a
substantial improvement in overall survival with sunitinib treatment was
probable." 

"NICE`s decision gives hope to patients with GIST who develop resistance to
imatinib," said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, senior vice president, clinical development
and medical affairs, Pfizer`s Oncology Business Unit. "Insights into the
causative pathways involved with cancers like GIST will help us bring Sutent to
the right patient at the right time." 

NICE`s decision was based on data from a pivotal Phase 3 trial of Sutent
compared with placebo in patients with advanced GIST. Sutent increased time to
tumor progression in the study by almost five months (6.4 weeks vs. 27.3 weeks,
P &lt;0.0001). Following these early findings, 84 percent of patients receiving
placebo switched to Sutent treatment. Updated analyses of this trial
demonstrated a median overall survival of 73.9 weeks for Sutent patients vs.
64.9 weeks for those initially receiving placebo (P = 0.161). However, according
to an exploratory analysis calculating what the difference may have been if the
patients had remained on placebo, estimated overall survival for Sutent patients
was 73.9 weeks, compared to 35 weeks for those receiving placebo. 

"It`s a terrible thing to have to tell a patient with terminal cancer that a
treatment is no longer working for them, their cancer is growing again and there
are no other treatments available," said Dr. Beatrice Seddon, consultant
clinical oncologist, University College London Hospitals. "Before the arrival of
sunitinib, this was the situation for people with advanced GIST in the U.K.
NICE`s decision today means that finally, we have something else to offer our
patients, and with it the hope of extra time and quality life with their
families and loved ones." 

Sutent has played an important role in re-shaping the treatment landscape for
GIST and advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), two historically
difficult-to-treat cancers. The benefit/risk profile of Sutent has been
well-established through large, randomized clinical trials evaluating the safety
and efficacy in both second-line GIST and first-line advanced RCC. To date,
approximately 50,500 patients globally have been treated with Sutent. 

NICE, the independent organization responsible for issuing guidance for drug
reimbursement to the British National Health Service, plans to publish final
guidance in July, which will then be implemented by the local funding bodies in
England and Wales. 

About Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor

Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is found in the gastrointestinal (GI)
tract and belongs to a group of rare cancers called soft tissue sarcomas.
Sarcomas begin in muscle, fat, fibrous tissue, blood vessels, or other
supporting tissue of the body. Advanced GIST affects approximately 90 to 150
people in the U.K. each year, with an annual worldwide incidence of
approximately 1.5 cases per 100,000 persons. 

Important SUTENT&#174; (sunitinib malate) Safety Information

Women of child bearing age who are (or become) pregnant during therapy should be
informed of the potential for fetal harm while on SUTENT. 

Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below the lower limit
of normal (LLN) have been observed. Patients with concomitant cardiac conditions
should be carefully monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of congestive
heart failure. 

Patients should be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with
standard antihypertensive therapy. CBCs with platelet count and serum
chemistries should be performed at the beginning of each treatment cycle for
patients receiving treatment with SUTENT. 

The most common adverse reactions in clinical trials were fatigue, asthenia,
diarrhea, nausea, mucositis/stomatitis, vomiting, dyspensia, abdominal pain,
constipation, hypertension, rash, hand-foot syndrome, skin discoloration,
altered taste, anorexia and bleeding.

&lt;p&gt; * Bond to work from UK as global head
 (Adds further details about prime brokerage business in sixth
paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Steve Eder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 27 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley (MS.N) has
hired Martine Bond, JPMorgan Chase  Co's (JPM.N) global head
of foreign exchange prime brokerage, and three key members of
her team, a person familiar with the appointments said on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The additions are part of a wider expansion of Morgan
Stanley's foreign exchange prime brokerage team, which provides
clearing and other services for hedge funds' currency trading
activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The team is set to double in size in the next year from its
current 15-20 members, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley, whose prime brokerage was hit with a wave
of defections last fall following the Lehman Brothers
bankruptcy filing, declined to comment, as did JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has since seen some of those customers return and said
in April that the balances of its top 50 prime brokerage
accounts increased 10 percent in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though it deals with hedge funds, the foreign exchange
prime brokerage business sits inside Morgan Stanley's foreign
exchange department and not within the main prime brokerage
unit that was hit by the counterparty concerns last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source said Bond -- slated to start working after a
3-month leave typically required by employment contracts in the
securities industry -- will work from the UK under the title of
global head of foreign exchange prime brokerage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three of her vice presidents from JPMorgan will join her,
including two in New York and one in the UK, said the source,
who declined to release the other names since they were not
department heads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bond will report to that division's COO, Todd Miller, who
in return reports to Steve Mettler, Morgan Stanley's global
head of foreign exchange and emerging markets.

&lt;p&gt;$9B in Chevron Shares Ended Up Defying Company Management
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
In the days ahead of its annual meeting, Chevron`s management engaged in a
fierce and unconventional lobbying campaign to convince shareholders to defeat a
shareholder resolution over the company`s potential $27 billion liability in
Ecuador but investors holding $9 billion in Chevron shares voted for it anyway,
officials with the environmental group Amazon Watch said today. 

The lobbying campaign apparently worked on one level, as the oil company
reported today the resolution received less than 10% support. But it failed on
another level, in that the resolution galvanized a record number of public
pension funds and investors that control more than $9 billion of Chevron stock
to challenge Chevron CEO David O`Reilly. 

"Chevron`s intense lobbying effort to defeat the resolution actually played into
the hands of shareholders in that it raised the profile of the resolution," said
Mitch Anderson, who works on corporate accountability issues for Amazon Watch, a
San Francisco-based environmental group. 

Anderson also said the result - 7% support - is a "victory" for backers of the
resolution given the "millions of dollars of resources" spent by Chevron on its
lobbying campaign and that the fact $9 billion in Chevron shares voted for it
because of the Ecuador liability. It was also clear that Chevron was calling
funds that had announced their support for the resolution to try to convince
them to change their stance. 

"Chevron has been working on this intensively for the last several days, which
is a sort of a sad commentary on the extent to which Chevron management is
threatened by shareholders," he said, noting that the SEC turned down an attempt
by Chevron to keep the resolution from even coming to a vote. 

The shareholder resolution relating to Ecuador, which called on Chevron to
examine whether it complies with host country laws and environmental
regulations, notes the Ecuadorian litigation in its recital section and was
filed by shareholders concerned about the outstanding liability. One other
resolution relating to Chevron`s human rights problems that mentioned the
Ecuador problem garnered more than 28% support, but Chevron`s management did not
actively lobby against it. 

Chevron faces a potential litigation liability of $27 billion in connection to a
landmark environmental lawsuit alleging that Texaco, which Chevron purchased in
2001, used substandard oil-extraction practices in Ecuador from 1964-1990. The
case, which is being heard in Ecuador at Chevron`s request, is expected to be
decided by the end of the year. 

Chevron has publicly stated that the company expects a significant adverse
judgment in the near future. 

Over recent days, Chevron issued a three page letter to shareholders denouncing
shareholder concerns as the result of a campaign by trial lawyers, rather than a
genuine concern about management`s handling of the Ecuador issue. Shelley Alpern
of Trillium Asset Management, a firm which co-sponsored the resolution,
responded to Chevron`s allegations by saying that the company is "trying to
shoot the messenger. The way they have handled the problem...has left them with
a black eye." 

The resolution was supported by the some of the nation`s largest pension funds,
including CalPERS, New York State, Maryland, Pennsylvania and the cities of New
York, Philadelphia and Detroit. The sovereign fund of the Netherlands also voted
in favor. 

"Chevron`s aggressive tactics are exactly the desperate, panicky maneuvers that
you see a company make when they are attempting to cover up a massive
liability," said Anderson. 

The company, which was facing five separate shareholder resolutions, had not
made similar lobbying efforts on any other resolution, despite the fact that
other resolutions would likely impose a far greater financial burden on the
company.

&lt;p&gt;CARLSBAD, California (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc CEO Carol Bartz said any deal to spin off or combine its Internet search assets will require a partner with "boatloads of money," and her company is talking "a little bit" with Microsoft Corp about a potential partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the All Things Digital conference on Wednesday, Bartz said the company's array of popular Web products, including Yahoo mail and its home page, remain the key assets that will return Yahoo to growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since taking the CEO job, Bartz has moved swiftly to revamp the company, cutting jobs, shuttering certain products and reorganizing the management structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bartz said the company would like to hold on and even increase its roughly 20 percent share of the U.S. Internet search market, but it was not necessary for Yahoo's success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are positioned as a place where people come to be informed; not just informed through a search, but informed through great content, with great editorial and great integration and a very local feel," Bartz said at the conference taking place north of San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo is the No.2 player in the search market, behind Google Inc, which had a roughly 64 percent share of the U.S. search market in April, according to comScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bartz, 60, took the reins at Yahoo in January, replacing co-founder Jerry Yang in the wake of Yahoo's rejection of a $47.5 billion acquisition bid from software giant Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo and Microsoft have recently talked about various partnerships, possibly with Microsoft managing Yahoo's search advertising business and Yahoo handling display ads across Microsoft's websites, according to a source familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if the talks between Yahoo and Microsoft about an Internet search deal continue, Bartz replied "a little bit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bartz said any deal combining its search efforts with another company would have to meet a specific set of criteria for Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's two parties in all this. The other party has to have a boatload of money and the right technology, and give us the right data and so forth. It's that simple," said Bartz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the No.3 player in the U.S. Internet search market, is expected to provide details about improvements to its search engine at the conference on Thursday when CEO Steve Ballmer takes the stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo earned $118 million in the first quarter, while its sales declined 13 percent year-over-year to $1.58 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the challenging economic conditions, Bartz said she believes the company is performing strongly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bartz said on Wednesday that the new organizational structure, which she said makes the management and reporting hierarchies more clear within the company, will help Yahoo infuse its products with personalization and social media features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo is adding social networking features such as status updates to its various properties. Last week, CEO Ari Blalogh said the company was also interested in acquiring outside companies to bolster its social efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo is facing increased competition from social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook. On Tuesday, Facebook, which has 200 million active users, announced it had received $200 million in funding from a Russian Internet investment firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bartz said the company's core online properties can provide an Internet experience for Web surfers that Facebook cannot match, by providing a one-stop shop for people to read the news, check their stock portfolio and take care of other online tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And she stressed Yahoo's various online products remain some of the most popular on the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo has a 76 percent reach among U.S. Internet users, said Bartz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic; Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

conference taking place north of San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo is the No.2 player in the search market, behind
Google Inc (GOOG.O), which had a roughly 64 percent share of
the U.S. search market in April, according to comScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bartz, 60, took the reins at Yahoo in January, replacing
co-founder Jerry Yang in the wake of Yahoo's rejection of a
$47.5 billion acquisition bid from software giant Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo and Microsoft have recently talked about various
partnerships, possibly with Microsoft managing Yahoo's search
advertising business and Yahoo handling display ads across
Microsoft's websites, according to a source familiar with the
situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asked if the talks between Yahoo and Microsoft about an
Internet search deal continue, Bartz replied "a little bit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bartz said any deal combining its search efforts with
another company would have to meet a specific set of criteria
for Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's two parties in all this. The other party has to
have a boatload of money and the right technology, and give us
the right data and so forth. It's that simple," said Bartz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, the No.3 player in the U.S. Internet search
market, is expected to provide details about improvements to
its search engine at the conference on Thursday when CEO Steve
Ballmer takes the stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo earned $118 million in the first quarter, while its
sales declined 13 percent year-over-year to $1.58 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Given the challenging economic conditions, Bartz said she
believes the company is performing strongly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bartz said on Wednesday that the new organizational
structure, which she said makes the management and reporting
hierarchies more clear within the company, will help Yahoo
infuse its products with personalization and social media
features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo is adding social networking features such as status
updates to its various properties. Last week, CEO Ari Blalogh
said the company was also interested in acquiring outside
companies to bolster its social efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo is facing increased competition from social
networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook. On Tuesday,
Facebook, which has 200 million active users, announced it had
received $200 million in funding from a Russian Internet
investment firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bartz said the company's core online properties can provide
an Internet experience for Web surfers that Facebook cannot
match, by providing a one-stop shop for people to read the
news, check their stock portfolio and take care of other online
tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And she stressed Yahoo's various online products remain
some of the most popular on the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo has a 76 percent reach among U.S. Internet users,
said Bartz.

&lt;p&gt;Refuses to Let Board Members Answer Own Questions As Conflict of Interest
Becomes Evident
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Several large investors blasted Chevron CEO David O`Reilly today at the
company`s annual meeting for mishandling a potential $27 billion liability in
Ecuador, while O`Reilly left open the possibility he would visit Ecuador to
inspect the damage personally after being invited by a well-known local
community leader. 

In a display of control, O`Reilly refused to let Chevron`s Board members answer
their own questions about whether they had independently vetted O`Reilly`s
handling of the Ecuador matter, which has been the subject of withering
criticism this week from industry analysts, shareholders and journalists. 

Atossa Soltani, the executive director of the environmental advocacy group
Amazon Watch, asked Chevron`s Board members to explain what, if anything, they
had done to ascertain the truth about Ecuador independent of information given
them from O`Reilly and his management team. There have been charges that
Chevron`s legal department is misleading shareholders about the Ecuador suit in
its public filings, prompting a probe by New York State Attorney General Andrew
Cuomo that could impose both civil and criminal liability on the company. 

O`Reilly refused to let any Board member answer Soltani`s question
--underscoring a criticism made by her this week in an open letter to Chevron
shareholders that the company`s Board is "passive" and failing to discharge its
fiduciary duties. 

"It is clear O`Reilly rules Chevron`s Board with an iron fist to inoculate him
and other top Chevron officials from any independent critique of their
mishandling of the Ecuador matter," Soltani said after the meeting. "O`Reilly
has a conflict of interest being CEO and Chairman of the Board, and that was
clearly evident today." 

"There is no evidence that Chevron`s Board has done anything meaningful to
challenge Chevron management as it goes off the rails and continues to mislead
shareholders about its responsibility for a humanitarian crisis of epic
proportions," she added. 

Pat Doherty, a representative of several New York City pension funds that
control roughly $280 million of Chevron stock, told O`Reilly that Chevron`s
human rights problems in Ecuador, Nigeria, and Burma "threaten shareholder
value" and that it is clear the company has no "exit strategy" as regards
Ecuador. He also differed with O`Reilly on his attempt to blame the company`s
legal woes in Ecuador on the country`s President, Rafael Correa. 

Chevron has launched a multi-million dollar lobbying campaign in Washington
"punish" Ecuador`s government for letting its own citizens bring suit against
Chevron. 

"Chevron`s current strategy of attempting to demonize the democratically elected
government of Ecuador makes no sense to us and ultimately will prove to be
self-defeating," Doherty warned. 

Shelly Alpern, a representative of a private fund in Boston called Trillium
Asset Management, said in reference to Ecuador: "We believe that this is a sad
state of affairs that the [Chevron] Board is so lacking in independence and
accountability." 

Luis Yanza, who is leading the effort by 80 indigenous and farmer communities to
hold Chevron accountable in court, emphasized how there is no evidence any top
Chevron manager, Board Member, or corporate officer had visited Ecuador to see
firsthand the enormous damage done by Texaco when it operated a large oil filed
in the country from 1964 to 1990. Yanza invited O`Reilly to visit the area at
his invitation. 

O`Reilly at first ignored the invitation, but a few minutes later another
shareholder insisted he answer Yanza. O`Reilly then said he would consider it
and come with an answer within six months. 

Also speaking was Ermegildo Criollo, a leader of the Cofan indigenous group in
Ecuador that is facing extinction if the oil damage is not cleaned up. Criollo
explained how the toxic waste discharged by Texaco had decimated the traditional
lifestyle of the Cofan, who now could not use the rainforest and have no access
to clean water. 

The lawsuit charges that Texaco (now Chevron) dumped billions of gallons of
toxic waste into Amazon waterways and abandoned over 900 unlined waste pits
carved out of the jungle floor, leading to a spike in cancer rates the
decimation of the traditional lifestyles of indigenous groups.

five indigenous groups that inhabit Ecuador`s Northern Amazon region. The
mission of the Coalition is to protect the environment and secure social justice
through grass roots organizing, political advocacy, and litigation. Two of its

&lt;p&gt;Veteran of Healthcare Industry to Extend Company`s Popular EHRSolutions to U.S.
Hospitals and Healthcare Organizations
CARLSBAD, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Medsphere Systems Corporation, the leading provider of open source electronic
health records (EHR), today announced the appointment of Walter Groszewski as
vice president of business development. In his 26 years in information
management, sales and consulting, Groszewski has specialized in developing
emerging healthcare and life sciences businesses. As Vice President of Business
Development at Medsphere, Groszewski will secure partnerships with strategic
healthcare organizations and develop new leadership for the changing Health IT
landscape. 

"The interest in electronic health records has never been more intense," said
Groszewski, who started in May. "With patients demanding better care, U.S.
hospitals can no longer delay the adoption of electronic health records. The
U.S. healthcare system could be saving $34 billion a year by using EHRs to
increase efficiency and safety. I am excited to join Medsphere and continue to
set the bar high for U.S. healthcare development." 

From 1984 to 2009, Groszewski worked at IBM as a certified consultant with
extensive project management experience. He was responsible for growing IBM`s
business in the health and human services segment within New York City. Most
recently, Groszewski served as IBM`s global sales executive, successfully
working with global teams and across brands to reach a provider revenue target
of one billion dollars in 2008. Groszewski and his team at IBM achieved a
revenue growth rate approximately three percent faster than the overall
industry. 

"Walter has decades of experience in healthcare and is the right person to keep
our expansion on target," said Michael J. Doyle, president and CEO of Medsphere.
"Walter will make sure that U.S. hospitals and healthcare organizations have
full access to technology for improving patient care. As his track record shows,
Walter is a talented industry veteran who has led the healthcare industry in the
direction best for patients and quality care. " 

Groszewski joins the Medsphere team at a time when the country is focusing more
and more on health technology as a solution to challenges in the U.S. healthcare
system. More than $19 billion in stimulus funds will be available to physicians
and hospitals for health IT adoption as part of the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Also, Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) recently
introduced the Health Information Technology Public Utility Act of 2009,
requiring that open source electronic health records solutions are made
available to all healthcare providers at little or no cost.

&lt;p&gt;SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Record performance in 2008 helped enable Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) to
reward its investors, fund a robust capital program and position the company to
capitalize on the increase in demand for energy that will come with the global
economic recovery, attendees were told today at the company`s 2009 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders. 

"Chevron`s been in business for 130 years through 13 major recessions. It`s no
accident we`re still in business today. We look past the downturns to keep our
focus on long-term growth," said Dave O`Reilly, chairman and CEO. "Eventually,
world economies will grow. Experts say that by 2030 energy demand will increase
as much as 30 to 40 percent. When the world starts growing, it will need all the
energy it can get. Chevron will be there to supply it." 

John Watson, vice chairman of the board, discussed Chevron`s strong 2008
financial performance, which produced earnings of $23.9 billion and a return on
capital employed of nearly 27 percent. The company acquired $8 billion of its
common shares and increased the quarterly dividend by 12 percent, marking 21
consecutive years of annual dividend rate increases. Watson recognized that 2008
was a difficult year for all equities, but said Chevron`s total stockholder
returns averaged nearly 15 percent over the five-year period ending Dec. 31,
2008, and bested the S 500 by 17 percentage points over the same period. 

Watson highlighted that 2008 was the safest year in the company`s history and
one of the best among the industry. He noted that Lloyds Register, an
independent auditor, confirmed that Chevron`s environmental management systems
meet all international standards. Chevron has met its greenhouse gas emission
goals every year since 2004, and is ranked No. 1 among U.S.-based oil and gas
companies and No. 2 worldwide in the 2008 Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index.
The Index lists companies taking best-in-class actions to measure and report
carbon emissions. 

Watson stated that Chevron`s $22.8 billion capital and exploratory expenditure
program for 2009 will fund large, multi-year projects with about 75 percent of
program dollars marked for worldwide crude oil and natural gas exploration and
production projects and 20 percent dedicated to the company`s downstream
business. 

George Kirkland, executive vice president, Global Upstream and Gas, noted that
the company`s upstream position is strong with operations in nearly all of the
world`s key hydrocarbon basins, and a portfolio that is deep and diverse with
11.2 billion barrels of proved reserves and 2.7 million barrels per day of
production capacity. As of 2008, the company had the most competitive cost
structure in the industry. 

Kirkland noted that in 2008 Chevron added more than 1.7 billion barrels and,
since 2002, more than 8.5 billion barrels of oil-equivalent resources to its
portfolio through exploration efforts. Nine major capital projects started up in
2008, demonstrating Chevron`s ability to execute complex projects. The projects
are expected to contribute 350,000 barrels per day in 2009. 

Kirkland also spoke about Chevron`s full queue of 40 major capital projects,
each of which represents a Chevron investment of more than $1 billion. Chevron`s
full inventory includes 93 projects each representing an investment of over $200
million. 

Mike Wirth, executive vice president, Global Downstream, said important
achievements in 2008 included record safety performance, continued investment in
the flexibility of the company`s refining system, and best-ever reliability -
exceeding the company`s commitment to improve utilization of operated refineries
by six percent versus 2005. 

He also noted a continued commitment to improve returns, including exiting
markets that do not align with strategy and selling less profitable assets. In
2008, the company exited more than 20 fuels markets and continued to rationalize
its service station network. It also reduced its lubricant product line by over
40 percent versus 2005 - a move that has helped reduce complexity and costs and
more than triple the profitability of this business. 

Nine proposals were voted on by Chevron stockholders while one proposal was
withdrawn by its proponents. The preliminary report of the Inspector of Election
was as follows:

* Item 1: More than 1.5 billion shares, or 94 percent of the votes cast, were
voted for the 14 nominees for election to the board of directors. 
* Item 2: More than 1.6 billion shares, or 98 percent of the votes cast, were
voted to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the independent
registered public accounting firm. 
* Item 3: 93 percent of the votes cast were voted for the board`s proposal to
approve the material terms of performance goals for the performance-based awards
under the Chevron Incentive Plan. 
* Item 4: 93 percent of the votes cast were voted for the board`s proposal to
approve the material terms of performance goals for the performance-based awards
under the Long-Term Incentive Plan of Chevron Corporation. 
* Item 5: Less than 47 percent of the votes cast were voted for the stockholder
proposal regarding special stockholder meetings. 
* Item 6: Less than 42 percent of the votes cast were voted for the stockholder
proposal regarding an advisory vote on the summary compensation table. 
* Item 7: The stockholder proposal that appeared in the proxy statement
regarding greenhouse gas emissions was withdrawn by its proponents due to
Chevron`s significant progress in developing and deploying a rigorous greenhouse
gas management system. 
* Item 8: Less than 26 percent of the votes cast were voted for the stockholder
proposal regarding a report on country selection guidelines. 
* Item 9: Less than 28 percent of the votes cast were voted for the stockholder
proposal regarding a human rights policy. 
* Item 10: Less than 7 percent of the votes cast were voted for the stockholder
proposal regarding a report on host country laws.

Final voting results will be reported in Chevron`s second quarter 2009 Form
10-Q, which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in early
August and available at www.chevron.com. Specific information about the
proposals before Chevron stockholders this year may be found in the Investor
Relations section of the company`s Web site under Stockholder Services - "Annual
Meeting Materials."

&lt;p&gt;CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Water Innovations Alliance, an industry association promoting accelerated
adoption of water technologies, today announced that IBM joined the
organization`s Foundation board. IBM will also serve as chair of a subcommittee
working on technology platforms, standards and methodologies to enable improved
water management decisions. 

The Alliance launched its Water IT Subcommittee in New York City on May 18,
2009. The one-day event took place in collaboration with Livingston Securities
LLC. 

"Having IBM take a leadership role in this initiative will further our mission
for creating a national smart water grid, and we are pleased to have their
active participation," said F. Mark Modzelewski, Co-Founder and Executive
Director of the Alliance. "It is vital that all the parties - both in the public
and private sectors - come together to create and fund a water information
technology initiative with common platforms, standards and nomenclature." 

"Demand for innovative water-related information technologies is growing
rapidly," said Peter Williams, CTO of IBM Big Green Innovations. "To achieve our
goal of improving water management, we need to collaborate on sensing and
monitoring infrastructures for water resources, a common system for measurement,
evaluation and reporting, as well as common standards. If we come up with an
effective IT management system that leverages the current infrastructure,
filtration, and treatment technologies, we could realize significant annual
water savings." 

Currently, 1.1 billion people lack access to a reliable water supply, and 2.6
billion people lack access to adequate sanitation. By 2025, over half the
world`s population will live in water-stressed or water-scarce countries. One
quarter of global freshwater use exceeds local long-term accessible supplies.
Agricultural uses are the biggest concern, with an estimated 15 to 35 percent of
irrigation withdrawals in excess of sustainable limits. Industrial withdrawals
of water are expected to rise by 55 percent out to the year 2025. In addition,
within the US, population has been migrating from the water-rich North to the
water-depleted sunbelt. Moreover, crumbling infrastructure means that cities
such as Chicago lose upwards of 60 percent of their water in transit from
treatment facilities to faucets. 

"Addressing water quality and management issues are of paramount importance to a
sustainable planet," said oceanographer and Alliance advisor Fabian Cousteau.
"Technological innovation is one of the vehicles that will help get us there." 

The emerging water IT field is focused on aiding the delivery of water from
suppliers to consumers using digital technology to improve decision making, save
energy, reduce cost and increase reliability and safety. The goal of the field
is to create a virtual water "grid" that cuts across all water supplies from
natural ones such as rivers and aquifers, to municipal suppliers, to the impact
of weather patterns.

available at: http://www-03.ibm.com/technology/greeninnovations/

"We were gratified by the quality of speakers and attendees who participated in
our first annual Water Innovations Alliance Conference," noted Vincent Caprio,
Chief Operating Officer of the Alliance. "Based on the success of our premiere,
we plan to co-locate our second event with our NanoBusiness Conference in
Chicago on September 10th, and will return to New York City for another spring
conference on May 17, 2010."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co's (JPM.N) credit card losses will near 9 percent of its card portfolio in the second quarter and might rise even further if unemployment increased, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said, after earlier saying card losses "could" hit that level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. bank is also looking to repay its $25 billion of U.S. government bailout funds "as soon as possible" and hopes to raise its recently lowered dividend as early as late this year "if we're lucky" -- provided conditions improve, Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at a Sanford C. Bernstein conference, Dimon said home lending losses over the next several quarters will be as high as $1.4 billion in home-equity, $500 million in prime mortgage and $375 million to $475 million in subprime mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's investment banking unit seems to be "OK" so far this quarter, Dimon added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan emerged as the top bookrunner to U.S. equity and equity related offerings this year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts believe banks will see better investment banking results in the second quarter, benefiting from their participation in a boom in the U.S. secondary offering activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon still expects the credit card business to lose money every quarter this year, hurt by a slowdown in consumer spending, although the bank's market share could rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent credit card law changes could also cost the company $500 million annually after tax, Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama signed into law on Friday sweeping reforms that restrict credit card interest rates and fees to help recession-weary consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It does make it harder to manage risk," Dimon said. "I think the business will essentially get repriced. It will be slightly smaller."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will likely incur $700 million to $750 million of pretax charges related to the special assessment fee charged by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, either this quarter or in the next couple of quarters, Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said the company is targeting a dividend payout of 30 percent to 40 percent of normalized earnings, but added he wants to see conditions improve before raising the dividend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking separately at the same conference, Discover Financial Services (DFS.N) Chief Executive David Nelms said he expects loan growth to slow in the second half of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nelms also expects the charge-off rate, the percentage of debt the company does not expect to be repaid, to be about 8 percent on a managed basis in the second quarter. In the first quarter, Discover's rate was 6.48 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discover will also continue to set aside more money to cover bad loans, Nelms said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With default rates at record levels, credit card companies are among the victims of an economic crisis that began with the U.S. housing market collapse and which has spread around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares were down 5 cents at $36.48, while Discover was up 1 percent at $8.98 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tenzin Pema and Jonathan Stempel, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;SAN RAMON, Calif. May 27 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N)
shareholders rejected a call for an environmental protection
report on its global operations, disappointing activists and
funds worried by a $27 billion damages claim against the
company in Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The proposal at the U.S. oil company's annual meeting on
Wednesday, which was for a report on the protection of people
and the environment in countries where Chevron operates,
received fewer than 7 percent support from shareholders,
Chevron said, citing preliminary results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron is battling the massive claim over jungle pollution
in Ecuador; and that case, in which a ruling is expected this
year, is among the issues cited by a group of mostly U.S. state
and municipal funds in the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, which says votes on similar issues at past
meetings got support of 8 percent to 10 percent, had criticized
the proposal as part of a campaign led by trial lawyers to
force the company to settle the Ecuador case. [ID:nN20512950]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plaintiffs in the Ecuador case, which has run for a decade

The article, published on Tuesday under the headline "Concerns Grow in
Chevron-Ecuador Suit", quotes a leading oil industry analyst, Fadel Gheit, as
saying the Ecuador case "is a mess in the ground and in public opinion" and has
been "very poorly handled" by Chevron. The $27 billion liability is expected to
be a major topic today at Chevron`s annual meeting, with attention focused on
how Chevron`s Board of Directors had not independently vetted management`s
handling of the matter. 

The lawsuit, being held in Ecuador at Chevron`s request, will determine if
Chevron will be forced to pay for a clean-up of the more than 18 billion gallons
of toxic waste dumped by Texaco (now Chevron) when it operated an oil concession
in the Amazon from 1964 to 1990. A team of court-appointed experts has assessed
damages at up to $27.3 billion and a decision is expected later this year. 

Several scientific experts consider the disaster to be the worst oil-related
contamination on the planet. A team of U.S.-based reviewers found that the
damages number is consistent with the cost of other large environmental
clean-ups around the world. 

Gheit, who works for Oppenheimer, was quoted in reference to Chevron`s Ecuador
liability as saying: "I think the longer it lingers the more it will cost. I
would settle and cut my losses. Time is not on their side. The sooner they
resolve it the better off shareholders are. I don`t think it will cost $27
billion, but [it] will certainly cost a hell of a lot more than $1.8 billion"
that Chevron has set aside for liabilities. 

The article also quoted Barclay`s Capital analyst Paul Cheng as saying, in
reference to the Chevron liability, that "we would expect that any negative
ruling [in Ecuador] would be damaging to the stock`s near-term performance, and
we would be an aggressive buyer to take advantage of any weakness." 

Platt's Oilgram News is widely recognized as the standard publication
chronicling the oil and gas energy sector and its published rates are used as a
benchmark within the industry. The article reported on concerns about Chevron
being raised by the New York attorney general and public and private funds. 

The article quotes a letter sent to Chevron by New York Attorney General Andrew
Cuomo saying "this office has broad authority to investigate and pursue
allegations of financial fraud and material misstatements in connection with
publicly traded companies." Cuomo said he was looking into "Chevron`s
characterization of available legal defenses" and asked Chevron to estimate
"possible damages if found liable &#8230; [and] what if any reserves have been
established in contemplation of such damages being assessed against Chevron." 

The Cuomo investigation is being brought under New York`s Martin Act, which
allows for both civil and criminal liability for fraud. Several New York
shareholders had requested the probe to determine if Chevron is complying with
securities laws. 

Leaders from Ecuador`s Amazon region are expected to attend the shareholder`s
meeting today and confront Chevron CEO David O`Reilly over the company`s
allegedly misleading assertions about Ecuador.

&lt;p&gt;MINNEAPOLIS--(Business Wire)--
U.S. Bank is the first card issuer in the United States to pilot an innovative
new product that allows cardholders to use a single card for traditional
magnetic stripe purchases, Visa&#174; payWave&#174; transactions and to gain access to
secure facilities. 

U.S. Bank is currently piloting the program with employees in Minneapolis. Those
involved in the pilot can make purchases and enter their secure work location
using a U.S. Bank AccelaPay&#174; Visa Card, a prepaid payroll account. The cards
contain the MicroPass 4006 platform consisting of two applications: the Visa
payWave application, which allows for contactless payment at the point of sale,
and the HID&#174; iCLASS&#174; application, which allows for contactless access to secure
facilities at U.S. Bank. 

The use of one card for identification, payments and secure access has the
ability to provide a unique solution to a variety of spaces: government,
university, corporate, health care, transportation and many other institutions.
Universities, for example, would be able to offer faculty and students secure
access to university facilities such as dormitories and laboratories, while also
using the same card as an ID and for purchases. The card will also have the
ability to combine workplace IDs and security access cards with payment cards
providing only one card to employees instead of two. 

"We are always looking for new and innovative ways to improve the overall
experience for our customers and business partners," said Dominic Venturo, chief
innovation officer of U.S. Bank Retail Payment Solutions. "By working with our
business partners, we have been able to bring several technologies together to
simplify the end solution for the cardholder." 

U.S. Bank worked closely with several organizations to create this
multifunctional card:

* CPI Card Group, a global leader in financial and commercial card production
and services, managed the production of the cards for this pilot. 
* HID Global, the trusted, worldwide leader in providing solutions for the
delivery of secure identity, provided the access control readers for the pilot,
as well as the iCLASS technology used within the card. HID handles 80 percent of
the secure access market in the U.S. 
* INSIDE Contactless, the world leader in advanced open-standard contactless
chip technologies, provided their MicroPass&#174; 4006 platform which is powering the
Visa payWave application and the HID iCLASS application of the card. 
* Visa Inc., operating the world`s largest retail electronic payments network
providing processing services and payment product platforms, is the payment
network for the card.

U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB), with $264 billion in assets, is the parent company of
U.S. Bank, the 6th largest commercial bank in the United States. The company
operates 2,847 banking offices and 5,183 ATMs in 24 states, and provides a

&lt;p&gt;Millions of Shareholders Benefit from ExxonMobil`s Disciplined Approach and
Consistent Performance

* ExxonMobil generates industry leading returns in 2008. 
* Company completes start-ups of at 8 major projects which add 260,000 oil
equivalent barrels a day. 
* Company achieves reserves replacement of more than 100 percent of production
for the 15th consecutive year. 
* ExxonMobil to invest between $25 and $30 billion annually over the next 5

DALLAS--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation`s (NYSE:XOM) financial strength and industry-leading
performance continues to provide shareholders with superior value while
delivering energy to fuel economic growth and protecting the environment, the
corporation said today at its Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 

"Despite the volatile economic times, ExxonMobil remains committed to investing
in integrated solutions to the energy challenge," said Rex W. Tillerson,
chairman and chief executive officer. 

"Our disciplined and consistent performance enables us to invest through the
economic cycle and develop new energy supplies while working to improve
efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions." 

Tillerson said the company`s record performance in 2008 has benefited millions
of shareholders who hold ExxonMobil shares either directly or indirectly through
their pension, insurance and mutual funds. Over the past five years, the
corporation`s dividends and share-buyback programs have put approximately $150
billion into the hands of millions of shareholders. 

Tillerson outlined some of the major achievements for 2008, including:

* Start-ups at eight major oil and gas production projects, which at their peak
are expected to add the net equivalent of 260,000 barrels per day to the
company's production. 
* Replacement of more than 100 percent of the company`s production through
proved reserves additions for the 15th consecutive year. 
* Continued growth of exploration acreage, which has increased by about 40
percent since 2003. 
* Generation of a return on average capital employed of 34 percent,
significantly higher than the closest competitor.

During his remarks to shareholders Tillerson outlined the challenge of meeting
growing energy demand while reducing greenhouse emissions. 

"No single energy source available today solves the dual challenge of meeting
growing energy needs while reducing emissions and no single energy source will
solve it tomorrow," Tillerson said. "For now and the foreseeable future, an
integrated set of solutions is required - ranging from producing hydrocarbons
more effectively, to using them more efficiently, to improving existing
alternatives and developing policies that encourage long-term planning and
investments." 

"ExxonMobil is strong, resilient, and well positioned for the future, with plans
to invest between $125 and $150 billion in new energy projects over the next
five years alone," said Tillerson. "Our commitment to developing advanced
technology, our industry-leading operational and project-management capabilities
and exceptional employees continue to position the company as the world leader
in the petroleum industry and a partner of choice for resource owners around the
world." 

Between 2008 and 2015, to offset normal field declines and depletion, ExxonMobil
expects to add approximately 1.5 million oil-equivalent barrels per day of new
capacity through new projects - equivalent to almost 40 percent of current
production. In all, ExxonMobil`s industry-leading portfolio of more than 100
projects is expected to support development of more than 24 billion
oil-equivalent barrels of energy. 

Exxon Mobil Corporation

Globally, Exxon Mobil Corporation is the world's largest publicly quoted oil and
gas company and the world's largest corporation in terms of market
capitalization. Worldwide the company and its subsidiaries produce approximately
4 million oil-equivalent barrels of energy resources every day from some 1600
fields and operate or market products on 6 continents. Exxon Mobil Corporation
is also the world's largest non-government marketer of natural gas and in our
global downstream business the company has interests in 38 refineries in 21
countries and over 32,000 service stations world-wide. 

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT: Projections, expectations and business plans in this
release are forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including capital
expenditures; production rates; project plans, schedules, and outcomes; and
demand growth could differ materially due to changes in market conditions
affecting the oil and gas industry or long-term oil and gas price levels;
political or regulatory developments; reservoir performance; timely completion
of development projects; technical or operating factors; and other factors
discussed in Item 1A of ExxonMobil's most recent Form 10-K and posted in the
Investors section of our website (www.exxonmobil.com). The term "reserves," as
used in this release, includes proven reserves from oil sands operations in
Canada which are currently reported separately as mining operations in our SEC
reports. Reserves referenced in this release also represent the combined total
from both consolidated subsidiaries and our interest in equity companies. See
the "Frequently Used Terms" posted in the Investors section of our website for

&lt;p&gt;May 27 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded Brazil's mining
giant Vale (VALE5.SA) (VALE.N) to "neutral" from "buy" and
removed the stock from its Latin America focus ideas list,
saying the shares seem to be pricing in the expected rebound in
iron ore shipments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Vale has outperformed as a high-quality name in a tough
market, leading to the current premium versus global mining
peers, analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Following the deal between Rio Tinto (RIO.L) (RIO.AX) and
Asian steel mills, we believe Vale could cut its price for
southern system iron ore fines by 27 percent. Vale's current
stock price is discounting only a 22 percent decrease for
2009," the analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the analysts continue to believe that Vale is a
structural winner for the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S.-listed shares of Vale closed at $19.26 Tuesday on the
New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Vale shares have gained 86 percent in the last six months,
while the Dow Jones Titans Basic Resources Index .DJTBAS has
risen only 35 percent during the same period.

&lt;p&gt;New Action Role-Playing Video Game Featuring Open World Exploration and an
Original Story in Development at Propaganda Games
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Live to tell the tale of becoming a notorious pirate captain or suffer a fate of
eternal damnation. Disney Interactive Studios today announced the development of
Pirates of the Caribbean: Armada of the Damned, an epic, action role-playing
game (RPG) from Propaganda Games, Disney`s video game development studio in
Vancouver, British Columbia. 

Armada of the Damned is an entirely new experience within the Pirates of the
Caribbean universe. The game takes place before the events of the blockbuster
films. Players will take on the role of a pirate and embark on epic land and sea
adventures. Numerous moral and character choices will need to be made that
affect their character and the original story within the world. Players will
explore a massive open world while fighting enemies, mystical creatures and
Mother Nature, both to gain experience and stay alive. Supernatural elements
familiar to the Pirates of the Caribbean world will also affect their
character`s story and influence their choices. 

"Armada of the Damned is a dynamic action role-playing game that captures all of
the franchise`s excitement, unpredictability and action while delving into
narrative elements never before explored within this unique universe," said Dan
Tudge, vice president and general manager, Propaganda Games. "Our team`s
collective experience with industry-leading RPGs and action titles provides a
strong foundation for us to create and build a compelling action role-playing
title." 

Armada of the Damned is scheduled to be released in Fall 2010 for
next-generation consoles and Windows PC. 

Armada of the Damned is an extension of the globally successful Pirates of the
Caribbean franchise, which began more than 40 years ago as a theme park
attraction at Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif. The franchise continues to excite
park goers with millions of visitors experiencing the four current theme park
attractions at Disney parks around the world. The three blockbuster films
grossed more than $2.6 billion worldwide in theaters and have continued to be
successful on home video. Disney Interactive Studios has shipped more than 6
million units worldwide of self-published multiplatform Pirates of the Caribbean
video games, which were inspired by the "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man`s
Chest" and "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World`s End" films.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - IBM has earmarked $3 billion to finance so-called smart infrastructure projects in Europe and Asia likely to receive government stimulus support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move, announced on Wednesday, follows a similar announcement of $2 billion the computer consulting and technology company is making available in the United States as it seeks to win business for which government funds may not immediately be forthcoming. [ID:nN29246083]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM Global Financing had $36 billion tied up in projects as of end-2008, in the form of measures like project and commercial financing and asset leasing in the public and private sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its most recent push comes as other infrastructure providers such as telecommunications equipment suppliers Ericsson and ZTE are increasingly providing vendor financing for cash-strapped customers amid global recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is now offering low interest rates, deferred payments and structured credit for projects such as the development of congestion-charge schemes in inner urban areas, or health-information technology, as well as for smaller ventures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financing is also available for non-IBM products and services, where they are part of projects in which IBM technology is involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $3 billion is split between $2 billion for Europe and $1 billion for Asia-Pacific. The $2 billion previously announced for the United States will also be extended to Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These stimulus projects and other government projects for more sustainable industries are a huge opportunity for us," IBM Global Financing's head of marketing, Nick Gallop, told Reuters by telephone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Government funding, with the best will in the world ... takes time. we can make decisions rapidly now and let companies get started," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can use financing to make things much more affordable and bring forward the break-even point of the project."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Die Exxon Mobil Corporation hat heute bekannt gegeben, dass sie mit Weatherford
International Ltd. eine Entwicklungsvereinbarung eingegangen ist, mit dem Ziel,
eine neue Bohrloch-Fertigstellungstechnologie unter dem Namen MazeFloTM zu
entwickeln und zu vermarkten, die das Risiko der Sandproduktion in vielerlei
Anwendungsbereichen abschw&#228;chen soll. 

Gem&#228;&#223; den Bedingungen der Vereinbarung werden die in Houston ans&#228;ssige
ExxonMobil Upstream Research Company und Weatherford zusammenarbeiten, um die
von ExxonMobil patentierte Technologie zur Sandkontrolle kommerziell zu
verwerten. Dabei werden Mehrfachfilter und Scheidew&#228;nde zwischen den einzelnen
Kammern eingesetzt, um die Zuverl&#228;ssigkeit und Nutzungsdauer von &#214;lquellen zu
erh&#246;hen. Die neue Technologie ist darauf ausgerichtet, das Sandaufkommen in
problematischen Abschnitten wahlweise zu begrenzen, w&#228;hrend gleichzeitig die
volle Produktionsleistung in anderen Abschnitten erhalten bleibt. 

&#8222;Die Sandproduktion ist aufgrund der Auswirkungen von unerw&#252;nschtem Sand auf die
Integrit&#228;t der Quellen und die Gesamtproduktion weiterhin ein Problem in der
Branche," sagte Stephen M. Cassiani, President der ExxonMobil Upstream Research
Company. &#8222;MazeFlo ist eine innovative und zuverl&#228;ssige Technologie zur
Sandkontrolle, die darauf ausgerichtet ist, die Risiken der Sandproduktion in
klastischen Lagerst&#228;tten abzuschw&#228;chen. Wir sind zuversichtlich, dass unsere
Zusammenarbeit mit Weatherford sowohl die Herstellungsqualit&#228;t als auch die
zeitgem&#228;&#223;e Vermarktung unserer neuen Technologie sicherstellen wird." 

Die Vereinbarung mit Weatherford umfasst die Konstruktion, Entwicklung und
Herstellung von Sandfilterprototypen f&#252;r die g&#228;ngigen Branchenherausforderungen,
wie z. B. R&#252;ckhaltung von Sand, mechanische Integrit&#228;t und Qualit&#228;tskontrolle.
MazeFlo kann bei Offshore-Quellen und landbasierten Quellen gleicherma&#223;en
eingesetzt werden und erg&#228;nzt die breite Palette von bereits von ExxonMobil
verwendeten, f&#252;hrenden Bohrloch-Fertigstellungstechnologien.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is revamping its search engine to counter the dominance of Google Inc in the Web search and related advertising business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company, which is still in talks with Yahoo Inc over a potential partnership, has long been determined to play a major role in the lucrative Web search market after watching upstart Google take a stranglehold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which has been testing the search engine internally under the name Kumo for several months, plans to introduce the new service, re-christened "Bing," over the next few days, with a full launch next Wednesday. The service will be available at www.bing.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advertising Age reported earlier this week that Microsoft was planning a $80 million to $100 million ad campaign to promote Bing. Microsoft declined to comment on the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll have what I would call a big budget -- big enough that I had to gulp when I approved the budget," said Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer, who unveiled Bing at a technology conference in Carlsbad, California, run by the All Things Digital tech blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based firm has lots of ground to make up. Last month Google took 64.2 percent of U.S. Internet searches -- up half a percentage point from the month before -- handling 9.5 billion out of a total of 14.8 billion searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo was a distant second with 20.4 percent of searches and Microsoft third with 8.2 percent, both down slightly from the month before, according to data firm comScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer offered no quick turnaround in those numbers. "My timeframe is lots of years," he said at the conference. "I don't have a specific forecast, but this is lots of years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new name, Bing, is short, universal and can be "verbed-up," said Ballmer, a clear reference to the fact that 'to Google' has become the generic verb for searching the Internet for information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW FEATURES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Google and Yahoo have recently introduced new features in their search engines to attract users, making Microsoft's task even harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is calling its new product a "decision engine," promising to make things like buying a digital camera, booking a flight or searching for a restaurant easier by serving up results based on similar previous searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A search on a make of car, for example, will bring up clickable categories on the left-hand sidebar, such as 'problems,' 'reviews' and 'dealers,' which Microsoft has calculated are the most likely places a Web user will want to go from the initial search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing also incorporates the increasingly popular Farecast service in its flight booking section -- making use of the company it bought last year -- which predicts whether fares will rise or fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other new features include getting directions to locations with only one mouse click, and the ability to hover over a search result to see more information, without having to open a new link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's shares rose 36 cents to $20.49 on Nasdaq at mid-afternoon. Google edged up 1.1 percent to $409.96 and Yahoo shares rose 1 percent to $15.09.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Additional reporting by Alexei Oreskovic; Editing by Derek Caney, Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Juniper, IBM in talks for OEM deal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Sources say agreement not imminent, may be months away&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Juniper shares up 3.1 pct
(Adds share move, background, byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ritsuko Ando&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 28 (Reuters) - Network equipment maker
Juniper Networks Inc JNPR.O and IBM (IBM.N) are in talks to
step up their sales partnership, but no agreement is imminent,
sources familiar with the situation said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies are considering an OEM (original equipment
manufacturer) deal, in which International Business Machines
Corp would resell Juniper equipment as part of its own family
of products, said the sources, who requested anonymity because
the talks are still ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Juniper shares rose 3.1 percent, outperforming a 1.2
percent gain on the Nasdaq as investors bet an OEM deal with
IBM could help the company gain market share from bigger rival
Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Officials at both companies declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sources said no decision has yet been made and any
announcement could be months away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Computer server and hardware maker IBM already helps sell
Juniper products such as routers, which direct Internet
traffic, under the same kind of sales partnership it has with
Cisco and other equipment vendors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts say an OEM deal would provide further incentive
for IBM's salesmen to promote Juniper gear to their mutual
customers, and underscore IBM's efforts to cultivate sales
relationships beyond equipment industry leader Cisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cisco recently announced it was entering the computer
server market, bringing it into direct competition with IBM as
well as Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N). Analysts have said IBM
could retaliate by shifting its ties to other equipment
vendors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM has already announced an OEM deal with Brocade
Communications Systems Inc (BRCD.O), which makes data storage
and other network equipment and is also a Cisco rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Avian Securities said in a research report last week that
it expects IBM to forge an OEM deal with Juniper and that it
was evident the company was shifting resources away from
Cisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM shares rose 1.71 percent to $104.69, while Cisco shares
rose 1.59 percent to $18.51.

&lt;p&gt; * Relaunched search engine takes aim at Google&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Service to be introduced over next few days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Full launch next Wednesday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft, Google, Yahoo shares all rise slightly
 (Adds Microsoft CEO comment, share prices, Bing details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEATTLE, May 28 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is
revamping its search engine to counter the dominance of Google
Inc (GOOG.O) in the Web search and related advertising
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software company, which is still in
talks with Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) over a potential partnership, has
long been determined to play a major role in the lucrative Web
search market after watching upstart Google take a
stranglehold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, which has been testing the search engine
internally under the name Kumo for several months, plans to
introduce the new service, re-christened "Bing," over the next
few days, with a full launch next Wednesday. The service will
be available at www.bing.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Advertising Age reported earlier this week that Microsoft
was planing a $80 million to $100 million ad campaign to
promote Bing. Microsoft declined to comment on the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We'll have what I would call a big budget -- big enough
that I had to gulp when I approved the budget," said Microsoft
Chief Executive Steve Ballmer, who unveiled Bing at a
technology conference in Carlsbad, California, run by the All
Things Digital tech blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Redmond, Washington-based firm has lots of ground to
make up. Last month Google took 64.2 percent of U.S. Internet
searches -- up half a percentage point from the month before --
handling 9.5 billion out of a total of 14.8 billion searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo was a distant second with 20.4 percent of searches
and Microsoft third with 8.2 percent, both down slightly from
the month before, according to data firm comScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer offered no quick turnaround in those numbers. "My
timeframe is lots of years," he said at the conference. "I
don't have a specific forecast, but this is lots of years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new name, Bing, is short, universal and can be
"verbed-up," said Ballmer, a clear reference to the fact that
'to Google' has become the generic verb for searching the
Internet for information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW FEATURES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both Google and Yahoo have recently introduced new features
in their search engines to attract users, making Microsoft's
task even harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft is calling its new product a "decision engine,"
promising to make things like buying a digital camera, booking
a flight or searching for a restaurant easier by serving up
results based on similar previous searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A search on a make of car, for example, will bring up
clickable categories on the left-hand sidebar, such as
'problems,' 'reviews' and 'dealers,' which Microsoft has
calculated are the most likely places a Web user will want to
go from the initial search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bing also incorporates the increasingly popular Farecast
service in its flight booking section -- making use of the
company it bought last year -- which predicts whether fares
will rise or fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other new features include getting directions to locations
with only one mouse click, and the ability to hover over a
search result to see more information, without having to open a
new link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's shares rose 36 cents to $20.49 on Nasdaq at
mid-afternoon. Google edged up 1.1 percent to $409.96 and Yahoo
shares rose 1 percent to $15.09.

&lt;p&gt;IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation announced today that it has entered into a Joint
Development Agreement with Weatherford International Ltd. to develop and
commercialize a new completion technology called MazeFloTM, designed to mitigate
sand production risk in a broad range of applications. 

Under terms of the agreement, Houston-based ExxonMobil Upstream Research Company
and Weatherford will work together to commercialize ExxonMobil`s patented sand
control technology that utilizes multiple screens and compartment baffles to
improve well reliability and longevity. The new technology is designed to
selectively limit sand production from problematic intervals, while maintaining
full production from others. 

"Sand production continues to be an industry focus area due to the impact of
unwanted sand on well integrity and production," said Stephen M. Cassiani,
president of ExxonMobil Upstream Research Company. "MazeFlo is an innovative and
reliable sand control technology designed to mitigate sand production risk in
clastic reservoirs. We are confident our collaboration with Weatherford will
ensure both the manufacturing quality and the timely commercialization of our
new technology." 

The agreement with Weatherford covers design, engineering and manufacturing of
prototype sand screens to address common industry challenges such as sand
retention, mechanical integrity and quality control. MazeFlo is applicable in
both onshore and offshore wells, and will complement ExxonMobil's broad suite of
industry-leading completion technologies.

&lt;p&gt;BARCELONA (Reuters) - Ken Newcombe had an idea, and the proverbial lightbulb that appeared over his head was an energy efficient one, not a traditional electric one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former head of carbon emissions trading at investment bank Goldman Sachs started his own carbon finance business last year, C-Quest Capital. He hopes to raise $500 million for a fund that invests in clean energy projects including replacing household lightbulbs in India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In India, we're leading in the development of alternatives for lighting for households, replacing incandescent lightbulbs with CFLs (compact fluorescent lamps)," he told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Indian Railways, one of the biggest institutions in the world, owns 640,000 houses and we're distributing four CFLs per household over the next 12 months."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the Kyoto Protocol climate change pact, companies can invest in projects in developing countries and in return receive U.N.-approved offset credits, each equivalent to one ton of avoided carbon dioxide, which can be sold for profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The projects can be single installations like wind farms, or a program of activities like replacing millions of lightbulbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Energy Agency has calculated that lighting using conventional bulbs uses 19 percent of global electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, environmental group Greenpeace asked India to follow Australia and ban the incandescent lightbulb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India announced in February it would replace 400 million bulbs with CFLs by 2012, which would save about 55 million ton of carbon dioxide per year, Greenpeace calculated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newcombe expects his Indian Railways project to reduce emissions by some 1 million ton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our business is expanding. We're looking to distribute 13 million CFLs to around 4.5 million households under our current contracts," Newcombe said, adding that C-Quest is developing similar projects in two other regions of India, as well as other green ventures in the U.S. and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Indian projects must be validated and registered by the United Nations before they are able to receive credits, a process which can take upwards of 1-2 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The project validation is under way, but we may lose offsets because we are unable to get registration before a significant number of CFLs are distributed," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We haven't started raising money yet, we're just using our founding capital to do all these projects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. EMISSIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C-Quest aims to set up 85-90 percent of its projects in Asia and the United States, with the remainder in Australia, Newcombe told Reuters on the sidelines of a carbon conference in Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're looking to improve land management in the U.S. and Australia, including soil sequestration, growing biofuel crops, and planting trees."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soil sequestration involves encouraging less intensive farming practices that retain organic matter in the soil, thereby storing carbon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee approved a draft bill that would create an emissions trading scheme to help cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed scheme allows companies to meet emissions targets through buying offsets generated by clean energy projects, but it not yet known what specific types of projects will be eligible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless, Newcombe, a veteran of the $126 billion global emissions market, is confident his investments will bear fruit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is so unlikely that our types of offsets won't be admissible that we don't have any problem going ahead and investing," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vote on the bill in the full House could happen in August but it's unclear if it will get through the Senate this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michael Szabo; Editing by Anthony Barker)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CARACAS May 28 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said it had offered
to sell the Venezuelan government a production laboratory after
an official threatened to temporarily seize the U.S.
pharmaceutical company's operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Venezuela's trade minister, Eduardo Saman, who also looks
after consumer affairs, said last week he would suggest to
President Hugo Chavez that the government temporarily take
control of the company in retaliation for Pfizer's closing of
one of its factories in the South American nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Socialist Chavez has stepped up pressure on the private
sector this year, extending a wave of nationalizations and
increasing scrutiny of companies producing basic goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Thursday Pfizer (PFE.N) said the affected plant was up
for sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Pfizer is talking with various interested parties, and one
of them is the Government of Venezuela," the company said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quoted in a Venezuelan newspaper, Saman said he had met
with Pfizer to talk about the possible purchase.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
As sweeping energy legislation winds through Congress, the chiefs of Chevron and
The Sierra Club will sit down - for the first time ever - to address their
vision for powering America`s future.Chevron CEO Dave O`Reilly and Sierra Club
Executive Director Carl Pope both agree that new fuels and efficiency will play
an important role in meeting growing global energy demand. Yet they have
different views on the role of fossil fuels and the pace - and cost - of a
transition to a low-carbon economy. 

"As President Obama has shown us, sometimes unusual partners have to come
together to find common ground," commented Pope. "Our energy issues are more
critical than ever, and we're eager to hash out our differences and debate the
best way to pursue a clean energy future." 

"America`s prosperity was built on a foundation of finding common ground for the
common good," O`Reilly said. "And today we must seek common ground in securing
America`s energy future. I look forward to a conversation that focuses on how
America will meet its long-term energy needs while addressing environmental
concerns." 

Founder of The Commonwealth Club`s Climate One program, Greg Dalton, who
organized the program added, "This debate comes at a critical juncture.
Washington is considering rewriting the rules on energy and environment and the
stakes are high for both of these heavyweights." 

O`Reilly was elected chairman and chief executive officer of Chevron Corporation
on January 1, 2000. The Dublin, Ireland native was previously vice president of
Chevron Corporation and chief operating officer at Chevron Chemical Company.
Upon his graduation from Ireland`s University College he began his career at
Chevron as a process engineer. 

Pope became Executive Director of the Sierra Club in 1992. He co-authored the
book Strategic Ignorance: Why the Bush Administration Is Recklessly Destroying a
Century of Environmental Progress. He has worked with the Sierra Club for more
than 30 years and has served as a board member for the National Clean Air
Coalition, California Common Cause, and Public Interest Economics Inc. In
January 2009, Pope announced his plans to step down once a successor is hired. 

The discussion will be moderated by Alan Murray, a regular contributor to CNBC
and online executive editor of The Wall Street Journal. 

The Commonwealth Club`s Climate One program is a leadership dialogue that
engages people from business, government, advocacy groups and academia in
conversations about energy, the economy and the environment. Recent Climate One
guests include oil tycoon Boone Pickens, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, and
Google CEO Eric Schmidt. The goal is to spark dialogue and action toward a
global, low-carbon economy. www.climate-one.org. 

Founded in 1903, The Commonwealth Club of California is the nation`s premier

&lt;p&gt;PLANO, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Market Street Plano welcomes all local princes and princesses to receive the
royal treatment at its Radio Disney "Princess Protection Program" Party on
Sunday, May 31 from 2 to 4 p.m. 

In preparation for the new Disney Channel original movie, "Princess Protection
Program," the Radio Disney 620 AM Road Crew will be hosting the event in the
Market Street Plano parking lot, located at 1929 Preston Road and W. Park Blvd,
allowing princes and princesses to take the stage and karaoke to tracks made
famous by their favorite Disney stars Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato. 

Young guests also can participate in Princess training classes, receive tips on
how to host their own "Princess Protection Program" Premiere Party, collect
royal prizes and register for a chance to win the National Grand Prize - a trip
for four to attend the red-carpet premiere of "Princess Protection Program" in
Toronto, Canada. 

"After a long school year, parents and children alike deserve a little royal
treatment," said Store Director Robert Bollinger. "This party only furthers the
royal treatment our guests experience when they walk into a Market Street store.
From our skilled butchers and bakers to the Market Street team members who carry
your groceries out every time, our guests can always expect the red-carpet
treatment." 

Fans know Selena Gomez as "wizard in training" Alex Russo from the Disney
Channel`s hit series, "Wizard of Waverly Place." Demi Lovato played Mitchie in
last summer`s hot Disney Channel hit, "Camp Rock," as well as Sonny from "Sonny
with a Chance." 

Market Street is a unique shopping experience that combines the everyday
groceries guests need with the specialty items, whole-health/gourmet products
and pre-prepared foods they want. In 2003, Market Street opened its first DFW
store in Colleyville. Almost identical stores followed in McKinney, Plano,
Allen, Frisco and Coppell-Lewisville. 

Fans can find Market Street DFW on Facebook and Twitter.

&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Foundation, the philanthropic arm of The Coca-Cola Company, has
awarded grants totaling $100,000 to six nonprofit organizations in Alabama
working to change the behavior of sedentary teens. Funding was granted in
response to a pilot Request for Proposal (RFP) The Foundation issued in March
2009. 

"Our goal is to make a positive difference in the lives of Alabama`s youth by
addressing declining trends in physical activity," said Ingrid Saunders Jones,
chair of The Coca-Cola Foundation, which granted more than $82 million in 2008
to improve global communities relating to water stewardship, active healthy
living, community recycling and education. "Our funding creates access to
sustainable, innovative programs where teens will learn the benefits of exercise
and nutrition." 

The Coca-Cola system, and its bottling partners, has a strong tradition of
encouraging active lifestyles. In 2008, more than $7 million was awarded to
programs that encouraged young people and adults to be more active. In March,
The Foundation issued a competitive pilot RFP that asked Alabama-based 501(c)
(3) organizations to submit proposals for summer physical activity and nutrition
education programs targeting youth between the ages of 12 and 18. Nearly 100
organizations applied. 

"Communities are at their best when businesses and local governments work
together to solve problems," said Alabama Governor Bob Riley. "This contribution
offered by The Coca-Cola Foundation will go a long way to help empower
Alabamians to live healthier, more active lifestyles. I want to thank Coca-Cola
for its investment in Alabama. Together, we will not only fight the problem of
obesity in this state - we will win." 

"I commend The Coca-Cola Company for its substantial investments in worthy
nonprofit organizations promoting healthy, active lifestyles in the state of
Alabama," said Congressman Artur Davis (D-Ala), who represents Alabama`s 7th
congressional district, where several programs will be funded by The Foundation.


Recipient organizations were chosen by a selection committee that included
representatives of the Coca-Cola system, and health and physical activity
experts. Organizations receiving funding include:

* Auburn University, Hale County, AL, $15,000, for the Hale and Hearty in Hale
County, which provides access to physical activity and nutritional education for
30 teens. The curriculum will be based on the National 4-H`s "Just Move" program
and will include a variety of activities. A nutrition component will be
instructed by the Alabama Cooperative Extension. To continue the program, all
Hale County teachers will be instructed on the Just Move Alabama curriculum and
encouraged to use the materials in their classrooms for at least 10 minutes
every day throughout the school year. 
* Girls, Inc. of Central Alabama, Birmingham, AL, $13,000 - for the Body By Me
program, which aims to develop healthy eating habits and develop regular
physical activity in teen girls, by focusing on 45 minutes of physical exercise
and 30-minutes of nutrition education class twice weekly. 
* Bama Kids, Inc., Camden County, AL, $24,000 - for the Summer Enrichment
Through Sports program, which will serve 200 youth in the Black Belt region of
Alabama by providing physical activity and nutrition lessons for three months. 
* Jonathan Daniels Community Development Corporation of Selma, AL, $23,000 - for
the My Body My Future HPLAY program, designed to increase physical activity,
nutrition education awareness, and behavior change in 100 youth. Physical
activities include yoga, aerobics, and basketball. The program also engages
parents through commitment letters for a healthier lifestyle, accompanied by
activity and nutrition logs to evaluate behavior changes and modification for
the youth and their families. 
* Montgomery YMCA, Montgomery, AL, $12,000 - for the High Action Workout for
Kids,a fitness program for 20 sedentary youth that includes weight training,
swimming programs, fitness classes, outdoor sports and nutritional education
through free YMCA memberships. Participants will also receive a six-month YMCA
family membership. 
* University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL, $13,000 - for the DANCE 4 Health, a
six-week summer program for 50 African-American teens. Participants will receive
ballroom dance instruction three times a week for six weeks. The program will
also include health assessments, and nutrition classes that focus on
understanding nutritional labels, and making healthy food choices.

"Obesity is a long-term and continuing problem facing Alabama," said Denise
Shirley, County Extension Coordinator, Hale County Alabama, which is working
with Auburn University to implement the Hale and Hearty in Hale County program.
"This funding will allow us to reach at risk children in Hale County and help to
break the cycle of obesity." 

As a stipulation for funding, each organization must operate its program for a
minimum of four weeks this summer. Each also has to provide clear, measurable
results at the end of the program.

&lt;p&gt;May 28 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded flash memory card
maker SanDisk Corp (SNDK.O) to "buy" from "neutral," citing the
renegotiation of the company's royalty agreement with Samsung
Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Shares of SanDisk were up about 4 percent at $16.10 before
the bell. They closed at $15.52 Wednesday on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Skepticism over SanDisk's ability to renegotiate its
agreement with Samsung before expiration had led to SanDisk's
royalty business being significantly undervalued in recent
months, analyst James Covello said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With the agreement now renegotiated, we expect the royalty
business to get re-priced closer to a fair value of about $5.4
billion, or $20-$25 a share," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, Samsung renewed its NAND flash memory chip
licence with SanDisk for seven years, at a lower royalty, while
guaranteeing a portion of its chips output to SanDisk.
[ID:nSEO225692]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst raised his price target on SanDisk shares to
$22 from $16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While SanDisk is likely to continue to incur losses through
most of 2009, improved supply/demand dynamics will continue to
drive the stock higher, Covello said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Importantly, we do not believe that a recovery in
SanDisk's product business in 2009 is a requisite for a
compelling valuation case for the stock," the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Even assuming zero value for the card business still gets
us to $22 in value just for the royalty business alone."

&lt;p&gt;NICE Decision Expands Treatment Choices for Patients
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc said today that the United Kingdom`s National Institute for Health
and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has issued its final appraisal document (FAD)
recommending reimbursement for Sutent (sunitinib malate) as a second-line
treatment for patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). This
recommendation follows NICE`s recently published guidance recommending
reimbursement for Sutent for the first-line treatment of advanced kidney cancer.


The guidance states that Sutent is recommended for reimbursement as a treatment
option for patients with advanced GIST after disease progression on or
intolerance to imatinib mesylate, and who have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.* According to NICE, "the benefits
seen in time to tumor progression and progression free survival were such that a
substantial improvement in overall survival with sunitinib treatment was
probable." 

"NICE`s decision gives hope to patients with GIST who develop resistance to
imatinib," said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, senior vice president, clinical development
and medical affairs, Pfizer`s Oncology Business Unit. "Insights into the
causative pathways involved with cancers like GIST will help us bring Sutent to
the right patient at the right time." 

NICE`s decision was based on data from a pivotal Phase 3 trial of Sutent
compared with placebo in patients with advanced GIST. Sutent increased time to
tumor progression in the study by almost five months (6.4 weeks vs. 27.3 weeks,
P &lt;0.0001). Following these early findings, 84 percent of patients receiving
placebo switched to Sutent treatment. Updated analyses of this trial
demonstrated a median overall survival of 73.9 weeks for Sutent patients vs.
64.9 weeks for those initially receiving placebo (P = 0.161). However, according
to an exploratory analysis calculating what the difference may have been if the
patients had remained on placebo, estimated overall survival for Sutent patients
was 73.9 weeks, compared to 35 weeks for those receiving placebo. 

"It`s a terrible thing to have to tell a patient with terminal cancer that a
treatment is no longer working for them, their cancer is growing again and there
are no other treatments available," said Dr. Beatrice Seddon, consultant
clinical oncologist, University College London Hospitals. "Before the arrival of
sunitinib, this was the situation for people with advanced GIST in the U.K.
NICE`s decision today means that finally, we have something else to offer our
patients, and with it the hope of extra time and quality life with their
families and loved ones." 

Sutent has played an important role in re-shaping the treatment landscape for
GIST and advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), two historically
difficult-to-treat cancers. The benefit/risk profile of Sutent has been
well-established through large, randomized clinical trials evaluating the safety
and efficacy in both second-line GIST and first-line advanced RCC. To date,
approximately 50,500 patients globally have been treated with Sutent. 

NICE, the independent organization responsible for issuing guidance for drug
reimbursement to the British National Health Service, plans to publish final
guidance in July, which will then be implemented by the local funding bodies in
England and Wales. 

About Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor

Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is found in the gastrointestinal (GI)
tract and belongs to a group of rare cancers called soft tissue sarcomas.
Sarcomas begin in muscle, fat, fibrous tissue, blood vessels, or other
supporting tissue of the body. Advanced GIST affects approximately 90 to 150
people in the U.K. each year, with an annual worldwide incidence of
approximately 1.5 cases per 100,000 persons. 

Important SUTENT&#174; (sunitinib malate) Safety Information

Women of child bearing age who are (or become) pregnant during therapy should be
informed of the potential for fetal harm while on SUTENT. 

Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below the lower limit
of normal (LLN) have been observed. Patients with concomitant cardiac conditions
should be carefully monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of congestive
heart failure. 

Patients should be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with
standard antihypertensive therapy. CBCs with platelet count and serum
chemistries should be performed at the beginning of each treatment cycle for
patients receiving treatment with SUTENT. 

The most common adverse reactions in clinical trials were fatigue, asthenia,
diarrhea, nausea, mucositis/stomatitis, vomiting, dyspensia, abdominal pain,
constipation, hypertension, rash, hand-foot syndrome, skin discoloration,
altered taste, anorexia and bleeding.

&lt;p&gt;May 28 (Reuters) - Procter  Gamble Co (PG.N) Chief
Executive A.G. Lafley is expected to provide a cautious
earnings outlook for the company's coming fiscal year in a
presentation to investors on Thursday, the Wall Street Journal
said on its website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Lafley is also likely to weigh in on possible price cuts,
after several quarters of price increases by the company, the
paper said, citing a person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A PG spokesman told the Journal: "We're focused on the
consumer-value equation, and we'll continue to look at that
equation and make whatever changes are necessary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Journal said many on Wall Street expect PG to give
some guidance on fiscal 2010 earnings on Thursday at a Sanford
Bernstein investor conference in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In order to address investor concerns that the household
products maker is not spending enough on product innovation,
Lafley is expected to announce Tide Stain Release, a new
laundry additive, the Journal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Procter  Gamble was not immediately available for comment
to Reuters out of regular office hours.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks rose on Friday, capping their third straight monthly advance, as rising commodity prices lifted shares of natural resource companies, while a sliding dollar boosted the allure of multinationals, including Coca-Cola Co (KO.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors were encouraged by a report showing in May consumer confidence hit its highest in eight months, while the run-up in commodities fueled bets that overseas demand would underpin a recovery in the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. front-month crude oil futures rose $1.23 percent, or 1.8 percent, to $66.31 a barrel, supporting gains in such stocks as Chevron (CVX.N), Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N). The SP energy index .GSPE rose 1.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Coca-Cola, which gets the bulk of its sales from abroad, jumped almost 5 percent after the dollar slid to five-month lows against a basket of currencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beverage maker was the Dow's top boost, followed by technology services company International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), up 1.5 percent to $106.28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's clear to me, based on the market action, that we've turned a corner in this economy," said Sasha Kostadinov, portfolio manager and research analyst at Shaker Investments in Cleveland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The question that I have is, when we get a clear view of what's around the corner, is it going to be better growth and moderate inflation, or is it going to be slow growth and bad inflation?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI gained 96.53 points, or 1.15 percent, to 8,500.33. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index .SPX climbed 12.31 points, or 1.36 percent, to 919.14. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC rose 22.54 points, or 1.29 percent, to 1,774.33.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since hitting a 12-year low in early March, the SP 500 has risen 35.9 percent. The third straight monthly advance is the index's longest monthly winning streak since fall 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, the SP 500 rose 5.3 percent, the Dow gained 4.1 percent and the Nasdaq advanced 3.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While rising oil prices are a boon for energy companies and a harbinger of improved worldwide demand, a jump in energy costs could present a significant headwind for consumers and businesses at a time when investors are looking for a spending recovery to fuel an economic revival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, a surge in commodity prices heightens the specter of inflationary pressures in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The slumping dollar lifted prices of other commodities, sending August gold futures as high as $982 an ounce, the highest since late February. Shares of miner Freeport-McMoran Copper and Gold Inc (FCX.N) rose 4.3 percent to $54.43 and the gold BUGS index .HUI gained 3.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares finished up 1.3 percent at $66.67, while ConocoPhillips climbed 0.5 percent to $45.84, and Exxon Mobil gained 0.2 percent to $69.35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), a maker of bulldozers and excavators, whose customers include mining companies, jumped 2.5 percent to $35.46. On Nasdaq, shares of software maker Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) were a top boost, rising 2.2 percent to $20.89.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among declining stocks, General Motors Corp (GM.N) plunged 33 percent to 75 cents as the beleaguered automaker drew closer to filing for bankruptcy protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the bankruptcy has been expected, analysts say there are worries about the implications for jobs, business and consumer sentiment in the months ahead. GM's bankruptcy petition is expected to occur on Sunday or Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trading was active on the New York Stock Exchange with about 1.86 billion shares changing hands, above last year's estimated daily average of 1.49 billion. On Nasdaq, about 2.59 billion shares traded, above last year's daily average of 2.28 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a ratio of more than 8 to 3 and by about 7 to 3 on the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;

The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC rose 22.54 points, or 1.29
percent, to 1,774.33.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since hitting a 12-year low in early March, the SP 500 has

index's longest monthly winning streak since fall 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In May, the SP 500 rose 5.3 percent, the Dow gained 4.1
percent and the Nasdaq advanced 3.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While rising oil prices are a boon for energy companies and
a harbinger of improved worldwide demand, a jump in energy
costs could present a significant headwind for consumers and
businesses at a time when investors are looking for a spending
recovery to fuel an economic revival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, a surge in commodity prices heightens the
specter of inflationary pressures in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The slumping dollar lifted prices of other commodities,
sending August gold futures GCQ9 as high as $982 an ounce,
the highest since late February. Shares of miner
Freeport-McMoran Copper and Gold Inc (FCX.N) rose 4.3 percent
to $54.43 and the gold BUGS index .HUI gained 3.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron shares finished up 1.3 percent at $66.67, while
ConocoPhillips climbed 0.5 percent to $45.84, and Exxon Mobil

and excavators, whose customers include mining companies,
jumped 2.5 percent to $35.46. On Nasdaq, shares of software
maker Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) were a top boost, rising 2.2
percent to $20.89.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among declining stocks, General Motors Corp (GM.N) plunged
33 percent to 75 cents as the beleaguered automaker drew closer

about 1.86 billion shares changing hands, above last year's
estimated daily average of 1.49 billion. On Nasdaq, about 2.59

a ratio of more than 8 to 3 and by about 7 to 3 on the Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has downgraded and assigned Rating Outlooks to J.P. Morgan Chase
Commercial Mortgage Securities 2004-C2 as follows: 

--$11.6 million class F to 'BBB' from 'BBB+'; Outlook Negative;

--$4.9 million class RP-4 at 'BBB'; Outlook Stable; 

--$7.4 million class RP-5 at 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable. 

Fitch does not rate the $13.7 million class NR. The RP certificates represent an
interest in a subordinate note secured by the Republic Plaza property. 

The downgrades are the result of an increase in specially serviced assets and
expected losses since Fitch's last rating action. Rating Outlooks reflect the
likely direction of any rating changes over the next one to two years. The
Negative Outlooks reflect the increase in Fitch Loans of Concern. As of the May
2009 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance had decreased by
11.4% to $941.8 million from $1.06 billion at issuance. Eleven loans are fully
defeased (6.5%) and the third largest loan in the pool is partially defeased. 

Fitch has identified 25 Loans of Concern (12.5%), including four loans in
special servicing (3.1%). The largest specially serviced asset (1.4%) is a
134,510 square foot (sf) retail plaza located in Temecula, CA. The loan
transferred to special servicing in May 2009 for imminent default as vacancy
increased to 43% after a large local grocery tenant filed for bankruptcy and
closed its store. 

The second largest specially serviced asset (1.2%) is a 312 unit multifamily
property located in Fort Worth, TX. The loan transferred to special servicing in
January 2009 for payment default. The borrower is seeking a loan modification.
The servicer reported occupancy as of April 2009 was 91%. 

The largest Fitch Loan of Concern not in special servicing (1.9%) is secured by
a an office property located in Chula Vista, CA. Occupancy has declined to 77%
as of April 2009, and approximately 30% of the remaining space has upcoming
lease expirations. 

Fitch maintains investment-grade shadow ratings on two loans in the trust:
Somerset Collection (12.3%) and Republic Plaza (10.3%). The Somerset Collection
loan is secured by 755,804 square feet (sf) of a 1.4 million sf regional mall
located in Troy, MI. The mall has experienced stable performance since issuance.
The servicer reported occupancy as of year end (YE) 2008 was 97% compared to
97.6% at issuance. Significant anchor tenants include Saks, Nordstrom, Neiman
Marcus and Macy's. 

The collateral for the Republic Plaza loan is a 1.3 million sf office building
located in Denver, CO. The whole loan consists of two A-note pieces, one of
which is the $107 million trust balance and the other is comprised of $28
million in non-pooled RP certificates, in addition to a $35 million B-note,
which is not held in the trust. Occupancy at the property has improved and
stabilized, reaching 97.8% as of March 2009 compared to 79.9% at issuance. A
large tenant vacated in December 2008, however another tenant has leased the
space through 2019. Brookfield Properties is the loan sponsor. 

Two loans are scheduled to mature in 2009 (1.9%). These loans have a servicer
reported YE 2008 weighted average debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.74
times (x) with a weighted average coupon of 5.04%. There are two loans scheduled
to mature in 2010 (2.3%) and they are defeased.

banks up to 350 billion yen each in such loans at an interest
rate to be set via auctions, the first of which was to be held
by the end of May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sumitomo Trust placed the minimum bid on Friday morning
after determining that demand for the funds would be low, the
daily added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Friday, the Nikkei reported that Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp, Mizuho
Corporate Bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corp, Sumitomo

decided not to take part in the Bank of Japan's first auction.

&lt;p&gt;-- Eric Auchard is a Reuters columnist. The opinions expressed are his own --&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Eric Auchard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) new Web search service Bing is a far cry from the general-purpose tool the company must build or buy to compete effectively with rival Google Inc. (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft would do far better helping users find the emails, documents and Web pages that users of Outlook, Office and Internet Explorer rely on every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But competitive restrictions appear to prevent the desktop software giant from doing what it knows best. Microsoft operates its business under oversight from U.S. regulators after it settled antitrust charges in 2002 that it abused its market dominance in personal computer operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barring that, Microsoft needs to come to terms with Yahoo (YHOO.O) over Web search. A deal has eluded them for 16 months but Yahoo remains Microsoft's best chance for competing with Google on the consumer Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft offered to pay up to $47.5 billion for Yahoo early last year but was rebuffed by Yahoo's former leadership. They have been in talks in recent months but no deal has emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than trying to be all things to all people, Microsoft's latest reboot of its Internet strategy helps consumer dig deeply and find what they are after quicker, but only in a selected set of categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type in the name of an automobile and Bing assumes the user is thinking about buying or repairing a car. For example, the left frame of the search results page for "hyundai sonata" links to reviews, repairs, used cars, dealers, videos, images and reference manuals. A search for "diabetes" turns up health-related categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the features Bing incorporates have been tried by smaller Web search providers and failed to make a dent in Google's share of the audience for Web search: Ask.com or specialist sites like Spock.com for people search or StumbleUpon for videos, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft needed to restart its search strategy somewhere, and had to focus. Offering a search service that works well in some categories, not others, is no option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changing consumer habits is hard enough when you are competing with Google, the generic verb for Web search. No one is going to switch willingly from Google unless Microsoft can demonstrate clear improvements in how Bing works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The demonstration a Microsoft executive gave me showed Bing can help Web users make decisions quicker by anticipating what kind of information they are searching for when they look for travel terms or autos, sports, health, retail or event names. The service goes lives for U.S. users starting on June 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It offers a great way to comparison shop for airline tickets that I'll certainly use when I travel. Many of the improvements Bing offers are designed to help Web shoppers. That's a lucrative area that will help Microsoft sell advertising, but is only one of the reasons that people use Web search tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft needs to make headway on the consumer Internet because its ability to expand in areas it already dominates is subject to regulatory challenges from competitors small and large that stand in its way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not voguish to say so in hip technology circles -- I may lose some Twitter fans here -- but resurrecting competition in the desktop computer market has resulted in unfortunate consequences for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In dozens of little ways, Microsoft seems reluctant or prevented from adopting widely accepted technologies that make the Web easier to use elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Microsoft has acquired a string of companies that can help it improve search for business users. Chief Executive Steve Ballmer he's prepared to take years and invest billions to make headway in the consumer Internet market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Microsoft has shown with its initial release of Bing is that it needs Yahoo search more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- Eric Auchard does not own any direct investments in securities mentioned in this article.

&lt;p&gt;CHELMSFORD, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
La corporationZOLL Medical (Nasdaq GS: ZOLL), un fabricant d'appareils de
r&#233;animation et de solutions logicielles connexes, a annonc&#233; que le minist&#232;re de
la Sant&#233; du Qu&#233;bec avait conclu avec ZOLL un accord visant &#224; munir toutes les
ambulances de la province, la plus vaste du Canada, d'un d&#233;fibrillateur E
Series&#174; de ZOLL. La province de Qu&#233;bec n'avait jamais auparavant adopt&#233; un
mod&#232;le unique de d&#233;fibrillateur pour l'ensemble de son r&#233;seau. 

En vertu des modalit&#233;s de l'accord, environ 700 d&#233;fibrillateurs E Series&#174; seront
achet&#233;s, en plus des &#233;lectrodes de CPR stat&#8226;padz&#174;, ce qui constitue la plus
importante commande jamais re&#231;ue par ZOLL en sol canadien. La transition vers
les appareils ZOLL se fera une r&#233;gion &#224; la fois, pour un total de 16 r&#233;gions.
Les premi&#232;res commandes ont d&#233;j&#224; &#233;t&#233; pass&#233;es par Urgences-Sant&#233; (fournisseur de
services pr&#233;hospitaliers de la ville de Montr&#233;al), la r&#233;gion de Qu&#233;bec, ainsi
que par les r&#233;gions de Chaudi&#232;re-Appalaches, de la Mauricie et de l'Outaouais.
Sur une p&#233;riode de six ans, la valeur totale des accords r&#233;gionaux d&#233;passera 11
millions de $. 

&#171; Suite au choix du d&#233;fibrillateur ZOLL de s&#233;rie E&#174; comme appareil devant &#234;tre
utilis&#233; au sein de la flotte ambulanci&#232;re qu&#233;b&#233;coise, les directeurs m&#233;dicaux
des services pr&#233;hospitaliers d`urgence pourront facilement disposer et comparer
les donn&#233;es touchant l`ensemble des interventions de r&#233;animation sur tout le
territoire qu&#233;b&#233;cois&#187; a d&#233;clar&#233; la Dre Colette D. Lacha&#238;ne, (adjointe clinique
au directeur m&#233;dical national des services pr&#233;hospitaliers du Qu&#233;bec). &#171; Dans le
cadre de son &#233;valuation clinique, le d&#233;fibrillateur E Series&#174; a obtenu les
meilleurs r&#233;sultats, plus sp&#233;cifiquement, du point de vue de la r&#233;vision et de
la transmission des donn&#233;es. La technologie de r&#233;troaction Real CPR Help&#174; et la
fonctionnalit&#233; See-Thru CPR&#174; ont &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; mentionn&#233;es &#224; titre de
caract&#233;ristiques positives, avant tout pour la r&#233;alisation d'une RCR de qualit&#233;
&#233;lev&#233;e, mais &#233;galement pour la r&#233;duction des interruptions. &#187; 

&#171; Manifestant sa volont&#233; d'am&#233;liorer la qualit&#233; des services de soins
pr&#233;hospitaliers aux victimes d'un arr&#234;t cardiaque subit, le minist&#232;re de la
Sant&#233; et des Services sociaux a souhait&#233; normaliser ses technologies de
r&#233;animation en offrant de l'&#233;quipement de pointe &#224; rendement &#233;lev&#233;, et ce que
l'on nous a propos&#233; pr&#233;sente un excellent rapport qualit&#233;/prix &#187;, a d&#233;clar&#233;
Jacques Gagnon, directeur des TI d'Approvisionnement des Deux Rives, corporation
d`achats en groupe. &#171; Le niveau de soins qui sera offert sera conforme aux
lignes directrices de l'American Heart Association (AHA) et &#224; celles de la
Fondation des maladies du c&#339;ur, qui mettent un accent particulier sur la RCR. &#187; 

&#171; ZOLL vise avant tout &#224; am&#233;liorer le taux de survie des victimes d'arr&#234;t
cardiaque subit, et nous sommes ravis de constater que le gouvernement du Qu&#233;bec
reconna&#238;t la mani&#232;re dont les caract&#233;ristiques technologiques de pointe de nos
d&#233;fibrillateurs E Series&#174; peuvent contribuer &#224; cet objectif &#187;, a d&#233;clar&#233; Richard
A. Packer, le pr&#233;sident-directeur g&#233;n&#233;ral de ZOLL. 

Les d&#233;fibrillateurs E Series&#174; de ZOLL sont con&#231;us pour s'adapter aux exigences
sp&#233;cifiques et aux conditions extr&#234;mes auxquelles les techniciens ambulanciers
param&#233;dics font face de mani&#232;re quotidienne. Les E Series&#174; offrent plusieurs
options de transmission des donn&#233;es, dont la transmission d'ECG &#224; 12 d&#233;rivations
aux h&#244;pitaux, ce que les lignes directrices internationales recommandent
d&#233;sormais pour les soins pr&#233;hospitaliers, afin de diminuer le d&#233;lai n&#233;cessaire &#224;
la perfusion chez les patients victimes d'un infarctus du myocarde avec
&#233;l&#233;vation du segment ST (STEMI). 

La technologie Real CPR Help dont tous les appareils de ZOLL sont dot&#233;s permet
aux premiers intervenants et aux techniciens ambulanciers param&#233;dics de savoir
si le rythme et la profondeur de leurs compressions thoraciques de RCR sont
appropri&#233;s. La fonctionnalit&#233; See-Thru CPR&#174; les aide &#224; minimiser les
interruptions &#224; la RCR qui nuisent aux chances de r&#233;ussite de la r&#233;animation. 

Au sujet des arr&#234;ts cardiaques subits (ACS)

Les ACS constituent une perturbation soudaine du fonctionnement du c&#339;ur,
entra&#238;nant une chute du d&#233;bit sanguin vers les organes vitaux. Chaque ann&#233;e,
plus d'un million de personnes en meurent, ce qui en fait la principale cause de
d&#233;c&#232;s dans le monde entier. Bien souvent, les ACS ne pr&#233;sentent aucun signe
avant-coureur et pr&#233;sentement, seulement 5 pour cent environ des victimes y
survivent. Un certain nombre d'am&#233;liorations r&#233;cemment apport&#233;es &#224; la cha&#238;ne de
survie, dont une RCR et une hypothermie post-r&#233;animation am&#233;lior&#233;es, permettent
d'esp&#233;rer de meilleurs r&#233;sultats. 

Au sujet du minist&#232;re de la Sant&#233; duQu&#233;bec

La mission du minist&#232;re de la Sant&#233; et des Services sociaux consiste &#224; maintenir
et &#224; am&#233;liorer la sant&#233; et le bien-&#234;tre des Qu&#233;b&#233;coises et des Qu&#233;b&#233;cois, en
permettant l'acc&#232;s &#224; un ensemble de services de sant&#233; et de services sociaux,
int&#233;gr&#233;s et de qualit&#233;, en vue de contribuer au d&#233;veloppement social et
&#233;conomique du Qu&#233;bec. Le minist&#232;re d&#233;termine et ex&#233;cute les priorit&#233;s, les
objectifs et les orientations de politique dans le domaine des services sociaux
et de sant&#233;, dans l'intention d'am&#233;liorer la sant&#233; et le bien-&#234;tre de la
population. Pour s'acquitter de sa mission, le minist&#232;re partage ses

&lt;p&gt;Anti-tumor Activity Also Shown in Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Sutent
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer announced today, at the 45th American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)
Annual Meeting, the results of several clinical studies that may help identify
patients who are more likely to benefit when treated with Sutent&#174; (sunitinib
malate) or axitinib (AG-013736), an investigational compound. The data
identifies prognostic and predictive factors associated with longer overall
survival among subgroups of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma
(mRCC), or advanced kidney cancer. In addition, Phase 2 study results showing
anti-tumor activity of Sutent in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory
prostate cancer (mHRPC) will be presented at ASCO. 

"Sunitinib has helped reshape the treatment landscape in advanced kidney
cancer," said Dr. Robert Motzer, attending physician at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center and lead investigator on the sunitinib Phase 3 trial in RCC. "Over
time, research with this drug continues to inform our understanding of how
individual patients respond to treatment, driving towards a more customized
treatment approach for this difficult-to-treat cancer." 

Data from a large, randomized, pivotal Phase 3 trial demonstrating superior
progression-free survival with Sutent (50mg/day on a 4 weeks on 2 weeks off
schedule) compared to interferon-alfa (IFN-&#945;) (9mU three times per week) in 750
treatment-na&#239;ve mRCC patients, and a median overall survival of more than two
years in patients treated with Sutent, were analyzed to determine prognostic
factors for overall survival. 

Based on the analysis, prognostic factors associated with longer overall
survival in patients treated with Sutent include time from diagnosis to
treatment (&#8805; 1 year vs. &lt; 1 year, p = 0.0008), Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status of 1 vs. 0 (p = 0.0085), lower corrected calcium
(p &lt; 0.0001), absence of bone metastases (p = 0.015), higher hemoglobin (p =
0.0008) and lower lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), an enzyme involved in energy
production in cells (p &lt; 0.0001). 

Predictive Factors to Identify Subgroups of mRCC Patients who may Benefit from
Treatment with Axitinib

In a separate retrospective analysis of two Phase 2 studies of axitinib, an
investigational compound being studied in mRCC, elevated diastolic blood
pressure (dBP &#8805; to 90 mmHg) was shown to be a predictor of clinical efficacy in
mRCC patients (n=109) treated with axitinib, an oral, selective inhibitor of
VEGFR 1, 2 and 3 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2 and 3). The
median overall survival for patients with at least one elevated dBP reading
(n=59) was about three times longer than patients with no elevation in dBP
(n=50) (130 weeks vs. 42 weeks, respectively; p &lt; 0.01). 

Advanced renal cell carcinoma, a rare but serious type of kidney cancer, is
among the most treatment-resistant tumors. Nearly 58,000 people in the United
States will be diagnosed with kidney cancer this year and nearly 13,000 people
will die from the disease. 

Pfizer is committed to further research in kidney cancer populations. Currently
underway are two Phase 3 trials studying the role of Sutent in adjuvant renal
cell carcinoma, immediately after surgery, in patients at risk for cancer
recurrence. Additionally, axitinib is being investigated in a Phase 3 clinical
trial for second-line therapy in mRCC. 

Phase 2 Study of Sunitinib Malate in First-line Hormone-Refractory Prostate
Cancer

Pfizer is also conducting clinical trials of sunitinib malate in other tumor
types, including prostate cancer, one of the most common cancers in men, with
more than 780,000 new cases diagnosed each year worldwide. Pfizer has initiated
a randomized Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of
sunitinib plus prednisone versus placebo and prednisone in metastatic HRPC
patients after disease progression on a docetaxel-based chemotherapy regimen. 

Positive data from a Phase 2 trial evaluating 55 patients with metastatic HRPC
will be presented this week at ASCO. In this study, sunitinib in combination
with docetaxel and prednisone appeared to be well-tolerated and showed
anti-tumor activity in patients with mHRPC, as indicated by both
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and RECIST-defined (Response Evaluation Criteria
In Solid Tumors) tumor responses.3

Findings showed anti-tumor activity of sunitinib in combination with docetaxel
and prednisone, with a PSA response occurring in 56 percent of patients with a
median time to PSA progression of 42.1 weeks. In addition, 53 percent of
patients on the study for longer than 12 weeks had a 30 percent or greater
decline in PSA at that time, and 22 percent of patients had a PSA drop to below
4.0 ng/mL. Out of 33 patients with measurable disease, 42 percent (n=14) had a
confirmed partial response and another 18 percent (n=6) had an initial partial
response. The median progression-free survival was 9.7 months (95 percent CI:
5.8, 10.4). 

In this study, the most commonly reported treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse
events were neutropenia (53 percent), leukopenia (28 percent), fatigue (17
percent), febrile neutropenia (15 percent), stomatitis (7 percent) and anorexia
(7 percent). 

"We continue to see encouraging results with Sutent across numerous cancers,
both as a single agent and in combination with standard therapies," said Dr.
Mace Rothenberg, head of oncology development at Pfizer. "Between Sutent and our
robust pipeline, we are committed to delivering tailored treatment options for
people living with cancer." 

About Axitinib

Axitinib is an oral, selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor
receptors 1, 2 and 3. Axitinib may work by inhibiting blood vessel formation,
which may starve tumors of blood supply needed for growth. Based on preclinical
studies, axitinib is being studied as both a single agent and in combination
with other cancer therapies across many tumor types. Axitinib is an
investigational agent and has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration or other global regulatory agencies. 

About Sutent&#174; (sunitinib malate)

Sutent is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of
gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) after disease progression on or
intolerance to imatinib mesylate and advanced/metastatic RCC. 

Sutent works by blocking multiple molecular targets implicated in the growth,
proliferation and spread of cancer. Two important Sutent targets, vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor
receptor (PDGFR), are expressed by many types of solid tumors and are thought to
play a crucial role in angiogenesis, the process by which tumors acquire blood
vessels, oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. Sutent also inhibits other
targets important to tumor growth, including KIT, FLT3 and RET. 

Important Sutent&#174; (sunitinib malate) Safety Information

Women of child bearing age who are (or become) pregnant during therapy should be
informed of the potential for fetal harm while on Sutent. 

Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below the lower limit
of normal (LLN) have been observed. Patients with concomitant cardiac conditions
should be carefully monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of congestive
heart failure. 

Patients should be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with
standard antihypertensive therapy. Complete blood counts (CBCs) with platelet
count and serum chemistries should be performed at the beginning of each
treatment cycle for patients receiving treatment with Sutent. 

The most common adverse reactions in advanced RCC and GIST clinical trials were
fatigue, asthenia, diarrhea, nausea, mucositis/stomatitis, vomiting, dyspepsia,
abdominal pain, constipation, hypertension, rash, hand-foot syndrome, skin
discoloration, altered taste, anorexia and bleeding.

&lt;p&gt;Anti-tumor Activity Also Shown in Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Sutent
ORLANDO, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer announced today, at the 45th American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)
Annual Meeting, the results of several clinical studies that may help identify
patients who are more likely to benefit when treated with Sutent&#174; (sunitinib
malate) or axitinib (AG-013736), an investigational compound. The data
identifies prognostic and predictive factors associated with longer overall
survival among subgroups of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma
(mRCC), or advanced kidney cancer. In addition, Phase 2 study results showing
anti-tumor activity of Sutent in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory
prostate cancer (mHRPC) will be presented at ASCO. 

"Sunitinib has helped reshape the treatment landscape in advanced kidney
cancer," said Dr. Robert Motzer, attending physician at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center and lead investigator on the sunitinib Phase 3 trial in RCC. "Over
time, research with this drug continues to inform our understanding of how
individual patients respond to treatment, driving towards a more customized
treatment approach for this difficult-to-treat cancer." 

Data from a large, randomized, pivotal Phase 3 trial demonstrating superior
progression-free survival with Sutent (50mg/day on a 4 weeks on 2 weeks off
schedule) compared to interferon-alfa (IFN-&#945;) (9mU three times per week) in 750
treatment-na&#239;ve mRCC patients, and a median overall survival of more than two
years in patients treated with Sutent, were analyzed to determine prognostic
factors for overall survival. 

Based on the analysis, prognostic factors associated with longer overall
survival in patients treated with Sutent include time from diagnosis to
treatment (&#8805; 1 year vs. &lt; 1 year, p = 0.0008), Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status of 1 vs. 0 (p = 0.0085), lower corrected calcium
(p &lt; 0.0001), absence of bone metastases (p = 0.015), higher hemoglobin (p =
0.0008) and lower lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), an enzyme involved in energy
production in cells (p &lt; 0.0001). 

Predictive Factors to Identify Subgroups of mRCC Patients who may Benefit from
Treatment with Axitinib

In a separate retrospective analysis of two Phase 2 studies of axitinib, an
investigational compound being studied in mRCC, elevated diastolic blood
pressure (dBP &#8805; to 90 mmHg) was shown to be a predictor of clinical efficacy in
mRCC patients (n=109) treated with axitinib, an oral, selective inhibitor of
VEGFR 1, 2 and 3 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2 and 3). The
median overall survival for patients with at least one elevated dBP reading
(n=59) was about three times longer than patients with no elevation in dBP
(n=50) (130 weeks vs. 42 weeks, respectively; p &lt; 0.01). 

Advanced renal cell carcinoma, a rare but serious type of kidney cancer, is
among the most treatment-resistant tumors. Nearly 58,000 people in the United
States will be diagnosed with kidney cancer this year and nearly 13,000 people
will die from the disease. 

Pfizer is committed to further research in kidney cancer populations. Currently
underway are two Phase 3 trials studying the role of Sutent in adjuvant renal
cell carcinoma, immediately after surgery, in patients at risk for cancer
recurrence. Additionally, axitinib is being investigated in a Phase 3 clinical
trial for second-line therapy in mRCC. 

Phase 2 Study of Sunitinib Malate in First-line Hormone-Refractory Prostate
Cancer

Pfizer is also conducting clinical trials of sunitinib malate in other tumor
types, including prostate cancer, one of the most common cancers in men, with
more than 780,000 new cases diagnosed each year worldwide. Pfizer has initiated
a randomized Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of
sunitinib plus prednisone versus placebo and prednisone in metastatic HRPC
patients after disease progression on a docetaxel-based chemotherapy regimen. 

Positive data from a Phase 2 trial evaluating 55 patients with metastatic HRPC
will be presented this week at ASCO. In this study, sunitinib in combination
with docetaxel and prednisone appeared to be well-tolerated and showed
anti-tumor activity in patients with mHRPC, as indicated by both
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and RECIST-defined (Response Evaluation Criteria
In Solid Tumors) tumor responses.3

Findings showed anti-tumor activity of sunitinib in combination with docetaxel
and prednisone, with a PSA response occurring in 56 percent of patients with a
median time to PSA progression of 42.1 weeks. In addition, 53 percent of
patients on the study for longer than 12 weeks had a 30 percent or greater
decline in PSA at that time, and 22 percent of patients had a PSA drop to below
4.0 ng/mL. Out of 33 patients with measurable disease, 42 percent (n=14) had a
confirmed partial response and another 18 percent (n=6) had an initial partial
response. The median progression-free survival was 9.7 months (95 percent CI:
5.8, 10.4). 

In this study, the most commonly reported treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse
events were neutropenia (53 percent), leukopenia (28 percent), fatigue (17
percent), febrile neutropenia (15 percent), stomatitis (7 percent) and anorexia
(7 percent). 

"We continue to see encouraging results with Sutent across numerous cancers,
both as a single agent and in combination with standard therapies," said Dr.
Mace Rothenberg, head of oncology development at Pfizer. "Between Sutent and our
robust pipeline, we are committed to delivering tailored treatment options for
people living with cancer." 

About Axitinib

Axitinib is an oral, selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor
receptors 1, 2 and 3. Axitinib may work by inhibiting blood vessel formation,
which may starve tumors of blood supply needed for growth. Based on preclinical
studies, axitinib is being studied as both a single agent and in combination
with other cancer therapies across many tumor types. Axitinib is an
investigational agent and has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration or other global regulatory agencies. 

About Sutent&#174; (sunitinib malate)

Sutent is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of
gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) after disease progression on or
intolerance to imatinib mesylate and advanced/metastatic RCC. 

Sutent works by blocking multiple molecular targets implicated in the growth,
proliferation and spread of cancer. Two important Sutent targets, vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor
receptor (PDGFR), are expressed by many types of solid tumors and are thought to
play a crucial role in angiogenesis, the process by which tumors acquire blood
vessels, oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. Sutent also inhibits other
targets important to tumor growth, including KIT, FLT3 and RET. 

Important Sutent&#174; (sunitinib malate) Safety Information

Women of child bearing age who are (or become) pregnant during therapy should be
informed of the potential for fetal harm while on Sutent. 

Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below the lower limit
of normal (LLN) have been observed. Patients with concomitant cardiac conditions
should be carefully monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of congestive
heart failure. 

Patients should be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with
standard antihypertensive therapy. Complete blood counts (CBCs) with platelet
count and serum chemistries should be performed at the beginning of each
treatment cycle for patients receiving treatment with Sutent. 

The most common adverse reactions in advanced RCC and GIST clinical trials were
fatigue, asthenia, diarrhea, nausea, mucositis/stomatitis, vomiting, dyspepsia,
abdominal pain, constipation, hypertension, rash, hand-foot syndrome, skin
discoloration, altered taste, anorexia and bleeding.

&lt;p&gt;   * Drug to treat cocaine addiction fails in mid-stage trial&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Says has enough cash to continue ops till 2010 end&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shares touch a life-time low of 63 cents&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comments, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; May 29 (Reuters) - Catalyst Pharmaceutical Partners Inc
(CPRX.O) said its lead drug candidate to treat cocaine
addiction failed to meet its main goal in a mid-stage trial,
sending shares down as much as 70 percent to a life-time low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The failure of the trial is "a significant setback for
Catalyst, which is heavily dependent on this single product
candidate," Hapoalim Securities analyst Raghuram Selvaraju said
and downgraded the stock to "market underperform".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company, which reaffirmed that it had enough cash to
continue operations till the end of 2010, said the drug CPP-109
could not show that a significantly larger proportion of
subjects treated by it were cocaine-free during the last two
weeks of the treatment period, compared with a dummy drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it would determine the next steps
regarding the development of the drug based on the complete
analyses of the clinical trial data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Catalyst expects to complete the analyses during the third
quarter after fully unblinding the trial data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In March, Catalyst said it had halted enrollment of new
subjects in an ongoing mid-stage trial testing CPP-109 for the
treatment of methamphetamine addiction in order to extend its
cash resources into 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company had decided to instead convert that trial to a
smaller proof-of-concept study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have sufficient cash to complete the analysis of the
results from our cocaine trial, to complete our methamphetamine
proof-of-concept study and to continue our operations through
the end of 2010 without additional funding," Chief Executive
Patrick McEnany said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company were trading down 55 percent at 94
cents in early morning trade. It touched a life-time low of 63
cents early in the session.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Consolidated Banking, Maybe?

Clearly the cobbled-together oversight from various federal agencies was
ineffective to contain the current financial crisis that all but swallowed the
U.S. last year -- institutions such as but not limited to Citigroup (NYSE: C),
Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) and AIG (NYSE: AIG) --
and it remains in fairly close proximity to do so again. 

Several weeks ago, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner sent to Congress a
proposal to potentially to overall the current supervision of financial markets.
While much is still up in the air, it is now expected as early as mid-June 2009
that the Obama Administration will make a formal recommendation to Congress for
the creation of a single banking regulator to oversee the entire sector. It
would be hoped that if such a proposal were sent to Congress it would be
finalized by the end of the year to help resolve the current quagmire. 

Currently, a disconnected grouping of state and federal regulators oversee
financial institutions throughout the country. It is not anticipated that the
Obama Administration will propose the elimination of this so-called "Dual
Banking System." 

The new regulator would serve as primary regulator for the nationally chartered
banks and thrifts, serve as a secondary oversight for the more than 5,000

UTStarcom - Big Opportunities

We expect UTStarcom, Inc. (NASDAQ: UTSI), a provider of IP-based telecom
equipments, to receive further demand for its IPTV solutions as mobile TV
systems become increasingly popular in China and India due to nationwide
deployments of 3G wireless networks. 

UTStarcom's transformation from a mobile handset developer to an IPTV and
optical transport solutions provider has been favorably implemented. 

Moreover, the company's current valuation is below its net cash position. At the
end of the first quarter, the company had approximately $2.41/diluted share of
cash position with no outstanding debt. 

On the other hand, the markets for IPTV solutions and intelligent switching
products are highly competitive and this, together with global economic
weakness, may hinder efforts to improve the company's earnings power.

&lt;p&gt;Research explores biomarkers as potential predictors of sensitivity to treatment
ORLANDO, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer announced today results from studies evaluating the company`s
investigational anti-insulin growth factor- type 1 receptor (IGF-1R) antibody,
figitumumab (CP-751,871), in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A
total of three abstracts were presented at the 45th Annual American Society of
Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting in Orlando. 

"As we try to find the right drug to use in the right setting for each patient,
we are encouraged by these data, suggesting a relationship between tumor
histology and response to figitumumab," said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, senior vice
president of clinical development and medical affairs for Pfizer`s Oncology
Business Unit. "Given that patients with advanced NSCLC face a poor prognosis,
it is important to be able to identify specific patients who may benefit most
from different treatment options." 

Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide. NSCLC accounts for about 85
percent of lung cancer cases and remains difficult to treat, particularly in the
metastatic setting. Nearly 60 percent of NSCLC patients are diagnosed late with
Stage IIIB/IV advanced disease. In Stage IV patients, the five-year survival
rate is only two percent. For all stages of NSCLC, the five-year survival rate
is only 15 percent. 

Over 60 Percent Response Rate Observed in 56 Patients with Squamous Cell
Carcinoma NSCLC Treated with Chemotherapy Plus Figitumumab

A single-arm extension cohort (n=56) was conducted to confirm the preliminary
findings from a randomized Phase 2 study of 156 patients, which evaluated
overall response with figitumumab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel
in patients with NSCLC. The Phase 2 study suggested a dose-response relationship
in patients with squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. 

In the extension cohort study, 56 patients with non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC
(squamous cell, large cell, and not otherwise specified) were enrolled and
treated with figitumumab (20 mg/kg), plus carboplatin (AUC of 6) and paclitaxel
(200 mg/m2). As measured by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors), 27 out of 42 squamous cell patients (64.3 percent) demonstrated a
response. One complete and 26 partial responses were observed. In fifteen of the
26 partial responses, there was a 50 to 95 percent reduction in tumor size. Of
10 patients with large cell carcinoma/not otherwise specified tumors, two
partial responses were seen. 

"Despite improvements in treatment, NSCLC is a heterogeneous disease that
remains difficult to control," said Dr. Daniel Karp, director of The University
of TexasM. D. Anderson Cancer Center Clinical and Translational Research Center
(CTRC). "The striking reductions in tumor size seen in squamous NSCLC patients
treated with figitumumab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel are
encouraging for this patient population with limited treatment options." 

Twenty patients received single-agent figitumumab upon discontinuation of
chemotherapy. Reductions in tumor size with figitumumab maintenance treatment
were observed in two patients. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.7
months for the overall extension cohort (n=56), 5.9 months for patients with
squamous cell carcinoma (n=46) and 3 months for patients with large cell
carcinoma and not otherwise specified tumors (n=10). 

Figitumumab was generally well-tolerated in the extension cohort. The most
common grade 3/4 adverse events were hyperglycemia (11 percent), fatigue (7
percent), and neutropenia (5 percent). Hyperglycemia almost always occurred
within the first treatment cycle and was generally manageable with standard
measures. 

Free IGF-1 as a Plasma Biomarker That May Predict Response to Figitumumab

Results from translational research conducted as part of the randomized Phase 2
study of figitumumab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in NSCLC
patients suggest that the amount of biologically active free IGF-1 (fIGF-1) in
plasma may help predict which patients will respond to figitumumab therapy. A
total of 156 patients were enrolled in the Phase 2 portion of the study.
Baseline blood samples were obtained from 116 patients. 

High fIGF-1 appeared to be a marker for resistance to chemotherapy, with median
PFS as low as 2.1 months for patients in the highest fIGF-1 quartile (P=0.11).
Patients with elevated baseline fIGF-1 levels appeared particularly sensitive to
figitumumab. Study findings showed that adding figitumumab (20 mg/kg) to
chemotherapy in patients with high levels of fIGF-1 increased PFS, versus
treatment with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (by 3.4 months, 6 months vs. 2.6
months, respectively, P=0.001 for patients with fIGF-1 &gt;0.6 ng/mL, and by 3.9
months, 6 months vs. 2.1 months, respectively, p=0.001, for patients with fIGF-1
&gt;0.9 ng/mL). 

In summary, results from this study suggest that determining baseline levels of
free IGF-1 may contribute to the identification of patients who may respond to
treatment with figitumumab. 

Exploring Additional Biomarkers As Predictors of Sensitivity To Figitumumab In
NSCLC

Data presented at ASCO reports on IGF-1R pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) biomarkers that may inform the design of future trials of
figitumumab in advanced NSCLC. 

In this study, authors analyzed 151 blood samples from 42 patients enrolled in
the randomized Phase 2 study of figitumumab in combination with carboplatin and
paclitaxel in NSCLC patients. They observed elevated plasma levels of fIGF-1 in
patients with adenocarcinoma compared with those with squamous cell carcinoma
(P=0.0326) and with large cell carcinoma (P=0.026). 

In patients with squamous cell carcinoma, expression of fIGF-1 was greatest in
patients with objective partial responses, compared with those with stable
disease or progressive disease (P=0.02). 

A PFS advantage was observed with the addition of figitumumab to the
chemotherapy regimen of adenocarcinoma patients with fIGF-1 levels in the
highest quartile. In patients with adenocarcinoma, those receiving the highest
figitumumab dose (20 mg/kg) in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin and
in the highest quartile of fIGF-1, experienced the longest median PFS
(P=0.0039). 

In summary, these results suggest that IGF-1R overexpression and increased free
IGF-1 may be key independent mechanisms of sensitivity to figitumumab in NSCLC.
These findings warrant further investigation. 

Figitumumab Phase 3 Clinical Trial Program

Pfizer recently initiated a large global Phase 3 clinical trial program, ADVIGO
(ADVancing IGF-1R in Oncology), to further evaluate figitumumab in NSCLC.

About Figitumumab (CP-751,871)

Figitumumab, an investigational fully human monoclonal antibody, is a highly
specific inhibitor of the insulin growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) pathway. The
IGF-1R pathway is thought to be one of the fundamental signaling pathways that
leads to uncontrolled growth and survival of tumor cells, and may represent a
resistance mechanism against EGFR inhibitors and other anti-cancer therapies. 

In addition to NSCLC, Pfizer is studying figitumumab in clinical trials for the
potential treatment of other cancers, including prostate, breast and colon
cancers, and Ewing`s sarcoma. To date, more than 1,000 patients have
participated in figitumumab clinical trials in multiple tumor types.

&lt;p&gt;- Updated follow-up of time to progression and overall survival reported from
Phase 2 clinical trials with CDX-110 (PF-04948568) and temozolomide - 
ORLANDO, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and Celldex Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CLDX) today announced the
presentation of updated data from two clinical trials of CDX-110 in
newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) at the 45th Annual Meeting of the
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). CDX-110, an investigational
immunotherapeutic vaccine that targets the tumor-specific molecule, epidermal
growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII), was developed by Celldex
Therapeutics and is now partnered with Pfizer. 

"Data from the 40 evaluable patients in ACTIVATE and ACT II continue to suggest
that vaccination with CDX-110 may be able to improve time to tumor recurrence
and overall survival when used in patients with newly-diagnosed GBM. These data
also continue to suggest that tolerability and side effects associated with
CDX-110 are minimal. These results are very encouraging and we look forward to
the results from the ongoing multi-center ACT III Phase 2 study," said John H.
Sampson, MD, PhD, Associate Deputy Director of The Preston Robert Tisch Brain
Tumor Center at Duke University Medical Center. 

ACTIVATE Results:

In this single arm Phase 2 study, 18 patients with newly diagnosed and optimally
resected EGFRvIII-positive GBM received CDX-110 as a monotherapy following
completion of chemoradiation with concurrent temozolomide. Median overall
survival (OS) was 26 months and median time to progression (TTP) was 14.2
months. Additionally, three patients remain without relapse more than 4 years
from surgery and continue to receive the vaccine within the clinical trial. 

ACT II Results:

In this single arm Phase 2 study, 22 patients with newly diagnosed and optimally
resected EGFRvIII-positive GBM received CDX-110 in combination with maintenance
temozolomide after having completed chemoradiation with concurrent temozolomide.
Median time to progression (TTP) is 15.2 months and three patients continue
without relapse after more than two years. Results to date from this ongoing
study estimate median overall survival to be 23.6 months (data are not yet
final). In addition, and in line with preclinical data that suggested the
combination with temozolomide could augment immune responses, patients show
robust serological evidence of an immune response against EGFRvIII. 

Efficacy data from both ACTIVATE and ACT II compare favorably to data for a
historical control group of 17 patients, matched for EGFRvIII expression, extent
of resection and performance status (Median TTP: 6.3 months; Median OS: 15.0
months). In both studies, CDX-110 was generally well tolerated with local
injection site reactions being the most commonly reported toxicity. 

Additional Results:

In addition, preliminary data from a pilot study in a small number of patients
with newly diagnosed GBM will be presented. In this study, CDX-110 was given in
combination with daclizumab, an antibody that blocks suppressive T cells, to
determine whether this combination could further augment immune responses. This
data will be presented in a poster session on Sunday, May 31 from 8:00am -
12:00pm EDT. 

ACT III, a multicenter, single-arm Phase 2 clinical trial in GBM in which all
patients will receive CDX-110 in combination with maintenance temozolomide, is
ongoing. Total enrollment is expected to be approximately 60 patients. In
addition, Pfizer and Celldex are working on the design of a randomized Phase 2
study in GBM to compare CDX-110 plus standard of care to standard of care alone.


About CDX-110 (PF-04948568)

CDX-110 is an investigational immunotherapeutic vaccine that targets the
tumor-specific molecule epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII).
EGFRvIII is a mutated form of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that
is only expressed in cancer cells and not in normal tissue and is a transforming
oncogene that can directly contribute to cancer cell growth. It is reported to
be present in 25-40 percent of GBM tumors.

&lt;p&gt;Novel c-Met/ALK Inhibitor is the First Agent in Clinical Development to
Selectively Target Sub-group of NSCLC Patients
ORLANDO, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer announced today results from four studies highlighting clinical data with
targeted treatment approaches in patients with non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). Data on the company`s oral c-Met and ALK inhibitor (PF-02341066), an
investigational agent that selectively targets cancer-causing genes implicated
in the progression of many cancers, will be presented at the 45th American
Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Orlando. Additionally,
data on investigational agents PF-00299804 (pan-HER inhibitor), figitumumab
(CP-751,871) and axitinib (AG-13736) will also be presented at the meeting. 

"Pfizer is committed to improving outcomes for patients with NSCLC," said Dr.
Mace Rothenberg, senior vice president of clinical development and medical
affairs for Pfizer`s Oncology Business Unit. 

"We are learning that NSCLC is not a single entity but a family of cancers
driven by distinct molecular processes. We are using that information to develop
treatments that selectively shut down these processes. By knowing which process
may be driving a particular patient`s cancer, we move one step closer to
matching the right drug, in the right setting, for each patient." 

Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide. NSCLC accounts for about 85
percent of lung cancer cases and remains difficult to treat, particularly in the
metastatic setting. Nearly 60 percent of NSCLC patients are diagnosed late with
Stage IIIB/IV advanced disease. For Stage III/IV NSCLC, the five-year survival
rate is only 12 percent. 

c-Met/ALK Inhibitor Shows Early Clinical Activity

New study results from an expansion cohort of a Phase 1 study in patients with
NSCLC carrying the ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinases) fusion gene showed early
clinical activity with PF-02341066, a dual inhibitor of mesenchymal epithelial
transition growth factor (c-Met or hepatocyte growth factor), a receptor
commonly altered in human cancers across a variety of solid tumor types, and ALK
translocation genes. PF-02341066 is the first agent in clinical development that
selectively targets a unique genetic feature of cancer cells, echinoderm
microtubule-associate protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK translocation, present in some
NSCLC patients. 

In this expansion cohort study, among 19 NSCLC patients who had an EML4-ALK
mutation treated with PF-02341066, 10 have had a partial response, with three
unconfirmed; the duration of response has ranged from 2+ to 23+ weeks.
Additionally, five patients have had stable disease, with the duration of
response ranging from 8+ to 40 weeks. 

"PF-02341066 represents a new compound that is thought to inhibit two cancer
targets, c-MET and ALK. Inappropriate activation of one or both genes can lead
to cancer and drug resistance. Our Phase 1 trial was expanded to enroll patients
whose tumors had abnormalities in these genes to determine the effect of
PF-02341066 against their tumors," said Dr. Rothenberg. "We are encouraged by
the high proportion of patients whose tumors shrank substantially or stopped
growing. These data support further study of PF-02341066 for the potential
treatment of NSCLC and possibly other difficult-to-treat cancers." 

This expansion cohort was part of a dose-escalation study which enrolled 37
advanced cancer patients with various tumors, including NSCLC, colorectal,
pancreatic, sarcoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma tumors. The maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) was 250 mg twice daily. In this study, the most common
adverse events were nausea, emesis, fatigue and diarrhea. Three dose limiting
toxicities were observed and reversible, including Grade 3 ALT (alanine
aminotransferase) increase in one patient at 200 mg/day and Grade 3 fatigue in
two patients at the 300 mg/twice daily dose level.2

Phase 2 Results of Irreversible Pan-HER Inhibitor

An ongoing Phase 2 study of PF-00299804, an irreversible, oral, selective
pan-HER (human epidermal growth factor receptor) inhibitor, evaluated patients
with NSCLC whose tumors have progressed despite at least one chemotherapy
treatment and also prior treatment with erlotinib(&#8804;8 week). In pre-clinical
studies, PF-00299804 has been shown to block the signaling in both wild type and
mutant EGFR NSCLC, including forms which are resistant to reversible HER
inhibitors.3

The HER pathway, which includes HER-1, HER-2, HER-3 and HER-4 receptors, plays
an important role in human malignancies and mutations. 

Fifty-three patients with progressive NSCLC were treated with PF-00299804 (45
mg/day) and enrolled in two study arms: adenocarcinoma (n=47) and
non-adenocarcinoma (n=6). In the 43 patients evaluated for response, three
patients (7 percent) achieved a partial response and 26 patients (60.5 percent)
achieved stable disease &#8805;6 weeks, as measured by RECIST (Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors). Additionally, seven patients treated with PF-00299804
experienced clinical benefit, as defined by partial response plus stable disease
&#8805;6 months, including 5 adenocarcinoma and 2 non-adenocarcinoma patients. 

In the study, the most common Grade 3 adverse events included skin disorders
(15.1 percent) and diarrhea (13.2 percent). Three patients experienced Grade 4
pulmonary embolus/dyspnea, which was deemed possibly treatment-related. 

Figitumumab Shows Activity in NSCLC Patients with Squamous Histology

A single-arm extension cohort was conducted to confirm the preliminary findings
from a randomized Phase 2 study of 156 patients, which evaluated overall
response with figitumumab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in
patients with NSCLC. 

In the extension cohort, 56 patients with non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC (squamous,
large cell, and not otherwise specified) were enrolled and treated with
figitumumab (20 mg/kg), plus carboplatin (AUC of 6) and paclitaxel (200 mg/m2).
As measured by RECIST, 27 out of 42 squamous cell patients (64.3 percent)
demonstrated response. One complete response and 26 partial responses were
observed. Among the 26 partial responses, 15 patients had 50-95 percent
reduction in tumor size. Maintenance treatment (n=20) with figitumumab resulted
in tumor size reductions in two patients. Median progression-free survival (PFS)
was 5.7 months for the overall extension cohort, 5.9 months for patients with
squamous cell carcinoma and 3 months for patients with large cell/not otherwise
specified tumors. 

Figitumumab was generally well-tolerated in the extension cohort. The most
common Grade 3 and 4 adverse events were hyperglycemia (11 percent), fatigue (7
percent), and neutropenia (5 percent). Hyperglycemia almost always occurred
within the first treatment cycle and was generally manageable with standard
measures. 

Figitumumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, is a highly specific inhibitor
of the insulin growth factor type 1 receptor (IGF-1R) pathway. The IGF-1R
pathway is thought to be one of the fundamental signaling pathways that leads to
uncontrolled growth and survival of tumor cells, and may represent a resistance
mechanism against EGFR inhibitors and other anti-cancer therapies. 

Axitinib in Combination with Chemotherapy

Findings from a Phase 1 study of axitinib in combination with
paclitaxel/carboplatin or gemcitabine/cisplatin in patients with advanced NSCLC
and other solid tumors are being presented at ASCO. 

A total of 49 patients were enrolled in the study, including 28 in the axitinib
plus paclitaxel (200 mg/m2) and carboplatin (AUC of 6) arm, and 21 patients in
the axitinib plus gemcitabine (1,250 mg/m2) and cisplatin (80 mg/m2) arm.
Predominant tumor types in the study included NSCLC (34 percent), melanoma,
ovarian, and pancreatic cancer (8 percent each). 

In the study, 17 patients (34.7 percent) achieved an objective response,
including three complete responses (6.1 percent) and 14 partial responses (28.6
percent). An additional 14 patients had stable disease for 8 weeks. Objective
responses were observed in patients with the following tumor types: NSCLC (n=6),
ovarian (n=3), melanoma (n=3), head and neck, breast, cervical and carcinoid
(n=1 each). 

The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of axitinib was 5 mg twice daily, with no
apparent overlapping toxicities when combined with the standard chemotherapy
regimens. The most common treatment-related adverse events for axitinib combined
with either paclitaxel/carboplatin or gemcitabine/cisplatin were hypertension
(34.7 percent), diarrhea (30.6 percent) and fatigue (30.6 percent). 

Axitinib is an oral and selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth
factor receptors 1, 2 and 3 (VEGFR 1, 2, 3). Axitinib is an investigational
agent and is being studied as both a single agent and in combination with other
agents across many tumor types.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON May 31 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said
operations were normal at its 150,000 barrel per day (bpd) Los
Angeles-area refinery in Torrance, California, on Sunday
following a malfunction on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A Saturday morning furnace malfunction had a minimal impact
on production at the refinery, said Exxon spokesman Aarti
Ramachandran on Sunday. She declined to say to which unit the
furnace belonged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon reported unplanned flaring at the refinery to
California pollution regulators on Saturday.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON May 31 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N)
reported unplanned flaring at its 150,000 barrel per day (bpd)
Los Angeles-area refinery in Torrance, California, on Saturday,
according to notices filed with California pollution
regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The notices did not say why the refinery had to use its
safety flare system, which burns off hydrocarbons when they
cannot be processed normally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One notice said a breakdown was not the cause of the
flaring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Exxon representative was not immediately available to
discuss refinery operations.
