&lt;p&gt;(Adds decision made public, comments and background)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Karen Freifeld&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 1 (Reuters) - Trustees involved in JPMorgan
Chase &amp; Co's proposed $4.5 billion settlement with
investors in money-losing mortgage bonds accepted the bank's
offer on Friday for the vast majority of the trusts holding the
securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trustees rejected the deal for six of about 330 trusts
included in the offer, according to a notice posted on a website
run by the trustees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty seven trusts obtained an extension until Oct. 1 for
one or more loan groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan reached the $4.5 billion agreement in November with
21 institutional investors in 330 residential mortgage-backed
securities trusts issued by JPMorgan and Bear Stearns, which the
bank took over during the financial crisis. One of the trusts
was later excluded from the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement would resolve claims over misrepresentations
in the quality of mortgages packaged into securities before the
collapse of the U.S. housing market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trustees, who included Bank of New York Mellon,
Wells Fargo Bank and HSBC Bank USA faced a
Aug. 1 deadline for a decision on whether to accept the offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan does not have to go through with the $4.5 billion
deal if the number of trusts that reject the deal are in excess
of a confidential limit the parties negotiated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming it goes forward, the trustees will seek court
approval for the trusts that accept the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are pleased that the Trustees have accepted the
settlement for so many trusts," said Robert Madden, a lawyer
with Gibbs &amp; Bruns, the Houston law firm that represents the
institutional investors who struck the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the deal offers "enormous benefits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe the acceptance by the Trustees of the
overwhelming majority of the 330 trusts is a significant step
toward finalizing the settlement", a JPMorgan spokeswoman said
in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives of the trustees declined to comment or did
not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a July 17 report, an expert for the trustees, Daniel
Fischel, recommended that the proposed settlement be accepted
for 314 trusts and that the trustees consider rejecting the
settlement for 16 trusts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expert said that before rejecting the proposed
settlement for any trust, the trustee should be confident a
group of investors is willing to pursue claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 21 investors who agreed to the deal in November include
BlackRock Inc, Metlife Inc, Allianz SE's Pacific
Investment Management Company, the TCW Group and
Bayerische Landesbank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement does not include trusts issued by Washington
Mutual, which JPMorgan also acquired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The offer was announced last year just before JPMorgan
reached a $13 billion settlement with U.S. government
authorities over defective mortgages packed into securities
before the 2008 financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp reached a similar deal with an
investor group in June 2011. The bank agreed to pay $8.5 billion
to resolve claims by investors in securities issued by
Countrywide Financial Corp, which Bank of America acquired in
2008. A New York judge largely approved that deal in January,
although appeals are pending.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) on Friday, claiming the South Korean smartphone maker refused to make a royalty payment last fall on patent licenses after Microsoft announced its intention to acquire Nokia's (NOK1V.HE) handset business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate passed legislation on Friday authorizing 1,000 more visas for Afghan civilians who worked with American troops and diplomats - often risking their lives - sending the measure to the White House for President Barack Obama to sign into law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill, passed unanimously, expands the 2009 Special Immigrant Visa program to 4,000 from 3,000 visas. The House of Representatives passed the measure, also unanimously, on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measure is intended to assist Afghans who worked for Americans, mostly as interpreters and guides, during the 13-year-long war and to ease the difficult process of getting visas to come to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the Afghans have had to go into hiding while waiting for visas because the Taliban views them as traitors to their homeland because they worked for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Ken Wills)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Trustees representing investors in JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's (JPM.N) $4.5 billion settlement over money-losing mortgage-backed securities are expected to accept the bank's proposal for the vast majority of their trusts, according to a person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seven trustees overseeing the securities will accept the deal for all but perhaps two dozen of the 330 trusts included in the offer, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trustees may poll bondholders in some trusts to see if they would pursue claims if the offer is rejected, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan reached the $4.5 billion agreement in November with 21 institutional investors in 330 residential mortgage-backed securities trusts issued by JPMorgan and Bear Stearns, which it took over during the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trustees, including Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N) Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. [DBKGN.UL] and HSBC Bank USA, [HBABU.UL] face a Aug. 1 deadline for a decision on whether to accept the offer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan does not have to go through with the deal if the number of trusts that reject the deal are in excess of a confidential limit the parties negotiated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokesman declined comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An expert for the trustees, Daniel Fischel, said in a July 17 report that before a trustee rejects the proposed settlement for any trust, the trustee should be confident that there's a group willing to pursue claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the report, Fischel recommended that the proposed settlement be accepted for 314 trusts and that the trustees consider rejecting the settlement for 16 trusts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 21 investors who agreed to the deal in November include BlackRock Inc, Metlife Inc MET.N, Allianz SE's Pacific Investment Management Company ALVG.DE, the TCW Group and Bayerische Landesbank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement does not include trusts issued by Washington Mutual, which JPMorgan also acquired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal was announced just before JPMorgan reached a $13 billion settlement with U.S. government authorities over defective mortgages packed into securities before the 2008 financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting By Karen Freifeld)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the second-largest U.S. oil company, reported better-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday as higher energy prices offset rising expenses and production dips in Kazakhstan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron's reliance on higher crude oil and natural gas prices to boost results, even as production falls, mirrored results from rival Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) on Thursday, and underlined Wall Street's concerns that international energy giants were not replenishing reserves fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is spending more than $20 billion on five new projects it hopes will boost production 20 percent by 2017.

			ICON plc (NASDAQ: ICLR), today announced that Pfizer and Roche 
      have joined the ADDPLAN&#174; DF Consortium. The consortium was 
      founded in 2013 by Novartis Pharma AG, Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc., Eli 
      Lilly, and Aptiv Solutions, which is an ICON plc company leading the 
      design and implementation of adaptive trials. The goal of the ADDPLAN DF 
      Consortium is to develop methodologies and execution technologies that 
      improve dose-selection, which remains a major barrier to resolving high 
      failure rates in Phase III trials. Both Pfizer&#8217;s and Roche&#8217;s decision to 
      join the Consortium comes as more companies recognise the value of 
      adaptive design in improving decision making in exploratory development.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ADDPLAN DF Consortium statisticians are currently collaborating to 
      expand the utility of the Multiple Comparison Procedure and Modeling 
      (MCP-Mod) approach, specifically by developing robust methodology for 
      incorporating adaptive functionality. The current MCP-Mod&#160;procedure 
      enables Proof of Concept (PoC) and dose selection to be established in a 
      single trial. The ability to go beyond the current approach and 
      include&#160;interim decision making into the MCP-Mod procedure&#160;will build in 
      additional efficiency and flexibility.

      design, significantly strengthens the Consortium&#8217;s ability to develop 
      validated, regulatory-compliant software for the design and execution of 
      adaptive trials,&#8221; says Reinhard Eisebitt, Executive Vice President and 
      Head of ICON&#8217;s Adaptive Trial Innovation Center. &#8220;Since its formation 
      last year, the ADDPLAN DF Consortium has provided invaluable insight to 
      further enhance the software, including the addition of adaptive 
      dose-escalation functionality and more simulation metrics, improved 
      plotting functionalities for simulation results, and an extension to 
      documentation.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Could Pfizer (PFE.N) acquire GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) as a "plan B" after failing to land AstraZeneca (AZN.L)? It would be a stretch but not totally impossible, according to analysts at Berenberg Bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GSK&#8217;s market capitalization has slumped to $117 billion, or just under Pfizer&#8217;s failed offer for AstraZeneca, following weak quarterly results and a warning on full-year profits last week. [ID:nL6N0PY3FQ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer would have to offer a premium to that, but even if it paid $164 billion, or 20 pounds a share, with $74 billion in cash, it would still end up with a highly earnings-boosting deal, the bank said in a note on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is perhaps a stretch, but not totally unrealistic," the analysts wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, which has a market value of $183 billion, declined to be drawn this week on whether it would renew its bid for AstraZeneca later this year, as it is allowed to do, but said it was still considering big deals. [ID:nL2N0Q40JW]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buying a large British drug company is attractive to U.S.-based Pfizer because it would slash its tax bill by moving its tax address to Britain, in a process known as inversion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GSK and Pfizer already work together through the ViiV Healthcare joint venture in HIV/AIDS, which contains one of GSK's most promising new drugs, Tivicay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acquiring GSK would also bolster Pfizer's vaccine business and give it a leading position in respiratory medicine, even if GSK is struggling with competition in this field. There would be further potential to combine the two firm's mature products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are also good reasons for Pfizer to think very hard before considering a move on GSK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. company is keen to grow in cancer, but GSK has just sold this part of its business to Novartis (NOVN.VX), and it is instead bulking up in consumer healthcare, a area Pfizer quit some years back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GSK, meanwhile, has said its complex three-way Novartis deal could create new options, and there has been speculation of a possible break-up of the company several years down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"GSK may just be too large for Pfizer to handle, but as a plan B it has some merits," Berenberg concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Ben Hirschler; editing by Jane Baird)&lt;/p&gt;

      &#8220;Our second quarter earnings and cash flow were solid,&#8221; said Chairman 
      and CEO John Watson. &#8220;Current quarter earnings reflected stronger market 
      conditions for crude oil, although some of these benefits were offset by 
      lower production volumes as a result of planned maintenance activity at 
      Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan. Gains on asset sales also contributed to 
      our results, as we completed important sales under our three-year 
      divestment program.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Watson added, &#8220;We continue to make significant progress on our major 
      capital projects which are expected to underpin a 20 percent increase in 
      production by 2017 and enable significant growth in our cash flows. In 
      the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, our production is expected to benefit in 
      the near-term from start-up of the Jack/St. Malo Project later this year 
      and the Big Foot Project in 2015. In Australia, our Gorgon and 
      Wheatstone LNG projects continue to reach important interim milestones. 
      Gorgon remains on track for expected start-up in mid-2015. We are also 
      advancing the development of our liquids-rich, unconventional properties 
      in the United States, Canada and Argentina.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Recent upstream highlights include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Australia &#8211; All Gorgon Train 1 and common modules required for 
        first LNG have been delivered and installed on Barrow Island.
      
			
				Australia &#8211; The first deliveries arrived at the Wheatstone 
        Project&#8217;s Materials Offloading Facility. Preparations continue for 
        arrival of the first Train 1 process modules anticipated later this 
        year.
      
			
				Chad/Cameroon &#8211; Completed the sale of the company&#8217;s nonoperated 
        interest in a producing concession in Chad and the related export 
        pipeline interests in Chad and Cameroon for approximately $1.3 billion.
      
			
				Nigeria &#8211; Achieved initial production of product at the 
        Escravos Gas-to-Liquids facility.
      
			
				United States &#8211; Offshore hookup and commissioning is underway 
        at the Jack/St. Malo Project, which remains on track for expected 
        start-up in fourth quarter 2014.
      
			
				United States &#8211; The production platform has been installed 
        offshore at the nonoperated Tubular Bells development, and start-up is 
        expected in third quarter 2014.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We also completed work on several important downstream growth 
      investments,&#8221; said Watson. The company started commercial production at 
      its new premium lubricants base oil facility in Pascagoula, Mississippi, 
      and completed the expansion of its Singapore additives plant. Chevron 
      Phillips Chemical Company LLC, the company&#8217;s 50 percent-owned affiliate, 
      achieved start-up of the world&#8217;s largest on-purpose 1-hexene plant, with 
      a capacity of 250,000 metric tons per year, at its Cedar Bayou complex 
      in Baytown, Texas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company purchased $1.25 billion of its common stock in the second 
      quarter 2014 under its share repurchase program.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			UPSTREAM
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Worldwide net oil-equivalent production was 2.55 million barrels per day 
      in second quarter 2014, down from 2.58 million barrels per day in the 
      2013 second quarter. Production increases from project ramp-ups in the 
      United States, Nigeria, Brazil and Argentina were more than offset by 
      price and other production entitlement effects in several locations, 
      normal field declines, and maintenance-related downtime at 
      Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan.

      U.S. upstream earnings of $1.05 billion in second quarter 2014 were down 
      $29 million from a year earlier, as gains on asset sales and stronger 
      crude oil and natural gas realizations were more than offset by 
      additional depreciation, exploration and operating expenses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company&#8217;s average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural 
      gas liquids was $92.44 in second quarter 2014, up from $92.25 a year 
      ago. The average sales price of natural gas was $4.09 per thousand cubic 
      feet, compared with $3.78 in last year&#8217;s second quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net oil-equivalent production of 667,000 barrels per day in second 
      quarter 2014 was up 8,000 barrels per day, or 1 percent, from a year 
      earlier. Production increases in the Permian Basin in Texas and New 
      Mexico and the Marcellus Shale in western Pennsylvania were partially 
      offset by normal field declines elsewhere.
			The net liquids 
      component of oil-equivalent production increased 1 percent in the 2014 
      second quarter to 460,000 barrels per day, while net natural gas 
      production also increased 1 percent, to 1.24 billion cubic feet per day.

      International upstream earnings of $4.21 billion increased $344 million 
      from second quarter 2013. The increase between quarters was primarily 
      due to a gain on the sale of interests in Chad and Cameroon and higher 
      realizations and sales volumes for crude oil, partially offset by higher 
      exploration and depreciation expenses. Foreign currency effects 
      decreased earnings by $147 million in the 2014 quarter, compared with an 
      increase of $275 million a year earlier.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The average sales price for crude oil and natural gas liquids in second 
      quarter 2014 was $101.15 per barrel, up from $93.71 a year earlier. The 
      average price of natural gas was $5.98 per thousand cubic feet, compared 
      with $5.93 in last year&#8217;s second quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net oil-equivalent production of 1.88 million barrels per day in second 
      quarter 2014 was down 45,000 barrels per day, or 2 percent, from a year 
      ago. Production increases from project ramp-ups in Nigeria, Brazil and 
      Argentina were more than offset by price and other production 
      entitlement effects in several locations and greater maintenance and 
      turnaround downtime at Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan. The negative effect 
      of price and other production entitlement effects and planned 
      maintenance was approximately 55,000 barrels per day. The net liquids 
      component of oil-equivalent production decreased 2 percent to 1.23 
      million barrels per day, while net natural gas production decreased 3 
      percent to 3.86 billion cubic feet per day.

      U.S. downstream operations earned $517 million in second quarter 2014 
      compared with earnings of $138 million a year earlier. The increase was 
      mainly due to higher earnings from the 50 percent-owned Chevron Phillips 
      Chemical Company LLC and stronger margins on refined product sales. 
      Higher gains from asset sales also contributed to the increase.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Refinery crude oil input of 761,000 barrels per day in second quarter 
      2014 decreased 53,000 barrels per day from the year-ago period. The 
      decrease was primarily due to a significant planned turnaround at the 
      refinery in El Segundo, California in the current quarter, partly offset 
      by higher volumes at the refinery in Richmond, California reflecting 
      re-start of the crude unit during the prior-year period. Refined product 
      sales of 1.19 million barrels per day were down 25,000 barrels per day 
      from second quarter 2013, mainly as a result of the turnaround in El 
      Segundo. Branded gasoline sales were essentially flat with the 
      comparative period at 525,000 barrels per day.

      International downstream operations earned $204 million in second 
      quarter 2014 compared with $628 million a year earlier. The decrease was 
      mainly due to lower margins on refined product sales and an unfavorable 
      change in effects on derivative instruments. Foreign currency effects 
      decreased earnings by $84 million in the 2014 quarter, compared with an 
      increase of $30 million a year earlier.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Refinery crude oil input of 844,000 barrels per day in second quarter 
      2014 decreased 28,000 barrels per day from the year-ago period. Total 
      refined product sales of 1.55 million barrels per day in the 2014 second 
      quarter were essentially flat with the year-ago period.

      Net charges in second quarter 2014 were $320 million, compared with $350 
      million in the year-ago period. The change between periods was mainly 
      due to the absence of the 2013 impairment of a power-related equity 
      affiliate and lower corporate charges. This decrease was largely offset 
      by higher corporate tax items.

      in 2013 for the company&#8217;s share of expenditures by affiliates, which did 
      not require cash outlays by the company. Work progressed during 2014 on 
      a number of major capital projects, including the Gorgon and Wheatstone 
      LNG projects in Australia and the Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot projects in 
      the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Expenditures for upstream represented 93

			This press release contains forward-looking statements relating to 
      Chevron&#8217;s operations that are based on management&#8217;s current 
      expectations, estimates and projections about the petroleum, chemicals 
      and other energy-related industries. Words such as &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; 
      &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;targets,&#8221; &#8220;forecasts,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221;

      &#8220;budgets,&#8221; &#8220;outlook&#8221; and similar expressions are intended to identify 
      such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of 
      future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and 
      other factors, many of which are beyond the company&#8217;s control and are 
      difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ 
      materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking 
      statements. The reader should not place undue reliance on these 
      forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this 
      press release. Unless legally required, Chevron undertakes no obligation 
      to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result 
      of new information, future events or otherwise.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ 
      materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: changing 
      crude oil and natural gas prices; changing refining, marketing and 
      chemicals margins; actions of competitors or regulators; timing of 
      exploration expenses; timing of crude oil liftings; the competitiveness 
      of alternate-energy sources or product substitutes; technological 
      developments; the results of operations and financial condition of 
      equity affiliates; the inability or failure of the company&#8217;s 
      joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and development 
      activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production 
      from existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; 
      potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned 
      projects; the potential disruption or interruption of the company&#8217;s 
      production or manufacturing facilities or delivery/transportation 
      networks due to war, accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe 
      weather or crude oil production quotas that might be imposed by the 
      Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; the potential liability 
      for remedial actions or assessments under existing or future 
      environmental regulations and litigation; significant investment or 
      product changes required by existing or future environmental statutes, 
      regulations and litigation; the potential liability resulting from other 
      pending or future litigation; the company&#8217;s future acquisition or 
      disposition of assets and gains and losses from asset dispositions or 
      impairments; government-mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, 
      industry-specific taxes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on 
      scope of company operations; foreign currency movements compared with 
      the U.S. dollar; the effects of changed accounting rules under generally 
      accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; and 
      the factors set forth under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; on pages 27 
      through 29 of the company&#8217;s 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In 
      addition, such results could be affected by general domestic and 
      international economic and political conditions. Other unpredictable or 
      unknown factors not discussed in this press release could also have 
      material adverse effects on forward-looking statements.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - "Hundreds" of Chinese employees at Microsoft Corp's Nokia phone business protested on Friday against mass layoffs that the U.S. tech company announced last month, according to an employee present and pictures posted on social media networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protesters held banners and shouted slogans against "Microsoft's hostile takeover and violent layoffs" for five hours until "they had sore throats," said the employee who participated in the demonstration and so declined to be identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protesters would convene on Friday afternoon to discuss demands they would present to the company, the employee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft announced on July 17 the deepest job cuts in its 39-year history, amounting to 18,000 positions.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Trustees involved in JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's (JPM.N) proposed $4.5 billion settlement with investors in money-losing mortgage bonds accepted the bank's offer on Friday for the vast majority of the trusts holding the securities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustees rejected the deal for six of about 330 trusts included in the offer, according to a notice posted on a website run by the trustees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty seven trusts obtained an extension until Oct. 1 for one or more loan groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan reached the $4.5 billion agreement in November with 21 institutional investors in 330 residential mortgage-backed securities trusts issued by JPMorgan and Bear Stearns, which the bank took over during the financial crisis. One of the trusts was later excluded from the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement would resolve claims over misrepresentations in the quality of mortgages packaged into securities before the collapse of the U.S. housing market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trustees, who included Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N), Wells Fargo Bank [WFC.UL] and HSBC Bank USA [HBABU.UL] faced a Aug. 1 deadline for a decision on whether to accept the offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan does not have to go through with the $4.5 billion deal if the number of trusts that reject the deal are in excess of a confidential limit the parties negotiated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming it goes forward, the trustees will seek court approval for the trusts that accept the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are pleased that the Trustees have accepted the settlement for so many trusts," said Robert Madden, a lawyer with Gibbs &amp; Bruns, the Houston law firm that represents the institutional investors who struck the deal.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the deal offers "enormous benefits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe the acceptance by the Trustees of the overwhelming majority of the 330 trusts is a significant step toward finalizing the settlement", a JPMorgan spokeswoman said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives of the trustees declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a July 17 report, an expert for the trustees, Daniel Fischel, recommended that the proposed settlement be accepted for 314 trusts and that the trustees consider rejecting the settlement for 16 trusts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expert said that before rejecting the proposed settlement for any trust, the trustee should be confident a group of investors is willing to pursue claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 21 investors who agreed to the deal in November include BlackRock Inc, Metlife Inc (MET.N), Allianz SE's Pacific Investment Management Company (ALVG.DE), the TCW Group and Bayerische Landesbank [BAYLN.UL].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement does not include trusts issued by Washington Mutual, which JPMorgan also acquired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The offer was announced last year just before JPMorgan reached a $13 billion settlement with U.S. government authorities over defective mortgages packed into securities before the 2008 financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) reached a similar deal with an investor group in June 2011. The bank agreed to pay $8.5 billion to resolve claims by investors in securities issued by Countrywide Financial Corp, which Bank of America acquired in 2008. A New York judge largely approved that deal in January, although appeals are pending. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Karen Freifeld; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARIS (Reuters) - French police arrested an officer on Saturday whom they suspect of stealing some 52 kg (115 pounds) of cocaine, worth around 2 million euros ($2.69 million), from a locked room inside central police headquarters in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police discovered on Friday that the cocaine, which was seized in a raid in July and then kept in a locker inside the headquarters overlooking the Seine river, had disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security camera footage helped investigators to identify a man entering the anti-drugs squad's quarters with two bags on the night of July 24 and leaving shortly after, police said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other officers helped to identify the man as a member of the Paris anti-drugs unit and he was tracked down and arrested in southern France, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A police source said the officer, 30, had been arrested in the southern city of Perpignan, near the border with Spain, during a raid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the second time this year that the Paris police headquarters at 36 Quai des Orfevres has been involved in scandal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, two officers from an anti-gang squad were placed under investigation after they were accused of having raped a 34-year-old Canadian woman visiting Paris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Nicholas Vinocur and Nicolas Bertin; Editing by Stephen Powell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 3 (Reuters) - Paul Parker, the former global
head of mergers and acquisitions (M) at Barclays Plc,
has joined Goldman Sachs Group Inc as co-chairman of its
mergers and acquisitions division, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs
said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parker is one of the world's most accomplished M bankers,
having recently advised Valeant Pharmaceuticals International
Inc on its roughly $50 billion bid for Botox maker
Allergan Inc and Comcast Corp on a $42 billion
takeover of rival cable group Time Warner Cable Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parker, a Lehman Brothers veteran who left Barclays in May, 
is expected to assume his new role in the next couple of weeks,
the Goldman Sachs spokesman said, confirming an earlier report
in the Financial Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack Levy and Tim Ingrassia will continue in their roles as 
co-chairmen of mergers and acquisitions and share that title
with Parker, who is expected to handle some of the investment
bank's most important client relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gene Sykes and Gregg Lemkau will continue to manage Goldman
Sachs' global M business, the spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parker was just one of a number of high-profile departures

the United States.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street firms led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc are close to buying a stake in chat and instant messaging startup Perzo Inc in pursuit of an alternative to a similar application from Bloomberg LP, sources familiar with Goldman's plans said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are trying to cut costs as sluggish trading volumes and higher regulation weigh on revenues. Bloomberg has dominated messaging on Wall Street for years, but its application is part of a data, trading and news terminal that costs about $20,000 a year. The Perzo applications are free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several banks and asset managers are considering an investment in Perzo, including Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Bank of America Corp, Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings PLC, BlackRock Inc and the hedge fund Maverick Capital Ltd, said two sources briefed on the matter who declined to comment publicly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies, which have received term sheets for the deal and signed non-disclosure agreements in recent days, either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment in time for publication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokespeople declined to comment on its Perzo investment, its plans to develop a chat program or its use of Bloomberg terminals. Bloomberg declined to comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perzo is a Palo Alto, California-based startup founded by David Gurle, who declined a request for comment. Perzo&#8217;s application differs from Bloomberg's in that it is "open-source," meaning customers can plug it into their systems and alter it as they see fit, whereas Bloomberg customers have to buy the entire terminal, and can't just buy the messaging system and adapt it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks have been looking for messaging alternatives to Bloomberg's closed system for years and have had limited success because the Bloomberg system is used by so many on Wall Street. One source compared Bloomberg to Blackberry, whose product dominated the smart phone market until Apple came out with its iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomson Reuters, which competes with Bloomberg in news, data and analytics, has a chat system with more than 200,000 users in its directory, compared with Bloomberg's 320,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomson Reuters has also collaborated with price data provider Markit and banks including Goldman Sachs to create an open messaging network.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokespeople declined to comment on its use of Thomson Reuters terminals. Reuters spokespeople declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's unclear what effect a successful new messaging system might have on Goldman's orders for Bloomberg terminals, or whether Goldman would use Bloomberg&#8217;s messaging system alongside the new application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bloomberg is a very tough ecosystem to break," said Jefferies analyst Dan Dolev. "People say it is the most expensive social network system in the world." Bloomberg's rise began in the 1980s when it became a prime source for data and analytics about bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Messaging applications play a critical role in the daily functioning of Wall Street. An underwriter will use messaging programs to tell investors where a bond has priced. Hedge fund managers use messaging applications to talk about trading ideas, and traders use them to talk to sales staff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To succeed, a bank messaging system must be secure, because of the sensitive information transmitted through the application. It must allow for central monitoring, so compliance staff and other officials can monitor conversations to make sure the bank is following securities trading regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROJECT BABEL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has been looking at alternatives to Bloomberg's messaging program for years, and launched a project internally called "Babel" in early 2013 to develop a competitor, according to two sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As that project was underway, the bank learned that reporters in Bloomberg's news division had access to information about bank professionals that it assumed had been private, such as when an employee had last logged into his or her terminal, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery strained relationships between Bloomberg and Goldman, as well as other large financial clients. Bloomberg publicly apologized and changed its policy to bar reporters from accessing client data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Babel project has been led by Goldman&#8217;s Chief Information Officer R. Martin Chavez, who has spent much of his career building technology for the Wall Street bank, the sources said. Darren Cohen, who heads Goldman's principal strategic investments group, got involved when it was decided that it might be easier to simply buy a startup that already had technology that could help meet Babel's goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman recently reached out to other banks to get them involved, the sources said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra and Jennifer Saba in New York.; Editing by Dan Wilchins and John Pickering)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aug 4 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc is
jettisoning less-profitable hedge-fund clients and raising fees
on others as it tries to adapt to new banking rules, the Wall
Street Journal reported on Monday, citing people familiar with
the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank has told hedge fund clients the regulations have
forced it to set aside more capital, crimping profits at its
prime-brokerage business, which executes and finances the funds'
trades, the newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investment bank is also pulling the firm's own cash out
of its largest internal hedge fund to comply with the new
regulations, the Journal reported, citing sources. (on.wsj.com/1s6mKyj)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move is part of an attempt by Wall Street banks to scale
down from capital-intensive businesses in order to comply with
stricter capital requirements by U.S. regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is urging funds to take back the cash they hold in
their accounts, charging clients more to finance trades and
imposing monthly fees more often on fund managers for
maintaining untapped credit lines with the bank, the Journal
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, Goldman has stopped serving clients that
produce little or no returns for the firm, according to the
Journal.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 4 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co on
Monday pegged its possible legal costs in excess of litigation
reserves at $4.6 billion at the end of June, up from $4.5
billion at the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also disclosed that it is responding to

			Walt Whitman and The Soul Children of Chicago, by Special White House 
      Invitation, to Perform before 47 African Nations at Kennedy Center
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The U.S. Africa Leaders Summit, on August 4-6
			in Washington, 
      D.C., will feature the internationally acclaimed youth gospel choir, 
      Walt Whitman and The Soul Children of Chicago.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dr. Walt Whitman, the choir&#8217;s founder and director, was invited by 
      special invitation from First Lady Michelle Obama to perform at a very 
      exclusive luncheon at the Kennedy Center for the First Ladies of 47 
      nations from the continent of Africa.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The honor of being presented by our nation to the nations as 
      ambassadors and diplomats representing Chicago and the United States, is 
      the highest honor that we have achieved in our 33-year history of our 
      organization,&#8221; said Whitman.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The theme of the U.S. Africa Leaders Summit is &#8220;Investing in the Next 
      Generation.&#8221; Focusing on the next generation is at the core of a 
      government&#8217;s responsibility and work, and this Summit is an opportunity 
      to discuss ways of stimulating growth, unlocking opportunities, and 
      creating an enabling environment for the next generation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Grammy Award winning Soul Children of Chicago was the only youth 
      group that was asked to participate in this week&#8217;s symposium. Walt 
      Whitman developed this world-class performance group (ages 7-17) with a 
      single purpose: to utilize music as a motivator and catalyst to inspire 
      young people throughout the world to have faith in themselves, each 
      other, and God. After 33 years, their performances continue to be 
      powerful, magnetic, and inspirational.

		&lt;h1&gt;FireEye to Discuss Advanced Android "VIP Attacks" and Microsoft PowerShell Attacks at Black Hat USA 2014&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;MILPITAS, CA--(Marketwired - Aug 4, 2014) -  FireEye, Inc. (NASDAQ: FEYE), the leader in stopping today's advanced cyber attacks, today announced it is hosting three briefings at Black Hat USA 2014: an advanced attack against Android phones; how to identify attacks leveraging Microsoft PowerShell; and how Planet Earth has become hackers' playground via command and control operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first briefing will address "Sidewinder Targeted Attacks," also known as VIP attacks, which target victims by intercepting location information reported from aggressive ad libraries that utilize the Android platform. These aggressive ad libraries leak user information and allow for Android devices to be hijacked by attackers to gain total control (for example, send texts, turn on/off cameras and microphones and much more). To learn more, attend:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What: Sidewinder Targeted Attack Against Android in the Golden Age of Ad Libs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who: Tao Wei, senior staff research scientist, FireEye and Yulong Zhang, senior software research engineer, FireEye&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When: August 7th, 10:15 - 11:15am &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where: Mandalay Bay, South Seas GH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second briefing will provide an overview of how Microsoft admin tools such as PowerShell have become strong surrogates for malware and how to remedy this issue. This presentation will focus on common attack patterns performed through PowerShell, and offer advice on identifying and preventing such attacks. To learn more, attend:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What: Investigating PowerShell Attacks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who: Ryan Kazanciyan, technical director, Mandiant and author Matt Hastings, consultant, Mandiant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When: August 7th, 3:30 - 4:30pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where: Mandalay Bay, South Seas GH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third briefing draws a new map of Planet Earth, based not on traditional parameters, but on hacker command and control (C2) communications. The primary data points used in this worldwide cyber survey are more than 30 million malware callbacks to over 200 countries and territories over an 18-month period, from January 2013 to June 2014. To learn more, attend:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What: Leviathan: Command And Control Communications On Planet Earth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who: Kevin Thompson, threat analyst, FireEye and Kenneth Geers, independent researcher and former senior global threat analyst, FireEye&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When: August 7th, 10:15 - 11:15am &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where: Mandalay Bay, South Seas F&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also visit the FireEye booth (#411) to learn more about emerging cybersecurity threats. Copies of the newly released Incident Response  Computer Forensics, Third Edition by Jason Luttgens, Matthew Pepe, and Kevin Mandia will also be available at the booth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About FireEye, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FireEye has invented a purpose-built, virtual machine-based security platform that provides real-time threat protection to enterprises and governments worldwide against the next generation of cyber attacks. These highly sophisticated cyber attacks easily circumvent traditional signature-based defenses, such as next-generation firewalls, IPS, anti-virus, and gateways. The&#160;FireEye Threat Prevention Platform&#160;provides real-time, dynamic threat protection without the use of signatures to protect an organization across the primary threat vectors and across the different stages of an attack life cycle. The core of the FireEye platform is a virtual execution engine, complemented by dynamic threat intelligence, to identify and block cyber attacks in real time.

			IBM and Dow Collaboration Delivers Sustainable Solutions in Ethiopia 
      While Building Employee Leadership Skills
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Company Employees Partner with International Medical Corps to Address 
      Sanitation Issues in Ethiopia
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dow&#8217;s (NYSE:DOW) Leadership 
      in Action (LIA) program and IBM&#8217;s 
      Corporate Service Corps have come together with the assistance of 
      nonprofit, PYXERA 
      Global, to deliver sustainable solutions in Ethiopia while providing 
      unique leadership development opportunities for participating employees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Five employees from Dow and three from IBM will participate in a joint 
      global pro bono project with International 
      Medical Corps (IMC) that will promote and support a campaign to 
      improve sanitation and hygiene behavior in the community of Wolayita. 
      IMC delivers health care services to those impacted by war, natural 
      disaster and disease with programs that focus on training and helping 
      devastated populations return to self-reliance. Through this effort, 
      Dow&#8217;s team will create a social marketing program to drive behavioral 
      changes required to create sustained resilience - the ability of 
      citizens and government to survive, thrive, or even avoid natural or 
      man-made crises, such as illness, fuel and food shortages, storms or 
      drought. IBM will assess, recommend, and design methodologies that can 
      measure how resilient a community is, particularly in the realm of 
      public health.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PYXERA Global facilitates these types of programs to aid companies 
      entering new geographies. The nonprofit, which identifies high-impact 
      organizations in emerging and frontier economies such as IMC, 
      accelerates understanding of existing needs in these markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Collaboration is instrumental in a project of this scope because no one 
      company holds all the solutions to the world&#8217;s problems,&#8221; said Michelle 
      Langley, Program Leader for Dow Sustainability Corps, Global Disaster 
      Relief and STEM. &#8220;More than 35 percent of the world&#8217;s population lacks 
      access to improved sanitation. By aligning strategies and leveraging 
      each other&#8217;s employee talent, Dow and IBM can leave a lasting impact on 
      the region.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "By bringing together the top talent and emerging leaders at IBM and 
      Dow, we are able to strengthen the impact we make on the community as 
      well as deepen the experience for the employees, ultimately building 
      lifelong relationships and sustainable solutions," said Gina Tesla, 
      Director, IBM Corporate Citizenship.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This project is just one example of how both companies offer unique 
      leadership development opportunities to employees. In addition to the 
      five Dow employees working with IBM, an additional 36 employees are 
      working on projects that address health, education and commerce.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;International Medical Corps will be able to reach Wolayita community 
      far more effectively as a result of this joint effort,&#8221; said Deirdre 
      White, CEO of PYXERA Global. &#8220;Companies like Dow and IBM are playing a 
      pivotal role in strengthening the ability of organizations throughout 
      Africa to better serve communities. We&#8217;re seeing this across a host of 
      issues areas from clean water and sanitation to infrastructure 
      education, healthcare, and technology.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Employees participating in LIA have worked virtually for several months 
      in preparation for their trip to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in August to 
      meet with their NGO partners. Dow and IBM employees have been 
      collaborating during this time, together with PYXERA Global, in 
      preparation for their sanitation awareness project. Both companies are 
      building stronger community ties in the region and instilling long 
      lasting skills for employees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;When you lead a team there are no manuals or &#8216;how to&#8217; documents. You 
      have to use your experiences and make the best decisions at the time,&#8221; 
      said John Kolmer, Dow Human Resources manager, Global Leadership 
      Development. &#8220;This program gives people that real life experience by 
      pushing them out of their comfort zone, and encouraging them to interact 
      with people from different cultures and areas of expertise.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dow&#8217;s LIA is a collaboration between Dow 
      Sustainability Corps (DSC) and Human Resources. DSC is part of Dow&#8217;s 
      approach to meet the world&#8217;s most basic needs by matching interested and 
      capable employees with NGOs, social entrepreneurs and local government 
      agencies that need support for sustainable development projects, 
      especially in emerging geographies and areas of growth for Dow. LIA 
      leverages the strengths of DSC and the company&#8217;s Human Resources 
      function to generate exceptional leadership development opportunities 
      for participating employees and the NGO partners.

      Bio2Electric, LLC Establishes EcoCatalytic Technologies to Develop New 
      Catalyst Technology
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Receives three year, $3.8M
			award for ethylene and propylene 
      production
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Bio2Electric, LLC, dba EcoCatalytic Technologies, received a three year, 
      $3.8 million award from the Advanced Research Project Agency - Energy 
      (ARPA-E) to develop a new catalyst technology for ethylene and propylene 
      production from components of natural gas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The confluence of low cost natural gas in the U.S. and the need to 
      reduce environmental emissions provides significant opportunity for 
      innovation,&#8221; said EcoCatalytic Technologies CEO Dr. John Sofranko.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ethylene and propylene are the largest volume building blocks in the 
      organic chemical industry, with more than 750 million tons per year 
      produced globally. These are then transformed into plastics such as PE, 
      PP and PET -- which are ultimately used in thousands of consumer 
      products.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The current technology for ethylene and propylene production remains 
      energy intensive and emits more than 1.5 tons of carbon dioxide for 
      every ton produced. The new EcoCatalytic technology could reduce the CO2 
      footprint by more than 90 percent and eliminates the release of NOx and 
      SOx pollutants.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      EcoCatalytic Technologies is working with North Carolina State 
      University, Particulate Solid Research, Inc. of Chicago, and KBR, Inc. 
      of Houston to develop the new catalyst technologies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) should not obstruct an anti-trust investigation by Chinese regulators, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) said on Monday, the latest shot fired by China's government at the U.S. software giant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SAIC has questioned Microsoft's lawyer, Deputy General Counsel Mary Snapp, who was at the regulator's offices on Monday, a spokesman for the SAIC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the SAIC said it was formally investigating Microsoft for breach of anti-trust rules and had raided four of the software firm's offices in China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft promised to respect Chinese law and fully cooperate with the SAIC's investigation work," the SAIC said in an e-mailed statement. Microsoft declined to provide immediate comment, but last week said its "business practices are designed to be compliant with Chinese law."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The warning is likely a preemptive step in the course of the government's investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think the government is saying Microsoft has already done anything to obstruct the investigation, otherwise they would have publicized it," said You Yunting, a senior partner at Shanghai DeBund Law Offices. "In China, you do everything you have to to completely submit if the authorities investigate you. The government is saying, 'We might be more lenient if you don't resist, otherwise we'll be tough'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been suspected of violating China's anti-monopoly law since June last year in relation to problems with compatibility, bundling and document authentication, the SAIC said last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But industry experts have questioned how exactly Microsoft is violating anti-trust regulations in China, where the size of its business is negligible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. company has taken a public beating in China in recent months. It has been subject to wider scrutiny against U.S. technology firms in China in the wake of former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's cyber espionage revelations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has also seen service for its OneDrive cloud storage service disrupted in China, and had its latest Windows 8 operating system banned from being installed on the central government's new computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Paul Carsten, Gerry Shih and Beijing Newsroom; Editing by Miral Fahmy and Ian Geoghegan)&lt;/p&gt;

quarterly profit blew past Wall Street expectations, with a

$86.90 after closing at $86.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said the company's earnings
per share for the first three quarters of fiscal 2014 were 
greater than any previous full fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our strategy of building strong brands and franchises
continues to create great value across our company," Iger said
in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operating income at Disney's media networks division was
flat at $2.3 billion and declined 7 percent for the unit's cable

companies to increase Disney's scale as other media companies
plan mergers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger said the company felt confident Disney can "continue to
mine growth from the channel properties that we own."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We like the hand that we have," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lisa Richwine and Lehar Maan; Editing by Maju

      The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) today reported third quarter 
      earnings, which are a record for any quarter. Diluted earnings per share 
      (EPS) for the third quarter increased 27% to $1.28 from $1.01 in the 
      prior-year quarter. Excluding certain items affecting comparability(1), 
      EPS for the quarter increased 24% to $1.28 from $1.03 in the prior-year 
      quarter. Diluted EPS for the nine months ended June&#160;28, 2014 increased 
      30% to $3.40 compared to $2.61 in the prior-year period. Excluding 
      certain items affecting comparability, EPS for the nine months increased 
      31% to $3.43.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our strategy of building strong brands and franchises continues to 
      create great value across our company,&#8221; said Robert A. Iger, chairman 
      and CEO of The Walt Disney Company. &#8220;This quarter we delivered the 
      highest EPS in the company&#8217;s history, and we&#8217;ve now generated greater 
      EPS in the first three quarters of FY 2014 than we have in any previous 
      full fiscal year. We&#8217;re extremely pleased with these results and we are 
      also thrilled with the spectacular performance of Guardians of the 
      Galaxy, which holds great promise as a new franchise for our company 
      and once again reinforces the tremendous value of Marvel.&#8221;

			Cable Networks
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Operating income at Cable Networks decreased 7% to $1.9 billion for the 
      quarter due to a decrease at ESPN, partially offset by an increase at 
      ABC Family. The decrease at ESPN was due to higher programming and 
      production costs, decreased recognition of previously deferred revenue 
      and the absence of ESPN UK, which was sold in the fourth quarter of the 
      prior year. These decreases were partially offset by affiliate fee 
      contractual rate increases and higher advertising revenue. Programming 
      and production costs increases were driven by a contractual rate 
      increase for Major League Baseball and the addition of FIFA World Cup 
      soccer, partially offset by the absence of X Games events in the current 
      quarter. ESPN recognized $98 million less of previously deferred revenue 
      during the quarter as a result of changes in contractual provisions 
      related to annual programming commitments. ESPN advertising revenue 
      increased due to higher rates and more units sold. Higher rates 
      reflected the benefit of FIFA World Cup soccer in the current quarter, 
      partially offset by two less NBA finals games this year. The increase at 
      ABC Family was driven by lower programming costs, reflecting fewer hours 
      of original scripted programming due to the timing of premieres, and 
      higher affiliate fees due to rate increases.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Broadcasting
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Operating income at Broadcasting increased 66% to $354 million for the 
      quarter due to an increase in affiliate fees and higher income from 
      program sales. The increase in affiliate revenues was due to contractual 
      rate increases and new contractual provisions. Increased operating 
      income from program sales was driven by a lower average expense 
      amortization rate and higher revenues led by Marvel's Agents of 
      S.H.I.E.L.D.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Parks and Resorts
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Parks and Resorts revenues for the quarter increased 8% to $4.0 billion 
      and segment operating income increased 23% to $848 million. Operating 
      income growth for the quarter was driven by an increase at our domestic 
      operations, partially offset by a decrease at Disneyland Paris. Parks 
      and Resorts results include a favorable impact due to a shift in the 
      timing of the Easter holiday relative to our fiscal periods.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Higher operating income at our domestic operations was due to increased 
      guest spending and higher attendance, partially offset by higher costs. 
      Guest spending growth reflected higher average ticket prices for 
      admissions at our theme parks and for sailings at our cruise line and 
      increased food, beverage and merchandise spending. Higher costs were 
      driven by MyMagic+ and labor and other cost inflation, partially 
      offset by lower pension and postretirement medical costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The decrease in operating income at Disneyland Paris was due to higher 
      operating costs, decreased attendance and occupied room nights and lower 
      special event revenue, partially offset by higher average ticket prices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Studio Entertainment
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Studio Entertainment revenues for the quarter increased 14% to $1.8 
      billion and segment operating income increased to $411 million from $201 
      million. Higher operating income was due to increases in worldwide home 
      entertainment and international theatrical distribution, partially 
      offset by a decrease in domestic theatrical distribution.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The increase in worldwide home entertainment was driven by lower per 
      unit costs, higher net effective pricing and unit sales growth 
      reflecting the success of Frozen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Higher international theatrical distribution results reflected the 
      performance of Frozen, Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier 
      and Maleficent in the current quarter compared to Iron Man 3, 
      Wreck-It-Ralph,
			Oz The Great and Powerful and Monsters 
      University in the prior-year quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lower results in domestic theatrical distribution were due to the 
      success of Iron Man 3 and Monsters University in the 
      prior-year quarter compared to Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier, 
      Maleficent and Million Dollar Arm in the current quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Consumer Products
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Consumer Products revenues for the quarter increased 16% to $902 million 
      and segment operating income increased 25% to $273 million. Higher 
      operating income was due to increases at our Retail and Merchandise 
      Licensing businesses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At our Retail business, higher operating income for the quarter was 
      driven by comparable store sales growth in all of our key markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The increase in operating income at Merchandise Licensing was due to the 
      performance of merchandise based on Frozen, Disney Channel 
      properties, Spider-Man and Planes partially offset by lower Monsters 
      University revenue. Additionally, Merchandise Licensing results 
      benefited from lower acquisition accounting impacts, which reduced 
      revenue recognition in the prior-year quarter. These increases were 
      partially offset by higher third-party royalties.

			Interactive
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Interactive revenues for the quarter increased 45% to $266 million and 
      segment operating results improved from a loss of $58 million to income 
      of $29 million. Improved results were due to strong game sales growth, 
      lower product development costs and higher licensing fees from our 
      mobile phone business in Japan. The increase in game sales was driven by Disney 
      Infinity, which was released in the fourth quarter of the prior 
      year, and the success of the Tsum Tsum and Frozen Free Fall 
      mobile games. The decrease in product development costs was due to fewer 
      titles in development and the benefit of restructuring activities.

      Corporate and unallocated shared expenses increased $22 million to $137

			Non-GAAP Financial Measures
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This earnings release presents EPS excluding the impact of certain items 
      affecting comparability, free cash flow and aggregate segment operating 
      income, all of which are important financial measures for the Company, 
      but are not financial measures defined by GAAP.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      These measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP 
      financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of EPS, 
      cash flow or net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. EPS 
      excluding certain items affecting comparability, free cash flow and 
      aggregate segment operating income as we have calculated them may not be 
      comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability 
      &#8211; The Company uses EPS excluding certain items to evaluate the 
      performance of the Company&#8217;s operations exclusive of certain items 
      affecting comparability of results from period to period. The Company 
      believes that information about EPS exclusive of these impacts is useful 
      to investors, particularly where the impact of the excluded items is 
      significant in relation to reported earnings, because the measure allows 
      for comparability between periods of the operating performance of the 
      Company&#8217;s business and allows investors to evaluate the impact of these 
      items separately from the impact of the operations of the business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The following table reconciles reported EPS to EPS excluding certain 
      items affecting comparability:

			(1) Charges for the current quarter and nine-month period 
      totaled $0 million and $67 million (pre-tax), respectively, driven by 
      severance costs. Charges for the prior-year quarter and nine-month 
      period totaled $60 million and $121 million (pre-tax), respectively, 
      driven by severance costs.(2) The prior-year nine-month 
      period includes a tax benefit due to an increase in prior-year earnings 
      from foreign operations indefinitely reinvested outside the United 
      States and subject to tax rates lower than the federal statutory income 
      tax rate ($64 million).(3) Our share of expense 
      associated with an equity redemption at Hulu LLC ($55 million pre-tax).(4) 
      Significant items in the current nine-month period include a loss from 
      Venezuelan foreign currency translation ($143 million pre-tax and before 
      noncontrolling interest), a gain on the sale of property ($77 million 
      pre-tax) and income related to a portion of a settlement of an affiliate 
      contract dispute ($29 million pre-tax). Significant items in the 
      prior-year nine-month period include the Celador litigation charge ($321 
      million pre-tax) and a gain on the sale of our interest in ESPN STAR 
      Sports ($219 million pre-tax and before noncontrolling interest).(5)

			Free cash flow &#8211; The Company uses free cash 
      flow (cash provided by operations less investments in parks, resorts and 
      other property), among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its 
      operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than 
      capital expenditures. Management believes that information about free 
      cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash 
      available to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments 
      and pay dividends or repurchase shares.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Aggregate segment operating income &#8211; The 
      Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on 
      segment operating income, and management uses aggregate segment 
      operating income as a measure of the performance of operating businesses 
      separate from non-operating factors. The Company believes that 
      information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors 
      by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the 
      Company&#8217;s portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors 
      that affect net income, thus providing separate insight into both 
      operations and the other factors that affect reported results.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group are being investigated by New York's attorney general as part of a probe into alternative trading systems known as "dark pools," according to Fox Business Network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley spokesman Mark Lake and the attorney general's office declined to comment to Reuters on the report. A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs was not immediately available for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark pools are broker-run trading venues that let investors trade shares anonymously and only make trading data available afterwards, reducing the chance of information leaking about trade orders. But the lack of transparency around dark pools has drawn the scrutiny of regulators, concerned that brokers and proprietary trading firms that use aggressive high-frequency trading strategies have an unfair advantage over other clients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays is facing allegations by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman that it lied to clients about its dark pool. The bank has urged the dismissal of the lawsuit in New York. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany's Deutsche Bank and Switzerland's UBS and Credit Suisse have said they are being probed by U.S. regulators as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by John McCrank; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)&lt;/p&gt;

			(a) This non-GAAP financial information is provided to allow 
      investors to more clearly evaluate operating performance and business 
      trends for the second quarters of 2014 and 2013. Management uses this 
      information to review results excluding items that are not necessarily 
      indicative of ongoing results.

		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company earned $16.2 million, or basic net income per share of 
      $1.75, on net sales of $848.1 million for the first six months of 2014, 
      compared to net income of $16.1 million, or basic net income per share 
      of $1.74, on net sales of $812.5 million for the first six months of 
      2013. The results for the first six months of 2014 included $0.5 million 
      of after-tax gains ($0.9 million on a pre-tax basis) due to 
      mark-to-market adjustments on commodity hedges and $3.1 million of 
      expenses ($5.1 million on a pre-tax basis) related to franchise 
      territory expansion. The results for the first six months of 2013 
      included $0.3 million of after-tax losses ($0.5 million on a pre-tax 
      basis) due to mark-to-market adjustments on commodity hedges, $1.0 
      million of expenses ($1.6 million on a pre-tax basis) related to 
      franchise territory expansion and a $0.3 million net decrease in income 
      tax expense due to certain favorable tax items associated with the 
      American Taxpayer Relief Act (H.R.8) enacted on January 2, 2013 and 
      other income tax changes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On a comparable basis, the Company earned $18.9 million in the first six 
      months of 2014 versus $17.0 million in the first six months of 2013. 
      Basic net income per share, on a comparable basis, for the first six 
      months of 2014 was $2.04, compared to $1.84 in the first six months of 
      2013. The following table reconciles reported GAAP net income and basic 
      net income per share to comparable net income and basic net income per

			(a) This non-GAAP financial information is provided to allow 
      investors to more clearly evaluate operating performance and business 
      trends for the first six months of 2014 and 2013. Management uses this 
      information to review results excluding items that are not necessarily 
      indicative of ongoing results.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J. Frank Harrison, III, Chairman and CEO, said, &#8220;We are pleased with our 
      second quarter, which included strong operating results and the 
      successful transition of Johnson City and Morristown, TN to Consolidated 
      as part of our planned territory expansion. We are excited about this 
      new opportunity to serve consumers, customers, communities, and 
      employees in these territories as their local Coca-Cola bottler. Our 
      strong operating results reflect outstanding execution by our sales and 
      marketing teams, a more favorable raw materials cost environment and the 
      much improved weather conditions we experienced compared to the prior 
      year. We are continuing our work on agreements with The Coca-Cola 
      Company for the remainder of the franchise territory expansion covered 
      in our previously announced letter of intent and look forward to serving 
      these additional territories in the future.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hank Flint, President and COO, added, &#8220;Our second quarter reflects 
      strong results for our business over the prior year including revenue 
      growth of over seven percent and gross margin growth of almost nine 
      percent. The revenue growth was driven by an increase in physical case 
      volume of approximately five percent and an increase in pricing of 
      approximately two percent. We have experienced favorable trends in key 
      components of raw material costs resulting in lower than anticipated 
      cost of goods sold, contributing to our gross margin growth. The growth 
      in our selling, delivery and administrative expenses is higher than it 
      has been in recent years as we continue to make long-term investments to 
      grow our revenue and market share as well as expand our franchise 
      territory.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Cautionary Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Included in this news release and other information that we make 
      publicly available from time to time are forward-looking management 
      comments and other statements that reflect management&#8217;s current outlook 
      for future periods.
			These statements include, among others, 
      statements regarding the following challenges we face in 2014:
			ongoing 
      work on agreements for the additional proposed territory expansion that 
      is described in the Letter of Intent dated April 15, 2013 with The 
      Coca-Cola Company that we believe will provide us with the opportunity 
      for growth in contiguous territories where we can leverage our current 
      infrastructure and operational capabilities.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			These statements and expectations are based on currently available 
      competitive, financial and economic data along with our operating plans 
      and are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause 
      anticipated events not to occur or actual results to differ materially 
      from historical or anticipated results.
			Among the events or 
      uncertainties which could adversely affect future periods are: lower 
      than expected selling pricing resulting from increased marketplace 
      competition; changes in how significant customers market or promote our 
      products; changes in our top customer relationships; changes in public 
      and consumer preferences related to nonalcoholic beverages; unfavorable 
      changes in the general economy; miscalculation of our need for 
      infrastructure investment; our inability to meet requirements under 
      beverage agreements; material changes in the performance requirements 
      for marketing funding support or our inability to meet such 
      requirements; decreases from historic levels of marketing funding 
      support; changes in
			The Coca-Cola Company&#8217;s and other beverage 
      companies&#8217; levels of advertising, marketing and spending on brand 
      innovation; the inability of our aluminum can or plastic bottle 
      suppliers to meet our purchase requirements; our inability to offset 
      higher raw material costs with higher selling prices, increased 
      bottle/can sales volume or reduced expenses; sustained increases in fuel 
      costs or our inability to secure adequate supplies of fuel; sustained 
      increases in workers&#8217; compensation, employment practices and vehicle 
      accident claims costs; sustained increases in the cost of employee 
      benefits; product liability claims or product recalls; technology 
      failures; changes in interest rates; the impact of debt levels on 
      operating flexibility and access to capital and credit markets; adverse 
      changes in our credit rating (whether as a result of our operations or 
      prospects or as a result of those of The Coca-Cola Company or other 
      bottlers in the Coca-Cola system); changes in legal contingencies; 
      legislative changes affecting our distribution and packaging; adoption 
      of significant product labeling or warning requirements; additional 
      taxes resulting from tax audits; natural disasters and unfavorable 
      weather; global climate change or legal or regulatory responses to such 
      change; issues surrounding labor relations; bottler system disputes; our 
      use of estimates and assumptions; changes in accounting standards; 
      impact of obesity and health concerns on product demand; public policy 
      challenges regarding the sale of soft drinks in schools; the impact of 
      volatility in the financial markets on access to the credit markets; the 
      impact of acquisitions of bottlers by their franchisors; and the 
      concentration of our capital stock ownership.
			The forward-looking 
      statements in this news release should be read in conjunction with the 
      more detailed descriptions of the above factors located in our Annual 
      Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2013 under Part I, 
      Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; as well as those additional factors we may 
      describe from time to time in other filings with the Securities and 
      Exchange Commission.
			Except as required by law, the Company 
      undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking 
      statements contained in this release as a result of new information or 
      future events or developments.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 5 (Reuters) - U.S. banks Morgan Stanley 
and Goldman Sachs Group are being investigated by New
York's attorney general as part of a probe into alternative
trading systems known as "dark pools," according to Fox Business
Network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley spokesman Mark Lake and the attorney
general's office declined to comment to Reuters on the report. A
spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs was not immediately available for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark pools are broker-run trading venues that let investors
trade shares anonymously and only make trading data available
afterwards, reducing the chance of information leaking about
trade orders. But the lack of transparency around dark pools has
drawn the scrutiny of regulators, concerned that brokers and
proprietary trading firms that use aggressive high-frequency
trading strategies have an unfair advantage over other clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays is facing allegations by New York Attorney
General Eric Schneiderman that it lied to clients about its dark
pool. The bank has urged the dismissal of the lawsuit in New
York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany's Deutsche Bank and Switzerland's UBS
 and Credit Suisse have said they are being
probed by U.S. regulators as well.

		&lt;h1&gt;VDX Recognized With the 2014 Microsoft US Eastern Regional Cloud Partner of the Year Award&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;CRANFORD, NJ--(Marketwired - Aug 5, 2014) -  Microsoft proudly announced the 2014 Cloud Regional Partner Award winners during a ceremony at the Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference in Washington, DC. The award acknowledges extraordinary contributions of Microsoft partners serving commercial customers throughout the past fiscal year.&#160;For this year, VDX, a National Microsoft System Integrator and premier IT consulting organization, was recognized with the 2014 Microsoft US Eastern Regional Cloud Partner of the Year.

The assessment also helps clients understand which applications are at the end-of-life and which solutions can migrate effectively.&#160;Once clients are comfortable with their cloud deployment, VDX can scale the infrastructure as needed.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our clients are ready to include the cloud as a strategic resource in their IT portfolio, but many need help striking the right balance between cost savings, agility, security, compliance and integration," said Robert English, CEO and Founder of VDX, Inc. "With Microsoft, we have a world-class portfolio of technologies to help accelerate the implementation of successful cloud strategies for our clients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When the time came to transition our desktop computing environment off of the Windows XP platform, we wanted to collaborate with a partner that could help us realize maximum return from our IT investments. With VDX we were able to meet both our end-of-life deadline for Windows XP, and build out the foundation of a private cloud computing environment," said John F. McFall, VP Technology, SSFCU.&#160;"Working with VDX we were able to virtualize our applications, upgrade our delivery mechanism and provide our users with an enhanced computing experience." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awards were presented in multiple categories, with winners and finalists chosen from a set of more than 200 organizations across the Eastern Region. VDX was recognized for providing outstanding solutions and services, as well as demonstrating excellent engagement in the Eastern Region.&#160;The Cloud Partner awards recognize companies who are providing outstanding services based on Microsoft cloud technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are pleased to present VDX with this award," said Luke Sossi, East Region Partner Sales Director.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Coca-Cola Invests an Additional US$5 Billion 
      for Long-Term Sustainable Growth in Africa
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Coca-Cola Also Expands its Replenish Africa Initiative To Bring 
      Safe Water Access to 6 Million People Across the Continent by 2020
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company and its African bottling partners today announced 
      a new investment of US$5 billion during the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit 
      here. The investment, to be made over the next six years, increases its 
      total announced investment in Africa to $17 billion from 2010 to 2020. 
      The Company and its bottling partners anticipate that this investment 
      will fund new manufacturing lines, cooling and distribution equipment 
      and production; create additional jobs and opportunities across 
      Coca-Cola&#8217;s African supply chain; and support key sustainability 
      initiatives and programs focused on safe water access, sustainable 
      sourcing, women&#8217;s economic empowerment, community well-being and 
      operational efficiency improvements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As an organization that has been part of the economic and social fabric 
      of Africa since 1928, we and our local bottling partners have seen, 
      firsthand, the great promise and potential of this dynamic, growing and 
      vibrant continent,&#8221; said Muhtar Kent, Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola 
      Company. &#8220;Even as we see tremendous growth potential in Africa, we know 
      that the strength and sustainability of our business are tied directly 
      to the strength and sustainability of the African communities we proudly 
      serve.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company has also signed a Letter of Intent to launch Source Africa, 
      an initiative to secure more consistent and sustainable local ingredient 
      sourcing for its products in partnership with the New Alliance for Food 
      Security and Nutrition and Grow Africa. The initiative will initially 
      focus on sustainable mango and tea production in Kenya; citrus, mango 
      and pineapple production in Nigeria; and mango in Malawi. Longer-term, 
      the program could expand to focus on sustainable ingredient production 
      in Ethiopia, Senegal, Tanzania and Mozambique. Source Africa builds on 
      the experience of Coca-Cola&#8217;s work in sustainable agriculture, including 
      Project Nurture, an $11.5 million partnership supporting 50,000 
      small-scale fruit farmers in East Africa to sustainably grow their crops 
      and income.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kent added, &#8220;As a business, we&#8217;re committed to creating public value and 
      helping our communities overcome development challenges. In Africa, we 
      believe we can do more to source agricultural ingredients locally, with 
      significant supply potential that&#8217;s underdeveloped and underutilised. 
      Tapping this potential could accelerate the growth of our business and 
      Africa&#8217;s emerging economies, making our supply chains more cost 
      effective and enabling sub-Saharan Africa to supply more ingredients to 
      growing markets in Africa and beyond.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At the Summit, Kent also announced that The Coca-Cola Africa Foundation 
      (TCCAF) will expand its Replenish 
      Africa Initiative (RAIN) through 2020 to support Pan-African safe 
      water access and sanitation programs for an additional 4 million African 
      people. This new expansion adds to TCCAF&#8217;s original RAIN commitment to 
      bring safe water access to 2 million people across the continent by 2015.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Through the RAIN program expansion, TCCAF and its public and private 
      partners will work to improve sustainable safe water access for 6 
      million Africans; economically empower up to 250,000 women and youth; 
      promote health and hygiene in thousands of communities, schools, and 
      health centers; and return up to 18.5 billion liters of water to nature 
      and communities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To date, TCCAF has made investments and collaborated with more than 140 
      partners to reach 2 million people with sustainable, safe water access 
      across at least 37 of Africa&#8217;s 55 countries by the end of 2015.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company and its Foundations also remain committed to other programs 
      focused on improving community well-being and women&#8217;s economic 
      empowerment in Africa, including:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Project 
        Last Mile: In June 2014, Coca-Cola, its Foundations, and public 
        and private partners announced a $21 million expansion of the medical 
        supply delivery program to an additional eight African countries over 
        the next five years.
      
			
				5by20: 
        To date, Coca-Cola has reached more than 370,000 women entrepreneurs 
        in 18 African countries through its 5by20 economic empowerment 
        initiative. Since 5by20 launched in 2010, more than 550,000 women 
        entrepreneurs in the global Coca-Cola value chain have been 
        economically empowered on the initiative&#8217;s journey to reach 5 million 
        by 2020.
      
			
				EKOCENTER: 
        In 2014, Coca-Cola is piloting its public-private partnership to bring 
        sustainable community markets operated by women entrepreneurs in six 
        countries in Africa, Asia and North America.

		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;With Nearly 40 Years of Industry Experience and a Decade as an Executive at PetroCard, Walters Is Well Positioned to Build on PetroCard's Leadership Position&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, WA--(Marketwired - Aug 5, 2014) -  PetroCard, Inc., a leading fuel distributor in the Pacific Northwest, announced the promotion of Scott Walters to the role of Chief Operating Officer. This is the first step in a succession plan that will result in his taking the helm as Chief Executive Officer in April, 2015 when PetroCard's current CEO David Harris retires. Walters, who has served as Senior Vice President of the Fuels Division at PetroCard since 2005, has nearly 40 years of experience in the industry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Scott is a proven leader both within PetroCard and the broader petroleum industry, and well suited to be the next chief executive of PetroCard," said Jason Metrokin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Bristol Bay Native Corporation, PetroCard's parent company. "We're taking this step now to ensure a smooth transition next spring when David Harris retires, so we can build on our strengths and grow our leadership position."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walters began his career in the petroleum industry with Conoco where he spent nearly a decade in a variety of management positions. Subsequently he went to work at Thunderbird Lubrications in Spokane which was acquired by Gull Oil. In 2005, PetroCard acquired Thunderbird Lubrications from Gull Oil and Scott was appointed the Senior Vice President of Fuels where he was responsible for the Fuel Sales, Supply and Transportation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to his company experience, Walters has played an active role in industry organizations. He served a number of years as an Officer and Director for the Washington Oil Marketers Association, where he is the immediate past President. He is also a past Director of the Western Petroleum Marketers Association. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"David Harris, the current CEO of PetroCard, has done a terrific job of structuring PetroCard for sustained growth, and we are all committed to expanding on that foundation," said Walters. "I look forward to working with the leadership team and all our employees to ensure we continue to deliver great customer service and take advantage of additional growth opportunities as they arise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PetroCard currently offers fuel services via four primary methods: via "cardlocks," or unattended, self-serve fueling stations, via fleet cards, via mobile fueling, and as well as via delivery to bulk fuel tanks through unbranded and branded contracts.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 5 (Reuters) - The difference between the
number of investors bearish on U.S. long-dated Treasuries
against those who were bullish shrank to its smallest in six
weeks, according to a J.P. Morgan survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gap between those who were 'short' long-dated U.S.
government debt and those who were 'long' contracted after a
government report showed no wage growth in July, reducing
worries about inflation accelerating and the Federal Reserve
might raise interest rate sooner to prevent the economy from
overheating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The share of short investors exceeded the share of long
investors by 21 percentage points, down from 29 points the
previous week, according to J.P. Morgan Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The share of short investors fell to 36 percent in the
latest week ending Aug. 4, from 42 percent in the prior week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By holding fewer longer-dated Treasuries, investors reduce
the duration or interest rate risk of their portfolios in
anticipation of a market drop, which generally causes
longer-dated bonds to generate bigger losses than shorter-dated
debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, longer-dated Treasuries produce higher returns
than short-term debt in a market rally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The share of long investors or those who said they held more
longer-dated Treasuries than their benchmarks rose to 15 percent
from 13 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The share of neutral investors, or those who said they were
holding long-dated securities equal to their portfolio
benchmarks, rose to 49 percent from last week's 45 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benchmark 10-year Treasuries yields was 2.500
percent early Tuesday, compared with 2.462 percent a week
ago.

		&lt;h1&gt;Porticor Enhances Microsoft SQL Server Encryption With Cloud Key Management Security for Complete Database Protection&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Porticor Virtual Private Data System Leverages Software-Defined Key Management to Eliminate Complexities and Risks Found in Traditional Hardware Encryption Security Modules&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;CAMPBELL, CA--(Marketwired - Aug 5, 2014) -  Porticor&#174;, a leading cloud data security company delivering the only cloud-based data encryption and key management solution that infuses trust into the cloud and keeps cloud data confidential, today announced that it supports Microsoft SQL Server Transparent Data Encryption (TDE), securing Microsoft's database in cloud infrastructures with its Porticor Virtual Private Data (VPD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Porticor's software-defined key management solution eliminates risks surrounding storing SQL Database Encryption Keys (DEK) on the database server, where they can be compromised or stolen. Porticor integrated with Microsoft's Transparent Data Encryption secures data through strong encryption, and also protects it from "root" access by administrators. The Porticor solution supports virtual systems, and private and public clouds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storing the data encryption keys in Porticor's key management service, Porticor's MS SQL Server plugin is a small installable package that can be added to a running SQL Server database with minimal configuration through normal SQL statements. The Porticor appliance is set up in minutes, and since it is a generic key management system it does not need to be configured to enable integration with a SQL Server. Uniquely, due to Homomorphic Key Management and Split Key Encryption technologies, the solution provides both secure key storage and secure key caching with no hardware needed, combining high security with top performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since SQL servers often hold an organization's most important information, they are a favorite target for attacks," said Gilad Parann-Nissany, Porticor founder and CEO. "Microsoft's Transparent Data Encryption feature encrypts the database, but in cloud computing the question of encryption key management comes into play. With Porticor, the DEKs are never stored on the SQL Server disk, are protected by a 'split key' method, and remain under control of the customer, eliminating the chance of the keys getting stolen or hacked."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft created the Extensible Key Management (EKM) API to provide integration between the SQL Server and a Hardware Security Module (HSM) key management system or a software-defined key management solution, such as Porticor. EKM supports Transparent Data Encryption to protect SQL Server data. With Porticor's EKM integration, the DEK is encrypted by an asymmetric key that never leaves the key management system, and is itself protected through Homomorphic Split Key Encryption. When the database is started, it authenticates into the Porticor virtual appliance and retrieves the DEK. Since the DEK is never stored on the SQL Server's disk, if the disk is ever removed and discarded, its encrypted tables cannot be decrypted. In addition to wholesale database encryption, EKM and Porticor's advanced API enable fine granular encryption of specific tables, database row, columns and records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Porticor Virtual Private Data system is the industry's only solution combining data encryption with patented split-key encryption and homomorphic key management technologies to protect critical data in public, private and hybrid cloud environments. Unlike traditional data encryption solutions, which are complicated and expensive to deploy and manage, Porticor's split-key encryption and homomorphic key management system is offered as the industry's first cloud data protection service of its kind, delivering true confidentiality of data in the cloud by ensuring customer encryption keys are not exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While other solutions require encryption keys to be manually managed for every disk, distributed storage or database record, or to be owned by a cloud provider, Porticor's homomorphic split-key encryption technology eliminates both complexity and compromises. Porticor restores key ownership to customers while automatically managing customer encryption keys with maximum security. With homomorphic key management, the keys are protected at all times -- even while they are in use. Porticor protects the entire data layer stack, including virtual disks, distributed storage, databases, and applications. It dynamically encrypts and decrypts virtual data whenever the application needs access, and delivers a key management system that is fully hosted in the cloud, yet offers the confidentiality, security and trust of a system that is hosted inside the datacenter. Within minutes, customers can encrypt their entire data layer with the proven AES 256-bit encryption algorithm.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) should not obstruct an anti-trust investigation by Chinese regulators, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) said on Monday, the latest shot fired by China's government at the U.S. software giant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SAIC has questioned Microsoft's lawyer, Deputy General Counsel Mary Snapp, who was at the regulator's offices on Monday, a spokesman for the SAIC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the SAIC said it was formally investigating Microsoft for breach of anti-trust rules and had raided four of the software firm's offices in China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft promised to respect Chinese law and fully cooperate with the SAIC's investigation work," the SAIC said in an e-mailed statement. Microsoft declined to provide immediate comment, but last week said its "business practices are designed to be compliant with Chinese law."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The warning is likely a preemptive step in the course of the government's investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think the government is saying Microsoft has already done anything to obstruct the investigation, otherwise they would have publicized it," said You Yunting, a senior partner at Shanghai DeBund Law Offices. "In China, you do everything you have to to completely submit if the authorities investigate you. The government is saying, 'We might be more lenient if you don't resist, otherwise we'll be tough'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been suspected of violating China's anti-monopoly law since June last year in relation to problems with compatibility, bundling and document authentication, the SAIC said last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But industry experts have questioned how exactly Microsoft is violating anti-trust regulations in China, where the size of its business is negligible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. company has taken a public beating in China in recent months. It has been subject to wider scrutiny against U.S. technology firms in China in the wake of former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's cyber espionage revelations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has also seen service for its OneDrive cloud storage service disrupted in China, and had its latest Windows 8 operating system banned from being installed on the central government's new computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Paul Carsten, Gerry Shih and Beijing Newsroom; Editing by Miral Fahmy and Ian Geoghegan)&lt;/p&gt;

      made using Visa Checkout.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      &#8220;Visa Checkout is a great service that helps our customers make their 
      purchases on Newegg quickly and conveniently,&#8221; said Soren Mills, Chief 
      Marketing Officer of Newegg North America. &#8220;It removes much of the 
      tedium inherent to the online checkout process, especially for our 
      customers who like to shop on mobile devices.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Enrolling in Visa Checkout is as simple as selecting the Visa Checkout 
      payment option during checkout, and creating a free Visa Checkout 
      account. Once enrolled, members can securely store payment information 
      for cards with the Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover logo. 
      Then, when it&#8217;s time to check out at Newegg, enrolled customers simply 
      enter their Visa Checkout username and password without ever leaving the 
      Newegg website.

		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Aug 5, 2014) - &#160;J.P. Morgan leaps two places to lead the 2014 Latin America Research Team, Institutional Investor's 22nd annual ranking of the region's best sell-side analysts. Its researchers appear in 24 of the survey's 25 sectors, failing to rank only in Agribusiness.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Complete results can be found at www.institutionalinvestor.com/rankings. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Two firms tie for second place: BTG Pactual, which rises from third, and Ita&#250; BBA, which falls from first. They each claim 22 positions.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;HSBC is the year's biggest gainer. It adds seven spots, for a total of 11, and lands in seventh place overall. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A total of 145 analyst teams from 13 sell-side research providers are included in this year's results. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The 2014 Latin America Research Team reflects the opinions of some 865 investment professionals at more than 450 buy-side institutions that collectively manage an estimated $402 billion in Latin American equities and $271 billion in Latin American debt. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Pedro Martins Jr., director of Latin American equity research at J.P. Morgan in S&#227;o Paulo, says a number of issues are weighing on investors' minds. "Clients are concerned with the cost of money moving higher," says Martins, who also directs the team that claims second place in Equity Strategy. "Interest in discussing consequences for Latin American equities is high with regard to slower [real gross domestic product] growth, weaker currencies and higher long rates for countries." &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Also on the minds of investors: a possible correction of "valuation excesses," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information contact Alyssa Walker at awalker@iiresearchgroup.com or (212) 224-3677.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Institutional Investor

&lt;p&gt;By Ethan Bilby&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xbox gamers fear the &#8220;red ring of death&#8221;, a flashing light that can herald system failure. Microsoft, which makes the consoles, must be awaiting a similar sign in China. After 22 years, the tech giant has achieved little in the country, which looks to account for around 2&#160;percent of revenue. Cloud services may multiply that over time, but political headwinds are raising the cost of business  possibly too high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years trying to persuade users to pay for its products, Microsoft is now fielding an antitrust probe by China&#8217;s State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC), which said on July 29 it believes features in Microsoft Windows and Office violate local competition law. Yet there&#8217;s nothing to suggest the company enjoys the advantages that normally come with market dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China sales for the year ending June 2013 surpassed $1 billion for the first time, Microsoft has said, but doesn&#8217;t give more detail than that. If those sales, which include servers, software and licencing from Windows-based smartphones, have grown at the same pace as Microsoft&#8217;s global business since, the figure might now be a little under $1.1 billion. Add on about $765 million in China revenue implied by&#160;Canalys shipment data for recently acquired Nokia, and the resulting $1.8 billion is just 2 percent of the $83 billion of global revenue Microsoft reported during the most recent calendar year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means China is mostly about option value. Revenue from cloud computing is the big hope. The group just launched its Azure platform of cloud-based programs and virtual servers. Just a quarter of that market this year would be worth $325 million in added Microsoft sales according to Forrester data. Yet it&#8217;s unlikely an American company will be able dominate such a security-sensitive market. Then there&#8217;s Xbox. China has just allowed sales of game consoles. But Chinese consumers may bristle over the high cost of a Chinese Xbox  50 percent over the U.S. price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question is at what point China stops being worth it. Already, the potential costs are mounting. The regulators could fine Microsoft if they find the company abused its dominance, or even tell it to make compromises like opening the source code for Windows  making staying in the market unappealing. Giving up on China may not yet be in the plans, but it&#8217;s increasingly unclear whether staying is making much difference.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;RYE BROOK, NY--(Marketwired - Aug 5, 2014) -  ImageWare Systems, Inc. (OTCQB: IWSY) and StrikeForce Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: SFOR)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIDO Alliance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Ramesh Kesanupalli, Founder of Nok Nok Labs, Founding Member, FIDO Alliance, told us, "Prevailing password authentication has proven to be insecure and risky amidst a world of escalating security threats, cyber crime and targeted attacks, not to mention increasing vulnerability associated with so many more vectors of attack coming through the Internet of Things (IoT). Right now, we are moving from informational access to a major life style change where we can access everything digitally. We're at the threshold of using authentication to pay at retail stores with our phones, to open and start our cars, to manage home networks, appliances, and security systems all through connected devices. Authentication is the FIRST step we must perform to begin to effectively use IoT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the complete interview: www.securitysolutionswatch.com/Interviews/in_Boardroom_NokNok_Ramesh.html
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About The FIDO Alliance
					The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, www.fidoalliance.org, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The Alliance plans to change the nature of authentication by developing standards-based specifications for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*****&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HP Enterprise Services&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. George Romas, Technical Director, Cybersecurity Solutions Group, HP Enterprise Services, U.S. Public Sector, told us, "IoT will create completely new industries that form around smart devices. We already see the beginnings of that today, where smoke detectors, thermostats, audio/video equipment, watches, smart phones, vehicles and more are becoming sensor-rich and network-enabled. Everyday devices in your home or office will collaborate to form new capabilities. An example of this scenario can be demonstrated through home security. Using IoT, your home would know that your house is vacant by polling the motion detectors embedded in its Nest Protect smoke detectors and thermostat, and correlating that information with the family schedule (work and school). When the back door opens without the proper key code or ping from an authenticated smart phone and motion is detected, your home sounds a piercing alarm over the whole-house audio speaker system. In turn, it also sends an alert with streaming video to the police, sends warning texts to all family members, and disrupts other communications from within the house.

        (OTCQB: IWSY) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ImageWare Systems, Inc. (OTCQB: IWSY), a leader in mobile and cloud-based, multi-modal biometric identity management solutions, was selected to implement a multi-modal biometric driver license system for the State of Baja California, Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contract was awarded by the Funciones Ocupacionales Insha, S.A. de C.V., the prime contractor on the project. For ImageWare, the contract is valued at more than $1.0 million and its software will help generate more than one million licenses over the next three years.

In many ways we are more vulnerable than ever to breaches being escalated. The Trusted Platform Module is a partial solution which can validate the boot chain of a compute node. (Verify the platform has come up without a root kit). The TPM is well supported by Linux and by the KVM hypervisor, but not widely used, although it should be. As bad as the security issues are with data center computing, they are much worse with the IoT right now, primarily because that set of products has evolved in a disconnected state and has not been exposed to attack in the same way our data processing infrastructure has been for decades."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the complete interview: www.securitysolutionswatch.com/Interviews/in_Boardroom_IBM_MichaelDay.html

				&lt;p&gt;Management Commentary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the second quarter, Adjusted EBITDA was up 20 percent compared to last year, primarily driven by contributions from our growth investments," said Al Cadotte, President and CEO of Newalta. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to expect 20 percent growth in Adjusted EBITDA for the year, driven by our growth capital investments and market activity. We are making solid progress on the strategic review of our Industrial Division. At the same time, we are evaluating our organization capacity and investment opportunities to accelerate our growth plans in both the Oilfield and New Markets Divisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We remain well positioned to deliver attractive returns for our shareholders for many years ahead." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consolidated Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second quarter revenue was up 9% to $213.1 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased 20% to $46 million compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 22%, up from 20% in 2013. Returns from growth capital investments in New Markets and Oilfield, coupled with the savings realized from the Rationalization Plan in Industrial and favourable commodity prices drove growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Year-to-date, Adjusted EBITDA was $78.1 million, up 18% over the prior year. Year-to-date results reflect the same factors as the quarter and were tempered by the impact of extreme weather on first quarter results. Revenue from contracts generated 16% of consolidated revenue on a trailing-twelve month (TTM) basis compared to 11% in TTM Q2 2013. The net loss in earnings for the quarter and for the year of $8.2 million and $1.7 million, respectively, was driven by higher stock-based compensation expense, restructuring related costs and higher finance charges associated with the early redemption of the Series 1 Senior Unsecured Debentures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q2 2014 Adjusted SGA improved to 10.0% of revenue from 10.8% in 2013, primarily due to overhead reductions in the quarter as part of the rationalization plan initiated in the first quarter focused primarily on our Industrial Division (Rationalization Plan).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital expenditures for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 were $32.8 million and $59.9 million, respectively, focused primarily on growth projects in New Markets and Oilfield. We remain on track to execute our capital expenditures program of approximately $145 million in growth capital and $35 million in maintenance capital this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operational Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Markets revenue and gross profit in the quarter increased 27% and 19%, respectively, to $71.1 million and $22.3 million compared to prior year. Improved performance was primarily driven by strong returns from our growth capital investments, particularly our mature fine tailings (MFT) contracts and U.S. satellites. Year-to-date, revenue and gross profit increased by 31% and 18%, respectively, to $127.2 million and $36.9 million compared to prior year, driven by Heavy Oil and U.S satellites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oilfield revenue and gross profit in the quarter increased 15% and 18%, respectively, to $45.3 million and $16.9 million compared to prior year. Performance was driven by returns from our growth capital investments, increased drilling activity, and improved commodity prices. Year-to-date, revenue and gross profit increased by 13% and 10%, respectively, to $99.6 million and $37.5 million compared to prior year. Results were impacted by the same factors as the quarter and were tempered by the impact of extreme weather on operating costs in the first quarter of 2014. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industrial revenue decreased by 4% to $96.7 million while gross profit increased by 18% to $14.5 million. Year-to-date, revenue decreased 5% to $174.1 million while gross profit increased by 16% to $20.9 million, compared to prior year. Savings realized from the Rationalization Plan and gains from favorable commodity prices were partially offset by lower waste receipts at the Stoney Creek Landfill (SCL). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent Developments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the first quarter, we initiated the Rationalization Plan associated with the comprehensive review announced in December 2013 focused on our Industrial Division. To date, we have closed four facilities, reduced overhead in associated support functions and have redirected lines of business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Q2, we engaged RBC Capital Markets to conduct a review of a full range of potential alternatives for our Industrial Division, including a potential sale, IPO or spin-off of the division, in whole or in parts (Strategic Review). We are committed to optimizing value from this division. While this review is underway, we are developing our 2015 to 2018 business plan excluding the Industrial Division. We are allocating resources towards our highest growth areas in both the Oilfield and New Markets Divisions, to accelerate and expand our organic growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, we realized approximately $4.0 million in savings associated with the Rationalization Plan and remain on track to realize approximately $10 million in annualized cash savings. Including costs associated with the Strategic Review, we incurred approximately $5.5 million in one-time restructuring costs and anticipate incurring an additional $1.0 million before year end. We will assess and update savings and cost estimates throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Rationalization Plan discussed above, we are assessing our cost structure across all divisions, including SGA. We have identified areas to better align resources with our business needs and have intiated steps to realize additional cost savings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Highlights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta's Board of Directors declared a second quarter dividend of $0.125 per share ($0.50 per share annualized), paid July 15, 2014, to shareholders on record as at June 30, 2014. This higher dividend rate established earlier this year reflects our positive outlook for the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 1, 2014, we issued $150 million Series 3 Senior Unsecured Debentures with a seven-year term, bearing interest at the rate of 5.875% per annum. Proceeds from the offering were used to redeem our $125 million 7.675% Series 1 Senior Unsecured Debentures and to repay a portion of outstanding debt on our credit facility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the quarter we also secured a contract with Shell Canada Limited (Shell) for construction services to build a new MFT plant at Shell's Jackpine Mine. We began work on this contract in the second quarter and expect work to continue into the first quarter of 2015. This contract is in addition to the contract awarded in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July we were awarded a contract with Syncrude Canada Ltd (Syncrude) for commissioning its full-scale centrifugation facility that will process MFT at Syncrude's Mildred Lake operations near Fort McMurray, Alberta. This contract builds on our relationship with Syncrude over the past four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outlook&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We expect to deliver Adjusted EBITDA growth of 20% over 2013. Growth capital investments combined with improved commodity prices, the rationalization initiatives focused primarily on the Industrial Division and reductions in SGA, will drive strong returns and improved results over prior year. &lt;/p&gt;
			
				In New Markets, we expect growth to be driven by our onsite contracts as well as continued progress in the U.S. expansion. We continue to work on securing new contracts, including MFT processing in the oil sands, and on the development of our Fort McMurray facility. In 2014, we plan to establish three additional satellites in the U.S.
            In Oilfield, we expect growth to be driven by our satellite program and steady drilling activity. Operations at our satellites commissioned in the second quarter will ramp up in the second half of 2014. In 2014, we plan to establish two additional satellites.
            In Industrial, we expect improved returns from steady activity levels and initiatives implemented under the Rationalization Plan. Full year activity levels at Ville Ste-Catherine (VSC) and SCL are expected to be in line with 2013. 
			&lt;p&gt;We continue to focus on growing our portfolio of longer term contracts, strengthening our foundation of stable cash flow, and maximizing returns from our existing assets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quarterly Conference Call&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Management will hold a conference call on Thursday, August 7, 2014 at 11:00 a.m. (ET) to discuss Newalta's performance for the quarter ended June 30, 2014.

			&lt;p&gt;During the second quarter, we engaged a financial advisor to conduct a Strategic Review for our Industrial Division which is ongoing. As such, forward-looking information in this document is made subject to any changes that may be implemented as a result of this Strategic Review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By its nature, forward-looking information involves numerous assumptions, known and unknown risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, that contribute to the possibility that the predictions, forecasts, projections and other forward-looking information will not occur. Many other factors could also cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking information and readers are cautioned that the foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should assumptions underlying the forward-looking information prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described herein as intended, planned, anticipated, believed, estimated or expected. Furthermore, the forward-looking information contained in this document is made as of the date of this document and, in each case, is expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. Unless otherwise required by law, we do not intend, or assume any obligation, to update any such forward-looking information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information contained on our website does not form part of this press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Press Release contains references to certain financial measures, including some that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS" or "GAAP") and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other corporations or entities. These financial measures are identified and defined below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"EBITDA", "EBITDA per share", "Adjusted EBITDA", and "Adjusted EBITDA per share" are measures of our operating profitability. EBITDA provides an indication of the results generated by our principal business activities prior to how these activities are financed, assets are amortized or impaired, or how the results are taxed in various jurisdictions. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA provides an indication of the results generated by our principal business activities prior to recognizing stock-based compensation and restructuring related costs. Adjusted EBITDA provides improved continuity with respect to the comparison of our operating results over a period of time. Stock-based compensation, a component of employee remuneration, can vary significantly with changes in the price of our common shares while restructuring costs are outside of our normal course of business. Restructuring related costs are charges primarily attributable to the Rationalization Plan and Strategic Review. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are derived from the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. EBITDA per share and Adjusted EBITDA per share are derived by dividing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by the basic weighted average number of shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are calculated as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;"Adjusted net earnings" and "Adjusted net earnings per share" are measures of our profitability. Adjusted net earnings provides an indication of the results generated by our principal business activities prior to recognizing stock-based compensation recovery or expense, the gain or loss on embedded derivatives and restructuring related charges. Stock-based compensation expense, a component of employee remuneration, can vary significantly with changes in the price of our common shares. The gain on the embedded derivative is a result of the change in the trading price of the debentures and the volatility of the applicable bond market. Restructuring related costs are related to initiatives outside of our normal course of business. As such, Adjusted net earnings provides improved continuity with respect to the comparison of our results over a period of time. Adjusted net earnings per share is derived by dividing Adjusted net earnings by the basic weighted average number of shares. &lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;"Cash Basis Return on Capital" (ROC - Cash) is used to assist management and investors in measuring the returns realized at the consolidated level from capital employed. ROC - Cash is derived from Adjusted EBITDA less cash stock-based compensation, cash taxes and maintenance capital divided by Net Assets. Net Assets is an average of the beginning and ending balances of our total assets less current liabilities for the period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Divisional Return on Capital" is used to assist management and investors in measuring the returns realized at the Divisional level from capital employed. It is derived from Divisional EBITDA divided by the average of the beginning and ending balances of assets employed for the period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Funds from operations" is used to assist management and investors in analyzing cash flow and leverage. Funds from operations as presented is not intended to represent operating funds from operations or operating profits for the period, nor should it be viewed as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities, net earnings or other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with IFRS. Funds from operations is derived from the consolidated statements of cash flows and is calculated as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Management Commentary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the second quarter, Adjusted EBITDA was up 20 percent compared to last year, primarily driven by contributions from our growth investments," said Al Cadotte, President and CEO of Newalta.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to expect 20 percent growth in Adjusted EBITDA for the year, driven by our growth capital investments and market activity.&#160;We are making solid progress on the strategic review of our Industrial Division.&#160;At the same time, we are evaluating our organization capacity and investment opportunities to accelerate our growth plans in both the Oilfield and New Markets Divisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We remain well positioned to deliver attractive returns for our shareholders for many years ahead." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consolidated Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second quarter revenue was up 9% to $213.1 million.&#160;Adjusted EBITDA increased 20% to $46 million compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 22%, up from 20% in 2013. Returns from growth capital investments in New Markets and Oilfield, coupled with the savings realized from the Rationalization Plan in Industrial and favourable commodity prices drove growth.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Year-to-date, Adjusted EBITDA was $78.1 million, up 18% over the prior year. Year-to-date results reflect the same factors as the quarter and were tempered by the impact of extreme weather on first quarter results. Revenue from contracts generated 16% of consolidated revenue on a trailing-twelve month (TTM) basis compared to 11% in TTM Q2 2013.&#160;The net loss in earnings for the quarter and for the year of $8.2 million and $1.7 million, respectively, was driven by higher stock-based compensation expense, restructuring related costs and higher finance charges associated with the early redemption of the Series 1 Senior Unsecured Debentures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q2 2014 Adjusted SGA improved to 10.0% of revenue from 10.8% in 2013, primarily due to overhead reductions in the quarter as part of the rationalization plan initiated in the first quarter focused primarily on our Industrial Division (Rationalization Plan).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital expenditures for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 were $32.8 million and $59.9 million, respectively, focused primarily on growth projects in New Markets and Oilfield.&#160;We remain on track to execute our capital expenditures program of approximately $145 million in growth capital and $35 million in maintenance capital this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operational Overview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Markets revenue and gross profit in the quarter increased 27% and 19%, respectively, to $71.1 million and $22.3 million compared to prior year. Improved performance was primarily driven by strong returns from our growth capital investments, particularly our mature fine tailings (MFT) contracts and U.S. satellites.&#160;Year-to-date, revenue and gross profit increased by 31% and 18%, respectively, to $127.2 million and $36.9 million compared to prior year, driven by Heavy Oil and U.S satellites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oilfield revenue and gross profit in the quarter increased 15% and 18%, respectively, to $45.3 million and $16.9 million compared to prior year. Performance was driven by returns from our growth capital investments, increased drilling activity, and improved commodity prices. Year-to-date, revenue and gross profit increased by 13% and 10%, respectively, to $99.6 million and $37.5 million compared to prior year. Results were impacted by the same factors as the quarter and were tempered by the impact of extreme weather on operating costs in the first quarter of 2014. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industrial revenue decreased by 4% to $96.7 million while gross profit increased by 18% to $14.5 million. Year-to-date, revenue decreased 5% to $174.1 million while gross profit increased by 16% to $20.9 million, compared to prior year. Savings realized from the Rationalization Plan and gains from favorable commodity prices were partially offset by lower waste receipts at the Stoney Creek Landfill (SCL). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent Developments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the first quarter, we initiated the Rationalization Plan associated with the comprehensive review announced in December 2013 focused on our Industrial Division.&#160;To date, we have closed four facilities, reduced overhead in associated support functions and have redirected lines of business.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Q2, we engaged RBC Capital Markets to conduct a review of a full range of potential alternatives for our Industrial Division, including a potential sale, IPO or spin-off of the division, in whole or in parts (Strategic Review).&#160;We are committed to optimizing value from this division.&#160;While this review is underway, we are developing our 2015 to 2018 business plan excluding the Industrial Division.&#160;We are allocating resources towards our highest growth areas in both the Oilfield and New Markets Divisions, to accelerate and expand our organic growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, we realized approximately $4.0 million in savings associated with the Rationalization Plan and remain on track to realize approximately $10 million in annualized cash savings.&#160;Including costs associated with the Strategic Review, we incurred approximately $5.5 million in one-time restructuring costs and anticipate incurring an additional $1.0 million before year end.&#160;We will assess and update savings and cost estimates throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Rationalization Plan discussed above, we are assessing our cost structure across all divisions, including SGA. We have identified areas to better align resources with our business needs and have intiated steps to realize additional cost savings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Highlights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta's Board of Directors declared a second quarter dividend of $0.125 per share ($0.50 per share annualized), paid July 15, 2014, to shareholders on record as at June 30, 2014.&#160;This higher dividend rate established earlier this year reflects our positive outlook for the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 1, 2014, we issued $150 million Series 3 Senior Unsecured Debentures with a seven-year term, bearing interest at the rate of 5.875% per annum.&#160;Proceeds from the offering were used to redeem our $125 million 7.675% Series 1 Senior Unsecured Debentures and to repay a portion of outstanding debt on our credit facility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the quarter we also secured a contract with Shell Canada Limited (Shell) for construction services to build a new MFT plant at Shell's Jackpine Mine.&#160;We began work on this contract in the second quarter and expect work to continue into the first quarter of 2015.&#160;This contract is in addition to the contract awarded in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July we were awarded a contract with Syncrude Canada Ltd (Syncrude) for commissioning its full-scale centrifugation facility that will process MFT at Syncrude's Mildred Lake operations near Fort McMurray, Alberta. This contract builds on our relationship with Syncrude over the past four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outlook&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We expect to deliver Adjusted EBITDA growth of 20% over 2013.&#160;Growth capital investments combined with improved commodity prices, the rationalization initiatives focused primarily on the Industrial Division and reductions in SGA, will drive strong returns and improved results over prior year.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
			
				In New Markets, we expect growth to be driven by our onsite contracts as well as continued progress in the U.S. expansion.&#160;We continue to work on securing new contracts, including MFT processing in the oil sands, and on the development of our Fort McMurray facility.&#160;In 2014, we plan to establish three additional satellites in the U.S.
            In Oilfield, we expect growth to be driven by our satellite program and steady drilling activity.&#160;Operations at our satellites commissioned in the second quarter will ramp up in the second half of 2014. In 2014, we plan to establish two additional satellites.
            In Industrial, we expect improved returns from steady activity levels and initiatives implemented under the Rationalization Plan. Full year activity levels at Ville Ste-Catherine (VSC) and SCL are expected to be in line with 2013.&#160;
			&lt;p&gt;We continue to focus on growing our portfolio of longer term contracts, strengthening our foundation of stable cash flow, and maximizing returns from our existing assets.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quarterly Conference Call&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Management will hold a conference call on Thursday, August 7, 2014 at 11:00 a.m. (ET) to discuss Newalta's performance for the quarter ended June 30, 2014.

			&lt;p&gt;During the second quarter, we engaged a financial advisor to conduct a Strategic Review for our Industrial Division which&#160;is ongoing.&#160;As such, forward-looking information in this document is made subject to any changes that may be implemented as a result of this Strategic Review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By its nature, forward-looking information involves numerous assumptions, known and unknown risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, that contribute to the possibility that the predictions, forecasts, projections and other forward-looking information will not occur.&#160;Many other factors could also cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking information and readers are cautioned that the foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive.&#160;Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should assumptions underlying the forward-looking information prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described herein as intended, planned, anticipated, believed, estimated or expected.&#160;Furthermore, the forward-looking information contained in this document is made as of the date of this document and, in each case, is expressly qualified by this cautionary statement.&#160;Unless otherwise required by law, we do not intend, or assume any obligation, to update any such forward-looking information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information contained on our website does not form part of this press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Press Release contains references to certain financial measures, including some that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS" or "GAAP") and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other corporations or entities.&#160;These financial measures are identified and defined below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"EBITDA", "EBITDA per share", "Adjusted EBITDA", and "Adjusted EBITDA per share" are measures of our operating profitability. EBITDA provides an indication of the results generated by our principal business activities prior to how these activities are financed, assets are amortized or impaired, or how the results are taxed in various jurisdictions.&#160;In addition, Adjusted EBITDA provides an indication of the results generated by our principal business activities prior to recognizing stock-based compensation and restructuring related costs. Adjusted EBITDA provides improved continuity with respect to the comparison of our operating results over a period of time. Stock-based compensation, a component of employee remuneration, can vary significantly with changes in the price of our common shares while restructuring costs are outside of our normal course of business. Restructuring related costs are charges primarily attributable to the Rationalization Plan and Strategic Review.&#160;EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are derived from the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.&#160;EBITDA per share and Adjusted EBITDA per share are derived by dividing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by the basic weighted average number of shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are calculated as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch Affirms JPMCC 2012-C8
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed 13 classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Trust 2012-C8, commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates series 2012-C8 (JPMCC 2012-C8). A detailed list of rating 
      actions follows at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations are due to stable pool performance. There have been no 
      delinquent or specially serviced loans since issuance. Fitch reviewed 
      the most recently available quarterly financial performance of the pool 
      as well as updated rent rolls for the top 15 loans, which represent 
      69.5% of the transaction. Fitch has designated two (7.0%) Fitch Loans of 
      Concern (FLOC).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the July 2014 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 3.7% to $1.1 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest loan in the pool (11.4%) is secured by an 1.0 million square 
      foot (sf) interest in a 1.2 million sf regional mall located in 
      Springfield, MO. Anchors include: JC Penney, Dillard's, Dillard's Mens  
      Home, Macy's and Sears (non-collateral). As of year-end (YE) 2013, the 
      servicer-reported collateral occupancy and debt service coverage ratio 
      (DSCR) was 96.0% and 3.42x, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second largest loan in the pool (9.8%) is secured by a 280,299 sf 
      office building located in Seattle, WA. The property is leased to 
      multiple tenants under three primary General Services Administration 
      (GSA) leases, which expire between 2019 and 2022. As of YE 2013, 
      occupancy and DSCR were a reported 94.1 % and 1.55x respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The larger of the two FLOCs (6.4%) is secured by a portfolio of 
      industrial properties. The loan was the second largest loan in the pool 
      at issuance and is currently the fourth largest loan. The loan was 
      originally backed by seven industrial properties located in two states 
      (Connecticut and Massachusetts); one property, which had been fully 
      leased to Kraft and had been vacant at issuance was released in 
      September 2013. The remaining portfolio is 98% leased with 38.5% 
      scheduled to expire in 2015. Per the master servicer, lease renewal 
      discussions regarding the largest lease (20.9%) will begin towards the 
      end of this year. As of YE 2013 DSCR was reported at 1.90x; NOI for the 
      remaining properties has increased 7.3% since issuance.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co has won the dismissal of a lawsuit by the City of Los Angeles accusing the largest U.S. bank of steering minority borrowers into mortgages they could not afford, even after similar cases against the next three largest banks were allowed to go forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a decision made public on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Otis Wright said the city could not hold JPMorgan responsible for questionable lending by the former Washington Mutual Inc, under a federal law governing the wind-down of failed banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright said Los Angeles may file an amended complaint focused on JPMorgan's, but not WaMu's, lending practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the largest U.S. thrift, WaMu failed in September 2008, when JPMorgan acquired most of it in a $1.9 billion sale supervised by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We respectfully disagree with the court's ruling as to the loans made by Washington Mutual, and are exploring our options," said Frank Mateljan, a spokesman for Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer, who filed the lawsuit on May 30.

&lt;p&gt;Aug 6 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co has won the
dismissal of a lawsuit by the City of Los Angeles accusing the
largest U.S. bank of steering minority borrowers into mortgages
they could not afford, even after similar cases against the next
three largest banks were allowed to go forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a decision made public on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge
Otis Wright said the city could not hold JPMorgan responsible
for questionable lending by the former Washington Mutual Inc,
under a federal law governing the wind-down of failed banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright said Los Angeles may file an amended complaint
focused on JPMorgan's, but not WaMu's, lending practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the largest U.S. thrift, WaMu failed in September 2008,
when JPMorgan acquired most of it in a $1.9 billion sale

Mike Feuer, who filed the lawsuit on May 30. "In the meantime,
we are aggressively pursuing our case against JPMorgan Chase."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Jason Lobo said: "We are pleased with
this decision, and we will continue to carry out our strong

liable for lost property tax revenue and higher costs to
maintain properties and ensure public safety, as a result of
about 200,000 foreclosures in the second most-populous U.S. city
from 2008 to 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDIC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright accepted JPMorgan's argument that the Financial
Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA), a
1989 law passed after that decade's savings-and-loan crisis,
blocked plaintiffs such as Los Angeles from pursuing many claims
over failed banks until they exhaust a separate FDIC claims
process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge said that made the city's lawsuit against JPMorgan
different from its similar lawsuits against Bank of America Corp
, Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. Those
lawsuits have survived motions to dismiss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"FIRREA bars this court from hearing the city's claims as
they relate to WaMu's discriminatory lending practices," Wright
wrote, in a decision dated August 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge said the rest of the lawsuit also had to be
dismissed because Los Angeles "lumps loans issued by both Chase
and WaMu together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he gave Los Angeles permission to file an amended
complaint that tries to "excise" allegations related to WaMu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles accused New York-based JPMorgan of engaging
since 2004 in a "continuous pattern and practice" of mortgage
discrimination in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It faulted alleged practices by the bank such as putting
minority borrowers into riskier loans than white borrowers,
causing a disproportionate number of foreclosures in minority
neighborhoods, and denying credit to minority borrowers on the
same terms as white borrowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is City of Los Angeles v. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co et
al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No.
14-04168.

		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA--(Marketwired - Aug 6, 2014) - Appcelerator, provider of the enterprise mobile engagement platform, has teamed up with Microsoft to connect the Appcelerator Platform with Microsoft Azure services. This will simplify the process of building fully native cross-platform apps powered by Azure. Organizations can now leverage existing development resources and connect to existing Azure modules, providing a significant competitive advantage and allowing companies to create a more seamless mobile presence across all devices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Fortune 1000 enterprises today use Microsoft Azure, Windows and other Microsoft services to drive business growth. With the proliferation of mobile devices and apps among both customers and employees, these organizations now have to build apps and manage non-Microsoft mobile devices for the first time. With this new integration, Appcelerator's ecosystem of more than 600,000 developers can now connect Microsoft-managed data via the Appcelerator Platform and Microsoft Azure. Moreover, enterprises have the ability to create apps for Windows 8, seamlessly extending their mobile development efforts to reach more people with high-quality user experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To power this integration, Microsoft and Appcelerator jointly developed modules enabling Appcelerator-built apps to connect to Azure App Services. This includes data object storage; authentication for third-party services and social networks (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, Microsoft Online Services and Azure Active Directory); and access to Microsoft's Notification Hub for push notification services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft helps companies do business faster and more competitively across a wide variety of platforms," said Kim Akers, general manager, Microsoft. "With this new integration, we will be able to connect our enterprise mobile stack to Appcelerator's mobile engagement platform, enabling enterprises to get more out of their Microsoft investments and supercharge their mobile strategies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The integration of the two platforms will help companies:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Connect Microsoft-managed data to Appcelerator-built apps via Azure Cloud
            
				Minimize development costs by leveraging existing JavaScript skillsets
            
				Mobilize and synchronize data managed via Microsoft Sharepoint and Dynamics
            
				Build and deploy fully native Windows 8 apps faster
            
				Deliver real-time analytics and reporting on apps upon deployment
			&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is one of the clear leaders in the enterprise software landscape," said Jeff Haynie, CEO, Appcelerator. "By integrating our mobile engagement platform with their powerful suite of business products and services, we're enabling developers to quickly and cost-effectively deploy native Windows 8 apps, with existing resources. This will allow them to reach new audiences and deliver high-quality user experiences without hiring new developers or retraining staff."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this set of critical integrations, CIOs and developers will be able to deliver Microsoft-powered mobile apps faster and at a lower cost. Over time, they'll be able to measure the success of these apps and optimize the user experience to deliver maximum value for employees and consumers alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more, please visit&#160;www.appcelerator.com/microsoft&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Appcelerator

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co confirmed on Wednesday it had taken advertisements off four Russian television channels, saying a fall in second-quarter sales had prompted a rethink of its marketing plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian business daily Kommersant reported earlier that Coca-Cola had stopped placing ads on REN-TV, Channel Five, Domashny and Russia's Defense Ministry's channel Zvezda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newspaper quoted sources saying this was probably linked to U.S. and European sanctions over Ukraine because a businessman hit by the Western measures is linked to three of the TV channels in question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola denied there was any political motive behind its decision to change its TV advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a result of the evaluation of Coca-Cola's beverage sales  in the second quarter of 2014 in Russia, we have made a decision to change the plan of promotional activities on TV and focus on key federal channels and most efficient channels with regards to our target audience," a company spokeswoman said by email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no political motive in this decision," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first two channels mentioned by Kommersant - REN-TV and Channel Five - are part of the media holding company National Media Group, which is owned by Yuri Kovalchuk's St-Petersburg-based Bank Rossiya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A close ally of President Vladimir Putin, Kovalchuk was hit by U.S. sanctions in March and blacklisted by the European Union last month. Washington said Kovalchuk had been targeted because he was a "personal banker" for Putin and other officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kovalchuk also owns a 25-percent stake in CTC Media, the parent of the Domashny Channel, through Bank Rossiya's subsidiary Telcrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola, however, pointed out that it had not withdrawn ads from the other two channels controlled by CTC Media - CTC and Peretz. The U.S. company said it would still be advertising on 13 Russian channels, after dropping the four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said in its second-quarter report last month that it saw a mid single-digit decline in Russian sales volumes and recorded a loss of $25 million related to restructuring its Russian juice operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had earlier predicted that volume growth in Russia would slow to "mid single digits" this year after high single digit volume growth previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Kommersant, Coca-Cola is one of the biggest advertisers in Russia with annual spending of 2.5 billion roubles ($69 million), while rival Pepsico spent some 7 billion roubles on promotions in Russian media last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1 US dollar = 36.2005 Russian rouble)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Maria Kiselyova; editing by David Clarke)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Shoppers entering a Walt Disney Co retail store these days can see company CEO Bob Iger's franchise strategy on display: walls packed with products linked to the company's famous characters, ranging from Mickey and Minnie to "Guardians of the Galaxy," Iron Man and Doc McStuffins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten years after being sold off and six years after Disney bought them back, Disney's 336 retail stores have helped make its consumer products division among the fastest-growing of the media company's five segments. In the quarter that ended in June, the unit earned $273 million, a 25 percent increase from a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the unit's fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth, Iger said when the company announced its results on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger's franchise strategy focuses on making larger-budget films like "Maleficent" that stand out in a crowd. Three years ago, he dispatched Bob Chapek, a veteran of the movie studio, to run the consumer products division, where he's done much the same thing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapek organized the unit around franchises, rather than categories such as footwear or lunch boxes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Consumers know that their children love a specific Disney franchise, whether it be Doc McStuffins, Frozen, or Minnie Mouse," Chapek said. Parents think "I want to buy Doc McStuffins," he said, before considering the type of product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger's franchise strategy is the reason that over the past eight years the company paid $15 billion to buy Pixar, Marvel and George Lucas' Lucasfilm "Star Wars" factory. Iger directed the company's movie studio to focus on fewer films built around franchises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of Chapek's work at consumer products, which operates the Disney stores and licenses characters, is building on existing franchises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company worked with licensee Hasbro to create 12-inch-tall Titan Heroes, from its "Avengers" line of figures, after research by Hasbro in Latin America showed customers wanted bigger toys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People who wouldn't otherwise be buying into the action figure category are now buying," Hasbro Chief Executive Brian Goldner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consumer products unit will be Disney's fastest-growing segment over the next five years, said Bernstein Research analyst Todd Juenger, who predicts earnings will grow at 13 percent compounded annual growth rate through fiscal 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New ideas from consumer-product staff include international dolls from Disney's "It's a Small World" ride and selling furry Tsum Tsum characters from a Disney video game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapek's strategy involves some risk-taking, said Stephen Berman, chief executive of Disney licensee Jakks Pacific. For Doc McStuffins, toys were in the market four months after the TV premiere, rather than waiting the typical 18 months to see if it was a hit. The bet was right on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of Doc McStuffins toys helped retail sales for the Disney Junior preschool business double to $1.9 billion in fiscal 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's taking a risk, but it's a calculated risk," Berman said. "Who could have figured McStuffins would be as big as it's become?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unit also is creating new franchises from book publishing. In May, it released the first in the "Deep Blue" mermaid series along with a song and music videos. In January it will launch "The Zodiac Legacy" thriller series from Marvel Comics creator Stan Lee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every Disney product is a mega-hit in toyland. Sales of products related to 2011 film "Cars 2" were big, but not as high as licensees expected, said Needham &amp; Co analyst Sean McGowan.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - A Chinese anti-trust regulator conducted new raids on Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and partner in China Accenture PLC (ACN.N), the agency said on its website on Wednesday, after saying last week Microsoft is under investigation for anti-trust violations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) raided offices in Beijing, Liaoning, Fujian and Hubei, it said.

&lt;p&gt;VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Wealthy foreigners hoping to fast-track immigration to Canada are preparing to sue Ottawa over the government's cancellation of its immigrant investor program, which has been assailed for allowing rich Chinese to buy their way into Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timothy Leahy, a lawyer who represents a group of mostly Chinese would-be immigrants in an ongoing case over long wait times for the now-defunct program, said he expects to file a second lawsuit within two months. This time, he and fellow immigration lawyer Rocco Galati are eyeing class action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're going to try to start a so-called class action for the investors whose files were closed," Leahy said. "If closing down the files is struck down as illegal, it would apply to everybody." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would mean the revival of thousands of applications that were killed when the Conservative government's Bill C-31 passed through parliament in June. The legislation cancels the "millionaire" immigration stream for which some processing times had lengthened to more than five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada's Federal Court ruled against Leahy's group of would-be immigrant-investors on the wait times case in June, though Leahy has filed an appeal that he expects to be heard sometime next year. The new lawsuit would be a separate case challenging the cancellation of the program&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launched in the mid-1980s, the immigrant investor program promised a fast-track visa for foreigners who had a minimum net worth of C$800,000 ($732,533) and at least C$400,000 to invest in the country. The minimums were later upped to a net worth of C$1.6 million and C$800,000 to invest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nancy Caron, spokeswoman for the government's citizenship and immigration department, said the backlog of investor applications was bogging down the immigration system. She said that with its cancellation, the government can now focus on initiatives that will better meet the country's economic needs.    Canada receives about 257,000 immigrants each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program was wildly popular, particularly with ethnic Chinese investors - first from Hong Kong and Taiwan, and later from mainland China. Vancouver, with its proximity to the Asia-Pacific region, was the preferred destination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many of my clients bought properties in Canada after they got the visa, but some of them bought before getting the visa," said Art Yang, chairman of Gasheng Overseas Investment Group, based in Guangzhou, China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They would be the more radical plaintiffs in this case against the federal government because they feel that they had spent a lot for the immigration." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 30,000 Chinese landed in Vancouver in the 1980s and 1990s on investor-class visas, according to data compiled by David Ley, a Vancouver-based geographer and author of the book "Millionaire Migrants". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was all quite deliberate," said Ley, who is also a professor at the University of British Columbia. "Basically, the three levels of Canadian government here - city, province and federal - were very eager to get investment from East Asia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the program may have been too successful. In the 2000s, Chinese applications soared, hitting a peak in 2010. By 2012, the backlog of unprocessed applications in Hong Kong alone hit 16,340, up from just 1,645 in 2006, according to court documents. Each applicant may represent numerous dependants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, housing prices were soaring in Vancouver, earning it the dubious title of North America's least affordable city and spurring a backlash against foreign investors for pricing ordinary Canadians out of the housing market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the cancellation of the investor immigrant program, realtors and developers braced for a collapse of Vancouver's luxury housing market, but so far that has not happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have not seen any measurable impact on Chinese demand for property in Canada as a result of the ending of the investment visa program," said Andrew Taylor, co-CEO of Juwai.com, an online marketplace that helps Chinese people to invest in overseas real estate. "Canada is still a top-five country for Chinese buyers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The music will keep playing as long as Canada is willing and China is wealthy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Clare Jim in Hong Kong; Editing by Peter Galloway)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Aug 7 (Reuters) - International Business
Machines Corp unveiled a "brain-like" computer chip on
Thursday that is the size of a postage stamp and capable of
processing massive amounts of data while handling inputs from
many different sources, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement comes one month after IBM unveiled a $3
billion investment over the next five years in chip research and
development to find a game-changing breakthrough that can help
revive its slumping hardware unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike most chips, which operate on pre written paths, IBM's
version processes data in realtime and is capable of dealing
with ambiguity, the company said. It runs on the energy
equivalent of a hearing aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built on Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co Ltd's 28nm
process technology, the chip only consumes 70mW of energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A product of almost a decade of research, the chip aims to
bridge the divide between existing computers and the brain's
high cognitive power and low energy use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After years of collaboration with IBM, we are now a step
closer to building a computer similar to our brain," said
Professor Rajit Manohar at Cornell Tech, where the chip was
designed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chip contains one million programmable neurons and could
allow a thermometer to scan and smell chemical signals and
deliver a diagnosis, or help a search and rescue robot to
identify people in need during a disaster, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM hopes it can integrate multi-sensory processing into
mobile devices and says the chip can handle future advances in
memory, 3G integration, logic and sensor technologies.

      Leading technology companies CSC 
      (NYSE: CSC) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) 
      today announced they are building on their existing alliance with new 
      ways to help global customers accelerate their transition to the cloud.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Enterprise clients increasingly are seeking to use the cloud to enhance 
      workforce performance, advance mobility, improve access to information 
      and gain competitive advantage &#8211; without losing their existing 
      infrastructure investment. CSC and IBM together will address these 
      growing needs by developing and offering clients a broad set of secure 
      cloud solutions offered &#8220;as-a-service&#8221; to increase operational agility, 
      choice, flexibility, and cost-savings. In addition to app development 
      and infrastructure management, new offerings to clients include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        A CSC Center of Excellence (&#8220;CoE&#8221;) offering clients a broad range of 
        IBM solutions and platforms, including IBM 
        Cloud&#8217;s SoftLayer&#174; infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) and BluemixTM, 
        IBM&#8217;s open cloud platform for development of web and mobile 
        applications;
      
			
        The compatibility of SoftLayer IaaS with CSC&#8217;s ServiceMesh 
        Agility Platform&#8482;, which will enable customers to simplify and 
        standardize the deployment, integration, and management of solutions 
        built on SoftLayer, an IBM company, Bluemix and other cloud 
        environments;
      
			
        The future addition of CSC&#8217;s ServiceMesh Agility Platform to the IBM 
        Cloud Marketplace, which allows developers, IT managers and business 
        leaders to learn, try and buy software and services from IBM and its 
        global partner ecosystem;
      
			
        A joint marketing, sales and consulting collaboration to create a 
        single, consumable services framework to support client app 
        development and modernization, Big Data and Analytics, cloud and 
        mobility infrastructure capabilities, and security.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;

      companies&#8217; speed-to-market capabilities with modernized applications 
      that are informed by analytics, live in any cloud, and securely serve 
      the growing information and accessibility needs of users anytime, 
      anywhere.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM has been aggressively moving forward with its SoftLayer offerings, 
      building out a network of 40 cloud centers across the globe. Since its 
      $2 billion acquisition of SoftLayer a year ago, IBM has poured $1 
      billion into a new Watson business unit, with Watson running on 
      SoftLayer, and another $1 billion to establish the Bluemix cloud 
      platform-as-a-service (PaaS) to help millions of developers build cloud 
      applications running on SoftLayer, with work based on Cloud 
      Foundry. The IBM Cloud marketplace hosts hundreds of SaaS and 
      infrastructure cloud services for business and IT professionals, as well 
      as developers, to bring the breadth of IBM-as-a-service to clients in 
      just a few clicks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Enhancing our partnership with IBM strengthens CSC&#8217;s strategy to 
      modernize, mobilize, integrate, secure and manage the evolving global 
      application ecosystem and our ability to helping clients transition to 
      the hybrid cloud,&#8221; said Jim 
      Smith, executive vice president  general manager, CSC Global 
      Business Services. &#8220;By collaborating, CSC and IBM can ensure that 
      clients put the right information into the right employee hands at the 
      right time wherever they may be. Clients will benefit from greater 
      choice, operational agility, cost savings, and integration flexibility 
      when they become cloud-empowered enterprises.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;IBM Cloud is designed to assist clients in the hybrid cloud era, from 
      the powerful footprint of SoftLayer to the rapid app development 
      environment of Bluemix to the breadth of our Software-as-a-Service 
      offerings on the IBM Cloud marketplace.&#8221; said Steve Robinson, General 
      Manager of IBM Cloud Platform Services. &#8220;As we expand our relationship 
      with CSC, we will work to bring even greater flexibility to our client 
      bases as they increase their social, mobile and Big Data workloads in 
      the cloud.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms Televisa at 'BBB+'; Outlook Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed Grupo Televisa, S.A.B.'s (Televisa) foreign 
      and local currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'BBB+' as well as 
      the company's long-term national scale rating at 'AAA(mex)'. A complete 
      list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. The Rating 
      Outlook is Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Televisa's 'BBB+' ratings reflect the company's strong business position 
      as the leading Mexican TV Broadcaster and one of the largest media 
      companies in the Spanish-speaking world, diversified media and 
      telecommunications portfolio, solid financial position underpinned by 
      its robust free cash flow generation and liquidity, as well as the 
      extended debt maturity profile. Televisa's ratings factor in the 
      company's exposure to economic cycles, strong competition across 
      business segments, and increasing regulatory pressure in Mexico.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings also reflect Televisa's strategy to expand its business 
      through organic growth and cash investments for acquisitions. The recent 
      investments made by Televisa include its purchase of MXN7 billion 
      convertible notes and USD195 million debt instrument of Tenedora Ares, 
      S.A.P.I. de C.V. (ARES). ARES is the owner of 51% of Grupo Cable TV, 
      S.A. de C.V. (Cablecom), a Mexican cable operator. Televisa has also 
      invested in Broadcasting Media Partners (BMP), the parent of Univision 
      Communications, Inc. (Univision), a U.S. based Spanish language 
      broadcast network, and GSF Telecom Holdings, which owns Iusacell, a 
      Mexican mobile operator. The company's growth strategy continues to be 
      centered on telecommunication in Mexico and the U.S. media sectors. If 
      Televisa receives regulatory approval to convert its investment in ARES 
      into equity, its business position and cash generation will improve.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Key Rating Drivers
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Robust Cash Generation from Contents:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Televisa's high quality in-house content production has enabled it to 
      maintain its largest broadcasting market position in Mexico, which has 
      given it a stable audience and reliable advertising revenue stream. The 
      company generates well over 10% of its total revenues from network 
      subscriptions and licensing/syndication businesses, as a result of the 
      increased pay TV subscribers globally including Mexico and higher 
      royalties from contents sales. Televisa distributes its contents to more 
      than 50 countries, including the United States through a Program License 
      Agreement (PLA) with Univision which provides a stable royalty income 
      until 2025, or beyond, should Televisa remain as a shareholder. Content 
      sales also improve geographic and currency diversification which helps 
      mitigate the risk stemming from the maturity and intense competition of 
      the Mexican broadcast industry.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Increasing Regulatory Pressure:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch expects the constitutional reform on the Mexican media sector to 
      result in an increased level of competition in the long-term; the impact 
      should be manageable for Televisa, however, as its content production 
      ability remains intact, which continues to be key to advertisement 
      revenue. Fitch does not foresee any significant dilution of the 
      company's market share over the medium term, and thus its cash flow and 
      financial profile will remain relatively stable. It will require 
      significant time and resources for new entrants to become competitive in 
      their contents' quality against Televisa.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In March 2014, the company was declared as the 'preponderant' operator 
      in the broadcasting sector and unfavorable regulatory measures were 
      imposed on the company. These measures include broadcasting 
      infrastructure sharing and making available the company's over-the-air 
      channels to third party platforms on the same terms and conditions as 
      those offered to its affiliates. The reform measures will also allow two 
      new broadcasters in the market. Televisa has already been subject to the 
      'must-offer' regulation since September 2013 and guided for only about 
      MXN1.4 billion revenue decline during 2014 from this new measure, which 
      is less than 2% of the total sales Fitch forecasts in 2014. On the other 
      hand, Televisa's telecom operations could benefit from a more favorable 
      competitive environment from the regulation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Operational Diversification Continues:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Solid growth in the company's pay-TV and telecom businesses has 
      continued to support its diversification from broadcast advertising 
      revenues. Integration of the content production and solid distribution 
      channels has been the company's key business strategy enabling a more 
      stable operating performance and stronger business profile compared to 
      its regional peers. In the first half of 2014, Televisa generated more 
      than half of its total operating segment income from non-contents 
      segment, with Sky, its direct-to-home (DTH) satellite operation, and 
      Telecommunications segment accounting for 29% and 24% of the total 
      operating segment income, respectively. The company has maintained a 
      double-digit revenue growth for these businesses which has helped 
      mitigate slowing industry growth from the mature advertising business, 
      on which the competitive pressure will further increase following the 
      entrance of new broadcasters.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Strong Cash Generation:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch forecasts Televisa to maintain its positive FCF generation over 
      the medium term. The company's cash flow from operations is likely to 
      continue to be robust, around MXN20 billion in 2014 and 2015, which will 
      comfortably cover its capex, which is expected to remain in line with 
      the 2013 level of over MXN14 billion. During the past three years (2011 
      - 2013), Televisa spent approximately MXN12 billion on average for capex 
      annually, primarily to improve its business position in Sky and 
      Telecommunications segments, as well as to invest in the mandatory 
      digitalization. In the same period, due to the high capex, dividend 
      payments have remained small at about MXN1 billion per year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Solid Financial Profile:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch expects the company's total adjusted-debt including satellite 
      leases-to-EBITDA ratio to remain below 2.5x and its net-debt-to-EBITDA 
      ratio to remain below 1.5x in the long term, on a pro forma basis 
      reflecting the recent Cablecom transaction which needs regulatory 
      approval. As of June 30, 2014, the company's gross and net leverage were 
      2.7x and 1.5x. These ratios were increases from 2.3x and 1.6x at 
      end-2013. During LTM June 2014, Televisa generated MXN28.6 billion 
      EBITDA (Consolidated Operating Income plus depreciation and 
      amortization). Amid stable FCF generations, these metrics should 
      gradually strengthen barring any further sizable acquisition investments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company also has a robust liquidity as of June 30, 2014 with cash 
      and temporary investments of about MXN37 billion comfortably covering 
      MXN853 million of short-term debt. The company does not face any 
      significant debt maturities until 2016, when approximately MXN9 billion 
      of financial obligations become due, while its access to capital market 
      should remain solid.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch's expectation of sustained increases in the leverage ratios, 
      driven by high capex and sizable acquisitions, could result in a 
      negative rating action. In addition, any significant loss of market 
      share, or profitability erosion due to the increased competitive 
      pressure in its key Mexican broadcasting operation could also pressure 
      the ratings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Conversely, further geographical and business diversification away from 
      the Mexican broadcasting market, coupled with consistent free cash flow 
      generations and a lower leverage could positively affect the ratings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In conjunction with the affirmation of Televisa's IDRs at 'BBB+' and the 
      long-term national scale rating at 'AAA(mex)', Fitch affirmed the 
      following ratings:
    &lt;/p&gt;

			CJPS Healthcare Offers Special Group Buy Promotion to the Premier 
      Healthcare Alliance
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			CJPS 
      Healthcare Supplies  Equipment announced today that it has 
      negotiated an exceptional group buy promotion with the Premier 
      healthcare alliance, for its vital 
      signs monitors. Effective August 1st, the promotion 
      allows Premier members to take advantage of special pricing and terms 
      pre-negotiated by Premier for VitalPoint&#174; PRO, and select peripherals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "We are extremely pleased to extend significant savings through our 
      contract with Premier and to be able to offer its members our 
      state-of-the-art products at an exceptional value," says C. Sevrain, 
      President of CJPS Healthcare Supplies  Equipment. "Our products, built 
      in Michigan and in Arizona, provide disruptive technologies, with 
      unparalleled value, especially for Premier members who will benefit from 
      products that have been on the market for years with a very strong 
      record of reliability," he adds.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			VitalPoint&#174; 
      PRO is a full-featured vital signs monitor, including hospital 
      network capability, in a much more compact and light weight format (4.5 
      lbs.) than its more expensive competitors. Despite its small size, this 
      sub-acute / bedside / transport monitor is able to monitor arrhythmia, 
      measure blood pressure, blood oxygen saturation, pulse rate, respiration 
      rate, heart rate and temperature, as well as provide electrocardiograms.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Group Buy promotion begins August 1st and runs through 
      September 30th, 2014. Premier members can save 15 percent off 
      the already discounted contract price of the monitor and up to 50 
      percent off select accessories. If those savings were not enough, the 
      company is also including a free blood pressure cuff, pulse oximetry 
      sensor, and 5-lead ECG cable with the purchase of each VitalPoint&#174; PRO 
      monitor during this limited time. Additional savings through trade-ins 
      are also available, whether the traded in monitors work or not.

than 3 percent since a peak seen at the end of July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some traders, however, felt the index had found a floor
around current levels for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're (investors are) still a bit nervous... but in the
short term it's fairly well priced in," Manoj Ladwa, head of
trading at TJM Partners, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bank of England kept interest rates at their record low
on Thursday, giving Britain's fast economic recovery more time
to build even as differences among its policymakers become more
apparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank also left interest rates
unchanged.

      Lync&#174; 2013 Qualification
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Industry&#8217;s Broadest Portfolio of Lync Qualified SBCs Secures and Enables 
      Real-Time Communications from the Enterprise Headquarters to the Branch 
      Office
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Key Takeaways:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        The Sonus SBC SWe (Software edition) receives Microsoft Lync 2013 
        qualification.
      
			
        The Sonus SBC portfolio provides the industry&#8217;s broadest end-to-end 
        Microsoft Lync-qualified SBC solution, delivering Session Initiation 
        Protocol (SIP)-enabled applications such as Voice over Internet 
        Protocol (VoIP) and video from the enterprise headquarters to the 
        branch office.
      
			
        As a Microsoft Gold Communications Partner, Sonus is committed to 
        delivering the solutions, as well as the expertise customers need to 
        secure and enable interoperability in Microsoft Lync Enterprise Voice 
        and Microsoft Office 365 deployments.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Sonus 
      Networks, Inc. (Nasdaq: SONS), a global 
      leader in securing real-time communications, today announced that 
      the Sonus SBC SWe (Software edition) has achieved Microsoft Lync 2013 
      qualification for Session Border Controller (SBC) deployments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      More than 67 percent of enterprises have virtualized UC applications to 
      help improve resiliency and enable more efficient utilization of server 
      resources, according to Nemertes Research. The ability to deploy a 
      Lync-qualified software SBC via virtual servers already supporting Lync 
      environments enables enterprises to deploy new networking resources 
      quickly and efficiently. With the SBC SWe, enterprises can quickly 
      turn-up SBC functionality within existing virtual environments to 
      deliver built-in media transcoding, network security (such as 
      encryption, authentication and Denial of Service [DoS] protection), 
      robust Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) interworking, intelligent call 
      routing and multi-vendor interoperability in Lync deployments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sonus SBCs are installed at the border between the internal Lync 
      Enterprise Voice network and SIP trunking services at the network 
      border, to enable a more seamless flow of SIP-based media for Unified 
      Communications (UC). Integrating these powerful network devices into 
      Lync deployments protects, secures, simplifies and standardizes 
      real-time communications, such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) 
      and video.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For large enterprises, the Sonus SBC SWe is also qualified for Lync 
      Online Dedicated. For small and medium enterprises, and branch 
      deployments, the Sonus SBC 1000 and SBC 2000 Session Border Controllers 
      are tested and qualified for Lync Online Dedicated and with Exchange 
      Online Unified Messaging.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Quotes:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are pleased to continue the long-standing relationship between Sonus 
      and Microsoft by recognizing the successful Microsoft Lync 2013 
      qualification of the SBC SWe,&#8221; said Giovanni Mezgec, general manager of 
      Lync Product Marketing at Microsoft. &#8220;As a Gold Communications Partner, 
      Sonus offers a broad portfolio of software- and hardware-based Microsoft 
      Lync-qualified SBCs to help enterprises of all sizes maximize Lync 
      Enterprise Voice and Office 365 investments.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Many enterprises today are choosing an evolutionary implementation 
      strategy to Lync Enterprise Voice, starting small and either augmenting 
      existing telephony systems or gradually migrating those groups most 
      well-suited to a softphone-centric working model. The Sonus SBC SWe 
      gives enterprises a simple, cost-effective way to secure and interwork 
      their Lync environments by enabling SBC functionality in existing 
      virtual servers, with no additional hardware required,&#8221; said David 
      Tipping, vice president, Product Line Management, Sonus. &#8220;Because the 
      SBC SWe shares a common code base with the SBC 5000 Series and the SBC 
      7000, Sonus customers can seamlessly move between Lync-qualified 
      hardware and software solutions, with assurance that existing 
      communications and network investments are fully protected.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Other Facts:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        The Sonus SBC 1000 and SBC 2000 are Microsoft Lync 2013 qualified in 
        several categories, including SBC, Survivable Branch Appliance (SBA), 
        E-911 ELIN gateway and enhanced gateway.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING Aug 7 (Reuters) - International Business Machines
Corp said on Thursday it would provide cloud-based risk
analysis for a Chinese financial data firm in a deal that
executives heralded as a model for future business in China,
where state-owned enterprises are increasingly shunning foreign
technology on security grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the new software deployment model, financial data

specific portfolio holdings or having to install IBM software or

has encouraged its state enterprises to wean themselves off
foreign hardware suppliers and reportedly ordered state banks to
pull out their IBM gear earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has been particularly targeted due to the sensitive and
critical role its servers play in practically every major

business in China more broadly but said they believed the new
cloud-based deployment model would help it succeed in the

sought to reassure investors that the IBM's future in the
country remained positive with a series of partnership
agreements with Chinese agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said in July it would donate $100 million in big data
software and provide technical training at 100 Chinese

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      New Visa Service to Help Gas Station Retailers Reduce Fraud at the Pump
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Intelligent analytics help merchants identify fraud before it 
      happens; Fraud rate dropped more than 20 percent in pilot test
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), the global leader in payments, is helping U.S. fuel 
      retailers prevent credit and debit card fraud at the pump with 
      intelligent analytics that identify higher-risk transactions that may be 
      fraudulent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While global fraud rates across the Visa payment system remain near 
      historic lows &#8211; less than 6 cents for every $100 transacted &#8211; fuel pumps 
      can be targets for criminals because they are often self-service 
      terminals. The new solution, Visa Transaction Advisor (VTA), enables 
      merchants to use real-time authorization risk scores to identify 
      transactions that could involve lost, stolen or counterfeit cards. A 
      pilot test of the new service showed a 23 percent reduction in the rate 
      of fraudulent transactions &#8211; all without costly infrastructure upgrades 
      or disruption of the customer experience.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Visa Transaction Advisor uses sophisticated analytics based on the 
      breadth and scale of VisaNet data to flag the riskiest transactions,&#8221; 
      said Mark Nelsen, Vice President of Risk Products and Business 
      Intelligence, Visa Inc. &#8220;By working with fuel companies to understand 
      their needs, we were able to create a new service that builds on Visa&#8217;s 
      predictive analytics capabilities, providing fuel merchants with more 
      intelligence to prevent fraud and improve their bottom line.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			How It Works
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      After a cardholder inserts the card at the pump, Visa analyzes multiple 
      data sets such as past transactions, whether the account has been 
      involved in a data compromise, and nearly 500 other pieces of data to 
      create a risk score. This allows merchants to identify those 
      transactions with a higher risk of fraud and perform further cardholder 
      authentication before gas is pumped.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The time and costs associated with resolving fraudulent transactions can 
      be substantial for both merchants and financial institutions and 
      inconvenient for cardholders, which is one of the reasons why fraud 
      prevention is critical. Visa&#8217;s solution is easy to implement &#8211; using 
      existing message fields and formats as well as pump software or hardware 
      to ensure minimal impact to merchants and acquirers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Several fuel merchants who piloted the technology over the last several 
      months noticed a decrease in fraud, without negatively impacting their 
      consumers&#8217; experience.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        &#8220;We are excited about VTA as a tool to help mitigate fraudulent 
        transactions. We saw a 23 percent reduction in the rate of fraudulent 
        chargebacks during our Los Angeles pilot program,&#8221; said Gabriel Andres 
        Porras, Merchant Acquiring Manager, Chevron. &#8220;This was done with 
        minimal impact to the customer experience, making secure payment at 
        the pump as convenient as possible.&#8221;
      
			
        &#8220;We provide fuel to millions of customers each month through 
        approximately 15,000 service stations in the United States,&#8221; said Mike 
        Swillo, US Credit Card Operations Manager, from Shell. &#8220;When we 
        consider new solutions and technology it has to have a clear business 
        benefit, be customer-centric, and easy to implement. With no 
        infrastructure investment, we are testing VTA as part of our proactive 
        fraud prevention tool-set to better identify fraudulent card activity 
        earlier in the transaction cycle, without inconveniencing our 
        customers.&#8221;
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Transaction Advisor is available to merchants through participating 
      U.S. acquirers. Visa has partnered with Vantiv and is also working with 
      other acquirers to offer the service to its fuel clients.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        &#8220;Ease of implementation is a critical requirement whenever we&#8217;re 
        talking about a new merchant service,&#8221; said Donald Boeding, president 
        of merchant services at Vantiv. &#8220;Visa Transaction Advisor builds on 
        existing payment infrastructure, is easy to implement and flexible 
        enough to allow customization by merchants, which is why we are 
        excited to be the first acquirer to offer it to our oil merchants.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;* FTSE 100 down 0.2 pct&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* BoE holds steady as rates debate heats up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Coca-Cola HBC hurt by deterioration in Russian market&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Old Mutual weak post results but Rio Tinto helps FTSE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Tricia Wright&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Britain's top shares slipped on
Thursday, led down by bottler Coca-Cola HBC and insurer Old
Mutual on sobering results, although strong earnings from Rio
Tinto gave the market some support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola HBC, the world's No. 2 bottler of
Coca-Cola drinks, sank 3.7 percent after warning that volumes
would fall for the rest of the year, citing a "sudden
deterioration" in Russia, its biggest market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More broadly, investors were on edge over the possible
impact of tit-for-tat sanctions announced by Russia, introduced
after the West penalised it over suspicions that it has
supported pro-Moscow rebels in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FTSE 100 was down 11.42 points, or 0.2 percent, at
6,624.74 points by 1117 GMT, meaning the index has fallen some 3
percent since a peak seen at the end of July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some traders, however, felt the index had found a floor
around current levels for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're (investors are) still a bit nervous... but in the
short term it's fairly well priced in," Manoj Ladwa, head of
trading at TJM Partners, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bank of England kept interest rates at their record low
on Thursday, giving Britain's fast economic recovery more time
to build even as differences among its policymakers become more
apparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank also left interest rates
unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old Mutual was another big faller, off 2.5 percent
after foreign exchange headwinds dampened a headline jump in
profit, traders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But fellow insurer Aviva climbed 2.7 percent, the top
FTSE 100 riser, after unveiling a 4 percent rise in first-half
operating profit as its European and UK general insurance
businesses built on a strong start to the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The index also received support from Anglo-Australian miner
Rio Tinto, up 1.7 percent after reporting a 21 percent
rise in first-half profit, beating market forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The miner slashed capital spending and cut costs faster than
expected while ramping up iron ore output, prompting a rise that
contributed 2.8 points to the benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"'World Class' is the line CEO Sam Walsh is using to
describe the results and the proof is plain to see," said Evan
Lucas, analyst at IG. "The results beat on all major
comparisons."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three-quarters of analysts with ratings on the stock believe
Rio Tinto is either a "buy" or "strong buy", Thomson Reuters
Starmine data showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Alistair Smout; Editing by Kevin

&lt;p&gt;Aug 7 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc said it was

for the potential misuse and circulation of non-public

&lt;p&gt;ATHENS Aug 7 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola HBC, the world's
No. 2 bottler of Coca-Cola drinks, warned volumes would fall for
the rest of the year, citing a "sudden deterioration" in Russia,
its biggest market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottler, which buys syrup concentrate from Coca-Cola and
then bottles and distributes the U.S. group's drinks in 28
countries in Europe and Nigeria, posted a 6 percent rise in
second-quarter profit to 135 million euros ($181 million) from
127 million euros in the same period a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the company warned difficult economic and trading
conditions had forced it to review its outlook for volumes, and
it expected the trend of declining volumes to continue for the
rest of the year. Volumes fell 3 percent in the first half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Russia, volumes fell by a low single digit percentage in
the second quarter, the first decline in 11 quarters. The
company said the escalation of the crisis in Russia and Ukraine
had affected consumer spending in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The prevailing difficult economic and trading conditions,
the sudden deterioration in Russia ... have led us to review our
volume outlook," the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sharp devaluation in the Russian rouble and Ukrainian
hryvnia against the euro due to political tensions in Ukraine
damaged CC HBC's results in the first quarter as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group said foreign exchange losses for the full year
would be lower than initially expected, at around 80-90 million
euros in 2014, 10 million euros lower than the range projected
in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greece, a significant market in terms of profit, declined by
a low single digit in the second quarter. The company said it
was still cautious, citing record unemployment and falling
household incomes in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company moved its headquarters to Switzerland from
debt-laden Greece last month and its primary listing to London
to save on taxes and improve access to capital markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1 US dollar = 0.7479 euro)

company said the escalation of the crisis in Russia and Ukraine
had affected consumer spending in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The prevailing difficult economic and trading conditions,
the sudden deterioration in Russia ... have led us to review our
volume outlook," the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sharp devaluation in the Russian rouble and Ukrainian
hryvnia against the euro due to political tensions in Ukraine
damaged CC HBC's results in the first quarter as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group said foreign exchange losses for the full year
would be lower than initially expected, at around 80-90 million
euros in 2014, 10 million euros lower than the range projected
in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greece, a significant market in terms of profit, declined by
a low single digit in the second quarter. The company said it
was still cautious, citing record unemployment and falling
household incomes in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company moved its headquarters to Switzerland from
debt-laden Greece last month and its primary listing to London
to save on taxes and improve access to capital markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1 US dollar = 0.7479 euro)

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - A former Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) employee was sentenced to two years in prison on Friday for his part in an insider trading scheme that netted him and his partner more than $400,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Jorgenson, 32, had pleaded guilty to securities fraud for his part in a sophisticated operation in which he passed private information he gleaned from his job as a corporate finance manager at Microsoft to a former colleague who traded stocks and options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is important that you serve as a public example," U.S. District Judge Marsha Pechman said in handing down the sentence in Seattle federal court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors had sought a prison sentence of 2-1/2 years for Jorgenson, who they say was the instigator of the scheme. Jorgenson, a father of four with no history of crime, had asked for one year and a day imprisonment, plus 500 hours of community service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jorgenson's day-trader accomplice Sean Stokke, 29, was sentenced to 1-1/2 years in prison two weeks ago. The maximum penalty for insider trading is 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission jointly charged the two men in December with operating an insider trading scheme. Jorgenson was fired by Microsoft soon after the scheme came to light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to charging documents, the pair's cooperation began in April 2012 when Jorgenson found out through his job in Microsoft's treasury department that the software company was planning a multi-million-dollar investment in the digital business of bookseller Barnes &amp; Noble Inc. (BKS.N) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He passed that information to Stokke, who bought options betting that Barnes &amp; Noble's stock would rise. The stock jumped about 50 percent when the investment was announced in late April 2012, reaping Stokke a profit of more than $184,000, prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stokke, who had previously worked with Jorgenson at an asset management company, shared the profits with his partner via envelopes stuffed with $10,000 in cash, according to the charges, which resulted from probes by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair repeated a similar process twice in the following 18 months, prosecutors said, buying options on Microsoft stock or an exchange-traded fund prior to the release of earnings that Jorgenson knew would surprise Wall Street and cause sharp moves in the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two men took in a total profit of $414,000 from the combined trades and planned to start their own hedge fund, according to prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is USA v Brian Jorgenson, case number 2:14-cr-00120-MJP in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington at Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;MINNEAPOLIS, MN--(Marketwired - Aug 8, 2014) -  A six-bedroom estate in the heart of the affluent Mendota Heights, Minnesota, will sell at a live real estate auction through J. P. King Auction Company. The estate, known as Three Meadows, was originally listed at $7.9 million, but it will sell to the highest bidder at or above $2.5 million on August 26. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With over 12,000 square feet of space to live and entertain, Three Meadows was built by Richard and Jamie Chapman and has served as their family home. It features six bedrooms and nine bathrooms, spread across five acres of meadow and wooded views. The main floor contains the formal living and dining areas, along with a kitchen that serves as the hub of the home. With a walk-in pantry and a professional appliance package, it also has access to the two-story, three-car garage and a butler's pantry that leads to the dining room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"First of all, I would describe this as a warm, inviting and friendly home, despite its grandeur," said Barry Berg, Minnesota's top-selling Realtor -- Coldwell Banker Burnet's Barry Berg Group is working in conjunction with J. P. King on the sale. "But one of the things that stands out the most to me is that it's a newer home with the type of character and quality that you just rarely find in modern homes today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The master suite features a beverage center and a decorated, two-sided fireplace to heat both the bedroom and the separate bathing area, which includes heated floors, a clawfoot tub and a Roman shower room. A dressing room, his-and-hers walk-in closets and a lounge with French doors that open to a private terrace finish out the suite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the second floor contains four of the remaining bedrooms and a private bonus room, the lower level is where the Chapmans spend the most time. With a list of rooms that include a library, family room, theater room, wine tasting room, wine cellar, exercise room, billiards room, gymnasium and a second kitchen, it also transforms into a swimmers' lounge with the sliding glass doors. The outdoor space is anchored by a heated pool with a water feature and color fiber lights, with a sun deck and a paver brick patio surrounding. In the park-like landscaping, an outdoor dining area and fire pit continue the entertaining opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The is not one of, but the prime lot in Mendota Heights," Berg said. "It's at the end of a beautiful, long street on five acres, and it's an absolutely exquisite piece of property with a lot of wonderful family living spaces."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Three Meadows auction closely follows J. P. King's sale of Brentwood Estates, a 30-acre property in Garfield, Minnesota. Sitting on the Big Chippewa Lake, it brought the county's highest sales price in over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The auction for Three Meadows will take place on Tuesday, August 26 at 11 a.m. at the property, which is located at 614 Hidden Creek Trail in Mendota Heights.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Carl Levin is preparing a last push to bring Wall Street's big commodity traders to heel during his final months in office, wrapping up a nearly two year-long probe that could potentially reveal abuses in energy and metals markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin's investigators have met with representatives from Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase in recent weeks, according to sources familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executives from those companies may appear at a hearing as early as September, during which Levin's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations would present the findings of the probe, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for Goldman and JPMorgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Senate investigators have explored whether Wall Street has abused its commodities holdings at the expense of clients, consumers, the environment or the health of the market, according to the people familiar with the probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The probe's findings and the possible hearing will add to the scrutiny Wall Street firms have already faced from the Federal Reserve and from other lawmakers over whether it is appropriate for banks to maintain vast holdings in metals warehouses and other physical commodities businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies including MillerCoors LLC and The Coca-Cola Co, for example, have accused warehouses and their owners of distorting supplies, inflating the prices of aluminum, and costing consumers billions of extra dollars annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street has found it lucrative to have a hand in both the trading and delivery of commodities but some investment banks have retreated from parts of the businesses as they have become the focus of lawsuits, regulatory scrutiny and public outrage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has sold its physical trading business and Goldman is selling its metals storage company but the banks have not dropped all such holdings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FINAL TARGETS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks' commodities businesses is one of the final targets for Levin, who is retiring at the end of this year after serving on the powerful investigations panel for around 15 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levin said in an interview on Thursday that he expects to conclude his work on Wall Street and commodity investments before he departs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are looking at the physical commodities issue. There may be one other (issue to investigate), but I don't want to say what it might be," said Levin, a Michigan Democrat. He declined to elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levin's panel began examining the commodities market in late 2012, after several months of growing complaints from metals users and following a Reuters story that highlighted a behind-the-scenes struggle between the banks and the Fed over commodity trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A front-page New York Times story and a Senate Banking subcommittee hearing in mid-2013 added to the pressure, and the Fed said early this year that it was likely to push forward with new measures to limit banks' involvement in the raw materials supply chain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BEYOND BANKS' STABILITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Fed has examined whether Wall Street's broad ownership of mines, wells or other physical assets could present a risk to a bank's solvency, Levin said his questions go deeper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are looking at many aspects of physical commodities... It is broader than safety and soundness," Levin said, using a regulatory term for bank stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate returns from summer recess in early September and sources said a hearing on the commodity issue is likely in the second or third week of that month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levin took control of the oversight panel for the second time in 2007 and has often excoriated Wall Street executives about their business tactics, use of tax loopholes and other perceived abuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over four, politically-charged hearings in April 2010, Levin summoned regulators and Wall Street executives to answer for their behavior during the global financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2013, he grilled executives from JPMorgan about trades that led to $6.2 billion losses known as the "London whale" trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such hearings can shine an important spotlight on regulatory failings and wrongdoing, Levin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Douwe Miedema David Lawder in Washington; Editing by Karey Van Hall and Frances Kerry)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Repeats for additional subscribers)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Jessica Dye&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aug 8 (Reuters) - Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer is
facing a mounting wave of lawsuits by women who allege that the
company knew about possible serious side effects of its
blockbuster anti-cholesterol drug Lipitor but never properly
warned the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past five months, a Reuters review of federal court
filings shows, lawsuits by U.S. women who say that taking
Lipitor gave them type-2 diabetes have shot up from 56 to almost
1,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits began to be filed not long after the Food and Drug
Administration in 2012 warned that Lipitor and other statins had
been linked to incidents of memory loss and a "small increased
risk" of diabetes. According to plaintiffs' lawyers, women face
a higher risk than men of developing diabetes from using
Lipitor, and gain fewer benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent spike in lawsuits followed a decision by a
federal judicial panel to consolidate all Lipitor diabetes
lawsuits from around the country into a single Federal courtroom
in Charleston, South Carolina. Pfizer opposed the consolidation,
arguing it would prompt copycat filings. The first case is
scheduled to be tried next July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said in a statement that it denied liability and
would fight the lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not uncommon for a drugmaker to get hit with thousands
of lawsuits over its products after the FDA orders a label
change alerting users to newly found risks. Takeda
Pharmaceutical, for instance, is facing more than 3,500
federal lawsuits since 2011 when the FDA ordered it to update
the label on its diabetes drug Actos to warn about bladder
cancer. Takeda has denied liability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But several factors set the Lipitor diabetes cases apart
from those against other drug companies. For one, Lipitor is the
best-selling prescription drug of all time, racking up global
sales of more than $130 billion since it went on the market in
1996. More than 29 million patients in the United States have
been prescribed the drug, suggesting there is a vast pool of
potential plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, potentially complicating matters for
plaintiffs, the FDA emphasized the benefits of statins even as
it warned of the risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the labeling change was released in 2012, a top FDA
official underscored that the agency still stood behind the
drugs: "Clearly, we think that the heart benefit of statins
outweighs this small increased risk (for diabetes)," Amy Egan, a
deputy director for safety at the agency's Division of
Metabolism and Endocrinology, said in a statement at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statins are a class of drugs that block the liver's
production of cholesterol to reduce the risk of heart disease.
Type 2 diabetes, once known as adult-onset or
noninsulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition that
affects the way the body metabolizes glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISKS AND BENEFITS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seemingly mixed message from the FDA suggests that
litigation will focus on two questions: how big a diabetes risk
do women using Lipitor face, and whether that risk is mitigated
by the drug's cardiovascular benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;H. Blair Hahn of Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, the lead
lawyer appointed to represent Lipitor plaintiffs in federal
court, said the plaintiffs contracted diabetes as a consequence
of taking Lipitor, and that women with diabetes see the length
and quality of their lives reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will ask a jury to decide what it's worth to take five
years of someone's life," Hahn said. He said the nearly 1,000
cases filed so far represent 4,000 women, and that the number of
cases could ultimately reach 10,000 or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it believes Lipitor did not cause the
plaintiffs' diabetes. Women who are prescribed Lipitor to
control cholesterol may share other risk factors that make them
vulnerable to the disease, such as high blood pressure or
obesity, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pfizer statement said there is an "overwhelming
consensus" in the medical community about statins' benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BELLWETHER TRIALS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first Lipitor trial, scheduled for next July before U.S.
District Judge Richard Gergel, will be one of several so-called
"bellwethers" used to gauge the strength of other cases. If
Pfizer prevails, it could persuade plaintiffs to accept smaller
settlements or drop cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer could also opt to settle before a single case is
tried to avoid possible negative exposure or to prevent
potentially damaging information from coming to light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If past settlements are any guide, Pfizer's potential
exposure could be substantial. Bayer, the maker of
one-time rival statin Baycol, paid $1 billion in 2005 to settle
about 3,000 cases alleging the drug caused rhabdomyolysis, a
disease that breaks down muscle tissue. Baycol was pulled from
the market in 2001 after being linked to 31 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011 AstraZeneca said it would pay $647 million to
resolve most of the 28,000 lawsuits it faced alleging its
antipsychotic Seroquel caused diabetes and other injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has not indicated that it has set aside any money
specifically to cover potential future Lipitor judgments,
according to its most recent quarterly filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Green, an expert in mass torts at the Wake Forest
University School of Law, said he did not expect Pfizer to
settle at this stage, especially given the major obstacle
plaintiffs still face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(They) have to show they were actually harmed by this
agent," he said. "That might be hard."

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FAIRFIELD, Conn., Aug. 8, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via PRWEB - MOP Environmental Solutions, Inc. and JPO Companies, Inc. Complete Merger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nearly-four-year saga of MOP Environmental Solutions, Inc. (Pinksheets: MOPN) from near-bankruptcy following the death of CEO and Inventor Charles Diamond to a company poised to break out in the environmental remediation arena, is finally completed; as today James O'Brien, CEO of the new MOP Environmental Solutions, Inc. announced the completion of the merger between MOP and JPO Companies, Inc. bringing the JPO Absorbents line of products under the MOP banner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We knew that this was going to be a challenging process," said CEO O'Brien, "JPO was a great little company and MOP was in trouble, but had the intellectual property that we needed to break out - to make us stand out in the field. Bringing the two companies together with some new products - like MOP Plus - combining the technologies of the two companies has created a company where truly the whole is greater than the sum of the parts; we are incredibly excited about the future. " &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the past year we have been field testing the response of customers and prospects to our new JPO-Ultra Blend, the JPO-100 series, current MOP products, and to MOP Plus, our newest product. The response has been tremendous!  Combining the intellectual property, the patents and the assets of the two companies allows us to aggressively reach out to both the response side and the maintenance side of the spill cleanup market - something that very few other companies can do. We believe that the result will be exponential rather than linear growth for the new MOP Environmental Solutions, Inc. through the existing relationships and extensive network of JPO Absorbents."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Jamie O'Brien deserves a lot of credit for having the foresight to bring this merger to completion," said James Reck, Vice President of the new MOP Environmental Solutions. "He has carefully tested the markets and then constructed a solid pathway for the merger that will allow us to hit the ground running, including bringing MOPN into compliance with Pinksheets and taking steps to protect the interests of shareholders in the process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With characteristic modesty, O'Brien said, "A lot of people deserve credit for where we are today, this hasn't been a one man show. Jim Reck has kept us moving ahead even when things seemed to be tied up in knots.This has been a team effort and moving forward it will be the new core group that makes MOP Environmental Solutions a powerhouse in the spill response/clean up and environmental remediation field. I am proud to be associated with these folks and I look forward to making things happen for MOP and JPO."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forward-looking statements in this news release are pursuant to safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer is facing a mounting wave of lawsuits by women who allege that the company knew about possible serious side effects of its blockbuster anti-cholesterol drug Lipitor but never properly warned the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past five months, a Reuters review of federal court filings shows, lawsuits by U.S. women who say that taking Lipitor gave them type-2 diabetes have shot up from 56 to almost 1,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits began to be filed not long after the Food and Drug Administration in 2012 warned that Lipitor and other statins had been linked to incidents of memory loss and a "small increased risk" of diabetes. According to plaintiffs' lawyers, women face a higher risk than men of developing diabetes from using Lipitor, and gain fewer benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent spike in lawsuits followed a decision by a federal judicial panel to consolidate all Lipitor diabetes lawsuits from around the country into a single Federal courtroom in Charleston, South Carolina. Pfizer opposed the consolidation, arguing it would prompt copycat filings. The first case is scheduled to be tried next July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said in a statement that it denied liability and would fight the lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not uncommon for a drugmaker to get hit with thousands of lawsuits over its products after the FDA orders a label change alerting users to newly found risks. Takeda Pharmaceutical, for instance, is facing more than 3,500 federal lawsuits since 2011 when the FDA ordered it to update the label on its diabetes drug Actos to warn about bladder cancer. Takeda has denied liability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But several factors set the Lipitor diabetes cases apart from those against other drug companies. For one, Lipitor is the best-selling prescription drug of all time, racking up global sales of more than $130 billion since it went on the market in 1996. More than 29 million patients in the United States have been prescribed the drug, suggesting there is a vast pool of potential plaintiffs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, potentially complicating matters for plaintiffs, the FDA emphasized the benefits of statins even as it warned of the risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the labeling change was released in 2012, a top FDA official underscored that the agency still stood behind the drugs: "Clearly, we think that the heart benefit of statins outweighs this small increased risk (for diabetes)," Amy Egan, a deputy director for safety at the agency's Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology, said in a statement at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statins are a class of drugs that block the liver's production of cholesterol to reduce the risk of heart disease. Type 2 diabetes, once known as adult-onset or noninsulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition that affects the way the body metabolizes glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISKS AND BENEFITS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seemingly mixed message from the FDA suggests that litigation will focus on two questions: how big a diabetes risk do women using Lipitor face, and whether that risk is mitigated by the drug's cardiovascular benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;H. Blair Hahn of Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, the lead lawyer appointed to represent Lipitor plaintiffs in federal court, said the plaintiffs contracted diabetes as a consequence of taking Lipitor, and that women with diabetes see the length and quality of their lives reduced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will ask a jury to decide what it's worth to take five years of someone's life," Hahn said. He said the nearly 1,000 cases filed so far represent 4,000 women, and that the number of cases could ultimately reach 10,000 or more.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it believes Lipitor did not cause the plaintiffs' diabetes. Women who are prescribed Lipitor to control cholesterol may share other risk factors that make them vulnerable to the disease, such as high blood pressure or obesity, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pfizer statement said there is an "overwhelming consensus" in the medical community about statins' benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BELLWETHER TRIALS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first Lipitor trial, scheduled for next July before U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel, will be one of several so-called "bellwethers" used to gauge the strength of other cases. If Pfizer prevails, it could persuade plaintiffs to accept smaller settlements or drop cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer could also opt to settle before a single case is tried to avoid possible negative exposure or to prevent potentially damaging information from coming to light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If past settlements are any guide, Pfizer's potential exposure could be substantial. Bayer, the maker of one-time rival statin Baycol, paid $1 billion in 2005 to settle about 3,000 cases alleging the drug caused rhabdomyolysis, a disease that breaks down muscle tissue. Baycol was pulled from the market in 2001 after being linked to 31 deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011 AstraZeneca said it would pay $647 million to resolve most of the 28,000 lawsuits it faced alleging its antipsychotic Seroquel caused diabetes and other injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has not indicated that it has set aside any money specifically to cover potential future Lipitor judgments, according to its most recent quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Green, an expert in mass torts at the Wake Forest University School of Law, said he did not expect Pfizer to settle at this stage, especially given the major obstacle plaintiffs still face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(They) have to show they were actually harmed by this agent," he said. "That might be hard." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jessica Dye in New York; Editing by Ted Botha, Eric Effron and Amy Stevens and John Pickering)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Adds details, quotes, context)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Alexei Anishchuk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOCHI, Russia Aug 9(Reuters) - U.S. oil giant ExxonMobil
 began drilling in Russia's Arctic on Saturday, despite
Western sanctions imposed on its Russian partner Rosneft, and
was hailed by Russia's president as an model of "cooperation".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although U.S. sanctions over the crisis in Ukraine are not
designed to halt joint projects by Russian and U.S. companies,
they nevertheless aim to starve Rosneft of dollar financing and
ban access to modern technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today, commercial success is driven by efficient
international cooperation," Vladimir Putin told Rosneft CEO Igor
Sechin and Glenn Waller, ExxonMobil's lead manager in Russia, on
a videoconference call from his Black Sea residence in Sochi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Businesses, including Russian and foreign companies,
perfectly realise that and despite certain current political
difficulties, pragmatism and common sense prevail, and we are
pleased to hear that," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon brought a rig from Norway to drill Russia's first well
in the Kara Sea and its move will be seen as a vote of
confidence in Rosneft, run by a close ally of Putin's, Igor
Sechin, who has also had sanctions imposed on him by Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We of course welcome this approach (to cooperate) and are
from our side are open to expand our cooperation," Putin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am convinced that the joint projects between Rosneft,
Exxon Mobil and other companies will benefit our national
economies, will contribute to strengthening the global energy
situation," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waller, who spoke Russian, said the company was keen to keep
working in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our cooperation is a long-term one," he said. "We see big
benefits here and are ready to work here with your agreement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States and the European Union have introduced
sanctions, from asset freezes and visa bans for businessmen and
officials thought close to Putin, to limits on access to Western
capital for Russian state banks over what Western powers say is
Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moscow has responded by banning food imports from the United
States, European Union, Australia, Canada and Norway, with Prime
Minister Dmitry Medvedev threatening further counter-sanctions
if the West presses ahead with more penalties.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE Aug 11 (Reuters) - Singapore-based upstream oil
and gas firm KrisEnergy Ltd said on Monday it has
agreed a $65 million deal to buy out Chevron Corp's 
interest in an offshore oil block in Cambodia and take over as
the block's operator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KrisEnergy said in a statement it plans to acquire the
entire issued share capital of Chevron Overseas Petroleum
(Cambodia) Ltd, a subsidiary of the global oil company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is subject to regulatory approvals. Other partners
in the joint venture, MOECO Cambodia Co. Ltd and GS Energy
Corporation, have approved the transaction, KrisEnergy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the deal is completed, KrisEnergy will increase its
stake in Cambodia Block A from 25 percent to 52.25 percent.  
The block is located in the Gulf of Thailand, where Chevron
struck oil a decade ago - the first significant oil discovery in
Cambodia's history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the launch of production has been delayed for years, as
Chevron, the operator of the block, failed to reach an agreement
with the government on a final investment decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KrisEnergy said it intends to work with the Cambodian
authorities to agree the terms and conditions of the production
licence before declaring a final investment decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best estimate contingent resources, or potentially
recoverable quantity of petroleum, attributable to KrisEnergy's
enlarged stake in the project, will be about 5.4 million barrels
of oil equivalent as of the end of 2013, KrisEnergy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KrisEnergy shares jumped 2.7 percent to S$0.75, the largest
daily rise in over a month, but they have fallen more than 40
percent so far this year.

&lt;p&gt;Aug 11 (Reuters) - On a trip to Beijing a decade ago, Bill
Gates was asked by a senior government official how much money
Microsoft Corp made in China. The official asked the
interpreter to double check Gates' reply as he couldn't believe
the figure was so low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a problem that hasn't gone away. Indeed, Microsoft's
current issues in China conceal a deeper problem for the U.S.
software giant - despite the popularity of its Windows operating
system and Office suite, few people in emerging markets are
willing to pay for legitimate copies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This not only costs Microsoft in lost revenue, but is also
holding back the spread of its newest Windows 8 version -
analysts say even buyers of pirate software prefer older
versions. According to StatCounter, a website that tracks what
software is loaded on Internet-connected computers, more than 90
percent of PCs in China - now the world's biggest market - are
running pre-8 versions of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is trying to tackle this. This year it's offering
Windows 8 at a discount to PC manufacturers who install its Bing
search engine as the default. And it's giving away versions of
Windows 8 for phones and some tablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, as the industry shifts from desktop to mobile, the
cloud and free or cheap software, China sums up both the old and
new challenges Microsoft faces in making money in emerging
markets - and, increasingly, in developed ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The great danger for the company is that what has happened
to them in emerging markets - basically no revenue from new PCs
because of piracy - is not far off what's happening everywhere,"
said Ben Thompson, the Taiwan-based author of stratechery.com, a
popular technology blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CORE COST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For sure, China is a major, and unique, headache for
Microsoft. Many of the problems are tied to a broader push by
the Chinese government to limit foreign firms' dominance and
encourage local technology firms to become viable competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of healthy relations with Beijing, Microsoft
last month was suddenly targeted by anti-monopoly regulators who
raided its China offices as part of a price-fixing
investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the spats mask the fact that Microsoft has never really
cracked how to get people in emerging markets to pay for its
software. The company rarely breaks out revenues by geography,
but it has provided clues about the size of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, then CEO Steve Ballmer reportedly told employees
that, because of piracy, Microsoft earned less revenue in China
than in the Netherlands - with 1 percent of its population -
even though China bought as many computers as the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the BSA anti-piracy lobby group that Microsoft
co-founded, emerging markets account for 56 percent of all PCs
in use, and 73 percent of software piracy. Of the $77.8 billion
revenue Microsoft generated in its 2013 financial year, China,
Brazil and Russia each "exceeded" $1 billion, according to a
Microsoft presentation. For comparison, Apple Inc 
generated $27 billion in Greater China, which includes Hong Kong
and Taiwan, in its 2013 financial year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Microsoft, that's a lot of lost revenue from the heart
of its business. "Windows and Office are still very much the
core of Microsoft," says Sameer Singh, an India-based analyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most recent breakdown by Microsoft of its results by
product line - for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 - shows that
56 percent of its global revenue and 78 percent of operating
profit came from Windows and Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft doesn't just lose the revenue from pirate copies,
it also loses access to customers who might buy other Microsoft
products that work with or on top of Windows and Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across most markets, Windows and Office account for more
than half of revenues, says Andrew Pickup, Microsoft's Asia PR
chief. This, analysts say, is because many of Microsoft's other
products, such as Exchange and Windows servers, depend on
customers already using Windows and Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Microsoft ecosystem is obviously pretty
interconnected," says Jan Dawson of U.S.-based Jackdaw Research.
"So it makes sense that the proportion of revenue would be
similar in emerging markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAKED PCS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the intractability of piracy in emerging markets is
that each part of the chain poses a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For PC makers working on wafer-thin margins the operating
system is one of the costliest parts of the machine, while
mom-and-pop shops which form the bulk of retailers in such
markets can't afford to turn away price-sensitive customers who
are comfortable buying pirate software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem, therefore, starts with computer makers, Singh
says, since "convincing them to ship every PC with Windows
pre-installed is difficult." Margins on PCs for a company like
Lenovo Group Ltd are "near single digits," says Bryan
Wang, an analyst at Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is that up to 60 percent of PCs shipped in the
emerging markets of Asia, says IDC research manager Handoko
Andi, have no Windows operating system pre-installed - so-called
'naked PCs', which usually instead carry some free, open source
operating system like Linux. That compares with about 25 percent
in the region's developed markets like Japan and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A quick scan of Taobao, the popular Chinese e-commerce site
operated by Alibaba, shows a vast selection of PCs shipped with
Linux rather than Windows. Once the machines hit the retailers,
it's hard to tell where legitimate software stops and piracy
begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a recent morning in Zhongguancun, a teeming electronics
hub in north Beijing, shopkeepers offered to bundle what they
said were legitimate versions of Windows with a new laptop,
either for free or the equivalent of about $30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft began lobbying Lenovo in 2004 to stop shipping
naked PCs, but the Chinese firm countered that its margins were
too low, a person familiar with the negotiations said. Two years
later - just days before then-President Hu Jintao visited Gates'
U.S. home - China announced a new law requiring PCs to be
shipped with operating systems. That merely dented piracy rates,
which fell to 79 percent in 2009 from 92 percent in 2004,
according to the BSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo said it reached an agreement with Microsoft in June
of this year to ensure that Lenovo PCs sold in China would come
pre-installed with a genuine Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"MOBILE ALSO-RAN"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's new approach is to push the price of Windows low
enough to make it worth a PC maker's while. The cost of a
Windows licence has fallen to below $50 from as high as $150,
said IDC's Andi, taking Microsoft down to "levels where they've
never competed before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Pickup said it was too early to gauge take-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, making Windows cheaper for PCs is just part of
a broader response to deeper shifts in the industry. The rise of
mobile, tablets, cloud-based services and free operating systems
has marginalised Microsoft and challenged its business model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Windows is on more than 90 percent of traditional
computers - according to data compiled by analyst Ben Bajarin -
that figure drops to below 14 percent once mobile devices such
as phones and tablets are factored in, estimates Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than half those devices run Google's Android
mobile OS, which is effectively free to handset and tablet
makers. Apple, a key player in all types of devices, gives away
upgrades to its operating systems for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pickup says Microsoft has listened to phone makers'
complaints and relaxed what hardware they need to install the
mobile version of Windows. It has also made the operating system
free on any mobile device of 9 inches or less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the moves are "about bringing down the cost
as more and more of the populations in these emerging markets
are having their first computing experience," Pickup said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are significant concessions, analysts say, but
Microsoft will have to learn to be a bit player, where its
software and services run on other people's operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest threat to Microsoft," Dawson said, "is the
shift from a PC-based world where Microsoft dominated to a
mobile world where Microsoft is an also-ran."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amazon.com has halted pre-orders of some Disney movies, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, in what appears to be another contract dispute after the online giant began a protracted spat with publisher Hachette Book Group this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has halted pre-orders of some Disney movies, the Wall Street Journal reported, in what appears to be another contract dispute after the online retailer began a protracted spat with publisher Hachette Book Group this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical copies of titles such as "Maleficent" and "Captain America: The Winter Soldier" were unavailable for order on Amazon.com on Sunday. Digital copies of some of the movies in question were still available for pre-order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment on the report. A Disney spokesman had no comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon has been waging a battle against Hachette, the fourth-largest U.S. book publisher, over the price the online retailer can charge for e-books. Hachette is owned by France's Lagardere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group called Authors United ran a two-page ad in the New York Times on Sunday, criticizing Amazon for halting pre-orders from some Hachette authors and slowing delivery of books by Hachette authors. The ad was signed by more than 900 writers, including Stephen King and Donna Tartt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, Amazon.com's Books Team ran a message on a website (www.readersunited.com/) on Friday evening reiterating its arguments for cheaper ebooks, and suggested people email Hachette CEO Michael Pietsch. The company published Pietsch's email address and listed key points people might want to make. [ID:nL2N0QF0FJ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pietsch replied to every individual who emailed him saying that the dispute started because Amazon is seeking a lot more profit and even more market share at the expense of authors, bookstores and Hachette.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Both Hachette and Amazon are big businesses and neither should claim a monopoly on enlightenment, but we do believe in a book industry where talent is respected and choice continues to be offered to the reading public," Pietsch wrote on Sunday, a copy of which was emailed to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once again, we call on Amazon to withdraw the sanctions against Hachette's authors that they have unilaterally imposed, and restore their books to normal levels of availability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon says pricing e-books at $14.99 or $19.99 is too expensive. It argues that cheaper e-books sell more copies and so ultimately generate more revenue and more royalties for authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Luciana Lopez; Additional reporting by Lisa Richwine and Ronald Grover in Los Angeles, and Ankush Sharma in Bangalore; Editing by Alison Williams, Sonya Hepinstall and Gopakumar Warrier)&lt;/p&gt;

      Chevron Introduces Line of Clarity Synthetic EA Hydraulic and Gear Oils
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Products Meet Enhanced EPA Requirements for Marine Vessels, Reduce 
      Impact of Accidental Discharge in Construction and Agriculture 
      Applications
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Products Company, a Chevron U.S.A. Inc. division, maker of 
      advanced lubricants for commercial, consumer, industrial and marine 
      markets, today unveiled its new line of Clarity&#174; Synthetic EA 
      Hydraulic and Gear Oils for the marine industry and other applications 
      where leaks or accidental discharge are a concern. These products meet 
      the new EPA Vessel General Permit (VGP) requirements for environmentally 
      acceptable lubricants (EALs).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Clarity Synthetic EA Hydraulic and Gear Oils are designed to give 
      maximum protection and provide good seal compatibility in hydraulic 
      equipment and industrial gear applications on vessels and equipment 
      where performance is critical. This includes marine applications such 
      as: stern tubes, thrusters, controllable pitch propellers, stabilizers, 
      rudder bearings and other mechanical equipment subject to immersion. 
      These products may be used in other hydraulic and gear applications 
      requiring high performance lubricants. The oils are high viscosity index 
      (VI) synthetic products that provide premium performance and long oil 
      life, while allowing for operation over a wide temperature range.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Clarity Synthetic EA Hydraulic Oils are designed to the performance 
      requirements of synthetic antiwear hydraulic oils, while providing VGP 
      compliance in case of leaks or incidental discharge to the environment. 
      Chevron will offer three grades of Clarity Synthetic EA Hydraulic Oils 
      (ISO 46, 68 and 100) for use in hydraulic systems as recommended by: ISO 
      15380 HEPR, DIN, Denison and Eaton-Vickers. The ISO 68 and 100 products 
      are recommended for marine stern tube usage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Environmental compliance is a major concern for companies in the 
      marine, agriculture and construction markets,&#8221; commented Jim Gambill, 
      Manager Americas Marketing with Chevron Products Company. &#8220;The goal is 
      to meet these regulatory and environmental requirements, without 
      sacrificing equipment durability. The new Clarity Synthetic EA hydraulic 
      and gear oils provide high performance while meeting today&#8217;s 
      environmental standards. With the Clarity Synthetic EA hydraulic and 
      gear oils, we&#8217;re able to deliver the same oil performance our customers 
      expect from Chevron, with products that biodegrade by more than 60% 
      within 28 days.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About the Vessel General Permit
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the revised VGP, effective December of last year, all vessels 
      entering or operating in U.S. waters are required to use EALs in all 
      oil-to-sea interfaces. This includes any application that is under the 
      vessel&#8217;s waterline, as well as applications such as mooring lines where 
      lubricants may be exposed over water. A lubricant is characterized as an 
      EAL if it meets applicable criteria for biodegradability, toxicity to 
      aquatic organisms and is not bioaccumulative.

&lt;p&gt;SOCHI Russia (Reuters) - U.S. oil giant ExxonMobil began drilling in Russia's Arctic on Saturday, despite Western sanctions imposed on its Russian partner Rosneft, and was hailed by Russia's president as an model of "cooperation".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although U.S. sanctions over the crisis in Ukraine are not designed to halt joint projects by Russian and U.S. companies, they nevertheless aim to starve Rosneft of dollar financing and ban access to modern technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today, commercial success is driven by efficient international cooperation," Vladimir Putin told Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin and Glenn Waller, ExxonMobil's lead manager in Russia, on a videoconference call from his Black Sea residence in Sochi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Businesses, including Russian and foreign companies, perfectly realize that and despite certain current political difficulties, pragmatism and common sense prevail, and we are pleased to hear that," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon brought a rig from Norway to drill Russia's first well in the Kara Sea and its move will be seen as a vote of confidence in Rosneft, run by a close ally of Putin's, Igor Sechin, who has also had sanctions imposed on him by Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We of course welcome this approach (to cooperate) and are from our side are open to expand our cooperation," Putin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am convinced that the joint projects between Rosneft, Exxon Mobil and other companies will benefit our national economies, will contribute to strengthening the global energy situation," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waller, who spoke Russian, said the company was keen to keep working in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our cooperation is a long-term one," he said. "We see big benefits here and are ready to work here with your agreement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States and the European Union have introduced sanctions, from asset freezes and visa bans for businessmen and officials thought close to Putin, to limits on access to Western capital for Russian state banks over what Western powers say is Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moscow has responded by banning food imports from the United States, European Union, Australia, Canada and Norway, with Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev threatening further counter-sanctions if the West presses ahead with more penalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Writing by Dmitry Zhdannikov and Katya Golubkova; Editing by Polina Devitt and Louise Ireland)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Adds response from Hachette CEO)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 11 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has
halted pre-orders of some Disney movies, the Wall Street Journal
reported, in what appears to be another contract dispute after
the online retailer began a protracted spat with publisher
Hachette Book Group this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical copies of titles such as "Maleficent" and "Captain
America: The Winter Soldier" were unavailable for order on
Amazon.com on Sunday. Digital copies of some of the movies in
question were still available for pre-order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com did not immediately respond to a request seeking
comment on the report. A Disney spokesman had no comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon has been waging a battle against Hachette, the
fourth-largest U.S. book publisher, over the price the online
retailer can charge for e-books. Hachette is owned by France's
Lagardere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group called Authors United ran a two-page ad in the New
York Times on Sunday, criticizing Amazon for halting pre-orders
from some Hachette authors and slowing delivery of books by
Hachette authors. The ad was signed by more than 900 writers,
including Stephen King and Donna Tartt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, Amazon.com's Books Team ran a message on a
website (www.readersunited.com/) on Friday evening
reiterating its arguments for cheaper ebooks, and suggested
people email Hachette CEO Michael Pietsch. The company published
Pietsch's email address and listed key points people might want
to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pietsch replied to every individual who emailed him saying
that the dispute started because Amazon is seeking a lot more
profit and even more market share at the expense of authors,
bookstores and Hachette.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Both Hachette and Amazon are big businesses and neither
should claim a monopoly on enlightenment, but we do believe in a
book industry where talent is respected and choice continues to
be offered to the reading public," Pietsch wrote on Sunday, a
copy of which was emailed to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once again, we call on Amazon to withdraw the sanctions
against Hachette's authors that they have unilaterally imposed,
and restore their books to normal levels of availability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon says pricing e-books at $14.99 or $19.99 is too
expensive. It argues that cheaper e-books sell more copies and
so ultimately generate more revenue and more royalties for
authors.

			Pfizer Reports Top-line Results from Postherpetic Neuralgia and 
      Painful Diabetic Peripheral
			Neuropathy Lyrica&#174; 
      Studies Conducted in China
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today top-line results from two 
      placebo-controlled studies conducted in China with Lyrica&#174; 
      (pregabalin) in patients with postherpetic neuralgia (pain after 
      shingles or PHN) and painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (pDPN), 
      respectively. The PHN Phase 4 study, A0081276, met its primary endpoint 
      by demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in pain when 
      compared to placebo. Separately, the pDPN Phase 3 study, A0081265, did 
      not meet its primary endpoint, a statistically significant change in 
      endpoint mean pain score relative to placebo.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The PHN study was an eight-week, randomized, double-blind, multi-center, 
      placebo-controlled, post-marketing study evaluating the efficacy, safety 
      and tolerability of pregabalin 300mg/day in the treatment of subjects 
      with PHN. For the primary efficacy parameter, change from baseline in 
      weekly mean pain scores (0-10 numeric rating scale), a significant 
      treatment difference of -0.71 points for pregabalin relative to placebo 
      was observed (p=0.0002). The safety profile in this study was consistent 
      with the known profile for Lyrica. The most common adverse events 
      reported for subjects given Lyrica were dizziness, oedema peripheral, 
      dry mouth and somnolence.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PHN is a type of peripheral neuropathic pain caused by nerve damage. PHN 
      symptoms include continued burning or electric shock-like pain.1
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The pDPN study was a 11-week randomized, double-blind, multi-center, 
      placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy, safety and 
      tolerability of pregabalin 300 mg/day in the treatment of subjects with 
      pDPN. For the primary efficacy parameter, endpoint mean pain score (0-10 
      numeric rating scale), a treatment difference of -0.28 points for 
      pregabalin relative to placebo was observed (p=0.0559). The safety 
      profile of pregabalin in this study was consistent with the known 
      profile for Lyrica. The most common adverse events reported by subjects 
      given Lyrica were dizziness and somnolence.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      pDPN is a form of permanent nerve damage characterized by burning, 
      shooting, pins-and-needles pain in the feet and hands2.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Full results for both studies will be submitted for publication when 
      analyses are complete.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Lyrica
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lyrica&#174; is currently approved for various indications in 120 
      countries and regions globally. In China, where these two studies were 
      conducted, Lyrica is approved for PHN.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lyrica is approved for five indications in the U.S., of which four are 
      in the therapeutic area of pain. These indications include neuropathic 
      pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, post-herpetic 
      neuralgia (pain after shingles), neuropathic pain associated with spinal 
      cord injury, fibromyalgia and partial onset seizures in adults with 
      epilepsy who take one or more drugs for seizures.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the European Union, Lyrica is approved for four indications: 
      peripheral and central neuropathic pain, generalized anxiety disorder in 
      adults, and partial seizures with or without secondary generalization in 
      adults with epilepsy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In Japan, Lyrica is the only treatment approved for all three of the 
      following indications: post-herpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain and 
      pain associated with FM.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lyrica&#8217;s ongoing clinical development program is focused on the 
      significant unmet needs of patients with certain chronic pain conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including Lyrica, increase the risk of 
      suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking AEDs for any 
      indication. There have been post-marketing reports of angioedema and 
      hypersensitivity with Lyrica. Treatment with Lyrica may cause dizziness, 
      somnolence, dry mouth, edema and blurred vision. Other most common 
      adverse reactions include weight gain, constipation, euphoric mood, 
      balance disorder, increased appetite and thinking abnormal (primarily 
      difficulty with concentration/attention).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Important Safety Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      LYRICA is not for everyone. LYRICA may cause serious, even life 
      threatening, allergic reactions. Stop taking LYRICA and call your doctor 
      right away if you have any signs of a serious allergic reaction. Some 
      signs are swelling of your face, mouth, lips, gums, tongue, throat or 
      neck or if you have any trouble breathing, or have a rash, hives or 
      blisters.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Drugs used to treat seizures increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or 
      behavior. Lyrica may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small 
      number of people, about 1 in 500. Patients, family members or caregivers 
      should call the doctor right away if they notice suicidal thoughts or 
      actions, thoughts of self harm, or any unusual changes in mood or 
      behavior. These changes may include new or worsening depression, 
      anxiety, restlessness, trouble sleeping, panic attacks, anger, 
      irritability, agitation, aggression, dangerous impulses or violence, or 
      extreme increases in activity or talking. If you have suicidal thoughts 
      or actions, do not stop Lyrica without first talking to your doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      LYRICA may cause swelling of your hands, legs and feet, which can be 
      serious for people with heart problems. LYRICA may cause dizziness and 
      sleepiness. You should not drive or work with machines until you know 
      how LYRICA affects you. Also, tell your doctor right away about muscle 
      pain or problems along with feeling sick and feverish, or any changes in 
      your eyesight including blurry vision or if you have any kidney problems 
      or get dialysis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Some of the most common side effects of LYRICA are dizziness, blurry 
      vision, weight gain, sleepiness, trouble concentrating, swelling of your 
      hands and feet, dry mouth, and feeling &#8220;high&#8221;. If you have diabetes, 
      tell your doctor about any skin sores.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      You may have a higher chance for swelling and hives if you are also 
      taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors so tell your 
      doctor if you are taking these medications. You may have a higher chance 
      of swelling of your hands or feet or gaining weight if you are also 
      taking certain diabetes medicines. Do not drink alcohol while on LYRICA. 
      You may have a higher chance for dizziness and sleepiness if you take 
      LYRICA with alcohol, narcotic pain medicines, or medicines for anxiety.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Before you start LYRICA, tell your doctor if you are planning to father 
      a child, or if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are 
      breast-feeding. If you have had a drug or alcohol problem, you may be 
      more likely to misuse LYRICA.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In studies, a specific type of blood vessel tumor was seen in mice, but 
      not in rats. The meaning of these findings in humans is not known.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Do not stop taking LYRICA without talking to your doctor. If you stop 
      suddenly you may have headaches, nausea, diarrhea, trouble sleeping, 
      increased sweating, or you may feel anxious. If you have epilepsy, you 
      may have seizures more often.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aug 12 (Reuters) - Home genetics company 23andMe on Tuesday
said it hopes to uncover gene mutations linked to inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) by enrolling 10,000 people with the
hard-to-treat malady and examining DNA from their donated saliva
samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The privately held company, founded in 2006 by Anne Wojcicki
and backed by Google Inc, said U.S. drugmaker Pfizer
Inc will support its latest research effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're hoping within a year or two to have some meaningful
genetic data and that it might lead to either an improved
therapy or a new therapy for IBD," said Catherine Afarian, a
spokeswoman for 23andMe, which is based in Mountain View,
California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBD is the catch-all term for Crohn's disease and ulcerative
colitis, painful and debilitating inflammatory conditions in
which the immune system is believed to attack the bowel. They 
affect 1.4 million people in the United States, according to the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there are no cures for either Crohn's or ulcerative
colitis, Pfizer is testing its approved Xeljanz arthritis pill
as well as four experimental drugs against one or both
conditions. The largest U.S. drugmaker does not currently sell
any IBD treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and 23andMe declined to provide financial details
about their collaboration, including whether Pfizer would be
able to exclusively license rights to develop drugs that target
any gene mutations identified in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;23andMe sells a $99 DNA test, from which it provides its
customers ancestry-related genetic reports and uninterpreted raw
genetic data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But those enrolling in the IBD research project, who must
have been diagnosed with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis
by a qualified physician, will receive the company's test at no
cost. They must provide a saliva sample, answer online surveys
and agree to share their data with researchers. The study is
only open to U.S. residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on study: (www.23andme.com/ibd)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until last year, 23andMe also offered reports meant to
provide information about a person's health risks, including
risk assessments for certain cancers. But following objections
from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, it no longer offers
that service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a warning letter dated Nov. 22, the FDA said products
that are designed to diagnose, mitigate or prevent disease are
medical devices that require regulatory clearance or approval,
"as FDA has explained to you on numerous occasions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency, which had not cleared any genetic tests offered
directly to consumers, said false positive tests for certain
breast or ovarian cancers could lead a patient to undergo
preventative surgery including mastectomy, intensive screening
or other potentially risky procedures. A false negative could
result in a failure to recognize and act on an actual risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest prior research effort by 23andMe, announced in
2009, recruited more than 10,000 people to identify genetic
links to Parkinson's disease. Although two gene mutations were
linked to the progressive neurological disease, they were not
deemed treatable with drugs.

&lt;p&gt;By Huw Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON Aug 12 (Reuters) - Win Bischoff, chairman of
Britain's accounting watchdog the Financial Reporting Council,
will also become chairman of JPMorgan Chase's European
arm from January, the investment bank said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His appointment to JPMorgan comes at a time when British
lawmakers are keen for the FRC to scrutinise the accounts of
banks more closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers have questioned regulators over why accountants
gave banks a clean bill of health just months before they had to
be rescued by taxpayers in the 2007-09 financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FRC said that the UK government's business ministry,
which appointed Bischoff to head the accounting watchdog, was
aware at the time that he might take up a post at JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bischoff's appointment at the bank has been approved by the
banking sector's two main regulators, the Financial Conduct
Authority and the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation
Authority, the FRC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bischoff took up the reins at the FRC earlier this year
after stepping down as chairman of Lloyds bank. He will
work about two days a week at the bank and two and a half days
at the watchdog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An FRC spokeswoman said the regulator did not believe there

Pinto, head of JPMorgan in Europe and CEO of the global
corporate and investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will also serve on the Directors' Risk Policy Committees
for JPMS and JPMorgan Europe Limited, as well as the EMEA
Governance Review Committee and the EMEA Audit and Compliance
Committee, the memo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bischoff's role will involve monitoring the firm's strategy,
executive management, performance and standards of conduct and
is central to its international governance, Pinto said in the
note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FRC warned accountants in May that they must sharpen
their act when it comes to checking the books of banks or they
could be forced to take corrective action.

      Microsoft is the world's largest computer software company with revenues

      Looking ahead, however, Microsoft's future is less certain than at any 
      previous time in the company's history: in spite of trying the company's

&lt;p&gt;Aug 12 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co named Win
Bischoff, former chairman of Citigroup Inc and most
recently Lloyds Banking Group Plc, as chairman of
JPMorgan Securities Plc, the Financial Times reported. (on.ft.com/1r6VRKX)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bischoff oversaw the restructuring and return to
profitability of Lloyds, which was rescued by the government
through a 20 billion pound ($31 billion) bailout during the
financial crisis. He stepped down four months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He would replace Tom Hoppe at JPMorgan Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his career in the banking sector, spanning five
decades, Bischoff worked at Schroders Plc before its
investment banking arm was acquired by Citigroup in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was chairman of Citi until stepping down in 2009 and
joined Lloyds shortly afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bischoff was named chairman of Britain's Financial Reporting
Council in January.

		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;New Toronto Facility Part of IBM's $1.2 Billion Global Cloud Services Expansion&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;TORONTO, ON--(Marketwired - Aug 12, 2014) -  IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced the opening of a new SoftLayer data center in Toronto to meet the growing demand for hybrid cloud solutions that encompass open integration, data control and unique industry expertise. The data center follows recent launches in London and Hong Kong, and is part of IBM Cloud's broader  rel="nofollow" href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/42956.wss".2 billion investment aimed at extending its cloud services capabilities in Canada and throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The facility is the first SoftLayer data center in Canada, giving customers a cloud services provider with a local presence that can deliver bare metal and virtual servers, storage, and networking, all in one integrated platform. Basing these services in a local facility meets the needs of Canadian customers that require in-country data residency, such as financial institutions, public sector organizations, and many large enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Toronto data center offers the full portfolio of SoftLayer's cloud services. It has capacity for more than 15,000 physical servers and is built exactly like other SoftLayer facilities, which are based on a POD (Performance Optimized Data Center) concept. The facility connects directly into SoftLayer's global network via a network Point of Presence (PoP) located in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Toronto is the fourth largest city in North America, and a vital financial and technological hub -- not only for the province of Ontario but for all of Canada," said Lance Crosby, SoftLayer's CEO. "We have hundreds of existing Canadian customers that can now have SoftLayer services deployed closer to home, and thousands of customers that will take advantage of the facility to get closer to end users in this market."&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's large Canadian customer base includes financial services, insurance, retail and public sector organizations as well as numerous Canadian startup companies, members of the SoftLayer Catalyst startup program. Catalyst provides promising startups with credits for any SoftLayer cloud infrastructure (including servers, storage, and networking), executive mentoring, as well as engineering resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently enrolled Canadian startups include Mnubo, Epilogger, Brika, Greenoffon, Zilyo, TeachIt, maegan and kiwiwearables. Catalyst also has established relationships with leading Canadian accelerators and incubators including GrowLab, Communitech, Ryerson University Digital Media Zone (DMZ), JOLT, FounderFuel, Extreme Startups and TheNext36 as well as those affiliated with the Ontario Network of Excellence (ONE). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are very excited to see SoftLayer open a data center in Toronto, as we are now expanding our customer base in Canada," said Brenda Crainic, CTO and co-founder of maegan. "We're looking forward to host all our data in Canada, in addition to SoftLayer's easy-to-use services and great customer service."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SoftLayer begins taking orders and delivering services in the Toronto data center today. New orders for services in the facility are eligible for $500.00 USD off the first month, for a limited time only.

&lt;p&gt;(Adds details on acquisition and background on Travelex and
Shetty)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Stanley Carvalho&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DUBAI Aug 12 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs and Qatar
National Bank (QNB) are arranging a $800 million loan
to help Abu Dhabi-based entrepreneur B.R. Shetty acquire a
majority stake in foreign exchange operator Travelex, he said on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The jumbo transaction has been finalised, we are happy with
the terms," Bavaguthu Raghuram Shetty told Reuters, adding that
the financing was expected to be completed by September or
October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;QNB declined to comment, while Goldman Sachs did not
immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travelex, the world's largest foreign exchange specialist,
was set up as a bureau de change in the 1970s and now trades in
over 80 currencies and more than 50 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said in May that Shetty and Abu Dhabi private equity
house Centurion Investments would buy the firm from its
shareholders including Chairman Lloyd Dorfman and Apax Partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indian billionaire Shetty, who owns money-transfer service
UAE Exchange, said on Tuesday that the total value of the
acquisition deal was about 800 million pounds ($1.34 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he would take a 91 percent stake in Travelex, and
Centurion would own the remaining 9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travelex did not immediately respond to a request for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as UAE Exchange, which has over 6 million customers
in 30 countries, Shetty owns healthcare company NMC Health

&lt;p&gt;* CEO hopes to see positive results of Disney deal in 2015&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Pandora Q2 EBITDA rises 69 percent, exceeds expectations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Pandora keeps EBITDA margin, ups 2014 revenue forecasts

 (Adds CEO comments, analyst, updates share price, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Annabella Nielsen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COPENHAGEN, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Danish jewellery retailer
Pandora hopes a new alliance with Walt Disney
Company will boost sales as soon as next year, Pandora
CEO Allan Leighton said after unveiling a jump in profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pandora's shares rose more than nine percent after the
company reported a 69 percent increase in second-quarter core
profit and unveiled the Disney deal, part of its strategy to
expand further in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a 10-year alliance, and is a very important thing for
us. It reflects on how the brand is perceived. Disney does not
perform strategic alliances with just anyone, and we are very
proud to be associated with Disney," Leighton told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Disney agreement gives Pandora access to its popular
resorts and extends the company's footprint in the United States
- a core growth market for the company, according to analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pandora's second-quarter revenue was 2.5 billion Danish
Crowns ($447.8 million) and the Americas led the way with 1.097
billion out of the total, followed by Europe on 1.064 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While revenue in Europe jumped 65 percent from a year
earlier, it only increased five percent in the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Disney is definitely an opportunity to drive some more
revenue in the U.S., and we are doing it to increase our sales,"
Leighton said, adding he hoped to see the impact on next year's
revenue, without being able to elaborate on the range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Pandora's main sellers in the United States has been
its charms. The company will now work with Disney to produce a
new range of charms, including beloved Disney figures such as
Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, to go on sale in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The agreement with Disney is very interesting. It is a
platform from which the Pandora brand could be spread and has
the possibility of reaching a much younger client," said analyst
Soren Lontoft at Sydbank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The United States is the largest single market for Pandora,
and there are still a lot of opportunities to grow in this
market," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also announced it would buy 27 Pandora-branded
stores from U.S. jeweller Hannoush, adding to the 369 concept
stores it has in the Americas as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pandora raised its 2014 revenue outlook to more than 11
billion Danish crowns from 10.5 billion, although it kept its
EBITDA margin target unchanged at 35 percent. At 1318 GMT
Pandora shares were 7.5 percent higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core earnings (EBITDA) rose to 893 million Danish crowns in
the second quarter, higher than an average forecast of 786
million Danish crowns in a Reuters poll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leighton declined to comment on a lawsuit launched last
month by 36 shareholders. They are seeking compensation because,
they say, they lost money in 2011 because Pandora announced a
profit warning too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The warning sent Pandora's shares down 65 percent in August
2011. Leighton, who was chairman at the time, was also sued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pandora's shares slumped after news of the investor lawsuit
was made public at the end of July and Tuesday's jump returns
them to levels last seen on July 23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1 US dollar = 5.5828 Danish crown)

			&lt;p&gt;Enables Ubiquitous Access to Enterprise Data Stored in Cloud and On-Premise Content Repositories&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;PALO ALTO, CA--(Marketwired - Aug 12, 2014) - Accellion, Inc., the pioneer in providing mobile file sharing and collaboration solutions to enterprise organizations that enable increased business productivity while ensuring security and compliance, today announced the launch of kiteworks&#8482; content connectors for Google Drive&#8482; for Work and Microsoft&#174; OneDrive&#8482; for Business. The connectors enable universal, secure access to enterprise content, whether stored inside or outside the corporate firewall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For most organizations enterprise content isn't stored in one place, it's distributed across multiple content repositories. Yet today's mobile professionals need real-time access to content whether it's stored in the cloud, behind a firewall, or on their mobile device. Companies need to separate their thinking regarding content storage and content access, and view the two as separate entities," said Vidhya Ranganathan, SVP of Products, Accellion. "We're thrilled to add Google Drive for Work and Microsoft OneDrive for Business to the list of content stores that now connect to kiteworks by Accellion, an enterprise-grade mobile file sharing and collaboration solution. With kiteworks, users can view, edit, share and collaborate on content across content stores, with internal and external users, on mobile devices, laptops or desktops."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprises need a secure way for employees to access and collaborate on content whether it is stored in public cloud solutions or behind the corporate firewall in enterprise content management systems. The new kiteworks cloud connectors extend access to enterprise content stored in GoogleDrive and Microsoft OneDrive, all from within kiteworks' secure mobile container, while IT has full control and visibility into data activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complete list of kiteworks content connectors includes: SharePoint 2007, 2010, 2013, SharePoint Online, Windows File Shares and Distributed File Systems, Documentum, OpenText, Google Drive for Work and Microsoft OneDrive for Business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kiteworks cloud content connectors provide a number of benefits, including:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Ubiquitous access to content stored in enterprise content management systems and cloud storage
            
						Users can view all content through a single, easy to access interface, regardless of whether the content is stored in a cloud service such as Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive, or on-premise in an enterprise content management system such as Microsoft SharePoint 
						Users have secure mobile access to cloud content sources with fully-containerized, round trip editing of Microsoft Office and PDF files 
						Users have secure mobile sharing and collaboration of files stored in cloud and on-premise solutions, while maintaining 'document of record' in the source system without content duplication
					
				
				Full control and visibility of enterprise content sharing for compliance with government and industry regulations such as HIPAA
            
						IT has full audit and reporting capabilities for all content stored and shared via cloud content repositories, including granular logging of user login, sharing and file/folder activities 
						Seamless integration with Google Drive and OneDrive, while honoring existing security settings, user roles and access control list
					
				
				Easy sharing of files from multiple content sources
            
						Users can easily share files from different content sources, including cloud storage, the kiteworks container, local devices, and on-premise ECM systems, all from within the same solution

			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/cb5cb5/global_human) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Human Resource Outsourcing Market 2014-2018" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a result of its ability to provide instant feedback about businesses, 
      social media has become a major data source for many organizations. With 
      the rise of social media, there is also a need to track user 
      interactions on these sites such as Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. 
      Organizations have realized the need to augment their data warehouses 
      with external data sources. In the current competitive scenario, 
      employers recruit through social media to reach applicants instantly and 
      at a lower cost.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, the need to decrease operational expenditure is 
      one of the major drivers in the market. As a result of slower economic 
      growth, organizations need to ensure maximum productivity with minimum 
      expenditure. In addition, globalization has increased the customer base 
      of companies exponentially. However, given the highly competitive 
      business environment, companies are looking at methods to reduce hiring 
      and recruitment costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that the absence of direct access to an HR 
      department within an organization is one of the main challenges. HR 
      Outsourcing functions often create a chasm between employees and 
      companies. When HR services are not accessible, it causes delays in 
      addressing issues that reduce efficiency among employees and leads to 
      disillusionment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The report contains a comprehensive market and vendor landscape in 
      addition to a SWOT analysis of the key vendors.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - On a trip to Beijing a decade ago, Bill Gates was asked by a senior government official how much money Microsoft Corp made in China. The official asked the interpreter to double check Gates' reply as he couldn't believe the figure was so low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a problem that hasn't gone away. Indeed, Microsoft's current issues in China conceal a deeper problem for the U.S. software giant - despite the popularity of its Windows operating system and Office suite, few people in emerging markets are willing to pay for legitimate copies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This not only costs Microsoft in lost revenue, but is also holding back the spread of its newest Windows 8 version - analysts say even buyers of pirate software prefer older versions. According to StatCounter, a website that tracks what software is loaded on Internet-connected computers, more than 90 percent of PCs in China - now the world's biggest market - are running pre-8 versions of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is trying to tackle this. This year it's offering Windows 8 at a discount to PC manufacturers who install its Bing search engine as the default. And it's giving away versions of Windows 8 for phones and some tablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, as the industry shifts from desktop to mobile, the cloud and free or cheap software, China sums up both the old and new challenges Microsoft faces in making money in emerging markets - and, increasingly, in developed ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The great danger for the company is that what has happened to them in emerging markets - basically no revenue from new PCs because of piracy - is not far off what's happening everywhere," said Ben Thompson, the Taiwan-based author of stratechery.com, a popular technology blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CORE COST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For sure, China is a major, and unique, headache for Microsoft. Many of the problems are tied to a broader push by the Chinese government to limit foreign firms' dominance and encourage local technology firms to become viable competitors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of healthy relations with Beijing, Microsoft last month was suddenly targeted by anti-monopoly regulators who raided its China offices as part of a price-fixing investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the spats mask the fact that Microsoft has never really cracked how to get people in emerging markets to pay for its software. The company rarely breaks out revenues by geography, but it has provided clues about the size of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, then CEO Steve Ballmer reportedly told employees that, because of piracy, Microsoft earned less revenue in China than in the Netherlands - with 1 percent of its population - even though China bought as many computers as the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the BSA anti-piracy lobby group that Microsoft co-founded, emerging markets account for 56 percent of all PCs in use, and 73 percent of software piracy.&#160;Of the $77.8 billion revenue Microsoft generated in its 2013 financial year, China, Brazil and Russia each "exceeded" $1 billion, according to a Microsoft presentation. For comparison, Apple Inc generated $27 billion in Greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, in its 2013 financial year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Microsoft, that's a lot of lost revenue from the heart of its business. "Windows and Office are still very much the core of Microsoft," says Sameer Singh, an India-based analyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most recent breakdown by Microsoft of its results by product line - for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 - shows that 56 percent of its global revenue and 78 percent of operating profit came from Windows and Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft doesn't just lose the revenue from pirate copies, it also loses access to customers who might buy other Microsoft products that work with or on top of Windows and Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across most markets, Windows and Office account for more than half of revenues, says Andrew Pickup, Microsoft's Asia PR chief. This, analysts say, is because many of Microsoft's other products, such as Exchange and Windows servers, depend on customers already using Windows and Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Microsoft ecosystem is obviously pretty interconnected," says Jan Dawson of U.S.-based Jackdaw Research. "So it makes sense that the proportion of revenue would be similar in emerging markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAKED PCS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the intractability of piracy in emerging markets is that each part of the chain poses a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For PC makers working on wafer-thin margins the operating system is one of the costliest parts of the machine, while mom-and-pop shops which form the bulk of retailers in such markets can't afford to turn away price-sensitive customers who are comfortable buying pirate software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem, therefore, starts with computer makers, Singh says, since "convincing them to ship every PC with Windows pre-installed is difficult." Margins on PCs for a company like Lenovo Group Ltd are "near single digits," says Bryan Wang, an analyst at Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is that up to 60 percent of PCs shipped in the emerging markets of Asia, says IDC research manager Handoko Andi, have no Windows operating system pre-installed - so-called 'naked PCs', which usually instead carry some free, open source operating system like Linux. That compares with about 25 percent in the region's developed markets like Japan and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A quick scan of Taobao, the popular Chinese e-commerce site operated by Alibaba, shows a vast selection of PCs shipped with Linux rather than Windows. Once the machines hit the retailers, it's hard to tell where legitimate software stops and piracy begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a recent morning in Zhongguancun, a teeming electronics hub in north Beijing, shopkeepers offered to bundle what they said were legitimate versions of Windows with a new laptop, either for free or the equivalent of about $30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft began lobbying Lenovo in 2004 to stop shipping naked PCs, but the Chinese firm countered that its margins were too low, a person familiar with the negotiations said. Two years later - just days before then-President Hu Jintao visited Gates' U.S. home - China announced a new law requiring PCs to be shipped with operating systems. That merely dented piracy rates, which fell to 79 percent in 2009 from 92 percent in 2004, according to the BSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo said it reached an agreement with Microsoft in June of this year to ensure that Lenovo PCs sold in China would come pre-installed with a genuine Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"MOBILE ALSO-RAN"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's new approach is to push the price of Windows low enough to make it worth a PC maker's while. The cost of a Windows license has fallen to below $50 from as high as $150, said IDC's Andi, taking Microsoft down to "levels where they've never competed before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Pickup said it was too early to gauge take-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, making Windows cheaper for PCs is just part of a broader response to deeper shifts in the industry. The rise of mobile, tablets, cloud-based services and free operating systems has marginalized Microsoft and challenged its business model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Windows is on more than 90 percent of traditional computers - according to data compiled by analyst Ben Bajarin - that figure drops to below 14 percent once mobile devices such as phones and tablets are factored in, estimates Gartner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than half those devices run Google's Android mobile OS, which is effectively free to handset and tablet makers. Apple, a key player in all types of devices, gives away upgrades to its operating systems for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pickup says Microsoft has listened to phone makers' complaints and relaxed what hardware they need to install the mobile version of Windows. It has also made the operating system free on any mobile device of 9 inches or less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the moves are "about bringing down the cost as more and more of the populations in these emerging markets are having their first computing experience," Pickup said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are significant concessions, analysts say, but Microsoft will have to learn to be a bit player, where its software and services run on other people's operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest threat to Microsoft," Dawson said, "is the shift from a PC-based world where Microsoft dominated to a mobile world where Microsoft is an also-ran."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This story has been refiled to correct Wang affiliation in paragraph 19)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Noel Randewich in SAN FRANCISCO and Bill Rigby in SEATTLE; Editing by Ian Geoghegan)&lt;/p&gt;

			Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices Votes to Recommend 
      Pfizer&#8217;s Prevnar 13&#174; Vaccine in Adults Aged 65 Years and Older
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced that the Centers for Disease 
      Control and Prevention&#8217;s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization 
      Practices (ACIP) voted to recommend Prevnar 13&#174; (Pneumococcal 
      13-valent Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197 
      Protein])PCV13) for routine use to help protect adults aged 65 years and 
      older against pneumococcal disease, which includes pneumonia caused by 
      the 13 pneumococcal serotypes included in the vaccine. Specifically, the 
      ACIP voted to recommend the following:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Adults 65 years of age or older who have not previously received 
        pneumococcal vaccine or whose previous vaccination history is unknown 
        should receive a dose of PCV13&#160;first,&#160;followed by a dose of PPSV23
      
			
        Adults 65 years of age or older who have not previously received PCV13 
        and who have previously received one or more doses of PPSV23 should 
        receive a dose of PCV13
      
			
        The recommendations for routine PCV13 use among adults 65 years and 
        older* should be re-evaluated in 2018 and revised as needed (*if 
        approved by ACIP and CDC Director)
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      The recommendations, including the time intervals between vaccines, will 
      be forwarded to the director of the CDC and the U.S. Department of 
      Health and Human Services for review and approval; once approved, the 
      recommendations are published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly 
      Report.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Immunization with Prevnar 13 can play an important role in helping to 
      reduce the incidence and burden of vaccine-type pneumococcal 
      community-acquired pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease among 
      adults 65 years of age or older,&#8221; said Luis Jodar, Ph.D., vice 
      president, Vaccines, Global Medicines Development Group and Scientific 
      Affairs. &#8220;This additional ACIP meeting recognizes the importance of 
      implementing an adult recommendation for Prevnar 13 in advance of the 
      U.S. influenza season, the time of year when this population is most 
      likely to be considering vaccination.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pneumococcal pneumonia is the most common type of community-acquired 
      bacterial pneumonia in the United States. About&#160;900,000 Americans&#160;get 
      pneumococcal pneumonia each year, nearly half of whom end up in the 
      hospital.1 Among adults 50 years of age and older, there are 
      approximately 440,000 cases of pneumococcal pneumonia each year in the 
      United States,2 with approximately 25,000 pneumococcal 
      disease-related deaths annually.3
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Estimates have placed the yearly direct and indirect costs of adult 
      hospitalizations and outpatient cases due to pneumococcal pneumonia in 
      the United States at nearly $5 billion,&#8221;4 said Susan 
      Silbermann, President, Pfizer Vaccines.&#160;&#8220;As health care professionals in 
      the US begin to implement this new ACIP recommendation, we believe that 
      Prevnar 13 can now help prevent vaccine-type pneumococcal pneumonia in 
      older adults and has the potential to provide an important public health 
      benefit. Pfizer remains committed to working with the healthcare and 
      public health communities to raise awareness of the importance of adult 
      immunization among consumers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Pneumococcal Disease
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pneumococcal disease refers to a group of illnesses caused by Streptococcus 
      pneumoniae bacteria.5 Invasive pneumococcal disease 
      occurs when bacteria enter the bloodstream or another site that is 
      normally sterile.6 Non-invasive pneumococcal pneumonia occurs 
      when the bacteria cause infection in the lungs but are not detected in 
      the blood concurrently.5 In adults, pneumonia is the most 
      common presentation of pneumococcal disease.5 For every one 
      case of invasive pneumococcal pneumonia in adults, it is estimated that 
      at least three cases of non-invasive pneumococcal pneumonia occur.7 
      While non-invasive forms of pneumococcal disease are typically more 
      common, the invasive types of disease are generally more severe.8
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Prevenar 13
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prevenar 13 was first introduced for use in infants and young children 
      in December 2009 in Europe and is now approved for such use in more than 
      120 countries worldwide, including the United States and Japan. It is 
      the most widely used pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) in the world, 
      and more than 640 million doses of Prevenar 7-valent/Prevenar 13 have 
      been distributed worldwide. In addition, Prevenar 13 is approved for use 
      in adults 50 years of age and older in more than 90 countries, and it is 
      also approved in the United States and European Union (EU) for use in 
      older children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Prevenar 13 is also 
      approved in the EU for use in adults 18 to 49 years of age.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			INDICATIONS FOR PREVNAR 13&#174;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Prevnar 13&#174; is a vaccine approved for adults 50 years of age and older 
        for the prevention of pneumococcal pneumonia and invasive disease 
        caused by 13 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 
        9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F). This indication is based upon immune 
        responses to the vaccine
      
			
        For children 6 weeks through 17 years of age, Prevnar 13&#174; is approved 
        for the prevention of invasive disease caused by the 13 vaccine 
        strains, and for children 6 weeks through 5 years for the prevention 
        of otitis media caused by 7 of the 13 strains
      
			
        Prevnar 13&#174; is not 100% effective and will only help protect against 
        the 13 strains included in the vaccine
      
			
        Effectiveness when given less than 5 years after a pneumococcal 
        polysaccharide vaccine is not known
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Prevnar 13&#174; should not be given to anyone with a history of severe 
        allergic reaction to any component of Prevnar 13&#174; or any diphtheria 
        toxoid&#8211;containing vaccine
      
			
        Children and adults with weakened immune systems (eg, HIV infection, 
        leukemia) may have a reduced immune response
      
			
        In adults, immune responses to Prevnar 13&#174; were reduced when given 
        with injected seasonal flu vaccine
      
			
        In adults, the common side effects were pain, redness, or swelling at 
        the injection site, limitation of arm movement, fatigue, headache, 
        muscle pain, joint pain, decreased appetite, chills, or rash
      
			
        A temporary pause of breathing following vaccination has been observed 
        in some infants born prematurely
      
			
        The most commonly reported serious adverse events in infants and 
        toddlers were bronchiolitis (an infection of the lungs) (0.9%), 
        gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach and small intestine) 
        (0.9%), and pneumonia (0.9%)
      
			
        In children 6 weeks through 17 years, the most common side effects 
        were tenderness, redness, or swelling at the injection site, 
        irritability, decreased appetite, decreased or increased sleep, and 
        fever
      
			
        Ask your health care provider about the risks and benefits of Prevnar 
        13&#174;. Only a health care provider can decide if Prevnar 13&#174; is right 
        for you

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Aug. 13, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The National Academy of Television Arts  Sciences (NATAS) has announced that Nevion, a leader in transporting media from the camera to the home, is among ten companies that will receive a Technical and Engineering Emmy&#174; award for its efforts in the standardization and productization of JPEG 2000 (J2K) interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	JPEG 2000 is an image compression standard and coding system that is important to the broadcast industry for real-time video transport over IP networks, because it can provide a suitable compression ratio without image quality loss/degradation - no blocking or tiling and imperceptible artifacts at high bit rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"This award is a tremendous honor that not only recognizes Nevion as one of the original pioneers of JPEG 2000 compression technology but also reflects the collaborative efforts of industry leaders in the field," said Janne T. Morst&#248;l, chief product and development officer, Nevion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Earlier this year, Nevion, with its Ventura VS902 media edge adapter, participated alongside other technology suppliers with their respective equipment in a first-ever, live public "interop" demonstration of JPEG 2000 broadcast profile streams over IP. This successful demonstration and completion of the VSF Technical Recommendations TR-01 for JPEG 2000 over IP were significant contributors to the award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"A commitment to industry standards is a key part of Nevion's product strategy as we firmly believe it's in the interest of our customers," added Morst&#248;l. "We look forward to continuing our interoperability work and to developing solutions using JPEG 2000."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The 66th Annual Technology and Engineering Emmy&#174; Awards will be awarded on January 8, 2015 at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas during the Consumer Electronics Show (CES). The reception and presentation will take place in The Bellagio Ballroom starting at 6:30 p.m.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			About Nevion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Building on a heritage of innovation and pioneering firsts, Nevion is a leader in media transport - from the camera to the home. A result of two industry-leading companies - Nevion and T-VIPS - coming together in late 2012, Nevion fully manages all network types - with intelligence, automation and security built-in, helping customers monetise content, save resources, and open doors to new revenue streams.&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;h1&gt;The Federal Circuit Court Has Ruled Denying SmartMetric's Motions in Its Patent Infringement Case Against Visa Inc. and MasterCard International -- SmartMetric Will Continue With Its Focus on Its Biometric Card Technology as It Moves Forward Into Production and Sales&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Aug 13, 2014) -  SmartMetric, Inc.

The company is now actively marketing its technology to card issuing financial institutions around the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About SmartMetric, Inc. 
				SmartMetric, Inc. is a technology company that designs and engineers its own advanced products utilizing the company's expertise in miniaturizing electronics.

			Chevron Phillips Chemical Adds New Ryton&#174; 
      PPS Grades for Food Contact Applications
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP (Chevron Phillips Chemical) is 
      introducing two new grades to its Ryton&#174; polyphenylene 
      sulfide (PPS) product line for use in food contact applications. These 
      high performance compounds - R-4-232NA and R-4-222NA - meet U.S. Food  
      Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and EU Commission Regulation 
      10/2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;At Chevron Phillips Chemical, we are continuously innovating our line 
      of Ryton&#174; PPS products to meet the evolving needs of the 
      dynamic markets we serve,&#8221; said Greg Harkness, Business Development 
      Manager, Specialties, Aromatics  Styrenics at Chevron Phillips 
      Chemical. &#8220;We recognized the need for a durable, food-contact grade 
      thermoplastic material and are confident these new compounds will 
      deliver an excellent alternative to metals.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Like all products in the Ryton&#174; PPS portfolio, the new grades 
      deliver superior chemical resistance and dimensional stability in 
      extreme temperatures. With this combination of properties, the compounds 
      are well-suited for applications that require intricate parts and need 
      to withstand hot water, sterilization and chemical disinfectants, such 
      as coffee maker brewing chambers and food processing components.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Engineers and product designers have come to rely on Ryton&#174; PPS 
      as a superior material for applications that require long-term 
      dimensional stability and resistance to harsh environments,&#8221; said Kyle 
      Mathis, Engineering Polymers General Manager at Chevron Phillips 
      Chemical. &#8220;When compared to metals, the new grades provide them with a 
      greater level of design freedom for new innovations and productivity 
      while meeting today&#8217;s industry and regulatory standards.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ryton&#174; R-4-232NA PPS resin is a 40 percent glass filled, high 
      flow grade providing excellent chemical resistance to hot water, 
      sterilization and chemical disinfectants. Ryton&#174; R-4-222NA 
      PPS resin is a 40 percent glass filled grade specially formulated for 
      enhanced mechanical strength for applications with constant or repeated 
      exposure to hot water.

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects story from Aug 12 to show the 27 concept stores
purchased by Pandora were already included in the Americas
count, paragraph 11)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* CEO hopes to see positive results of Disney deal in 2015&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Pandora Q2 EBITDA rises 69 percent, exceeds expectations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Pandora keeps EBITDA margin, ups 2014 revenue forecasts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Annabella Nielsen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COPENHAGEN, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Danish jewellery retailer
Pandora hopes a new alliance with Walt Disney
Company will boost sales as soon as next year, Pandora
CEO Allan Leighton said after unveiling a jump in profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pandora's shares rose more than nine percent after the
company reported a 69 percent increase in second-quarter core
profit and unveiled the Disney deal, part of its strategy to
expand further in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a 10-year alliance, and is a very important thing for
us. It reflects on how the brand is perceived. Disney does not
perform strategic alliances with just anyone, and we are very
proud to be associated with Disney," Leighton told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Disney agreement gives Pandora access to its popular
resorts and extends the company's footprint in the United States
- a core growth market for the company, according to analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pandora's second-quarter revenue was 2.5 billion Danish
Crowns ($447.8 million) and the Americas led the way with 1.097
billion out of the total, followed by Europe on 1.064 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While revenue in Europe jumped 65 percent from a year
earlier, it only increased five percent in the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Disney is definitely an opportunity to drive some more
revenue in the U.S., and we are doing it to increase our sales,"
Leighton said, adding he hoped to see the impact on next year's
revenue, without being able to elaborate on the range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Pandora's main sellers in the United States has been
its charms. The company will now work with Disney to produce a
new range of charms, including beloved Disney figures such as
Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, to go on sale in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The agreement with Disney is very interesting. It is a
platform from which the Pandora brand could be spread and has
the possibility of reaching a much younger client," said analyst
Soren Lontoft at Sydbank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The United States is the largest single market for Pandora,
and there are still a lot of opportunities to grow in this
market," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also announced it would buy 27 Pandora-branded
stores, known as "concept stores", from U.S. jeweller Hannoush.
They are already included in Pandora's 369 concept stores in the
Americas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pandora raised its 2014 revenue outlook to more than 11
billion Danish crowns from 10.5 billion, although it kept its
EBITDA margin target unchanged at 35 percent. At 1318 GMT
Pandora shares were 7.5 percent higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core earnings (EBITDA) rose to 893 million Danish crowns in
the second quarter, higher than an average forecast of 786
million Danish crowns in a Reuters poll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leighton declined to comment on a lawsuit launched last
month by 36 shareholders. They are seeking compensation because,
they say, they lost money in 2011 because Pandora announced a
profit warning too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The warning sent Pandora's shares down 65 percent in August
2011. Leighton, who was chairman at the time, was also sued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pandora's shares slumped after news of the investor lawsuit
was made public at the end of July and Tuesday's jump returns
them to levels last seen on July 23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1 US dollar = 5.5828 Danish crown)

      J.P. Wiser&#8217;s brand.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Before committing to this sponsorship, we of course looked into the key 
      demographic of ESPN Fantasy Football fans and we found a lot of 
      similarities with our J.P. Wiser&#8217;s drinkers. They both appreciate 
      quality time with friends and family and share that desire for 
      competitive camaraderie, so this makes so much sense to us,&#8221; said 
      Richard McLeod, Brand Director for North American Whisky for Pernod 
      Ricard USA. &#8220;It makes sense for consumers, too. Together with ESPN, 
      we&#8217;re providing what players need for ultimate bro bonding.&#8221;

      ESPN Fantasy Football is the most popular fantasy football game, growing 
      more than 23 percent in 2013, as compared to the previous year. This new 
      alignment will help grow the number of J.P. Wiser&#8217;s advocates in the 
      United States by bringing new ads to the U.S. market. Beyond making fans 
      laugh with its clever and humorous content, the ads will aim to engage 
      with this large demographic to encourage players to give J.P. Wiser&#8217;s a 
      shot as an alternative to beer this football season.

		&lt;h1&gt;What Do You Consider When Selecting a Plastic Surgeon? Dr. Jon Paul Trevisani Explains&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Orlando Plastic Surgeon Jon Paul Trevisani, MD, Highlights Some Key Factors for Cosmetic Surgery Patients to Be Aware of Prior to Choosing Their Physician&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;ORLANDO, FL--(Marketwired - Aug 13, 2014) -  With so many surgeons offering cosmetic procedures, many patients can become confused and unsure of how to choose the right doctor, explains Orlando plastic surgeon Jon Paul Trevisani, MD. He says patients who are unaware of what to look for might unintentionally choose a physician who is not properly trained to perform cosmetic surgery. He notes this can lead to unsatisfactory results that potentially could require breast augmentation revision or other revisional procedures from a more qualified surgeon later on. Dr. Jon Paul Trevisani explains this can be particularly upsetting for patients who end up with undesirable results after complex procedures such as a mommy makeover, which typically consists of multiple different surgical procedures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an effort to assist individuals who are considering breast augmentation, tummy tuck, facelift surgery, or other cosmetic treatments, Dr. Jon Paul Trevisani recently authored a blog post titled, "How to Choose the Right Plastic Surgeon." In the post, he highlights information he says is crucial for potential patients to be aware of prior to any aesthetic plastic surgery procedure. He stresses the importance of thorough research, noting that referrals from friends and family often help direct patients to the right doctor. The Orlando plastic surgeon also states that one of the most essential things a patient should be looking for in a qualified physician is the proper certification, emphasizing that plastic surgeons should always be certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a follow-up blog post titled, "Why is Board Certification Important?," Dr. Jon Paul Trevisani further explains what board certification actually means and why patients should always be sure to check for it. "One of the most important reasons is for your own safety. Doctors who are board certified are held to certain standards that can help to keep you, the patient, safe," he says. He goes on to explain that in order to maintain each physician's skills, plastic surgeons who have been certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery must complete extensive training in their field, and should participate in regular re-certification and continuing education programs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Dr. Jon Paul Trevisani stresses the importance of patient education, noting that when patients are well-informed of the qualities to look for in a plastic surgeon, they are typically more likely to achieve the results they desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Jon Paul Trevisani, M.D., F.A.C.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jon Paul Trevisani has been named one of the top 25 breast augmentation surgeons in the United States, and is an appointed member of the LEAD (Leadership, Experience in Augmentation and Development) program as part of the physician advisory board. He is also an active member of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic surgery, an invitation-only membership offered only to board certified plastic surgeons who are highly experienced in their field.&#160;Dr. Jon Paul Trevisani is available for interview upon request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about Dr. Jon Paul Trevisani or his practice, please visit jptrev.com, usabreast.com, or facebook.com/DrJonTrevisani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To view the original source of this press release, click here: http://www.jptrev.com/news-room/what-do-you-consider-when-selecting-a-plastic-surgeon-dr-jon-paul-trevisani-explains/

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - A Goldman Sachs Group Inc unit is a final bidder for a Tokyo office tower in a deal that could fetch about 165 billion yen ($1.6 billion), said people familiar with the deal, which could be the biggest office property deal in six years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Updates with CEO quotes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Anjali Athavaley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 14 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co said
Thursday it is making a cash payment of $2.15 billion for a 16.7
percent stake in Monster Beverage Corp as the world's
largest soda maker seeks to expand into faster-growing
categories such as energy drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, Coke will have two directors on
Monster's board. Coke will transfer ownership of its worldwide
energy business including brands like Full Throttle and Burn, to
Monster. Monster will transfer its non-energy business, which
includes Hansen's Natural Sodas and Peace Tea, to Coke. Coke
will become Monster's preferred distribution partner globally,
while Monster brands will be the only energy drinks distributed
by Coke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Coke, the transaction represents an opportunity to
increase its footprint in energy drinks, a $27 billion market
globally, according to Euromonitor International. It comes at a
time when people are drinking less soda in developed markets.
Coke said last month that its quarterly revenue in North
America, its biggest market, was flat, partly driven by a
decline in diet Coke sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In turn, Monster will gain access to Coke's extensive global
distribution system. The companies have a distribution agreement
in the U.S. and Canada and will amend it to expand into
additional territories. On a conference call with media, Rodney
Sacks, chief executive officer of Monster, said that the company
would also convert distribution agreements it has with
Anheuser-Busch InBev in the U.S. to Coke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe it will be a win-win strategy" Sacks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person familiar with the transaction said that the deal
enables Monster to enter markets where it doesn't have a
presence, like China and Russia, and increase its footprint in
places where the company thinks it can gain share, like Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola shares rose 1.2 percent in after-hours trading,
while Monster surged 22 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke's Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent said the company
has the option to increase its stake to 25 percent and cannot
exceed that amount in the next four years. Coke is under no
obligation to make additional investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transaction is expected to close late in 2014 or early
in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal comes two years after Coke took the unusual step of
shooting down a report by the Wall Street Journal that said it
was in talks to buy Monster. Coke and Monster had discussed a
possible deal as recently as 2011, sources familiar with the
matter told Reuters at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the call, both companies downplayed the risk that energy
drinks will be more strictly regulated. Monster is facing
lawsuits over its advertising practices and injuries allegedly
caused by its flagship energy drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays served as financial adviser and Jones Day served as
legal adviser to Monster. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom

		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) and Monster Beverage Corporation 
      (NASDAQ: MNST) announced today that they have entered into definitive 
      agreements for a long-term strategic partnership that is expected to 
      accelerate growth for both companies in the fast-growing, global energy 
      drink category. The new, innovative partnership leverages the respective 
      strengths of The Coca-Cola Company and Monster to create compelling 
      value for both companies and their shareowners.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Importantly, the partnership strategically aligns both companies for the 
      long-term by combining the strength of The Coca-Cola Company&#8217;s worldwide 
      bottling system with Monster&#8217;s dedicated focus and expertise as a 
      leading energy player globally.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Details of the Transactions:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Equity Investment: In an effort to 
      align long-term interests, The Coca-Cola Company will acquire an 
      approximately 16.7% ownership interest in Monster (post issuance) and 
      will have two directors on Monster&#8217;s Board of Directors. The Coca-Cola 
      Company expects to account for its investment in Monster under the 
      equity accounting method.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Business Transfers: To optimally 
      align product portfolios and enable those portfolios to benefit from 
      each company&#8217;s respective brand marketing, production and distribution 
      strengths and optimize the parties&#8217; capital and resource allocation, The 
      Coca-Cola Company will transfer ownership of its worldwide energy 
      business, including NOS, Full Throttle, Burn, Mother, Play and Power 
      Play, and Relentless, to Monster; and Monster will transfer its 
      non-energy business, including Hansen&#8217;s Natural Sodas, Peace Tea, 
      Hubert&#8217;s Lemonade and Hansen&#8217;s Juice Products, to The Coca-Cola Company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Distribution: The Coca-Cola Company 
      and Monster will amend their current distribution agreement in the U.S. 
      and Canada by expanding into additional territories and entering into 
      long-term agreements. The Coca-Cola Company will become Monster&#8217;s 
      preferred distribution partner globally and Monster will become The 
      Coca-Cola Company&#8217;s exclusive energy play. These agreements will deliver 
      sustainable value to The Coca-Cola Company&#8217;s global system and 
      accelerate Monster&#8217;s opportunity to grow internationally.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pursuant to the terms of the transaction agreements, at the closing, The 
      Coca-Cola Company will make a net cash payment of $2.15 billion and 
      transfer its worldwide energy business to Monster. In exchange, Monster 
      will issue to The Coca-Cola Company the shares of Monster common stock, 
      transfer its non-energy business to The Coca-Cola Company, and enter 
      into expanded distribution arrangements. The transaction, which is 
      expected to close late in 2014 or early in 2015, is subject to customary 
      closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Coca-Cola Company continues to identify innovative approaches to 
      partnerships that enable us to stay at the forefront of consumer trends 
      in the beverage industry,&#8221; said Muhtar Kent, Chairman and Chief 
      Executive Officer of The Coca-Cola Company. &#8220;Our equity investment in 
      Monster is a capital efficient way to bolster our participation in the 
      fast-growing and attractive global energy drinks category. This 
      long-term partnership aligns us with a leading energy player globally, 
      brings financial benefit to our Company and our bottling partners, and 
      supports broader commercial strategies with our customers to bring total 
      beverage growth opportunities that will also benefit our core business.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kent added, &#8220;We are excited to evolve our long-time partnership. Monster 
      has been an important part of our global system since 2008, so we have 
      experienced first-hand Monster&#8217;s performance-driven and entrepreneurial 
      culture, proven success in building and extending the Monster brand and 
      their strong product innovation pipeline. We believe this partnership 
      will create compelling and sustainable value for our system and our 
      shareowners.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The transaction announced today represents a unique opportunity for 
      Monster and its shareholders,&#8221; said Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman and Chief 
      Executive Officer of Monster. &#8220;We gain enhanced access to The Coca-Cola 
      Company&#8217;s distribution system, the most powerful and extensive system in 
      the world. At the same time, we become The Coca-Cola Company&#8217;s exclusive 
      energy play, with a robust portfolio led by our Monster Energy line and 
      The Coca-Cola Company&#8217;s energy brands. Our business will be bolstered by 
      The Coca-Cola Company energy brands we will acquire, providing us with 
      complementary energy product offerings in many geographies, as well as 
      access to new channels, including vending and specialty accounts,&#8221; Sacks 
      said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our agreement enables us to focus on our core energy business, while 
      leveraging the strength of The Coca-Cola Company&#8217;s powerful distribution 
      and bottling system on a worldwide scale,&#8221; said Hilton H. Schlosberg, 
      Monster&#8217;s Vice Chairman and President. &#8220;The goals of both companies&#8217; 
      management teams are further aligned, with a great enhancement to 
      Monster&#8217;s position as one of the world&#8217;s leading energy beverage 
      companies. We expect the transaction to significantly accelerate our 
      growth and results of operations internationally, and we plan to review 
      all options available to return a substantial amount of cash to our 
      shareholders,&#8221; Schlosberg added.

		&lt;h1&gt;Oswalt Law Group Reminds Phoenix Drivers of Summer DUI Potential&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Oswalt Law Group in Phoenix, Arizona, Represents Drivers Who Have Been Charged With DUI; This Summer, Oswalt Law Group Is Conducting an Awareness Campaign to Help Drivers Understand the Potential Dangers of Drinking Before Getting Behind the Wheel&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;PHOENIX, AZ--(Marketwired - Aug 14, 2014) -  Arizona law provides stiff penalties for those who engage in drinking and driving.&#160;Even first-time offenders may find themselves paying thousands of dollars in fines and fees and losing their driving privileges for a significant amount of time.&#160;However, with summer parties and events, statistics predict that many people will be arrested for DUI before Labor Day.&#160;Oswalt Law Group in Phoenix, a criminal defense firm, is taking the opportunity to remind Arizona residents that drinking and driving can be a costly and dangerous mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oswalt Law Group, located on the web at http://www.oswaltlawyers.com/, has been providing Phoenix and Arizona residents with professional legal representation for all types of criminal charges for some time now.&#160;During this time, the attorneys at Oswalt Law Group have discovered that one of the most common reasons for people to seek criminal defense representation is due to charges related to driving under the influence.&#160;In fact, according to the Arizona Department of Public Safety, located on the web at http://www.azdps.gov/information/Impaired_Driving/Statistics/, nearly 21 percent of all people killed on Arizona highways in a given year are involved in a drunk driving crash.&#160;The fact that these figures exist in spite of Arizona's strict DUI laws is an indication of how big the drunk driving problem really is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of its summer awareness campaign to bring attention to the problem of drunk driving, Oswalt Law Group points out that in Arizona, a first-time conviction for DUI with a blood alcohol content of .08 percent to .15 percent will still cost the driver thousands of dollars and can result in 10 days in jail.&#160;Drivers are required to spend at least 24 hours in jail and may be required to install an ignition interlock device as a condition of being allowed to drive in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, summer is also a time when many people are out at parties or other events and may enjoy a drink or two.&#160;It is important to remember that alcohol does not metabolize at the same rate for everyone, so it is almost impossible to predict exactly how much alcohol will result in a DUI charge if the driver is stopped.&#160;The safest and simplest way to avoid a DUI is to use a designated driver who consumes no alcohol at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attorneys at Oswalt Law Group are taking time to get the word out to the public: drinking and driving is not only dangerous but costly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Oswalt Law Group: For those who have been charged with DUI, Oswalt Law Group offers professional legal representation.&#160;The attorneys at Oswalt Law Group represent those who have been charged with all types of DUIs including extreme and super extreme DUI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - An Indianapolis church has alleged that JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co mismanaged trust accounts held for its benefit by investing in high cost, risky investments that advanced the firms' interests over its own, according to a lawsuit filed in Indianapolis federal court late on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Christ Church Cathedral of Indianapolis, which is endowed by heirs to the estate of drug company founder Eli Lilly, alleged that the trust accounts lost about $13 million in value between 2004 and 2013 after JPMorgan used church funds to buy 177 different investment products that generated the highest revenues to the firm, according to the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm, as the sole trustee for the trust accounts, breached its responsibility to act in the church's best interests, the church alleged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan invested between 68 percent and 85 percent of the church trusts' portfolio in proprietary products, or those branded with the firm's name, according to a complaint. The investments, which included private equity and hedge funds, were also "clearly unsuitable" and performed poorly, the church said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other types of investments included structured notes, a risky complex security whose performance is linked to the performance of another underlying investment, such as a foreign currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the investments were sold at substantial losses, the church said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan used a "guided architecture" platform to help it select investments for the trusts that would be more profitable to the bank than other choices, the church alleged. Proprietary products are typically more expensive for investors and generate more fees for the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the products in the church's portfolio earned "substantial revenues" for JPMorgan in disclosed and undisclosed fees, expenses, and payments from third parties who wanted JPMorgan to underwrite and include their investments on its platform of approved products for clients, the church alleged.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value of the trusts was as high as $35.4 million between 2004 and 2007, but decreased to $31.6 million by the end of 2013, the church alleged. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annual average disclosed fees from that period increased 475 percent between 2004 and 2013, from $35,000 to $177,800, for a total of nearly $1 million, the church said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's assets, during the same period, ballooned from $1 trillion to $2.4 trillion, while its net revenues increased from $43 billion to $96.6 billion, according to the church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Suzanne Barlyn; Editing by Andrea Ricci)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Bahrain-based Arcapita Bank has hired JP Morgan to lead a share listing for Irish energy firm Viridian Group, two sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday, in a deal that one said could give the firm a value, including debt, of nearly 1 billion pounds ($1.7 billion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belfast-based Viridian emerged as a holding company in 1998, after the 1993 privatization of Northern Ireland Electricity. It now operates through its Energia and Power NI businesses and owns two gas-fired generation plants at Huntstown, north of Dublin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viridian, which has been owned by Arcapita Bank since 2006, reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of 99 million pounds in the year to the end of March on 1.6 billion pounds of revenue. Net debt stood at 582.7 million pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Thomson Reuters data shares in UK industry peers SS, Centrica, Drax, United Utilities, Severn Trent and National Grid on average are currently trading on an enterprise value (EV) to prospective EBITDA multiple of 10.3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one at Arcapita Bank was immediately available to comment. Officials at Viridian and JP Morgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial public offering (IPO) is expected to be launched before the end of the year with the listing likely to be in London, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan has been hired as global co-ordinator and will be looking to add further banks to the deal, they said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=0.5995 British pounds)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Greg Mahlich)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aug 14 (Reuters) - An Indianapolis church has alleged that
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co mismanaged trust accounts held for
its benefit by investing in high cost, risky investments that
advanced the firms' interests over its own, according to a
lawsuit filed in Indianapolis federal court late on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Christ Church Cathedral of Indianapolis, which is
endowed by heirs to the estate of drug company founder Eli
Lilly, alleged that the trust accounts lost about $13 million in
value between 2004 and 2013 after JPMorgan used church funds to
buy 177 different investment products that generated the highest
revenues to the firm, according to the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm, as the sole trustee for the trust accounts,
breached its responsibility to act in the church's best
interests, the church alleged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan invested between 68 percent and 85 percent of the
church trusts' portfolio in proprietary products, or those
branded with the firm's name, according to a complaint. The
investments, which included private equity and hedge funds, were
also "clearly unsuitable" and performed poorly, the church said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other types of investments included structured notes, a
risky complex security whose performance is linked to the
performance of another underlying investment, such as a foreign
currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the investments were sold at substantial losses, the
church said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan used a "guided architecture" platform to help it
select investments for the trusts that would be more profitable

products are typically more expensive for investors and generate
more fees for the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the products in the church's portfolio earned
"substantial revenues" for JPMorgan in disclosed and undisclosed
fees, expenses, and payments from third parties who wanted
JPMorgan to underwrite and include their investments on its
platform of approved products for clients, the church alleged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value of the trusts was as high as $35.4 million between
2004 and 2007, but decreased to $31.6 million by the end of
2013, the church alleged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annual average disclosed fees from that period increased 475
percent between 2004 and 2013, from $35,000 to $177,800, for a
total of nearly $1 million, the church said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's assets, during the same period, ballooned from $1
trillion to $2.4 trillion, while its net revenues increased from
$43 billion to $96.6 billion, according to the church.

		&lt;h1&gt;Washington, DC Orthodontist Explains the Cost of Invisalign&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wayne Hickory Discusses the Cost of Invisalign Teeth Aligners, a Discreet and Removable Alternative to Traditional Metal Braces&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, DC--(Marketwired - Aug 14, 2014) - &#160;Orthodontist Wayne Hickory, DMD, says Invisalign&#174; orthodontic treatments are some of the most highly requested procedures at his practices, Embassy Row Orthodontics and Bethesda Dental Specialties. Invisalign&#174; is a system of removable, clear teeth aligners designed to straighten the teeth in a more discreet way. In a recent blog post on Embassy Row's website titled "How Much Does Invisalign&#174; Cost?", the Washington, DC orthodontist explains some of the factors that go into the cost of this popular treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional metal braces, Invisalign&#174; uses a series of clear plastic aligners that are slightly modified from the set that comes before it. This allows for gradual movement of the teeth into a more desirable position. The whole process usually takes less than a year for optimal results; however, with some patients, a longer treatment time may be required. Dr. Hickory says, since each patient's orthodontic needs are unique, the cost of Invisalign&#174; will vary depending on the total number of aligners used and the overall treatment length. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hickory says patients can often choose from a variety of options to help bring the cost of Invisalign&#174; into their budget. His practice accepts most Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) insurance plans and offers other financing options, including: &lt;/p&gt;
			
				Pre-Payment Discount - If the&#160;patients pay their full amount in one lump sum they can receive a&#160;discount.&#160;
            
				Third-Party Financing - CareCredit&#174;&#160;healthcare financing is available for qualified applicants.
            
				Multiple Treatment Discount - Patients can&#160;receive a discount if their immediate family members decide to receive&#160;Invisalign&#174; or Invisalign&#160;Teen&#174;&#160;treatment.
            
				Customized Payment Plan - The practice&#160;can develop a monthly payment plan according to the patient's financial&#160;needs and budget.
			&lt;p&gt;A patient coordinator is available to review a patient's payment options in more detail after a complimentary consultation and teeth evaluation, says Dr. Hickory. During the consultation, the orthodontist will perform a comprehensive examination and explain all aspects of the Invisalign&#174; procedure. The patient coordinator will then tally the patient's estimated fee amount based on Dr. Hickory's oral assessment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hickory believes the advantages from using Invisalign&#174; far outweigh the treatment's expense. He recommends patients visit a reputable orthodontist to evaluate their teeth and receive a professional opinion on whether Invisalign&#174; is an appropriate treatment option for their smile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Wayne Hickory, DMD, MDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hickory is a Super Elite Provider of Invisalign&#174; -- less than 1% of all Invisalign&#174; providers share this distinction. He earned his Doctorate of Dental Medicine from the University of Connecticut School of Dental Medicine. He also completed his postdoctoral program in orthodontics and Masters of Dental Science at the university. Dr. Hickory has been among the world's largest practitioners of Invisalign&#174; and gives national and international lectures on the orthodontic treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hickory is available for interview upon request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information about Dr. Hickory, visit embassyrowortho.com, invisalignbaltimorewashington.com, and bethesdadentalspecialties.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To view the original source of this press release, click here: www.embassyrowortho.com/latest-news/washington-dc-orthodontist-explains-the-cost-of-invisalign/. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Global STS Translation Market 2014-2018: Key 
      Vendors are ATT, IBM, SpeechTrans  Voxtec International
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/tdcgzx/global_sts) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      STS Translation Market 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Global STS Translation market will grow at a CAGR of 19.11% to 
      2018
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The demand for STS translation solutions is increasing because of the 
      popularity of mobile devices and consistent network connectivity. 
      Service providers offer applications that allow voice-based access to a 
      cell phone, enabling the use of speech to access mobile device-based or 
      network dependent features, applications, and services. This enhances 
      customer experience and can be implemented for any application.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers is the presence of a 
      diverse workforce within companies. Globalization has resulted in MNCs 
      operating from various countries to gain cost and competitive advantage. 
      As a result, there is a high demand for speech translation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that the inability to suppress variations in 
      the performance of the systems is a challenge for the vendors and the 
      market at large. Speech recognition is hindered because of 
      speaker-dependent variations such as dialects, accent, intonation, and 
      noise disturbance, and hence the output is distorted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fund manager David Winters has sold his shares in Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), citing Chairman Warren Buffett's inaction on Coca-Cola Co's (KO.N) equity plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM has already divested $16 billion in annual revenue over the past decade from low-margin businesses like personal computers and printers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States came despite CIFUS members' concern, first reported by the Wall Street Journal earlier this year, that IBM servers used in the Pentagon's networks could be accessed remotely by Chinese spies and compromised. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo has been through the secretive CFIUS process three times before and has won approval each time, according to a source familiar with the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CFIUS, an interagency group chaired by the Treasury Secretary, reviews deals that could bring U.S. businesses under foreign ownership and is required by law to assess any transaction involving a state-owned firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo said in a statement that it remains on track to close the IBM server deal by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say Lenovo will likely find it easier than IBM to sell the x86 servers to Chinese companies as Beijing tries to localize its IT purchases in the wake of revelations about U.S. surveillance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting By Lehar Maan in Bangalore; Editing by Maju Samuel)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Adds background on IBM and server business sale)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Marina Lopes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aug 15 (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp
 said on Friday that U.S. regulators had approved the
$2.3 billion sale of its low-end server business to Lenovo Group

reported by the Wall Street Journal earlier this year, that IBM

the IBM server deal by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say Lenovo will likely find it easier than IBM to
sell the x86 servers to Chinese companies as Beijing tries to
localize its IT purchases in the wake of revelations about U.S.
surveillance.

			&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jacquie Smiles, Invisalign's Top 1% Premier Elite Provider Offers Expert Invisalign Advice for Her Patients in New York City in Her Latest Infographic&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Aug 15, 2014) -  Jacqueline Fulop-Goodling, D.M.D., P.C. (aka Dr. Jacquie Smiles) recently released an infographic that discusses the facts, numbers, and figures of Invisalign. As a highly experienced Orthodontist in NYC, Dr. Jacquie Smiles can help determine if Invisalign is right for you. Dr. Jacquie Smiles' goal is to help patients feel better about themselves by improving their health, occlusion, and dental esthetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 20% of the population does not have an ideal bite. According to the infographic, Invisalign straightens teeth by correcting crowding, spacing, overbite, under bite, and a deep bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of those who seek orthodontic treatment, 1 in 5 patients is over the age of eighteen. This shows that orthodontics is no longer just for kids, but for adults. Invisalign is an excellent option for both kids and adults, as it is nearly invisible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally developed in 1997 by two Stanford University Graduates, Invisalign was later sold to U.S. orthodontists in 1999. It costs anywhere from $3,500 to $8,000, with an average cost of $5,500, and insurance covers an average of $500 to $1,500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invisalign is offered in more than 45 countries, and treats over 2.5 million patients. For those treated with Invisalign, there is a 96% patient satisfaction rate. "I would say more than 96% of my patients, who are treated with Invisalign, are more than satisfied with the end results." - Dr. Jacqueline Fulop-Goodling, D.M.D., P.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Invisalign, you may achieve: healthier gums, a decreased risk of abnormal wear, and less dental visits. Also, they are virtually invisible, removable, and make cleaning your teeth easier. "Many of my patients find comfort in the idea of straightening their teeth with a product that is virtually invisible." - Dr. Jacqueline Fulop-Goodling, D.M.D., PC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few celebrities who have straightened their smiles with Invisalign include: Oprah Winfrey, Tom Cruise, Katherine Heigl, Eva Longoria, Gisele Bundchen, Serena Williams, Justin Bieber, and Khloe Kardashian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To view the full infographic with statistics and other interesting facts about Invisalign, please go to http://drjacquiesmiles.com/invisalign-facts-numbers-figures-infographic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Dr. Jacqueline Fulop-Goodling, D.M.D. PC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jacquie completed her DMD degree and orthodontic residency at Boston University and after graduation became the first female and youngest Director of B.U.'s Predoctoral Orthodontic Department.

      Fitch: Coca-Cola's Ratings Unaffected by Agreement With Monster
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ratings for The Coca-Cola Company (Coca-Cola: IDRs 'A+/F1') are 
      unaffected by the firm's pending $2.15 billion net cash investment in 
      Monster Beverage Corporation (Monster: Not Rated), according to Fitch 
      Ratings. A full list of Coca-Cola's ratings is at the end of the press 
      release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Yesterday, Coca-Cola and Monster announced a long-term strategic 
      partnership intended to accelerate growth in the global energy drink 
      category for both companies. The agreement, which utilizes Coca-Cola's 
      global distribution capabilities and Monster's expertise in energy, 
      consists of four parts as discussed below. The transaction, which is 
      subject to regulatory approvals, is expected to close in late 2014 or 
      early 2015.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The definitive agreements entail Coca-Cola purchasing a 16.7% equity 
      stake in Monster and becoming Monster's preferred distribution partner 
      globally. Additionally, Coca-Cola will swap its global energy portfolio 
      for Monster's non-energy business. Coca-Cola's energy brands consist of 
      NOS, Full Throttle, Burn, Mother, Play and Power Play, and Relentless 
      while Monster's non-energy business includes Hansen's Natural Soda's and 
      Juice Products, Peace Tea, and Hubert's Lemonade. Coca-Cola's energy 
      sales were approximately $330 million in 2013 while sales for Monster's 
      non-core products totaled $115 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch views Coca-Cola's investment as relatively low risk, despite 
      health concerns surrounding energy drinks, and expects any impact on 
      leverage and liquidity to be minimal. Furthermore, Fitch believes the 
      transaction may be accretive to Coca-Cola's earnings beyond its pending 
      16.7% proportional share of Monster. Monster's net income totaled 
      approximately $339 million in 2013, up from $63 million in 2008.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola has an established relationship with Monster, as the parties' 
      have had a U.S. distribution agreement in place since 2008, and will be 
      entitled to two seats on Monster's Board of Directors. Moreover, the 
      firm's minority investment limits the impact of potential future 
      litigation or regulatory risk associated with its exposure to energy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Longer-term benefits should accrue to both firms given Coca-Cola's vast 
      global distribution capabilities and Monster's No. 2 market position in 
      U.S. energy drinks. Energy drink volumes increased 7.8% in the U.S. 
      during the first quarter of 2014, with Monster's name-sake brand's 
      dollar share rising 10.7% to 32.9%, while CSD category volumes have 
      experienced low single-digit declines annual in the U.S. since 2005, 
      according to Beverage Digest.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the latest 12 months (LTM) period ended June 27, 2014, total 
      debt-to-EBITDA was 3.0x and the liquidity consisted of $21.6 billion of 
      cash and short-term marketable securities. During the six-month period 
      ended June 27, 2014, consolidated net operating revenue excluding the 
      negative effects of currency and structural changes grew 3%. Concentrate 
      volumes rose 1% while price/mix contributed 2%. Operating income 
      increased 6% excluding the impacts of currency and structural changes. 
      Coca-Cola's first half 2014 performance was in line with Fitch's 
      expectations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch currently rates The Coca-Cola Company (Coca-Cola) and its 
      subsidiaries as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Bank credit facilities at 'A+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior unsecured debt at 'A+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Short-term IDR at 'F1';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Commercial paper (CP) at 'F1'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. and Coca-Cola Refreshments Canada, Ltd. 
      (CCR)
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Long-term IDR at 'A+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior unsecured debt at 'A+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior shelf at 'A+'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rating Outlook is Negative. Coca-Cola had approximately $40.2 
      billion of debt, inclusive of $17.3 billion of commercial paper, at June 
      27, 2014.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ELKRIDGE, Md., Aug. 15, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via PRWEB - The Correctional Education Association (CEA) today announced a partnership with JPay that will significantly increase educational opportunities for incarcerated adults and juveniles and reduce recidivism in America's prisons. The collaboration centers on developing and implementing an open, digital education platform for use by educators, inmates and correctional staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial program offerings include preparation for key high school equivalency, pre-GED reading, writing and numeracy, English as a second language, reentry and life skills, and computer literacy. CEA and JPay will also partner with colleges and other organizations for accredited degree-seeking opportunities, including college level courses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system is composed of a cloud-based learning management system (LMS) for use, at no cost, by any educator or administrator interested in offering digital education to their inmates. Educators will be able to load coursework online and distribute it to inmates, who will then load it onto their tablets from a kiosk or a secure wireless network in their facility. Inmate students can complete course material, assignments and tests from their tablets, as well as communicate with their teachers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The partnership exceeds our expectations for implementing an open, common framework for delivering educational opportunities to incarcerated individuals," said Steve Steurer, Executive Director of the Correctional Education Association. "The result, we believe, will be a giant step forward for updating and extending the reach of education in prisons, juvenile facilities and jails."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, 2014 the White House held a meeting on technology and correctional education.  One of the recommendations from that meeting included building an affordable and secure platform that would allow education providers and publishers an opportunity to connect to inmate tablets and other portable devices. JPay, in committing its development and infrastructure resources, and CEA, with its expertise and influence in inmate education, have teamed to make this vision a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're excited to be working with CEA to build this revolutionary platform for correctional education," said Ryan Shapiro, CEO of JPay, a leading provider of corrections services. "We're proud to provide opportunities for incarcerated individuals to change their lives.  We see this initiative transforming our industry, resulting in a significant decrease in recidivism." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The power of correctional education was highlighted in a 2014 RAND Corporation study. Findings include the determination that inmates who participate in correctional education programs are 43% less likely to return to prison than those not participating. They also have better chances of gaining employment after leaving prison. A key recommendation of the study was the need for the effective use of technology in correctional education by implementing a technology platform open to educators and education providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article was originally distributed on PRWeb.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) said Thursday it is making a cash payment of $2.15 billion for a 16.7 percent stake in Monster Beverage Corp (MNST.O) as the world's largest soda maker seeks to expand into faster-growing categories such as energy drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, Coke will have two directors on Monster's board. Coke will transfer ownership of its worldwide energy business including brands like Full Throttle and Burn, to Monster. Monster will transfer its non-energy business, which includes Hansen's Natural Sodas and Peace Tea, to Coke. Coke will become Monster's preferred distribution partner globally, while Monster brands will be the only energy drinks distributed by Coke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Coke, the transaction represents an opportunity to increase its footprint in energy drinks, a $27 billion market globally, according to Euromonitor International. It comes at a time when people are drinking less soda in developed markets. Coke said last month that its quarterly revenue in North America, its biggest market, was flat, partly driven by a decline in diet Coke sales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In turn, Monster will gain access to Coke's extensive global distribution system. The companies have a distribution agreement in the U.S. and Canada and will amend it to expand into additional territories. On a conference call with media, Rodney Sacks, chief executive officer of Monster, said that the company would also convert distribution agreements it has with Anheuser-Busch InBev in the U.S. to Coke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe it will be a win-win strategy" Sacks said.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person familiar with the transaction said that the deal enables Monster to enter markets where it doesn't have a presence, like China and Russia, and increase its footprint in places where the company thinks it can gain share, like Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola shares rose 1.2 percent in after-hours trading, while Monster surged 22 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke's Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent said the company has the option to increase its stake to 25 percent and cannot exceed that amount in the next four years. Coke is under no obligation to make additional investments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transaction is expected to close late in 2014 or early in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal comes two years after Coke took the unusual step of shooting down a report by the Wall Street Journal that said it was in talks to buy Monster. Coke and Monster had discussed a possible deal as recently as 2011, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the call, both companies downplayed the risk that energy drinks will be more strictly regulated. Monster is facing lawsuits over its advertising practices and injuries allegedly caused by its flagship energy drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays served as financial adviser and Jones Day served as legal adviser to Monster. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom LLP advised Coke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This corrected version of the story fixes stock symbol for Monster in first paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Jessica Dye; Editing by Jonathan Oatis, Andrew Hay and Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Bahrain-based Arcapita Bank has hired JPMorgan (JPM.N) to lead a share listing for Irish energy firm Viridian Group, two sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday, in a deal that one said could give the firm a value, including debt, of nearly 1 billion pounds ($1.7 billion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belfast-based Viridian emerged as a holding company in 1998, after the 1993 privatization of Northern Ireland Electricity. It now operates through its Energia and Power NI businesses and owns two gas-fired generation plants at Huntstown, north of Dublin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viridian, which has been owned by Arcapita Bank since 2006, reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of 99 million pounds in the year to the end of March on 1.6 billion pounds of revenue. Net debt stood at 582.7 million pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Thomson Reuters data shares in UK industry peers SS (SSE.L), Centrica (CNA.L), Drax (DRX.L), United Utilities (UU.L), Severn Trent (SVT.L) and National Grid (NG.L) on average are currently trading on an enterprise value (EV) to prospective EBITDA multiple of 10.3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one at Arcapita Bank was immediately available and officials at Viridian and JPMorgan declined to comment on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday an official at Viridian said: "We regularly work with a range of banks, including JPM, to assist with financing and strategic options."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have made no decision to proceed with an IPO and JPMorgan have not been appointed as a global co-ordinator."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial public offering (IPO) is expected to be launched before the end of the year with the listing likely to be in London, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has been hired as global co-ordinator and will be looking to add further banks to the deal, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Greg Mahlich and David Evans)&lt;/p&gt;

			JPR Reports AMD Jumps 11% in GPU Shipments in Q2, Intel up 4%, Nvidia 
      Slips
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Quarter-to-quarter total GPU shipments up 3.2%&#8212;Desktop graphics up 
      1%, notebooks up 5%
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jon Peddie Research (JPR), the industry's research and consulting firm 
      for graphics and multimedia, announced estimated graphics chip shipments 
      and suppliers&#8217; market share for 2014 2Q.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Graphics chips are without doubt one of the most powerful, exciting, and 
      essential components in tech today: not only does every computer require 
      one (or more), but the technology is entering into major new markets 
      like supercomputers, remote workstations, and simulators almost on a 
      daily basis. New technologies and compute programs are taking advantage 
      of the ability of GPU power to scale. On top of that, PC gaming momentum 
      continues to build. It would be no exaggeration to say that GPUs are 
      becoming the 800-pound gorilla in the room.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The big drop in graphics shipments in Q1 has been partially offset by a 
      small rise this quarter. Shipments were up 3.2% quarter-to-quarter, and 
      down 4.5% compared to the same quarter last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Quick highlights:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				AMD&#8217;s overall unit shipments increased 11% quarter-to-quarter, Intel&#8217;s 
        total shipments increased 4% from last quarter, and Nvidia&#8217;s 
        decreased 8.3%.
      
			
        The attach rate of GPUs (includes integrated and discrete GPUs) to 
        PCs, for the quarter was 139% (up 3.2%) and 32% of PCs had discrete 
        GPUs, (down 3.6%) which mean 68% of the PCs are using the embedded 
        graphics in the CPU.
      
			
        The overall PC market increased 1.3% quarter-to-quarter, and decreased 
        1.7% year-to-year.
      
			
        Desktop graphics add-in boards (AIBs) that use discrete GPUs declined 
        17.5%.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Q2 is, on average, usually mixed, up slightly some years, down others. 
      There was an abnormal spike in 2009 after the massive market decline 
      which warps the 10-year average to 7.1% and makes the 3.2% this year 
      appear to be below average. If the anomalous 2009 spike is ignored, the 
      9 year average is just 0.5%, which would make the 3.2% increase for Q2 
      2014 a significant increase.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      GPUs are traditionally a leading indicator of the market, since a GPU 
      goes into every system before it is shipped, and most of the PC vendors 
      are guiding cautiously up to flat for Q3&#8217;14.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Gaming PC segment, where higher-end GPUs are used, was a bright spot 
      in the market in Q1. Nvidia and AMD high-end GPUs sales 
      were strong, lifting the ASPs for the discrete GPU market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Q2 2014 saw the first decline in tablet sales, and one of the few 
      increases in PC sales. The CAGR for total PC graphics from 2014 to 2017 
      is basically flat. We expect the total shipments of graphics chips in 
      2017 to be 418 million units. In 2013, 438.3 million GPUs were shipped 
      and the forecast for 2014 is 414.2 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;

				AMD&#8217;s shipments of desktop heterogeneous GPU/CPUs, i.e., APUs 
        increased 16.7% from the previous quarter, and increased 10.3% in 
        notebooks. AMD&#8217;s discrete desktop shipments decreased 10.7% and 
        notebook discrete shipments increased 30.6%. The company&#8217;s overall PC 
        graphics shipments increased 11%.
      
			
				Intel&#8217;s desktop processor embedded graphics (EPGs) shipments 
        increased from last quarter by 7.2%, and notebooks increased by 1.9%. 
        The company&#8217;s overall PC graphics shipments increased 4.1%.
      
			
				Nvidia&#8217;s desktop discrete shipments decreased 21% from last 
        quarter; and the company&#8217;s notebook discrete shipments increased 6.9%. 
        The company&#8217;s overall PC graphics shipments decreased 8.3%.
      
			
        Year-to-year this quarter AMD&#8217;s overall PC shipments decreased 
        22%, Intel increased 4.2%, Nvidia decreased 12.7%, and 
        others essentially went away.
      
			
        Total discrete GPU (desktop and notebook) shipments from the last 
        quarter decreased 3.6%, and decreased 13.3% from last year. Sales of 
        discrete GPUs fluctuate due to a variety of factors (timing, memory 
        pricing, etc.) and the influence of integrated graphics. Overall, the 
        trend for discrete GPUs has increased with a CAGR from 2014 to 2017 
        now of -5.6% (from -10%).
      
			
        Ninety nine percent of Intel&#8217;s non-server processors have 
        graphics, and over 65% of AMD&#8217;s non-server processors contain 
        integrated graphics; AMD still ships integrated graphics 
        chipsets (IGPs).
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Year-to-year for the quarter, the graphics market decreased. Shipments 
      were down 3.2 million units from this quarter last year, which is a 
      smaller decline than last quarter and suggests the big declines may be 
      leveling off.

      Graphics chips (GPUs) and chips with graphics (IGPs, APUs, and EPGs) are 
      a leading indicator for the PC market. At least one and often two GPUs 
      are present in every PC shipped. It can take the form of a discrete 
      chip, a GPU integrated in the chipset or embedded in the CPU. The 
      average has grown from 1.2 GPUs per PC in 2001 to almost 1.35 GPUs per 
      PC.

		&lt;p&gt;
			- Sweepstakes aims to show kids how veggies can be fun and delicious -
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			- Currently, only 1 in 10 US children eat the recommended amount of 
      vegetables -
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Birds Eye&#174; frozen vegetables and the Walt Disney Company&#174; 
      are teaming up to increase vegetable consumption among children in the 
      United States. The launch of this joint initiative, The Veggin&#8217; In LA 
      With Laura Marano Sweepstakes presented by Birds Eye, will show kids 
      that veggies can be fun, cool, and delicious. The sweepstakes, running 
      through September 24, features a grand prize trip to Los Angeles to &#8220;veg 
      out&#8221; and enjoy a private dinner party with Laura Marano, one of the 
      stars of Disney Channel&#8217;s popular comedy series, "Austin  Ally,"
			and a Birds Eye chef.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Given that 9 out of 10 children don&#8217;t eat the recommended amount of 
      fruits and vegetables, it is increasingly important to show kids and 
      their parents that filling half of their plates with veggies is not just 
      possible, but tasty too.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We can&#8217;t wait to start the sweepstakes and get kids excited about 
      vegetables one bite at a time,&#8221; explained Mike Barkley, Senior 
      Vice President of Marketing for Birds Eye. &#8220;The collaboration between 
      Birds Eye and Disney is a perfect fit, as we&#8217;re both fully committed to 
      children&#8217;s wellness and improving the vegetable consumption in this 
      country.&#8221;

      The sweepstakes is part of Birds Eye&#8217;s &#8220;Step Up To The Plate&#8221; campaign, 
      dedicated to encouraging kids to try new veggies, while helping parents 
      explore different preparation methods and approaches to making veggies 
      fun. The sweepstakes also supports the Disney &#8220;Magic of Healthy Living&#8221; 
      initiative, which partners with parents and inspires kids to live a 
      healthier lifestyle.

      Intapp Extends Collaboration With Microsoft to Accelerate Law Firm 
      Success With Office 365
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Collaborative effort to jointly develop Intapp Integration Builder 
      content management and information governance templates for Microsoft 
      OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Intapp today announced a new initiative with Microsoft to help law firms 
      get more out of Office 365 using Intapp 
      Integration Builder, the industry&#8217;s most widely adopted application 
      integration platform. A global leader in legal software, Intapp is 
      expanding its decade-long collaboration with Microsoft as part of a 
      broader effort to support firms as they adopt cloud services. New 
      enhancements to Integration Builder &#8211; including integration templates 
      for Microsoft OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online &#8211; will provide 
      firms with centralized control over content, user and process management 
      across on-premises and cloud-based systems necessary for efficient 
      business operations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Expanding Intapp Integration Builder&#8217;s existing support for Microsoft 
      cloud services is a natural step in our ongoing collaboration,&#8221; said 
      Laura Marino, vice president of product management, Intapp. &#8220;Today, over 
      420 organizations are using Integration Builder to connect applications 
      and manage data across their environments. Our joint initiative with 
      Microsoft helps us deliver the ease of use, visibility and control that 
      these organizations have come to expect as they incorporate cloud 
      services like Microsoft Office 365 into their overall IT architecture.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The cloud offers lawyers and staff many benefits &#8211; including increased 
      productivity, flexibility and easier access to information &#8211; but it also 
      introduces new challenges for IT. Effective content management across 
      on-premises software and cloud services is critical to ensuring that 
      files are up to date, and that lawyers and staff always have access to 
      the information they need to be productive. And effective administrative 
      capabilities are vital for IT teams seeking to maintain the control they 
      require over their entire architecture.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new templates &#8211; which will become available as part of the 
      Integration Builder 5.0 release later this year &#8211; will make it 
      straightforward for firms to manage, track and automate synchronization 
      of files across on-premises and cloud-based systems. Integration Builder 
      templates will also enable automated user provisioning and workspace 
      provisioning on specific matters &#8211; improving efficiency, accuracy and 
      governance for IT.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Integration Builder has a long track record as the trusted application 
      integration and data management platform for the legal industry. We&#8217;re 
      pleased to work with Intapp to help law firms easily incorporate 
      Microsoft Office 365 into their environment and provide lawyers with the 
      significant benefits these cloud services provide,&#8221; said Nishan DeSilva, 
      senior director within Microsoft&#8217;s Legal and Corporate Affairs group.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Intapp and Microsoft have worked together previously on developing 
      extensions that allow firms to use Intapp Wall Builder to secure and 
      manage access to information stored in Microsoft SharePoint, both on 
      premises and in the cloud.

			Pfizer Announces Submission of Palbociclib New Drug Application to 
      the FDA
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. today announced it has completed the submission of a New 
      Drug Application (NDA) to the United States Food and Drug Administration 
      (FDA) for palbociclib. This NDA requests FDA approval of palbociclib, in 
      combination with letrozole, for the treatment of postmenopausal women 
      with estrogen receptor positive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor 
      receptor 2 negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer who have not received 
      previous systemic treatment for their advanced disease. The submission 
      is based on the final results of PALOMA-1, a randomized, Phase 2 trial 
      comparing palbociclib plus letrozole versus letrozole alone in this 
      population of patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Palbociclib received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA in 
      April 2013, for the first-line systemic treatment of women with advanced 
      or metastatic ER+, HER2- breast cancer. This designation was based on 
      interim data from the PALOMA-1 trial.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The FDA has a 60-day filing review period to determine whether the NDA 
      is complete and acceptable for filing. Pfizer will communicate the 
      Agency&#8217;s decision.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Today&#8217;s submission marks an important milestone for Pfizer and 
      palbociclib, and a potential advance for women with advanced breast 
      cancer,&#8221; said Garry Nicholson, President, Pfizer Oncology.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Palbociclib
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Palbociclib is an investigational oral targeted agent that selectively 
      inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4 and 6 to regain cell cycle 
      control and block tumor cell proliferation.1
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Loss of cell cycle control is a hallmark of cancer and CDK 4/6 are 
      overactivated in numerous cancers, leading to loss of proliferative 
      control.2,3 CDK 4/6 are key regulators of the cell cycle that 
      trigger cellular progression from growth phase (G1) into phases 
      associated with DNA replication (S).4,5 CDK 4/6, whose 
      increased activity is frequent in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) 
      breast cancer (BC), are key downstream targets of ER signaling in ER+ BC.6,7 
      Preclinical data suggest that dual inhibition of CDK 4/6 and ER 
      signaling is synergistic, and it has been shown to stop growth of ER+ BC 
      cell lines in the G1 phase.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Palbociclib is not approved for any indication in any market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About PALOMA-1
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PALOMA-1 (also known as Study 1003 and TRIO-18) is a Phase 2 trial 
      designed to assess progression-free survival in post-menopausal women 
      with ER+, HER2- advanced breast cancer receiving palbociclib (125 mg 
      once daily for three out of four weeks in repeated cycles) in 
      combination with letrozole versus letrozole alone (2.5 mg once daily on 
      a continuous regimen). Final results from PALOMA-1 were presented at the 
      American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2014. 
      PALOMA-1 was conducted in collaboration with the Jonsson Cancer Center&#8217;s 
      Revlon/UCLA Women&#8217;s Cancer Research Program, led by Dr. Dennis Slamon.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Palbociclib Development Program in ER+, HER2- Breast Cancer
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer has worked closely with investigators and international breast 
      cancer experts to establish a robust development program for palbociclib 
      in ER+, HER2- breast cancer across stages and treatment settings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer has initiated two Phase 3 studies of palbociclib in 
      advanced/metastatic breast cancer. PALOMA-2 (also known as Study 1008) 
      is a randomized (2:1), multi-center, double blind Phase 3 study that 
      evaluates palbociclib in combination with letrozole versus letrozole 
      plus placebo as a first-line treatment for post-menopausal patients with 
      ER+, HER2- advanced breast cancer. PALOMA-3 (also known as Study 1023) 
      is a randomized (2:1), multi-center, double blind Phase 3 study that 
      evaluates palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant versus fulvestrant 
      plus placebo in women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2- 
      metastatic breast cancer whose disease has progressed after prior 
      endocrine therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additional, investigator-led studies of palbociclib in 
      advanced/metastatic breast cancer and in early breast cancer are open 
      and enrolling patients, including the PEARL and PENELOPE-B 
      studies.&#160;PEARL, sponsored by Grupo Espa&#241;ol de Investigaci&#243;n en C&#225;ncer de 
      Mama (GEICAM, Spanish Breast Cancer Research Group), with participation 
      from the Central European Cooperative Oncology Group (CECOG), is a 
      randomized (1:1), multi-center, open-label Phase 3 study evaluating 
      palbociclib in combination with exemestane versus capecitabine in 
      post-menopausal women with ER+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer whose 
      disease was refractory to previous non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors 
      (letrozole or anastrozole). PENELOPE-B is a randomized (1:1), double 
      blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study comparing palbociclib plus 
      standard endocrine therapy to placebo plus standard endocrine therapy in 
      patients with HR+, HER2- early-stage breast cancer with certain features 
      that suggest an increased risk for recurrence after completing 
      pre-operative chemotherapy followed by surgery. This international study 
      is sponsored by the German Breast Group (GBG).

				&lt;p&gt;The National Academy of Television Arts  Sciences has awarded a 2014 Emmy&#174; Award in Technology  Engineering to Ericsson for Standardization and Productization of JPEG2000 Interoperability&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) today announced it will receive a Technology  Engineering Emmy&#174; Award from the National Academy of Television Arts  Sciences for its work in developing pioneering JPEG2000 interoperability technology. This is Ericsson's fifth Emmy&#174; Award recognition and it will be formally presented to the company at a ceremony on January 8th, 2015 at the Bellagio Hotel during the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, USA.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Ericsson has consistently championed the industry need to support open standards to foster better integration of different vendor technologies, and its groundbreaking work in pushing forward JPEG2000 interoperability is demonstrable evidence of this. Ericsson has worked closely with other vendors to define the parameters and necessary methodologies for JPEG2000 interoperability in order to overcome the issues of video ecosystems containing different proprietary solutions. Ericsson also participated in a number of testing events where its equipment demonstrated full interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Per Borgklint, Senior Vice President and Head of Business Unit Support Solutions, Ericsson said: "We are truly delighted to be awarded with a fifth Emmy&#174; Award. This award underlines how committed Ericsson is to developing industry-wide standardization and vendor interoperability. By enabling JPEG2000 interoperability, we are giving content owners, broadcasters and TV service providers the necessary technologies and infrastructures to evolve their IP video services for the delivery of richer and broader TV experiences for consumers."&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;JPEG2000 is a compression standard that is widely used in broadcast applications where high capacity networks are available. The technology enables the distribution of very high picture quality content for live events like sports, offering a cost-effective method of high bit-rate content delivery over IP. Although JPEG2000 compression has been used for almost 10 years, issues with interoperability hindered its solution effectiveness. Consequently, efforts to improve its interoperability were initiated with formal testing following the issuing of a Technical Recommendation by the Video Services Forum in April 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Former Microsoft Corp Chief Executive Steve Ballmer has left the software company's board in order to spend more time on his newly acquired Los Angeles Clippers basketball team, but said he plans to hang on to his 4 percent stake in Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I see a combination of the Clippers, civic contribution, teaching and study taking a lot of time," Ballmer said in a letter to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made public by Microsoft on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fall will be hectic between teaching a new class and the start of the NBA season so my departure from the board is effective immediately," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, 58, paid an NBA-record $2 billion for the Clippers. On Monday he greeted several thousand fans gathered at the team's Staples Center home with the trademark screams that punctuated employee meetings at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His exit marks the end of a 34-year association with the company that led the personal computer revolution. Ballmer joined Bill Gates' firm in 1980 when it was just a small startup in the Seattle suburbs, and succeeded him as CEO from 2000 until this February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His decision to step down from the board is not surprising after 12 months of change at the head of the 39-year old software giant. It avoids potential board tension between Microsoft's new leader and the old regime, as Nadella attempts to move the company away from its traditional PC-focused mindset toward mobile computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It removes the final 'Ballmer overhang' at Microsoft," said FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives of Ballmer's exit. "His resignation from the board represents a positive, as it leaves the company with a clean sheet of paper."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year ago this week Ballmer announced his plan to retire from Microsoft, amid discontent over his leadership fueled by activist shareholder ValueAct Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That caused five months of uncertainty at the top of Microsoft until Feb. 4, when veteran insider Nadella was appointed CEO and co-founder Gates stepped down as chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Gates sells shares to fund his philanthropy, Ballmer has become the biggest individual shareholder in Microsoft, owning a 4 percent stake worth about $15 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I hold more Microsoft shares than anyone other than index funds and love the mix of profits, investments and dividends returned in our stock," Ballmer said in his letter to Nadella. "I expect to continue holding that position for the foreseeable future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares closed up 50 cents at $45.33 on Nasdaq. They are up 40 percent since Ballmer said he planned to retire, and are trading at levels not seen since the tech stock boom of 2000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Diane Craft, Chizu Nomiyama and Dan Grebler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Patent buyer Intellectual Ventures announced its second round of staff cuts this year, saying it will reduce its global workforce by 19 percent as the firm increasingly turns to litigation to generate licensing revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intellectual Ventures has raised about $6 billion and acquired 70,000 patents and other intellectual property assets, which it licenses to companies in exchange for royalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are making operational changes that are consistent with this reduction and will enable us to maintain and expand our leadership in the market for invention," the company said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm currently lists more than 700 worldwide employees on its website, which means the latest round of cuts will impact over 130 positions. The bulk of the cuts will come among professionals who work to license patents outside the courtroom, as opposed to its legal department, said sources familiar with the decision who were not authorized to speak publicly this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, Intellectual Ventures announced a five percent staffing reduction. A multi-billion dollar fund Intellectual Ventures launched in 2008 generated returns of 2.5 percent for investors through the end of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years top executives at the firm, including co-founder Nathan Myhrvold, described litigation as an inefficient way to close patent deals.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's always been IV's philosophy that signing license agreements, rather than heading to the courtroom, is the best way to do business," Intellectual Ventures chief litigation counsel Melissa Finocchio said in a 2012 blog post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Created in 2000, Intellectual Ventures did not file any patent lawsuits until 2010. But since then it has filed 52, according to Westlaw data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has achieved settlements with some chipmakers including Hynix. It went to trial against Google's Motorola Mobility unit earlier this year which ended in a mistrial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Intellectual Ventures filed a barrage of lawsuits against several financial institutions last year, including Capital One, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and Bank of America Corp. A federal judge in Virginia dismissed an Intellectual Ventures lawsuit against Capital One earlier this year, a decision which IV is appealing. Intellectual Ventures' claims against JPMorgan and BofA are still pending.     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some tech companies like Microsoft are also investors in the company and receive a share of the royalties. Long-time investors Apple and Intel declined to participate in the firm's latest fundraising vehicle earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Intellectual Ventures has faced criticism from some in the technology industry who argue that the firm, which does not primarily make products, exploits the patent system by demanding royalties from those who do. The firm says it creates a mechanism for inventors to capitalize on their ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Dan Levine; Editing by Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

to his 4 percent stake in Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I see a combination of the Clippers, civic contribution,
teaching and study taking a lot of time," Ballmer said in a
letter to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made public by Microsoft
on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fall will be hectic between teaching a new class and
the start of the NBA season so my departure from the board is
effective immediately," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, 58, paid an NBA-record $2 billion for the Clippers.
On Monday he greeted several thousand fans gathered at the
team's Staples Center home with the trademark screams that
punctuated employee meetings at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His exit marks the end of a 34-year association with the
company that led the personal computer revolution. Ballmer
joined Bill Gates' firm in 1980 when it was just a small startup
in the Seattle suburbs, and succeeded him as CEO from 2000 until
this February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His decision to step down from the board is not surprising
after 12 months of change at the head of the 39-year old
software giant. It avoids potential board tension between
Microsoft's new leader and the old regime, as Nadella attempts
to move the company away from its traditional PC-focused mindset
toward mobile computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It removes the final 'Ballmer overhang' at Microsoft," said
FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives of Ballmer's exit. "His
resignation from the board represents a positive, as it leaves
the company with a clean sheet of paper."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year ago this week Ballmer announced his plan to retire
from Microsoft, amid discontent over his leadership fueled by
activist shareholder ValueAct Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That caused five months of uncertainty at the top of
Microsoft until Feb. 4, when veteran insider Nadella was
appointed CEO and co-founder Gates stepped down as chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Gates sells shares to fund his philanthropy, Ballmer has
become the biggest individual shareholder in Microsoft, owning a
4 percent stake worth about $15 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I hold more Microsoft shares than anyone other than index
funds and love the mix of profits, investments and dividends
returned in our stock," Ballmer said in his letter to Nadella.
"I expect to continue holding that position for the foreseeable
future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares closed up 50 cents at $45.33 on Nasdaq.
They are up 40 percent since Ballmer said he planned to retire,
and are trading at levels not seen since the tech stock boom of
2000.

&lt;p&gt;(Adds details on cuts, background)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Dan Levine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Aug 19 (Reuters) - Patent buyer Intellectual
Ventures announced its second round of staff cuts this year,
saying it will reduce its global workforce by 19 percent as the
firm increasingly turns to litigation to generate licensing
revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intellectual Ventures has raised about $6 billion and
acquired 70,000 patents and other intellectual property assets,
which it licenses to companies in exchange for royalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are making operational changes that are consistent with
this reduction and will enable us to maintain and expand our
leadership in the market for invention," the company said on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm currently lists more than 700 worldwide employees
on its website, which means the latest round of cuts will impact
over 130 positions. The bulk of the cuts will come among
professionals who work to license patents outside the courtroom,
as opposed to its legal department, said sources familiar with
the decision who were not authorized to speak publicly this
week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, Intellectual Ventures announced a five percent
staffing reduction. A multi-billion dollar fund
Intellectual Ventures launched in 2008 generated returns of 2.5
percent for investors through the end of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years top executives at the firm, including co-founder
Nathan Myhrvold, described litigation as an inefficient way to
close patent deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's always been IV's philosophy that signing license
agreements, rather than heading to the courtroom, is the best
way to do business," Intellectual Ventures chief litigation
counsel Melissa Finocchio said in a 2012 blog post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Created in 2000, Intellectual Ventures did not file any
patent lawsuits until 2010. But since then it has filed 52,
according to Westlaw data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has achieved settlements with some chipmakers
including Hynix. It went to trial against Google's Motorola
Mobility unit earlier this year which ended in a mistrial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Intellectual Ventures filed a barrage of
lawsuits against several financial institutions last year,
including Capital One, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and Bank of America
Corp. A federal judge in Virginia dismissed an Intellectual
Ventures lawsuit against Capital One earlier this year, a
decision which IV is appealing. Intellectual Ventures' claims
against JPMorgan and BofA are still pending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some tech companies like Microsoft are also investors in the
company and receive a share of the royalties. Long-time
investors Apple and Intel declined to
participate in the firm's latest fundraising vehicle earlier
this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Intellectual Ventures has faced criticism
from some in the technology industry who argue that the firm,
which does not primarily make products, exploits the patent
system by demanding royalties from those who do. The firm says
it creates a mechanism for inventors to capitalize on their
ideas.

			Goodwin Procter Names Michael Caplan as Chief Operating Officer
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goodwin Procter LLP, an AmLaw 50 firm, announced today that Michael R. 
      Caplan has been selected to succeed Arthur W. Greenberg as the firm&#8217;s 
      chief operating officer effective August 18. Greenberg will be retiring 
      from the firm on October 31.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As COO, Caplan will manage Goodwin Procter&#8217;s business, financial and 
      administrative operations, and focus on the firm&#8217;s growth strategy and 
      execution. He will report to the firm&#8217;s managing partner and serve as an 
      ex-officio member of its Management and Executive Committees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Mike&#8217;s background and experience are unique in the world of traditional 
      law firm chief operations officers,&#8221; said Goodwin Procter Chairman Regina 
      M. Pisa. &#8220;In a rapidly evolving industry, we believe that someone 
      with broad cross-industry perspective will be best positioned to 
      innovate and contribute new ideas. Mike brings this perspective along 
      with a solid understanding of law firm economics and operations.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Caplan has served as the Global Chief Operating Officer of Marsh  
      McLennan Companies&#8217; Corporate Legal, Risk and Compliance Department 
      since February 2011. There, he managed day-to-day operations for the 
      legal department, overseeing all Marsh  McLennan&#8217;s operating companies, 
      including 140 attorneys. The department was recognized in 2013 by the 
      Association for Corporate Counsel for its approach to creating value 
      through technology, convergence and value-based fee arrangements. The 
      Association in 2012 also named it &#8220;Litigation Department of the Year&#8221; 
      and &#8220;Best IP Department.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Mike is highly credentialed and an excellent manager of both operations 
      and people,&#8221; said Robert 
      S. Insolia, managing partner at Goodwin Procter. &#8220;He will join a 
      strong senior management group at Goodwin Procter and we are excited to 
      have him on our team.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Previously, Caplan held operations and technology management roles in 
      the financial services industry for over two decades, including 
      positions at Bank of America, The Goldman Sachs Group and JP Morgan  
      Co. He received his master&#8217;s degree in accounting from American 
      University in 1993.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Caplan will work closely with Greenberg over the next few months as he 
      transitions into his new role. Greenberg has served as the firm&#8217;s Chief 
      Operating Officer since 2004 after being initially hired as Executive 
      Director in 1996.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Greenberg retires from Goodwin Procter after over 18 years of overseeing 
      the firm&#8217;s business operations. During his tenure at the firm, annual 
      revenue grew from $106 million to more than $750 million while the 
      number of attorneys expanded from 290 to 850.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Arthur played a critical role in laying the foundation and building the 
      infrastructure as Goodwin Procter transitioned from a primarily local, 
      Boston-based organization into a national and then global law firm,&#8221; 
      Pisa said. &#8220;He helped instill fiscal discipline that has allowed us, 
      unlike many other law firms, to weather tough markets and seize 
      opportunities to realize our vision. Arthur&#8217;s ability to scale the 
      support for our growing operation has been a key component of our 
      success.&#8221;

		&lt;p&gt;
			Workshare Integrates with Microsoft Office 365 to Enable Secure 
      Collaboration
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Workshare 
      today announced its integration with Microsoft Office 365, providing 
      Microsoft users with a full set of collaboration 
      functionality to increase productivity. The integration of Workshare&#8217;s 
      desktop and cloud collaboration tool, Professional 
      9, will enable firms to meet the increasing demand for cloud-based 
      applications in the legal sector.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With 96% 
      of legal professionals requiring access to content on the move, 
      there is a growing need for legal firms and corporate counsels to 
      implement desktop as well as mobile and cloud-first tools.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      By providing Office 365 users with collaboration features, the 
      integration enables users to be more mobile and productive, while 
      allowing them to work with the way they are accustomed to. The 
      integration will enable faster turnaround on documents, enriching the 
      usability of Office 365 by allowing users to access, compare, and 
      collaborate securely from any device.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chris White, CIO at Clyde  Co, commented, &#8220;Workshare&#8217;s integration with 
      Office 365 is a major milestone for legal firms who need to consolidate 
      the applications and systems they use, while meeting the needs of legal 
      professionals who need to be more productive both in the office and 
      outside. As a global law firm, maintaining the productivity of our fee 
      earners while they&#8217;re mobile is a key challenge. It&#8217;s reassuring that 
      Workshare is supporting Microsoft&#8217;s new direction, as the integrated 
      solutions offer a clear path to maintaining productivity as users demand 
      more flexible ways of working.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Workshare has a long history of supporting Microsoft&#8217;s Office suite and 
      now our application is Office 365 ready,&#8221; commented Anthony Foy, CEO at 
      Workshare. &#8220;A high percentage of Microsoft&#8217;s enterprise customers are 
      already using Office 365 and require secure collaboration capabilities. 
      In providing secure comparison and metadata removal functionality, our 
      joint offering will be hugely beneficial in helping these companies 
      transition to the cloud as efficiently and effectively as possible.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nishan DeSilva, senior director within Microsoft&#8217;s legal and corporate 
      affairs department commented, "Workshare has been a long-time Microsoft 
      partner &#8211; building a range of applications that integrate with the 
      Office suite. We are excited about Workshare&#8217;s integration with Office 
      365, which addresses the rising demand for cloud-based applications in 
      the legal sector."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Workshare will be providing demos of the new integration at the ILTA 
      Conference in Nashville Tennessee, from August 17-21 on booth #406/408.

&lt;p&gt;(Adds Goldman comment)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LONDON Aug 19 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs and Libya's
sovereign wealth fund are set to meet in a London court over
claims the Wall Street bank exploited a position of trust by
encouraging the fund to invest more than $1 billion in trades
that ended up worthless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman had filed a summary judgment application - a request
to decide a claim without going to trial - in the case brought
by the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) in January, but had
recently withdrawn it, the LIA said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Following the serving of the LIA's reply evidence, Goldman
Sachs has withdrawn its summary judgment application," the LIA
said. A case management hearing has been scheduled for early
October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said in a statement on Tuesday: "We continue to
believe this case is entirely without merit and intend to
contest it vigorously as it moves through the legal process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LIA had filed its lawsuit at London's High Court over a
series of equity derivatives trades executed between January and
April 2008 that expired as worthless in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund, which became a Goldman client in 2007, alleges the
bank deliberately exploited the relationship of trust and
confidence it had established with LIA staff, causing the fund
to enter into the disputed trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LIA estimates Goldman made a profit of around $350
million on the trades, while it was left with "colossal" losses.

&lt;p&gt;BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's country risk rose slightly on Wednesday, the JP Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus showed, after the government said it planned to pay its foreign-currency bonds locally to skirt a U.S. court ruling that prevented the government from servicing its debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South American country's risk climbed 1.4 percent to 779 basis points over safe-haven U.S. Treasuries on JP Morgan's index 11EMJ.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Former Microsoft Corp Chief Executive Steve Ballmer has left the software company's board in order to spend more time on his newly acquired Los Angeles Clippers basketball team, but said he plans to hang on to his 4 percent stake in Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I see a combination of the Clippers, civic contribution, teaching and study taking a lot of time," Ballmer said in a letter to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made public by Microsoft on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fall will be hectic between teaching a new class and the start of the NBA season so my departure from the board is effective immediately," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, 58, paid an NBA-record $2 billion for the Clippers. On Monday he greeted several thousand fans gathered at the team's Staples Center home with the trademark screams that punctuated employee meetings at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His exit marks the end of a 34-year association with the company that led the personal computer revolution. Ballmer joined Bill Gates' firm in 1980 when it was just a small startup in the Seattle suburbs, and succeeded him as CEO from 2000 until this February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His decision to step down from the board is not surprising after 12 months of change at the head of the 39-year old software giant. It avoids potential board tension between Microsoft's new leader and the old regime, as Nadella attempts to move the company away from its traditional PC-focused mindset toward mobile computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It removes the final 'Ballmer overhang' at Microsoft," said FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives of Ballmer's exit. "His resignation from the board represents a positive, as it leaves the company with a clean sheet of paper."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year ago this week Ballmer announced his plan to retire from Microsoft, amid discontent over his leadership fueled by activist shareholder ValueAct Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That caused five months of uncertainty at the top of Microsoft until Feb. 4, when veteran insider Nadella was appointed CEO and co-founder Gates stepped down as chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Gates sells shares to fund his philanthropy, Ballmer has become the biggest individual shareholder in Microsoft, owning a 4 percent stake worth about $15 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I hold more Microsoft shares than anyone other than index funds and love the mix of profits, investments and dividends returned in our stock," Ballmer said in his letter to Nadella. "I expect to continue holding that position for the foreseeable future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares closed up 50 cents at $45.33 on Nasdaq. They are up 40 percent since Ballmer said he planned to retire, and are trading at levels not seen since the tech stock boom of 2000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Diane Craft, Chizu Nomiyama and Dan Grebler)&lt;/p&gt;

			Promisec, 
      a pioneer in endpoint Security, Compliance and System management, today 
      announced a new update to Promisec 
      Integrity, a suite of cloud-based offerings designed to provide 
      endpoint visibility and remediation to ensure compliance for 
      small-to-medium enterprise organizations. The new update will offer 
      customers easy identification for Microsoft Patch MS14-045.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new service is part of the Promisec's incident response service 
      package which will allow customers to quickly identify any system that 
      has the errant patch installed. Microsoft has indicated to its customers 
      to remove the patch manually but with the Promisec Integrity solution, 
      customers will not be required to manually remove the patch. This will 
      save companies countless hours reviewing install logs and manually 
      checking windows systems for the problem patch.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Promisec Integrity also includes the Microsoft Patch Validation service 
      that can quickly identify which systems are missing critical patches and 
      allow you to update these as part of their windows update service. 
      Promisec Integrity offers remediation of these systems where the 
      endpoint may have had the windows update service turned off.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With more and more cyber threats and IT operational challenges coming 
      to light, it is important that companies have a solution that is easy to 
      deploy and immediately helps to assure security and compliance 
      throughout the enterprise,&#8221; said Dan Ross, CEO, Promisec. &#8220;The newest 
      update to our Integrity Solution will save companies time and money by 
      allowing them to quickly see the problem and track the remediation 
      process in a timely and cost efficient matter.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Designed to meet the unique needs of small-to-medium enterprise 
      environments, Promisec Integrity leverages the flexibility and 
      scalability of the cloud to offer advanced cyber protection that is 
      affordable, customizable, and easy to deploy and use, while retaining 
      the same nimble agentless functionality as Promisec&#8217;s on-premise&#160;Endpoint 
      Manager&#160;offering. The cloud solution provides a set of modular 
      capabilities, including Endpoint Health Assessment, Incident response 
      related service, etc.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 20 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc 
plans to raise pay for junior bankers by 20 percent next year,
the New York Post reported on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pay raise means that first-year analysts will earn about
$85,000 before collecting bonuses in 2015, the newspaper said.
Analysts who have been at the Wall Street bank longer will earn
more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs spokesperson did not immediately respond to
a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's pay hike comes as Wall Street is making an effort
to ease strains on junior bankers by limiting hours they work
and compensating them better.

			About iKang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	iKang Healthcare Group, Inc. is the largest provider in China's fast growing private preventive healthcare services market, accounting for approximately 12.3% of market share in terms of revenue in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Through iKang's integrated service platform and established nationwide network of medical centers and third-party service provider facilities, the Company provides comprehensive and high quality preventive healthcare solutions including a wide range of medical examinations services and value-added services including disease screening and other services. iKang's customers are primarily corporate customers who contract the Company to provide medical examination services to their employees and clients and pay for these services at pre-negotiated prices. iKang also directly markets its services to individual customers. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, the Company delivered its services to approximately 2.7 million individuals in total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	As of June 30, 2014, iKang's nationwide network consisted of 48 self-owned medical centers covering 15 of the most affluent cities in China, namely Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chongqing, Tianjin, Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Chengdu, Fuzhou, Changchun, Jiangyin, Changzhou and Hong Kong. The Company has also supplemented its self-owned medical center network by contracting with approximately 300 third-party service provider facilities which include selected independent medical examination centers and hospitals across all of China's provinces, creating a nationwide network that allows iKang to serve its customers in markets where it does not have self-owned medical centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

			About Eliquis
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Eliquis (apixaban) is an oral selective Factor Xa inhibitor. By 
      inhibiting Factor Xa, a key blood clotting protein, Eliquis 
      decreases thrombin generation and blood clot formation. Eliquis 
      is approved to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in 
      patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in the United States, 
      European Union, Japan and a number of other countries around the world. Eliquis 
      is approved for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) which can 
      lead to PE (pulmonary embolism) in adult patients who have undergone 
      elective hip or knee replacement surgery in the United States, European 
      Union and a number of other countries around the world. Eliquis 
      is not approved for this indication in Japan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			WARNINGS:
			(A) DISCONTINUING ELIQUIS IN PATIENTS WITH 
      NONVALVULAR ATRIAL FIBRILLATION WITHOUT ADEQUATE CONTINUOUS 
      ANTICOAGULATION INCREASES RISK OF STROKE, (B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			(A) Discontinuing ELIQUIS places patients at an increased risk of 
      thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke was observed following 
      discontinuation of ELIQUIS in clinical trials in patients with 
      nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. If anticoagulation with ELIQUIS must be 
      discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding, coverage 
      with another anticoagulant should be strongly considered.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			(B) When neuraxial anesthesia (epidural/spinal anesthesia) or spinal 
      puncture is employed, patients anticoagulated or scheduled to be 
      anticoagulated with low molecular weight heparins, heparinoids, or 
      Factor Xa inhibitors for prevention of thromboembolic complications are 
      at risk of developing an epidural or spinal hematoma which can result in 
      long-term or permanent paralysis.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The risk of these events may be increased by the use of indwelling 
      epidural catheters for administration of analgesia or by the concomitant 
      use of drugs affecting hemostasis such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
      drugs (NSAIDs), platelet aggregation inhibitors, or other 
      anticoagulants. The risk also appears to be increased by traumatic or 
      repeated epidural or spinal puncture.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of neurologic impairment. If 
      neurologic compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary. Consider 
      the potential benefit versus risk before neuraxial intervention in 
      patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			CONTRAINDICATIONS
		&lt;/p&gt;

        anaphylactic reactions)
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Increased Risk of Stroke with Discontinuation of ELIQUIS in 
        Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation: Discontinuing 
        ELIQUIS in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation 
        increases the risk of thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke 
        was observed during the transition from ELIQUIS to warfarin in 
        clinical trials in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. If 
        ELIQUIS must be discontinued for a reason other than pathological 
        bleeding, consider coverage with another anticoagulant.
      
			
				Bleeding Risk: ELIQUIS increases the risk of bleeding and can 
        cause serious, potentially fatal bleeding. Concomitant use of drugs 
        affecting hemostasis increases the risk of bleeding including aspirin 
        and other anti-platelet agents, other anticoagulants, heparin, 
        thrombolytic agents, SSRIs, SNRIs, and NSAIDs. Patients should be made 
        aware of signs or symptoms of blood loss and instructed to immediately 
        report to an emergency room. Discontinue ELIQUIS in patients with 
        active pathological hemorrhage.
      
			
        There is no established way to reverse the anticoagulant effect of 
        apixaban, which can be expected to persist for at least 24 hours after 
        the last dose (i.e., about two half-lives). A specific antidote for 
        ELIQUIS is not available. Hemodialysis does not appear to have a 
        substantial impact on apixaban exposure. Protamine sulfate and vitamin 
        K would not be expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of 
        apixaban. There is no experience with antifibrinolytic agents 
        (tranexamic acid, aminocaproic acid) in individuals receiving 
        apixaban. There is neither scientific rationale for reversal nor 
        experience with systemic hemostatics (desmopressin and aprotinin) in 
        individuals receiving apixaban. Use of procoagulant reversal agents 
        such as prothrombin complex concentrate, activated prothrombin complex 
        concentrate, or recombinant factor VIIa may be considered but has not 
        been evaluated in clinical studies. Activated charcoal reduces 
        absorption of apixaban thereby lowering apixaban plasma concentrations.
      
			
				Prosthetic Heart Valves: The safety and efficacy of ELIQUIS 
        have not been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves and is 
        not recommended in these patients.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			ADVERSE REACTIONS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The most common and most serious adverse reactions reported with ELIQUIS 
      (apixaban) were related to bleeding.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			TEMPORARY INTERRUPTION FOR SURGERY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective 
      surgery or invasive procedures with a moderate or high risk of 
      unacceptable or clinically significant bleeding. ELIQUIS should be 
      discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive 
      procedures with a low risk of bleeding or where the bleeding would be 
      noncritical in location and easily controlled. Bridging anticoagulation 
      during the 24 to 48 hours after stopping ELIQUIS and prior to the 
      intervention is not generally required. ELIQUIS should be restarted 
      after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate hemostasis 
      has been established.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			DRUG INTERACTIONS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Strong Dual Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp: Inhibitors of CYP3A4 
        and P-gp increase exposure to apixaban and increase the risk of 
        bleeding. For patients receiving 5 mg twice daily, the dose of ELIQUIS 
        should be decreased when it is coadministered with drugs that are 
        strong dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp (e.g., ketoconazole, 
        itraconazole, ritonavir, or clarithromycin). In patients already 
        taking ELIQUIS at a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily, avoid coadministration 
        with strong dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp.
      
			
				Strong Dual Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp: Avoid concomitant use 
        of ELIQUIS with strong dual inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp (e.g., 
        rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John&#8217;s wort) because such 
        drugs will decrease exposure to apixaban and increase the risk of 
        stroke.
      
			
				Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Agents: Coadministration of 
        antiplatelet agents, fibrinolytics, heparin, aspirin, and chronic 
        NSAID use increases the risk of bleeding. APPRAISE-2, a 
        placebo-controlled clinical trial of apixaban in high-risk post-acute 
        coronary syndrome patients treated with aspirin or the combination of 
        aspirin and clopidogrel, was terminated early due to a higher rate of 
        bleeding with apixaban compared to placebo.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			PREGNANCY CATEGORY B
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ELIQUIS in pregnant 
      women. Treatment is likely to increase the risk of hemorrhage during 
      pregnancy and delivery. ELIQUIS should be used during pregnancy only if 
      the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the mother and 
      fetus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			About AMPLIFY, AMPLIFY-EXT and ARISTOTLE
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      AMPLIFY (Apixaban for the initial Management of PuLmonary 
      embolIsm and deep vein thrombosis as First-line therapY), 
      a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial, included 5,395 patients 
      (2,691 were randomized to Eliquis and 2,704 were randomized to 
      standard of care, which was initial enoxaparin treatment overlapped by 
      warfarin therapy) with confirmed symptomatic DVT or PE requiring 
      treatment for six months, and evaluated Eliquis therapy compared 
      to standard of care. The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite 
      endpoint of recurrent symptomatic VTE (nonfatal DVT or nonfatal PE) or 
      VTE-related death. The primary safety endpoint was the incidence of 
      major bleeding compared to standard of care.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      AMPLIFY-EXT (Apixaban after the initial Management of PuLmonary 
      embolIsm and deep vein thrombosis with First-line therapY-EXTended 
      Treatment), a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial, included 
      2,486 patients (842 were randomized to Eliquis 2.5 mg, 815 were 
      randomized to Eliquis 5 mg and 829 were randomized to placebo) 
      with prior VTE who had completed six to 12 months of anticoagulation 
      treatment for DVT or PE, and evaluated Eliquis therapy compared 
      to placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was reduction of the composite 
      of symptomatic, recurrent VTE and death from any cause. The primary 
      safety endpoint was the incidence of major bleeding.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction In STroke 
      and Other ThromboemboLic Events in Atrial 
      Fibrillation) was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Eliquis 
      versus warfarin for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism. In 
      ARISTOTLE, 18,201 patients were randomized (9,120 patients to Eliquis 
      and 9,081 to warfarin). ARISTOTLE was an active-controlled, randomized, 
      double-blind, multi-national trial in patients with nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation or atrial flutter, and at least one additional risk factor 
      for stroke. Patients were randomized to treatment with Eliquis 5 
      mg orally twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients, 
      representing 4.7 percent of all patients) or warfarin (target INR range 
      2.0-3.0), and followed for a median of 1.8 years.

year, when it expects full-year profit to be "materially lower"
than last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its first set of results under Watkins, the company
revealed on Monday that first-half net profit slid 15.6 percent
to A$182.3 million ($169.50 million), from A$215.9 million a
year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was largely in line with analyst expectations of
A$184.5 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, but
shares fell 2.9 percent as analysts focused on the weak earnings
outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watkins, who took the post in March, conceded the poor
operational result was not entirely due to external factors like
domestic price competition from Asahi Group Holding Ltd's
 Pepsi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some of that is due to market forces, some is due to what
we can only describe as own goal factors," Watkins said on a
conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decisions by the company last year to cut its sales staff
and stand back from promotional activity in Australia were
poorly made in hindsight, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCA in February booked an 83 percent decline in annual net
profit, its worst profit in 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watkins is overseeing a strategic review that seeks to
restore brand value and save the company A$100 million in costs
over the next three years partly by streamlining its supply
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is drawing up plans for more low and no-calorie
drinks and on Wednesday unveiled a new 250ml, A$2 coke can - an
attempt to gain leverage in Australia's price wars. Further
initiatives would be coming in the summer, Watkins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a business, we have been slow to adapt to these changes
in market conditions and shifting consumer trends," Watkins
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said the first-half results were extremely
disappointing and wanted to see more detail on the review, which
is not expected until a scheduled analyst day in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Management is still in rebase mode and we recommend caution
until it is clear this has come to an end," Citi analyst Gino
Rossi said in a note to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INDONESIA AND BEER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First-half earnings before interest and tax in Australia,
which generates more than 80 per cent of profits, fell 14.1 per
cent to A$226.5 million, while earnings in Indonesia plummeted
83.4 per cent to A$5.2 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has long been speculation that CCA's 30 percent
shareholder, The Coca-Cola Co, was keen to buy the
business back from CCA or team up with a partner like Mexican
bottler Coca-Cola FEMSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Watkins said on Wednesday CCA was committed to both
Indonesia and its alcoholic beverages unit, which is unlikely to
reach the 1 percent contribution to profit growth that had been
flagged for this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCA returned to the beer market in December after a two-year
break, but it said sales had been slower than expected due to
increased competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCA shares were 2.9 percent lower at A$9.45 in mid-afternoon
trade on the Australian stock exchange, off an intraday low of
A$9.23. Shares have fallen around 22 percent since the start of
the year, compared with an 4.8 percent rise in the S/ASX 200

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co is ramping up its first major push to promote the "Star Wars" franchise it purchased from George Lucas in 2012, blitzing consumers this year with a mobile game, animated TV show and an expanded line of toys and clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anticipated rush of light sabers, Wookiees and other "Star Wars" mainstays is Disney's attempt to cash in on its $4.05 billion acquisition of LucasFilm, which gave the company a popular yet aging franchise that has not produced a new feature film in nine years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday the company introduced "Star Wars: Commander," a free mobile app that lets players direct battles with franchise heroes Han Solo, Chewbacca and Princess Leia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is available exclusively for 30 days through Apple Inc's App Store and later on Google Inc's Android devices. Disney generates revenue by selling a currency known as crystals that can be used to speed up game play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sept. 29, the company will release computer-animated movie "Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion" online and on the Watch Disney XD app. The film debuts on Disney Channels around the world on Oct. 3, followed by a series based on the movie on the Disney XD channel starting Oct. 13. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, retailers began selling toys, bedding, backpacks and other products tied to the series, expanding the range of "Star Wars" items previously available. A line of "Star Wars"-branded healthy foods will hit shelves next year.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game will be promoted on Disney's StarWars.com website, which is drawing steady traffic from fans more than a year before the next film, "Episode VII," hits theaters, said Jimmy Pitaro, president of Disney's interactive unit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are still a decent amount of time from the movie, and yet we are seeing a huge amount of interest," Pitaro said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen if "Star Wars" will be as much a draw as a couple decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the campaign is representative of Disney's strategy of banking on acquired names. This year, retailers generated $1 billion in sales from each of eight Disney's franchises, including Marvel's Spider-Man and Pixar movie "Cars," Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger has said.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company says will release a film annually starting with  "Episode VII." It also plans to "significantly" increase the space adventure's presence at its theme parks, Iger said during an Aug. 5 earnings call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Iger didn't disclose how the company intends to use "Star Wars" at its parks, in 2012 it tapped another franchise when it opened a 12-acre Cars Land, based on the 2006 Pixar film, at Disney California Adventure park in Anaheim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is one of those franchises you just can't overexpose," said Peter Sealey, former head of marketing at Columbia Pictures. "You just put the metal to the floor and enjoy the ride." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting By Ronald Grover; Editing by Edwin Chan and Cynthia Osterman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fraudsters are targeting JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co customers in an email "phishing" campaign that is unusual because it attempts to collect credentials for that bank and also infect PCs with a virus that steals passwords from other institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h1&gt;'Crude Awakening' Kindle Single eBook Gives Definitive Account of Chevron v. Donziger Trial and Investigation&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Aug 21, 2014) - Crude Awakening: Chevron in Ecuador, published by leading independent digital publisher RosettaBooks, picks up where other accounts of Chevron in Ecuador leave off. It relates the gripping inside story of Chevron's New York "counter-trial" against the plaintiffs who won a record $19 billion environmental judgment in Ecuador. Written by legal journalist Michael D. Goldhaber, who was first to publicize the Crude film outtakes and to condemn them, Crude Awakening is the only book to examine:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				What are the underlying merits of the environmental case?
            
				What was proved at the New York trial -- and what wasn't?
            
				What are the lessons for global litigation -- and litigation fraud?
            
				How have the plaintiffs succeeded in exploiting the media?
					
				
			&lt;p&gt;A detective story and courtroom drama, with a concluding chapter of keen commentary, Crude Awakening is a behind-the-scenes look at the world's biggest and messiest case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On their way to winning a $19 billion verdict against Chevron in Ecuador, lawyers for the Amazonian plaintiffs invite a documentary film crew to record their every move. Unfortunately, their every move includes fraud. Chevron subpoenas the outtakes of the movie Crude, and follows the clues from one improbable fraud to the next. In time, the oil company turns the tables, and sues the plaintiffs for racketeering. The drama culminates in a classic New York "counter-trial," where it's the testimony of one corrupt ex-judge against another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Crude Awakening details Chevron's struggle to prove that the truth is the truth - even when the truth is on the side of the big bad oil company, and not on the side of the charismatic little guy fighting for indigenous people of the Amazon rain forest," said Goldhaber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crude Awakening will captivate both students of law and students of human nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About the Author: Michael D. Goldhaber is "The Global Lawyer" columnist for The American Lawyer, and senior international correspondent for American Lawyer Media. He is a graduate of Harvard College, Columbia Journalism School, and Yale Law School.

		&lt;h1&gt;Meru Networks First to Achieve Microsoft Lync Qualification for 802.11ac Wi-Fi Solutions&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Meru's High-Performance, Reliable Wi-Fi Solutions Meet Stringent Quality-of-Service Standards for Microsoft's Market-Leading Unified Communication Offering&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;SUNNYVALE, CA--(Marketwired - Aug 21, 2014) - 
					Meru Networks&#174; (NASDAQ: MERU), a leader in intelligent Wi-Fi networking, today announced that it is the first vendor to complete qualification with Microsoft Lync&#174; for 802.11ac wireless networking solutions. The Lync qualification program is designed to ensure products adhere to Microsoft's stringent guidelines for voice and video quality. Products that receive qualification have demonstrated a very high level of performance under demanding network conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With Wi-Fi becoming the primary means of network access and unified communications capabilities being available on so many devices, ensuring high performance of Lync over wireless networks is more important than ever," said BJ Haberkorn, director of Lync product management at Microsoft. "The 802.11ac Wi-Fi solutions from Meru are qualified with Lync and show outstanding performance, even in the highest-density environments." &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Using Microsoft Lync over Meru Wi-Fi delivers a consistently high-quality experience for end-users, who can click-to-call within Microsoft applications for wire-like voice when using Meru. In traditional networks, devices see dozens or even hundreds of access points operating on different channels. Meru's wireless technology gives each user device a single virtualized point of access that enables the network to manage connections over the best available access point. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No matter how many physical access points a network has, Meru networks eliminate the boundaries created by a hub-like patchwork of access points and create the appearance of a single, seamless layer of coverage. This lets the network -- not client devices -- make connectivity decisions, and allows users to move freely, without disruptive handoffs. Doing so ensures continuity of service and an excellent user experience when using streaming applications such as Microsoft Lync. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The high quality and ease-of-use provided by Microsoft Lync is driving organizations of all types to adopt unified communications over landline telephony," said Ajay Malik, senior vice president of engineering and quality assurance at Meru. "Meru intelligent Wi-Fi networks ensure optimal performance of Microsoft Lync, even when users are in motion. Receiving Lync qualification validates that our 802.11ac Wi-Fi solutions provide the high quality of experience that users have come to expect from both Microsoft and Meru." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Meru's AP832 and AP822 802.11ac access points are fully qualified as interoperable with Microsoft Lync Server.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON/NEW YORK Aug 21 (Reuters) - Fraudsters are targeting
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co customers in an email "phishing"
campaign that is unusual because it attempts to collect
credentials for that bank and also infect PCs with a virus for
stealing passwords from other institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The campaign, dubbed "Smash and Grab," was launched on
Tuesday with a widely distributed email that urged recipients to
click to view a secure message from JPMorgan, according to
security researchers with corporate email provider Proofpoint
Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the No. 1 U.S. bank by assets, confirmed that
spammers had launched a phishing campaign targeting its
customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks like they sent it out to lots of people in hopes
that some of them might be JPMorgan Chase customers, because
there are a lot of them," said bank spokeswoman Trish Wexler."We
are seeing this as a very small incident."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said the bank believes most of the spam was stopped by
fraud filters at large Internet providers, adding that the email
looked realistic because the attackers apparently used a screen
grab from an authentic email sent by the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users who click on a malicious link are asked to enter
credentials for accessing accounts with JPMorgan. Even if they
did not comply, the site attempted to automatically install the
Dyre banking Trojan on their PCs, according to Proofpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dyre is a recently discovered piece of malware that seeks
credentials from customers of Bank of America Corp,
Citigroup Inc and the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC
, according to email security firm Phishme. (bit.ly/1lvFaVg)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proofpoint Vice President of Threat Research Mike Horn said
it is unusual for spammers to infect PCs with malware in the
same campaign that is seeking to persuade users to provide
banking credentials because that increases the odds of
detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Usually when they do credential phishing, that is all they
do. In this case they are throwing in the kitchen sink," Horn
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proofpoint saw about 150,000 emails from the group on
Tuesday, the first day it noticed the campaign among its
customers in the Fortune 500 and higher education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That makes a moderately large campaign, but the largest
attempts involve sending more than 1 million pieces of spam over
a few days to Proofpoint clients, he said. The firm manages over
100 million email accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horn said that Proofpoint quickly identified the spam and
was able to stop it infecting customers, but was not sure how
effective it was in infecting others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horn said that his firm was unsure who was behind the
emails, though much of the campaign's infrastructure was in
Russia and Ukraine and the group's tactics were consistent with
those of Eastern European cybercrime gangs.

      Noble1 IT Hardware Support Solutions Launches New MSP Program toSupport 
      HP, Cisco, Brocade, Dell, IBM Products, and More
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noble1, one of North America&#8217;s premiere IT Hardware Support Solutions 
      companies, announced today that it has launched an exclusive program 
      entitled MSP1 designed specifically for Managed Service Providers (MSPs).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The newly implemented program has been designed to deliver multiple 
      value-added services to the MSP market. With MSP1, managed service 
      providers will no longer be tasked with challenges related to support 
      logistics.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The business processes associated with IT hardware support drastically 
      impact MSPs&#8212;especially aspects related to staffing, vendor issues 
      related to parts, and challenges in shipping and stocking. Now, with 
      Noble1&#8217;s MSP1 offering, MSPs will benefit from everything from preferred 
      pricing, dedicated inventory, and dedicated account managers. Further, 
      MSP1 will deliver other tremendous benefits including brand integration 
      and branded help desk options, a comprehensive loyalty rewards program 
      and, most importantly, customizable support contracts to include 
      duration, and scope, etc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This new program is poised to become a true game changer for managed 
      service providers,&#8221; commented Derek Stiles, President and Chief 
      Executive Officer of Noble1. &#8220;The evolution of the MSP has been 
      substantial over the past decade&#8212;however, with that evolution comes the 
      pitfalls of support mechanisms and their inherent client expectations. 
      What customers expect and what MSPs can deliver as it relates to IT 
      hardware support is vastly polarized, and thus can drastically impact 
      business and brand. It is for this reason that we have developed such a 
      comprehensive network of talent and logistics to alleviate those 
      challenges in the MSP world.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new program, scheduled to launch September 1, 2014, will be 
      supported by a complete North America Network of trained technicians, 
      parts located strategically and geographically, and full 24/7/365 
      support.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Noble1 IT Hardware Support SolutionsNoble1 was 
      created from the clear idea that there simply has to be a better recipe 
      for providing alternative IT support on a world-class level without 
      breaking the bank for the consumer. To that end, we&#8217;ve assembled some of 
      the top talent in the industry to provide 24x7x4 help desk, onsite 
      service, and parts logistics across North America and beyond.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since 2010, the Noble1 team has been ready to meet the support 
      challenges presented by older IT datacenter equipment that works fine, 
      but finds itself on the endangered species list by the manufacturer, or 
      &#8220;End of Life&#8221; as they are so fond of classifying this otherwise viable 
      equipment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As our clients across North America can attest, Noble1 will be there for 
      you any time of day or night to ensure your infrastructure continues 
      running smoothly and efficiently. Remember, problems happen, it&#8217;s how 
      you choose to address them that makes all the difference, and Noble1 is 
      the right choice for your organization.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Japanese Mobile Games Giant gumi Inc. Launches U.S. Studio, Announces 
      Hiring of Former Microsoft GM, and Extends Plans with Sega and Others to 
      Deliver 30 Games Worldwide
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Former Co-Founding Member of Xbox 360 Team, AJ Redmer, will bring the 
      company&#8217;s focus on regional success to new studios and oversee first 
      party creative development
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today gumi 
      Inc., a leading developer and publisher of mobile games, is 
      announcing its first major North American expansion plans since the 
      close of a $50 million round of funding. The company is officially 
      expanding into the U.S. with the opening of a games studio and the 
      hiring of former Microsoft Game Studios GM AJ Redmer. The U.S. studio, 
      combined with others across the world, plan to release thirty new titles 
      worldwide, including Chain Chronicles--a SEGA game, which is already a 
      top grossing mainstay on both iOS and Android in Japan - soon to be 
      released in the U.S.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to studios in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, China, and 
      France, gumi 
      Inc. is announcing new studios that will make content for English 
      speaking countries, with North America being the primary market. The new 
      U.S. headquarters is in Austin for first party creative development with 
      another studio in Vancouver. AJ Redmer, former General Manager of 
      Microsoft Game Studios, will oversee the aforementioned studios and 
      future teams involved in gumi's Western expansion efforts. AJ was one of 
      the founding members of the Xbox360 team and personally executed 
      essential components to the console&#8217;s success, such as high level 
      strategy, hardware design, developer relations, content strategy, 
      marketing, design and manufacturing plans. He also oversaw key studios 
      in both North America and across Asia at different tenures during his 
      career, most recently as the CEO of WeMade Entertainment USA. To 
      compliment the development studios, gumi will also establish an office 
      in San Francisco focusing on business development and public relations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In our experience of achieving global success with Brave Frontier, we 
      recognized that Western markets, such as the U.S., Canada, and Europe, 
      have unique tastes to their local cultures and playing styles. As we 
      have already done with our studios in Asia, we've set out to build 
      studios in key regions with the best talent and domain expertise to 
      produce original content that is relevant to local markets in the West,&#8221; 
      said Hironao Kunimitsu, CEO of gumi Inc. &#8220;With AJ's first-hand 
      experience overseeing production of several of the gaming world's most 
      iconic franchises, gumi aims to raise the bar of mobile gaming 
      development for global regions.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Inc. is also expanding its relationship with SEGA. The company will 
      publish SEGA&#8217;s Japanese game titles in North America, Europe and South 
      Asian countries, and the two parties will further collaborate in order 
      to provide consumers with localized support to match player preferences, 
      languages and gameplay environments.

&lt;p&gt;OSLO (Reuters) - Microsoft has agreed to install Opera Software's Internet browser on low and mid-market mobile phones it inherited from Nokia, potentially putting Opera Mini on another 100 million phones year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal comes after Microsoft completed its $7.5 billion takeover of Nokia's handset business in April and announced it would cut 18,000 jobs as part of its efforts to halve the size of the Nokia phone business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a great agreement for us, and something we have been dreaming of for 10 years and now it&#8217;s finally happening," Opera Chief Executive Lars Boilesen said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opera shares surged after the deal was announced on Thursday and at 1410 GMT they were trading up 10 percent, giving the firm a market capitalisation of $1.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opera, which also generates revenues from digital advertising platforms, said the deal would be profitable from day one. It declined to estimate the expected volume, but a source close to the agreement said Opera Mini could now be installed on an additional 100 million handsets a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opera also raised its full-year guidance, predicting earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation would be $117 million to $124 million, up from previous guidance of $110-120 million, while revenues would come in at $480-500 million versus a previous forecast of $435-460 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norway's Opera said Microsoft would automatically put the Opera Mini browser, known for its ability to compress content and save on data charges, on its feature phones -- mobile phones with more limited capacity than so-called smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opera said Microsoft was essentially outsourcing web browser development for all phones that do not use its Windows operating system. Opera Mini will also be pushed out to existing phones to encourage uses to upgrade from the Xpress browser. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The deal involves feature phones and the Asha product line, which is good, but there is a potential kicker here if they manage to convert existing users, like they say they will," Christer Roth an analyst at DNB Markets said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they succeed then it would give them a solid user base growth, which they indirectly can monetize," Roth said. "The most lucrative part would be if they managed to take over the browser part of all windows phones."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Opera Mini browser is installed on 250 million phones, primarily in emerging markets. It can compress data by as much as 90 percent, saving operators bandwidth and is compatible with nearly all Internet-capable devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich Bernardo, head of legacy business, phones, at Microsoft said the deal would allow the company to provide continuity of service as it moves from the Xpress browser to Opera Mini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All new phones will be delivered with Opera as their default browser from now on," Boilesen said. "The only thing we are not doing so far is delivering browsers to their Windows Smartphone platform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I&#8217;m confident that if this deal becomes a success we will deliver browsers to their Windows phones as well," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second quarter, Opera's adjusted EBITDA rose 24 percent to $27 million, beating forecasts for $24.7 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Writing by Terje Solsvik and Balazs Koranyi; editing by David Clarke)&lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Global BPO Market Report 2014-2018: Key Vendors 
      Dominating are Accenture, Capgemini, Genpact, IBM  Tata Consultancy 
      Services
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/4jb2ch/global_bpo_market) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      BPO Market 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global BPO market will grow at a CAGR of 5.63 percent over the 
      period 2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global BPO market can be segmented on the basis of BPO applications 
      into the following: CRM, FA, HR and Others that include procurement, 
      and engineering and RD BPO functions. The report also discusses in 
      detail the market spending across end-user segments and covers the 
      spending across key geographical regions in the market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cloud technology is revolutionizing the mode of outsourcing business 
      processes. With its usage, BPO clients can have instant access to 
      applications on demand and eliminate the need to invest in IT 
      infrastructure. Though many BPO clients are still hesitant regarding its 
      usage because of concerns of data security, return on investment, high 
      initial investment, high cost of upgrades, maintenance, and acquiring a 
      new project, several clients are increasingly adopting this technology 
      in view of its disruptive levels of productivity improvement and 
      business enablement. Some of the advantages associated with adopting a 
      cloud-based BPO service are cost reduction, reliability, scalability, 
      and agility.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, cost-effectiveness of outsourcing certain 
      capital and labor intensive operations is one of the major factors 
      driving the growth of the market. These firms are increasingly 
      outsourcing their back office functions that require more 
      infrastructure, capital investment, and human resources. Outsourcing 
      these functions enable the firms to improve efficiency of operations and 
      cut costs though labor arbitrage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that the future of the Global BPO market is, 
      however, constrained by certain factors; the most important among them 
      being the rising attrition rates. BPO jobs are mainly taken up on a 
      temporary or part-time basis and hence the turnover rates of employees 
      are very high.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The report also includes a discussion of the other vendors operating in 
      this market. The report contains a comprehensive market and vendor 
      landscape in addition to a SWOT analysis of the key vendors.

      Research and Markets: Global Retail Industry IT Spending Market Report 
      2014-2018 with Cisco Systems, Dell, IBM  Hewlett-Packard Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/3mhfqq/global_retail) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Retail Industry IT Spending Market 2014-2018" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysts forecast the Global Retail IT Spending market will grow at 
      a CAGR of 4.10 percent over the period 2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cloud computing refers to accessing resources operated by a third-party 
      provider. With minimal upfront investment, cloud computing provides a 
      pay-per-use billing model. Currently, cloud computing is the buzzword in 
      the Technology sector, especially with the majority of large retailers 
      viewing cloud computing as a priority, while a few others are have 
      already adopted it or have funds in place for its adoption.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report the growth of the Global Retail Industry IT 
      Spending market is driven by several factors. The increased demand for 
      improved customer interaction is one of the major drivers. Retailers 
      spend a considerable amount on IT solutions to provide customers with 
      various facilities that enable them to manage their activities 
      conveniently, regardless of their location. Another important driver is 
      technological differentiation because of intense competition.

Year-end move seen most likely</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Shares in drugmaker AstraZeneca have climbed more than 7 percent this week, fueled by speculation of renewed takeover interest from Pfizer, following an abortive $118 billion (71 billion pounds) takeover attempt in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while British takeover rules mean deal talks could be back on the cards as early as Aug. 26, following the ending of the first of a two-stage cooling-off period, many investors and analysts see the year-end as a more likely time for any return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not expecting anything next week," said Dan Mahony, a fund manager at Polar Capital, who increased his stake in AstraZeneca last year. "I know the stock is rallying on anticipation but I suspect if anything is going to happen it is more likely to happen in November or December."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read has made clear he is still considering big deals to revive his firm's pipeline and cut its tax bill - something buying AstraZeneca would allow it to do via a so-called inversion that would shift its tax base to Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Read has little leverage right now. Pfizer cannot take the initiative and launch a public bid until Nov. 26 - six months from when it walked away after AstraZeneca rejected its last offer - though AstraZeneca can invite it back from Aug. 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;British rules also allow Pfizer to make a single offer via a private phone call to AstraZeneca. But this single offer option is rarely used in takeover situations as the bidder has no way to take things further if the target simply says "no".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, Pfizer would need to make a knockout offer at a big premium to its last bid of 55 pounds a share, which many analysts view as unlikely given Read's reluctance to close the gap in May to the 58.85 pounds AstraZeneca indicated it wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CANCER DRUG HOPES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one factor that could force AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot back to the table this month would be sustained pressure from his shareholders, a number of whom are disgruntled that he let Pfizer's offer slip away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet there has been no high-profile investor rebellion so far - and Soriot has been steadily building up hopes for his company's new cancer drugs, adding respiratory medicines through a deal with Almirall and putting behind him a damaging U.S. investigation into heart drug Brilinta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca aims to present more convincing evidence for its experimental medicines at a cancer conference in Madrid in late September, and Soriot intends to highlight the potential of the full line-up of new drugs at an investor day on Nov. 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision to time that investor event just one week before Pfizer has a free hand to renew its approaches suggests AstraZeneca is "very unlikely" to invite&#160;Pfizer&#160;to make a new offer once the three-month cooling off period ends next week, according to analysts at Jefferies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political uncertainty has also played into the British group's hands to some extent, with recent U.S. threats to clamp down on tax inversions provoking fears that such tax-saving deals may in future be blocked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the failure to buy AstraZeneca in May, healthcare bankers says Pfizer has been looking at other targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ireland-based Actavis would represent one good alternative, according to analysts at Leerink, and Berenberg believes Pfizer could even contemplate buying AstraZeneca's larger British rival GlaxoSmithKline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But neither offers as good a fit as AstraZeneca, whose pipeline of immune system-boosting cancer drugs would complement Pfizer's currently narrow oncology portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca shares were 2.2 percent high at 43.79 pounds by 1.50 p.m. BST, outperforming a 0.6 percent gain in the European drugs sector.     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Mark Heinrich)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Aug 21 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co is
ramping up its first major push to promote the "Star Wars"
franchise it purchased from George Lucas in 2012, blitzing
consumers this year with a mobile game, animated TV show and an
expanded line of toys and clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anticipated rush of light sabers, Wookiees and other
"Star Wars" mainstays is Disney's attempt to cash in on its
$4.05 billion acquisition of LucasFilm, which gave the company a
popular yet aging franchise that has not produced a new feature
film in nine years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday the company introduced "Star Wars: Commander," a
free mobile app that lets players direct battles with franchise
heroes Han Solo, Chewbacca and Princess Leia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is available exclusively for 30 days through Apple Inc's
 App Store and later on Google Inc's Android
devices. Disney generates revenue by selling a currency known as
crystals that can be used to speed up game play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sept. 29, the company will release computer-animated
movie "Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion" online and on the
Watch Disney XD app. The film debuts on Disney Channels around
the world on Oct. 3, followed by a series based on the movie on
the Disney XD channel starting Oct. 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, retailers began selling toys, bedding, backpacks
and other products tied to the series, expanding the range of
"Star Wars" items previously available. A line of "Star
Wars"-branded healthy foods will hit shelves next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game will be promoted on Disney's StarWars.com website,
which is drawing steady traffic from fans more than a year
before the next film, "Episode VII," hits theaters, said Jimmy
Pitaro, president of Disney's interactive unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are still a decent amount of time from the movie, and
yet we are seeing a huge amount of interest," Pitaro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen if "Star Wars" will be as much a draw
as a couple decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the campaign is representative of Disney's strategy of
banking on acquired names. This year, retailers generated $1
billion in sales from each of eight Disney's franchises,
including Marvel's Spider-Man and Pixar movie "Cars," Chief
Executive Officer Bob Iger has said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company says will release a film annually starting with 
"Episode VII." It also plans to "significantly" increase the
space adventure's presence at its theme parks, Iger said during
an Aug. 5 earnings call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Iger didn't disclose how the company intends to use
"Star Wars" at its parks, in 2012 it tapped another franchise
when it opened a 12-acre Cars Land, based on the 2006 Pixar
film, at Disney California Adventure park in Anaheim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is one of those franchises you just can't overexpose,"
said Peter Sealey, former head of marketing at Columbia
Pictures. "You just put the metal to the floor and enjoy the
ride."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shake Shack, the fast-food restaurant chain that has developed a cult following for its 'Shackburgers', 'flat-top' hot dogs and eponymous shakes, has selected JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) to lead a proposed initial public offering, according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential offering, which could come as soon as this year according to the people, would be the biggest public event for a company that started out of a hot dog kiosk in New York's Madison Square Park in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Shake Shack is expected to post earnings of around $20 million next year and the size of the IPO is likely to be small, underwriting one of the biggest burger names in the United States is a plum assignment for investment banks JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shake Shack's majority owner, Union Square Hospitality Group LLC, interviewed investment&#160;banks&#160;in recent weeks to appoint underwriters for the IPO, Reuters first reported last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives for Shake Shack, Union Square Hospitality, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shake Shack would likely be the most-followed IPO out of a string of casual dining chains that have gone public this year. They include El Pollo Loco Holdings Inc (LOCO.O), Zoe's Kitchen Inc (ZOES.N) and Papa Murphy's Holdings Inc (FRSH.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shake Shack is present in many U.S. states including New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Florida and Massachusetts. It has also expanded internationally in cities such as London, Istanbul, Moscow and Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company does not franchise and says it has no plans to do so in the future. Shake Shack's chief executive is Randy Garutti, a Cornell University graduate who worked his way up at Union Square Hospitality from general manager at its restaurants to lead Shake Shack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Union Square Hospitality was founded by restaurateur Danny Meyer in 1985. It also runs other popular New York eateries, including Blue Smoke, Gramercy Tavern and Union Square Cafe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private equity firm Leonard Green &amp; Partners LP agreed to acquire a 39.5 percent stake Union Square Hospitality in 2012 for an undisclosed amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Soyoung Kim and Chizu Nomiyama)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian software maker Opera signed a deal to take over the browser building unit of Microsoft's Nokia mobile phone unit and reported second-quarter earnings above expectations on Thursday, sending it shares sharply higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have signed a strategic licensing deal with Microsoft. We are basically taking over the browser building department in Nokia," Opera Chief Executive Lars Boilsesen said. "This means that Opera Mini will become the default browser for Microsoft's feature phone product lines and the Asha phones product lines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal will be profitable from the start, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opera shares rose 6.5 percent to 80.45 crowns a share by 0304 EST on the deal and the earnings report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All the current user base will be encouraged to upgrade to Opera Mini and all the new phones will come with Opera Mini pre-installed as a default browser.

			Aruba Networks Leads Industry with First Microsoft Lync Qualified 
      802.11ac Wi-Fi Solution
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Indoor  Outdoor 802.11ac APs Address Rapid Adoption of Mobile 
      Devices and Laptops Running Microsoft Lync and Office 365 at 
      Price-Points Attractive for All Enterprises
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Aruba Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARUN) today announced that its indoor and 
      outdoor enterprise 802.11ac 
      Wi-Fi access points (APs) are the first in the industry to be qualified 
      under the Microsoft Lync Server Wi-Fi qualification program. The 
      qualification program ensures that products conform to Microsoft&#8217;s 
      stringent guidelines for end-user voice and video quality. With this 
      qualification, enterprises of all sizes can now leverage the speed and 
      reliability of Aruba gigabit Wi-Fi to ensure predictable unified 
      communications experiences.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The significant growth of #GenMobile 
      employees using Lync-enabled smartphones, laptops and tablets has placed 
      increased strain on enterprise Wi-Fi infrastructures, boosting demand 
      for a Lync-qualified 802.11ac solution. With its patented ClientMatch&#8482; 
      technology, which intelligently steers mobile devices to the ideal AP, 
      and AppRF 
      technology, which prioritizes and improves the reliability of Lync 
      traffic, Aruba&#8217;s AP-200, 
      AP-210, 
      AP-220, 
      and AP-275 
      Series of 802.11ac APs are ideal for enterprises seeking cost-effective, 
      reliable and high-performance wireless solutions on which to run Lync 
      unified communications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The mass adoption of Lync-enabled devices has dramatically raised the 
      capacity and throughput demands on Wi-Fi networks,&#8221; said Zeus Kerravala, 
      principal analyst for ZK Research. &#8220;The high performance of 802.11ac 
      Wi-Fi is the ideal answer, and the accelerating unit shipments of 
      802.11ac devices and infrastructure highlights widespread market 
      adoption. By Lync-qualifying all its indoor and outdoor 802.11ac 
      products &#8211; from the entry level AP-200 series to the industrial-grade 
      AP-270 series &#8211; Aruba is supporting Lync across the spectrum, from small 
      branches running Office 365 to the largest host or on-premise Lync 2013 
      server based solutions. That&#8217;s a game changer for Microsoft and for 
      enterprises that have wanted to roll out Lync enterprise-wide but were 
      concerned about the cost of infrastructure upgrades.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Aruba offers wireless solutions for Lync on-premises, hosted, and Office 
      365 applications. With technologies like AppRF, Aruba can automatically 
      differentiate Lync voice, video, and desktop sharing from other 
      application streams and prioritize Lync traffic to deliver a better 
      overall user experience. The high performance of Lync over Aruba Wi-Fi &#8211; 
      particularly with the added bandwidth of 802.11ac &#8211; is enabling 
      enterprises worldwide to discard wired IP phones in favor of mobile Lync 
      clients.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With 802.11ac, we&#8217;re finding that enterprises are even more confident 
      about &#8216;cutting the cord&#8217; and using Lync for all their users&#8217; unified 
      communications needs &#8211; particularly for those making voice and video 
      calls on their mobile devices,&#8221; said Eric King, Director of Lync Partner 
      Management. &#8220;Aruba has always been committed to ensuring the best 
      possible Lync over Wi-Fi experience and their 802.11ac APs are no 
      exception. Marrying Aruba 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Lync gives enterprises a 
      reliable, high-performing UC experience.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The all wireless workplace is fast becoming a reality,&#8221; said Michael R. 
      Tennefoss, Vice President Strategic Partnerships for Aruba Networks. 
      &#8220;Reliably delivering Lync services over Wi-Fi gives enterprises the 
      option to cut the last cord and pocket the savings that come from 
      eliminating wired desk phones. Using the Lync-qualified 802.11ac 
      wireless solution in conjunction with tightly integrated Lync server SDN 
      API gives enterprises a robust, cost-effective platform for 
      extending unified communications to mobile users and devices throughout 
      the enterprise.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Detroit has once again raised the possibility of having a regional water and sewer system authority in the latest version of a debt adjustment plan the city filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court late on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new draft of the plan -- the last one expected ahead of a financial feasibility trial scheduled to open in early September -- also includes the city's current effort to repurchase $5.2 billion of outstanding water and sewer system revenue bonds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 25.7 percent of the bonds were tendered by late Wednesday, according to tender agent Bondholder Communications Group. Bondholders have until 5 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday to take up the city's tender offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If enough bonds are returned and if the city can project sufficient savings from a planned bond refunding, Detroit could sell up to $5.5 billion of refunding bonds in the municipal market as soon as next week. The city also could privately place the debt with financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion of the proposed regional authority to run the city's water and sewer services returned to Detroit's plan after the idea was dropped in a prior draft earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That prompted Judge Steven Rhodes, who is overseeing Detroit's historic bankruptcy case, to order the city and Wayne, Macomb and Oakland counties into mediation on the concept. Detroit currently provides water and sewer services in those counties, but the system is in need of costly repairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a result of mediation or otherwise, it is possible that the city may enter into an authority transaction that includes the formation of the DWSD (Detroit Water and Sewer Department) Authority to conduct many or all of the operations currently &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;conducted by DWSD," the sixth amended plan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It added that the deal would be subject to approval by the bankruptcy court and other involved parties and would require the three counties to drop their objections to the debt adjustment plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of Detroit's plan to adjust $18 billion of debt and exit the biggest-ever municipal bankruptcy, the city said it would use $408.6 million in water and sewer revenue over nine years to cover payments to the Detroit General Retirement System accrued through June 30. The three counties have objected to the revenue diversion, contending the money is needed for critical system improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhodes will commence on Sept. 2 a lengthy confirmation hearing on Detroit's plan to determine if it's fair and feasible. The key proceeding had been slated to start on Aug. 29 with objections from individual creditors without legal representation, but Rhodes on Wednesday postponed that portion until later in the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The updated financial plan also touches upon a state-run financial review commission, created under a new Michigan law, which would oversee Detroit's finances after it exits bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The financial oversight board shall be composed of individuals with recognized financial competence and experience and shall have the authority to, among other things, impose limits on city borrowing and expenditures and require the use of financial best practices," the plan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It added that the city will "promptly" provide the court with any reports given to or received from the commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhodes last week directed Detroit to present details at the confirmation hearing on how the law will be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The law, which was enacted in June as part of Michigan's $195 million contribution to the plan, creates a nine-member panel that will stay active until Detroit meets certain financial thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting By Karen Pierog; Editing by Greg Mahlich)&lt;/p&gt;

that will stay active until Detroit meets certain financial
thresholds.

&lt;p&gt;(Adds background )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Nate Raymond and Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aug 22 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc has agreed
to a settlement worth $1.2 billion to resolve a U.S. regulator's
claims the bank sold Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
 faulty mortgage bonds, the regulator announced Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the settlement with the Federal Housing Finance
Agency, the conservator for the two government-controlled
mortgage finance companies, Goldman Sachs said it agreed to pay
$3.15 billion to repurchase mortgage-backed securities from
Fannie and Freddie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FHFA, which valued the settlement at $1.2 billion, said
the accord "effectively makes Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac whole
on their investments in the securities at issue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $1.2 billion reflects the amount that Goldman will pay,
minus the estimated current value of the securities being bought
back from Fannie and Freddie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal averts a Sept. 29 trial in a pair of lawsuits
against Goldman that the FHFA filed in 2011 as it sought to
recover damages from various financial institutions behind some
$200 billion in mortgage bonds bought by Fannie and Freddie that
later went sour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, the FHFA has resolved all but three of the 18
lawsuits it filed, recovering $17.3 billion through cases
against banks including Bank of America Corp, Deutsche
Bank AG and Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FHFA's primary case against Goldman Sachs accused the
bank of misleading the two mortgage finance giants in the sale
of over $11.1 billion in mortgage-backed securities sold to
Fannie and Freddie from 2005 to 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs denied the allegations, and in the settlement
did not admit wrongdoing. Under the settlement, Goldman Sachs
will pay about $1 billion to Fannie Mae and $2.15 billion to
Freddie Mac, the FHFA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs in a statement said the costs of the deal were
substantially covered by its litigation reserves as of the
second quarter of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are pleased to have resolved these matters," Gregory
Palm, Goldman's general counsel, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal tops a $550 million settlement that Goldman Sachs
reached with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to
resolve charges over how it marketed a subprime mortgage product
in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Justice continues to investigate
Goldman Sachs over its marketing of mortgage-backed securities.
The Justice Department on Thursday announced a $16.65 billion
settlement with Bank of America over mortgage
securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FHFA continues to litigate against three other banks:
HSBC Holdings Plc, Nomura Holdings Inc and
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HSBC continues to face its own trial Sept. 29, while
Nomura's case would go to a jury Jan. 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Federal Housing Finance Agency v. Goldman, Sachs
&amp; Co. et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York,

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Aug 22 (Reuters) - The world's biggest
broadcaster of Spanish-language content, Grupo Televisa, has 15
days to resubmit an acceptable plan for infrastructure sharing
with other broadcast concessions, Mexico's telecom watchdog said
on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT) said it had
suggested certain changes to a plan previously submitted by
Televisa and was giving the broadcaster the
additional time to make those changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico's government last year approved a constitutional
reform that said phone and broadcast companies with more than 50
percent of the market share are subject to harsher regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the new rules, Televisa needs IFT approval for any
plan that sets out the conditions for infrastructure sharing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IFT did not give details about its specific suggestions
to Televisa but said the previous plan "did not meet all the
requirements (dominant) companies must include in an
infrastructure offer."

&lt;p&gt;BOGOTA Aug 22 (Reuters) - The Colombian peso weakened to
its lowest level in more than three months on Friday, weighed by
a widely awaited speech by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen
and JP Morgan's removal of the currency from its "overweight"
portfolio recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peso fell 0.59 percent from Thursday's
closing price, to an intraday low of 1,929.85 pesos to the
dollar before trimming losses to close 0.27 percent lower at
1923.80 pesos per dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yellen on Friday said the Fed may have to raise U.S.
interest rates sooner and faster than expected, if the labor
market may be tigther than it seems. Higher interest rates tend
to boost the allure of the dollar as they raise the yield on
some U.S. assets..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yellen's speech strengthened the dollar on an international
level, which is transmitted to Latin America," said Cristian
Lancheros, an analyst at the Acciones y Valores brokerage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Colombia's foreign exchange market closed on Thursday,
JP Morgan announced that it moved the Colombian peso from
"overweight" to "medium-weight" in its GBI-EM model portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among its concerns, the bank cited contemplated pension fund
reform which would mandate some funds investing a chunk of their
assets abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Colombian pension funds step up investments abroad, that
would step up demand for dollars and could be bearish for the
peso, analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sensitivity over pension reform and headwinds for oil
exports are weighing on sentiment, reducing out-performance
potential of COP [the Colombian peso] notably in the last few
weeks," the investment bank said in a note to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will take whatever time is necessary to
modify its pension rules, though changes will not be immediate,
the director of public credit at the finance ministry, Michel
Janna, told Reuters late on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once the decree is ready to be published and executed there
will surely be a transition period," Janna said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can't give a date, but there are a series of steps that
we'll take in the necessary time to be able to make the best
reform possible," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government and policymakers have expressed concern in
recent weeks that attacks by Marxist rebels, increased operating
costs and weaker crude prices have started to reduce government
income from oil sector exports that could bite into future
economic growth.

&lt;p&gt;Aug 22 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc could pay
about $1.1 billion to settle claims from the U.S. housing
finance regulator that it sold bad mortgage-backed securities
(MBS), the Financial Times reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiations between Goldman and the Federal Housing Finance
Agency (FHFA) could be concluded as early as next week, the
business daily reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
(on.ft.com/1q2eaOS)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed amount would be almost double of what the Wall
Street bank paid to the Securities and Exchange Commission in
2010 over similar issues. (reut.rs/1t0fepd)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and FHFA were not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and Morgan Stanley are also in preliminary
discussions with the U.S. Department of Justice about settling
allegations that they mis-sold MBS, the British newspaper
reported, citing three people with knowledge about the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its lawsuit, the FHFA said Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac bought $11.1 billion of mortgage-backed
securities from Goldman, unaware that "significant percentages
of the underlying mortgage loans... had materially poorer
credit quality than was represented in the registration
statements."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Bank of America Corp reached a $16.65
billion settlement with U.S. regulators to settle charges that
it misled investors into buying troubled mortgage-backed
securities.

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      (c) Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch does not rate the $12,604,000 class F, the $14,003,000 class G, 
      the $26,607,000 interest-only class X-D, the $35,010,270 interest-only 
      class X-E, and the $35,010,270 class NR. Fitch does not rate the 
      $15,099,000 class UHP, which will only receive distributions from, and 
      will only incur losses with respect to, the Trust Companion Loan related 
      to the U-Haul Self Storage Whole Loan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The class A-3A1 balance increased to $175,000,000 from $162,500,000 and 
      the class A-3A2 balance decreased to $75,000,000 from $87,500,000 since 
      Fitch published its presale report. Additionally, the class X-B was 
      withdrawn because it was removed from the transaction structure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 76 loans secured by 120 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.20 
      billion as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association; Barclays Bank PLC; 
      Starwood Mortgage Funding II LLC; and General Electric Capital 
      Corporation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 74.6% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis on 82%, and asset summary reviews on 82% of the pool.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction has a Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
      of 1.11x, a Fitch stressed loan-to-value (LTV) of 110.8%, and a Fitch 
      debt yield of 8.6%. Fitch's aggregate net cash flow represents a 
      variance of 9% to issuer cash flows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Higher Leverage than Recent Transactions: The pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV 
      are 1.11x and 110.8%, respectively, which is worse than the first-half 
      2014 and 2013 averages of 1.19x and 105.6% and 1.29x and 101.6%, 
      respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lower Loan Concentration: Loan concentration is lower than that of other 
      recent transactions. The largest loan represents 8% of the pool, and the 
      top 10 loans represent 47.3%. The average top 10 concentrations for 
      first-half 2014 and 2013 conduit transactions were 52.5% and 54.5%, 
      respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Limited Amortization: 12.9% of the pool is full-term interest-only, 
      59.2% of the pool is partial-term interest-only, and 3.4% of the pool is 
      fully amortizing. The remainder of the pool (31 loans, 24.5%) consists 
      of amortizing balloon loans with loan terms of five to 10 years. Based 
      on the scheduled balance at maturity, the pool will have paid down 14.9%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 8.8% below the 
      most recent net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a recent 
      NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this 
      period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could 
      result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans, and 
      could result in potential rating actions on the certificates. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to JPMBB 2014-C22 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity 
      to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a 
      further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' 
      certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, in 
      which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The master servicer will be Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, 
      rated 'CMS1-' by Fitch. The special servicer will be LNR Partners, LLC., 
      rated 'CSS1-' by Fitch.

      Research and Markets: Global Hodgkins Lymphoma Therapeutics Market 
      2014-2018: Bristol Myers Squibb, F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Merck  Co  
      Pfizer Dominate the Industry
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/gtf8vh/global_hodgkins) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Hodgkins Lymphoma Therapeutics Market 2014-2018" report to 
      their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Hodgkin's Lymphoma Therapeutics market will grow at a CAGR of 
      6.84 percent over the period 2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There has been an increase in awareness of Hodgkin's lymphoma among 
      patients and physicians. Enhanced patient and physician awareness is 
      expected to lead to earlier disease diagnosis and treatment. The 
      acceptability of Hodgkin's lymphoma drugs is expected to rise because of 
      the increasing public awareness. Raising general awareness about 
      Hodgkin's lymphoma has led to an increase in research funding and 
      support for clinical and support services. For instance, September 15 is 
      celebrated as WLAD by the LRF. The program was initiated to make people 
      more aware about both Hodgkin's lymphoma and NHL in terms of symptom 
      recognition, early diagnosis, and treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report the Global Hodgkin's Lymphoma Therapeutics 
      market is driven by several factors. One of the main drivers in this 
      market is the improved diagnostic techniques. Improved diagnostic 
      techniques have led to the treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma in an 
      aggressive way and have driven revenue growth in a positive direction. 
      Improvement in the diagnosis leads to the early detection and treatment 
      of the disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that the Global Hodgkin's Lymphoma 
      Therapeutics market is inhibited by some serious challenges. One of the 
      main challenges is the high cost of Hodgkin's lymphoma treatment. 
      Despite the numerous benefits, the high cost of treatment options 
      hinders the acceptability among patients. Many patients do not have the 
      required budget for investing in high-cost treatment options.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/v7x9vf/global_laundry) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Laundry Care Market 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Laundry Care market to grow at a CAGR of 5.03 percent over 
      the period 2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Laundry Care market can be segmented into four divisions: 
      Laundry Detergents, Fabric Softeners, Speciality Products, and Bleach. 
      These are sets of methodologies and technologies that transform 
      unstructured and structured data into meaningful and useful information 
      processes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the emerging trends in this market is increased demand for 
      laundry care products in developing countries. The increase in the 
      disposable income, change in lifestyle, and growth of the middle-class 
      population in these countries are expected to foster a demand for 
      laundry care products in the future.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, innovation and advances in technology have led 
      to the emergence of new laundry care products that offer multifunctional 
      benefits. Some products are designed to fulfil region-specific demands 
      of consumers, while others offer color protection, protect fabrics 
      against shrinkage, and provide extra cleaning power.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that stringent environmental laws and 
      regulations have made it difficult for manufacturers to survive in this

 (Updates to add link to graphics)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Elzio Barreto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Aug 22 (Reuters) - As Chinese banks prepare to
raise $55 billion in the country's first preferred share offers,
foreign investment banks with experience in structuring such
deals are ready to pounce on a potential $275 million in
underwriting fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And some are more ready than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was one of the first to spot the
potential in China for preferred shares, a form of hybrid
security which listed companies can sell to raise capital with
minimal dilution in the value of shares held by existing
stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While preferred share issues are prevalent in Europe and the
United States, China gave the green light for these securities
just last year to open more fund-raising avenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, the regulators opened the door for banks to issue
preferred shares in a bid to bolster the lenders' finances
against an expected rise in bad loans as the economy slows.
Banks also need funds to comply with the stricter capital
adequacy requirements under the global Basel III rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman moved one of its global experts on hybrid securities
to Asia five years ago to begin talks with Chinese clients. Now,
Goldman Sachs Gao Hua, the Wall Street bank's Chinese unit, is
among the underwriters on three deals - the biggest number among
its international peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that we were there several years ago...we didn't
just show up for the beauty parade," helped win the mandates,
said Dominique Jooris, Goldman's head of credit capital markets
in Asia ex-Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jooris, who is from Belgium, co-authored a book in Chinese
on preferred shares with Rita Chan, the bank's head of China
debt capital markets, titled "The Rise of Another Dragon: The
History and Opportunities in Hybrid Securities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Founder Securities, the Swiss bank's 
local joint venture, is on two deals and UBS Securities
 on one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six banks are planning to raise funds from preferred share
sales in the near future. Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co
Ltd is likely to be first, with a 30 billion yuan
($4.9 billion) issue, while the biggest planned issue is Bank of
China Ltd's 100 billion yuan private placement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies such as gas and coal mining firm Guanghui Energy
Co Ltd and China State Construction Engineering Corp
Ltd also have issuance plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first issuers are expected to be the banks, but then
there will be some interest from other corporate issuers as
well," said Antony Dapiran, a partner at law firm Davis Polk &amp;
Wardwell in Hong Kong. "It seems to be something that's gotten
some interest in the market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preferred shares have the characteristics of both debt and
equity, and typically don't trade on the open market or carry
any voting rights. China's regulator had stipulated that
preferred share issues to the public must not contain provisions
that allow these shares to be converted to common equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;QUITE A COUP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winning mandates for preferred share issues in China is
quite a coup for global banks in a market dominated by domestic
firms. Chinese investment banks have a virtual monopoly of local
capital markets, with no international bank among the top-10
underwriters of equity or bond deals so far this year. The
global firms' expertise in handling preferred share deals could
help them kick down that door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The international banks have the experience in doing these
in other markets, so they have an edge on the domestic banks,"
said a person involved in upcoming offerings who was not
authorized to speak publicly on the matter. "Domestic banks have
never seen or worked with anything like this before and don't
necessarily know how to market this to clients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with the international banks are Chinese brokerages
including Citic Securities and China International
Capital Corp (CICC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likely buyers include insurance firms and pension and hedge
funds, bankers and capital markets lawyers said, as well as
equity funds looking for a defensive bet through the shares'
regular coupon payments. Chinese trust companies may also be
interested, as they could repackage the preferred shares and
resell them to retail investors in small chunks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deals aren't likely to happen all at once, so the
underwriting fee pot is likely to be stretched over time.
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (ICBC),
for example, can issue its preferred shares over a 36-month
period. Because they're new, preferred share issues may also
take time to win regulatory approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment banking fees in Asia ex-Japan have risen more
than 15 percent to $6.8 billion so far this year, driven by an
increase in equity capital markets activity in China, according
to Thomson Reuters/Freeman Consulting Co estimates. Fees on
China equity deals have more than doubled to $1.83 billion as
initial public offerings resumed after a year-long hiatus.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, AB, Aug. 22, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via PRWEB - The first ORTC Public Draft Specification has been published, authored by Hookflash, Microsoft, and Google. (http://ortc.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/ortc.html ) 
This specification extends WebRTC 1.0 with new functionality to create a WebRTC 1.1 API with exceptional flexibility and no loss of compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like WebRTC, ORTC (Object Real-time Communication) enables plugin-free real-time communications for mobile, web and cloud, but is specifically tailored to provide the direct control needed to enable advanced multimedia and conferencing features. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We heard developers say that they wanted more direct control over the technologies available in WebRTC. At the same time, we didn't want existing developers to have to start over with a new API. ORTC is our proposal for how we can accomplish both of these things - a new set of APIs for direct control, that builds off the existing WebRTC 1.0 API set. As an evolution of the existing API, we consider this WebRTC 1.1" comments Justin Uberti, Google Tech Lead, WebRTC. "We're grateful to Hookflash for their work to get ORTC off the ground. They have been instrumental in making this cross-industry collaboration happen, and we look forward to continuing our work with them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This newly published public draft has come a long way since the W3C ORTC Community Group was formed in mid-2013. As it has progressed from an initial set of ideas to a fleshed-out draft complete enough for implementations, several companies have gotten closely involved, with Microsoft and Google now joining Hookflash as authors of the emerging specification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have been working hard to get the ORTC API to the point where it can be implemented. This would not have been possible without the initial and continuing work of Hookflash", commented Bernard Aboba, Principal Architect, Skype, "We also are excited by the ORTC API's support for advanced video features such as SVC (Scalable Video Coding) and simulcast.  The Javascript Object API approach has made these advanced video technologies more accessible, which has been difficult in the past."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The W3C ORTC Community Group now numbers more than 60 participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe the contributions to WebRTC 1.1 / ORTC will allow web communications technology to become ubiquitous and transcend nearly all communications technologies that came before it" says Hookflash Co-founder, Erik Lagerway, "We are honored to be working with some of the brightest minds at Google, Microsoft, and the other contributing members in the ORTC CG to mature WebRTC into a universal go-to toolkit enabling communications across the globe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on ORTC, see:

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China could have a new homegrown operating system by October to take on imported rivals such as Microsoft Corp, Google Inc and Apple Inc, Xinhua news agency said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer technology became an area of tension between China and the United States after a number of run-ins over cyber security. China is now looking to help its domestic industry catch up with imported systems such as Microsoft's Windows and Google's mobile operating system Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The operating system would first appear on desktop devices and later extend to smartphone and other mobile devices, Xinhua said, citing Ni Guangnan who heads an official OS development alliance established in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ni's comments were originally reported by the People's Post and Telecommunications News, an official trade paper run by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hope to launch a Chinese-made desktop operating system by October supporting app stores," Ni told the trade paper. Some Chinese OS already existed, but there was a large gap between China's technology and that of developed countries, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he hoped domestically built software would be able to replace desktop operating systems within one to two years and mobile operating systems within three to five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, China banned government use of Windows 8, Microsoft's latest operating system, a blow to the U.S. technology firm's business which raised fears China was moving to protect domestic firms. Microsoft is also under investigation for anti-trust violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March last year, China said that Google had too much control over China's smartphone industry via its Android mobile operating system and has discriminated against some local firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mutual suspicions between China and the United States over hacking have escalated over the past year following revelations by Edward Snowden that U.S. intelligence planted "backdoor" surveillance tools on U.S.-made hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department, meanwhile, indicted five Chinese military officers in May on counts of extensive industrial espionage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ni said the ban on Windows 8 was a big opportunity for the Chinese sector to push forward its own systems, but that the industry needed further development and investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Creating an environment that allows us to contend with Google, Apple and Microsoft - that is the key to success," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Adam Jourdan; Editing by Nick Macfie)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Edgemont Development Corporation Reports Second Quarter 2014 
      Results
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Edgemont Development Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) 
      announced today its results for the second quarter of 2014. Launched in 
      2011, the Corporation owns a 201.5-acre residential project in southwest 
      Edmonton, Alberta. The project is being developed in four phases and 
      marketed under the name &#8220;Woodhaven Edgemont.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The second quarter of 2014 saw continued progress on the project 
      including the installation of the underground utilities required for the 
      construction of the 199th Street arterial roadway and 
      completion of the stormwater outfall to Wedgewood Creek,&#8221; said Bill 
      Doherty, CEO of the Corporation. &#8220;This work was required so we can 
      deliver finished lots to home builders to meet the demand in the 
      Edmonton market.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Highlights for the Second Quarter
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the second quarter of 2014, the Corporation undertook the 
      following activities towards fulfilling its project plan:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        onsite landscaping in Phase 1;
      
			
        installed the underground utilities required for construction of the 
        199th Street arterial roadway;
      
			
        completed the construction of the stormwater outfall to Wedgewood 
        Creek;
      
			
        closed the competitive tenders for the offsite sanitary forcemain;
      
			
        closed the competitive tenders for the Edgemont Sanitary Pump Station;
      
			
        addressed comments received from the City of Edmonton on the 
        engineering drawings for Phase 2; and
      
			
        received comments from the City on the rezoning applications Phase 3 
        and Phase 4.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      From an overall timing perspective, the completion of Phase 1 is behind 
      the schedule initially anticipated by management and as disclosed in the 
      offering documents. The municipal approval process and construction 
      delays have contributed to third-party sales to date being behind 
      management&#8217;s initial expectations, which in turn, have impacted the 
      timing of lot absorptions and obtaining further lot commitments, and the 
      resulting collection of revenue from Phase 2.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The overall pricing strategy for the remainder of the project has been 
      revised to reflect the distinctive values created by the natural 
      amenities while remaining competitive with comparable communities in the 
      southwest sector of Edmonton. This has resulted in an increase in the 
      projected revenue and gross profit for the remaining lots that will be 
      developed in Phases 2, 3 and 4 compared to management&#8217;s initial 
      expectations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Second Quarter Financial Results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three months ended June 30, 2014, the Corporation recognized 
      revenue from lot sales of $nil and cost of sales relating to the lots 
      sold of $nil. This translated into a negative gross margin of $nil. The 
      revenue and cost of sales recognized during the three months ended June 
      30, 2013 was in respect of the sale of 45 lots for which the Corporation 
      received commitments for the first release of 91 Phase 1 lots (&#8220;Phase 
      1A&#8221;). The revenue recognition for those 45 lots was triggered by the 
      receipt of second deposits and substantial completion of onsite roads 
      for those lots. The Corporation also incurred other income/(expenses) 
      during the three months ended June 30, 2014 of ($253,364). The nature 
      and amount of expenses incurred during the three months ended June 30, 
      2014 were comparable to the total expenses incurred during the 
      comparative period. The overall net loss before tax of $253,364 was 
      partially offset by a deferred tax recovery of $63,341, resulting in an 
      overall net loss of $190,023.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the six months ended June 30, 2014, the Corporation recognized 
      revenue from lot sales of $nil and cost of sales relating to the lots 
      sold of $nil. This translated into a negative gross margin of $nil. The 
      revenue and cost of sales recognized during the six months ended June 
      30, 2013 were in respect of the sale of 66 lots for which the 
      Corporation received commitments for the first release of 91 Phase 1 
      lots (&#8220;Phase 1A&#8221;). The revenue recognition for those 66 lots was 
      triggered by the receipt of second deposits and substantial completion 
      of onsite roads for those lots. The Corporation also incurred other 
      income/(expenses) during the six months ended June 30, 2014 of 
      ($491,702). The nature and amount of expenses incurred during the six 
      months ended June 30, 2014 were comparable to the total expenses 
      incurred during the comparative period. The overall net loss before tax 
      of $491,702 was partially offset by a deferred tax recovery of $122,926, 
      resulting in an overall net loss of $368,776.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The negative gross margin recognized by the Corporation as well as the 
      construction delays experienced to date, are not consistent with 
      management&#8217;s initial expectations. Management has updated the pricing 
      strategy for the remainder of the project, which has resulted in an 
      increase in the projected revenue for the future lots that will be 
      developed in Phases 2, 3 and 4 when compared to management&#8217;s initial 
      expectations. This pricing strategy is supported by current market 
      prices and consumer demand in the sector.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Geotechnical information for Phase 2 indicates saturated soil conditions 
      similar to those being encountered in other areas of the overall 
      Edgemont neighbourhood. Management has completed additional site and 
      soil analysis to provide more detailed information on the conditions and 
      impact on the construction budget. The contracts for earthworks and 
      underground utility installation in Phase 2 were competitively tendered 
      to qualified contractors to obtain price quotations based on the 
      available information. The bids received exceeded the initial 
      construction cost assumptions for Phase 2 contained in the offering 
      documents.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Greater cost certainty has been obtained on the anticipated costs for 
      constructing the remaining offsite infrastructure. Notwithstanding the 
      negotiation of contracts for 199th Street and competitive 
      tendering for the offsite sanitary forcemain and Edgemont Sanitary Lift 
      Station, the current budget for offsite infrastructure exceeds the 
      original cost assumptions used by management in preparing the offering 
      documents. As of August 19, 2014, the total forecasted increases in hard 
      construction costs and soft costs, before financing and net of 
      recoveries, are $31.7 million and $5.6 million, respectively. 
      Discussions are taking place with the builders regarding Phase 2 lot 
      commitments, based on the new pricing strategy and terms. As a result, 
      commencement of construction in Phase 2 has been delayed until 
      commitments for the lots have been secured.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Based on the current anticipated timing for the release of Phase 2 and 
      the current pace of third-party sales, collection of the revenue for the 
      final phase of the project, including recoveries, is not anticipated 
      until 2018 based on the anticipated timing for receipt of recoveries for 
      the last phase of development. This represents an additional two years 
      for completion of the project when compared to the original six-year 
      time frame as disclosed in the offering documents and an additional year 
      when compared to the seven-year timeframe previously reported.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The combined impact of these factors is a change in the timing and 
      amount of cash distributions when compared to the original assumptions. 
      As identified in the first quarter news release, delays in construction 
      related approvals, builder lot absorptions and related revenue 
      collection, coupled with increased construction costs, were expected 
      to&#160;result in a downward revision to the internal rate of return (&#8220;IRR&#8221;) 
      from the projected 13.5% disclosed in the offering documents. Based on 
      management&#8217;s best information as at the end of Q2 2014, the currently 
      forecasted IRR is 6.25%. This IRR is based on achieving certain revenue 
      targets, maintaining construction schedules, timely receipt of 
      recoveries from benefiting developments, third party sales and 
      commitment for additional lots from the builders. Further changes to the 
      IRR projection could occur due to changes in the aforementioned and 
      other factors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Management is continuing to explore and implement options and strategies 
      to reduce costs, increase revenues and accelerate absorptions, including 
      advancing preliminary design of the remaining phases to obtain greater 
      certainty on the servicing costs and provide an opportunity for 
      additional builders to participate in the project.

      Walton Yellowhead Development Corporation ReportsSecond Quarter 
      2014 Results
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Yellowhead Development Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) 
      announced today the Corporation&#8217;s results for the second quarter of 
      2014. Launched in 2011, the Corporation was formed to provide investors 
      with the opportunity to participate in the acquisition and development 
      of the 133.68-acre Yellowhead Industrial Park (the &#8220;Property&#8221;) 
      located in the Winterburn Industrial Park, in northwest Edmonton, 
      Alberta.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As previously reported, on April 30, 2014, the Corporation completed the 
      sale of its entire right, title and interest in the Property for a total 
      cash consideration of $36,677,800 and the assumption of the project debt 
      in the amount of $5,528,982 for a total of $42,206,782. The Property was 
      purchased by Yellowhead Lands Limited Partnership owned 85% by the 
      Canada Pension Plan Investment Board; 7.5 % by WAM Development Group, an 
      arm&#8217;s length third-party; and 7.5% by Walton International Group Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For those investors who acquired 8%, unsecured, subordinated, 
      convertible, extendable debentures and Class B non-voting common shares 
      of the Corporation (the &#8220;Class B Shares&#8221;) under its prospectus 
      offering in 2011 (the &#8220;Prospectus Offering&#8221;), the sale 
      represents, as of April 30, 2014, a net internal rate of return of 
      approximately 8.8% and a realization multiple of approximately 1.2 
      times, based on the offering price of those securities issued under the 
      Prospectus Offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On May 12, 2014, the Corporation used the cash proceeds, together with 
      its existing assets, to repay in full the principal amount of, and 
      accrued interest on, all of its issued and outstanding debentures 
      (including those interest debentures issued to satisfy the Corporation&#8217;s 
      obligation to pay interest on previously issued debentures).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the Prospectus Offering, investors acquired units of the 
      Corporation at a price of $10.00 per unit, with each unit comprised of a 
      $7.50 principal amount debenture and one Class B Share at a price of 
      $2.50. The distributions on the debentures were equal to $9.07 per 
      debenture, which is comprised of the original principal amount of $7.50 
      and $1.57 in interest on the debenture. For the Class B Shares, 
      investors received a $3.01 per Class B Share distribution. Total 
      distributions to investors were $12.08 per $10.00 unit.

      During the three months ended June 30, 2014, the Corporation recognized 
      revenue from the sale of the Property of $42,206,782 and cost of sales 
      relating to the sold Property of $36,773,071. This translated into a 
      gross margin of $5,433,711. The Corporation also incurred total other 
      expenses of $178,787. The total expenses primarily consisted of 
      debenture interest of $75,046, $44,289 in costs for the management of 
      the Corporation, and $32,549 in servicing fees. The net income before 
      tax of $5,254,924 was partially offset by a tax expense of $1,318,126 
      resulting in a net income of $3,936,798.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) has been searching for up to $1.5 billion of equity investment to help develop its Duvernay shale formation assets in Canada and contacted potential investors including private equity firms, according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron&#8217;s subsidiary, Chevron Canada Limited, has exploration leases for approximately 330,000 net acres (1,335 square km) in the Duvernay shale formation. The area is located about 124 miles (200 km) northwest of Edmonton, Alberta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The San Ramon, California-based oil and gas company has sent an offering memorandum to potential investors over the summer, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because oil and gas developments take many years to generate a return for their investors, Chevron was looking for an equity investor with a long-term investment horizon, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A representative for Chevron declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron announced in October that its initial exploration of the Kaybob area of the Duvernay shall formation was complete. At the time, the company said the next step was transitioning to a two-rig drilling program to optimize well and completion design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A potential equity injection would help Chevron diffuse the development risk for the next phase of the project. Chevron commenced an exploration program in the Duvernay in 2011 and, as of August 2014, had drilled 15 wells, completed 13 using multi-stage hydraulic fracturing, and tied in 10 wells to existing third-party processing facilities. Hydraulic fracturing is more expensive than traditional extraction methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some private equity firms had looked at the opportunity to provide an equity investment into the Duvernay project, but may not ultimately partner with Chevron because of the long investment horizon, according to the people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has recently bulked up its acreage in the Duvernay by 20 percent. In August, the company purchased the interests of Alta Energy Luxembourg, which had nearly 68,000 acres. New York-based private equity firm Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) was an investor in Alta Energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other lease owners in the Duvernay shale formation include Penn West Petroleum Ltd (PWT.TO), Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) and Athabasca Oil Corp (ATH.TO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting By Mike Stone in New York)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* U.S. shale gas boom to increase global LNG supply&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Wary Asian buyers hold off on long-term contracts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Chevron has contracts for only 65 pct of $54 bln Gorgon
output&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Oleg Vukmanovic  and Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MILAN/SINGAPORE, Aug 26 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Chevron
is struggling to lock-in 20-year sales contracts for its Gorgon
liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant in Australia, the
world's most expensive, as buyers spoiled for choice by new
suppliers hold out for cheaper deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high level of unsold LNG shows how the U.S. shale gas
boom has played havoc with major investments now coming to
fruition in Australia, and threatens to undermine the industry's
traditional sales model where projects tie up forward sales in
long-term contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly $200 billion worth of gas projects are nearing
completion in Australia, with seven LNG projects due to start
exporting gas between late 2014 and 2017, making the country the
world's largest producer of the fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as Gorgon, other projects include BG Group's 
Curtis Island, Conoco and Origin's Australia
Pacific, Inpex's Ichthys, Shell's Prelude and
Santos' Gladstone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with LNG exports from the United States due to begin
next year, buyers are more cautious about locking in 20-25 year
contracts. For the Australian mega-projects, already stung by
soaring costs, this means more uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Buyers are being very cautious about firming up long-term
import deals, especially since U.S. prices are undercutting
Australian projects coming onstream around the same time," said
a source at a large Asian LNG seller, who asked not to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a lot of confusion about which are the best deals
given there are so many pricing options on offer from different
regions," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a price-tag of $54 billion, Chevron's Gorgon project is
expected to start up in mid-2015 but has so far locked in sales
for just 65 percent of its share of capacity, which leaves it
highly exposed to the risk of falls in the spot price. Chevron
intends to trade its unsold long-term output on the spot market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the huge cost of development, LNG project backers
usually look to lock in contracts for at least 85 percent of
production, guaranteeing a fixed return for the bulk of their
output. Gorgon has locked in sales with Japanese utilities
including Tokyo Gas and Chubu Electric, which
have both stakes in the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the degree of uncertainty that there is about U.S.
exports and the size of U.S. exports, I think you can understand
why buyers might want to wait a little bit to see how that all
lands out before going forward to secure longer-term contracts,"
Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pat Yarrington told a recent
briefing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the company acknowledged the difficulties it faced,
saying it would prefer to move buyers to a longer-term sales
contract "if we get the right kind of pricing," according to
George Kirkland, executive vice-president of the upstream gas
division. Chevron declined further comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISING DEMAND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron initially planned to sell at least 85 percent of
Gorgon output to long-term customers, betting that rising demand
in the world's biggest LNG consumer, Asia, would keep prices
high enough to pay back project costs, originally pegged at $37
billion in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two events radically changed that calculation. An
unconventional drilling boom has transformed the United States
into the world's top natural gas producer and opened the door to
substantial exports of LNG - already deals have been signed to
sell in excess of 30 million tonnes of U.S. LNG, equal to about
a third of Japan's annual imports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wave of new supply globally is also weighing on long-term
prices, at a time when Asian demand growth is slowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's prediction that global LNG demand will almost
double by 2025 - requiring more than 100 million tonnes of new
supply - may be true, but will not guarantee it an easy ride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facing the same problem, rival Woodside Petroleum Ltd, which
is developing the Browse floating LNG project in Australia,
 is building an LNG trading business, including a
20-year deal to buy U.S. LNG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim is to be able to supply customers with LNG from any
source - rather than just its own fields - and with a range of
pricing models, keeping the company from having to sign
long-term contracts at the bottom of the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The best way to protect the value of these projects, in
fact, is to not be at the mercy of when buyers are able to sign
up," Woodside CEO Peter Coleman said this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPOT PRICES SLUMP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability of producers is reflected in a near 50
percent price fall for Asian spot cargoes in recent months to
three-and-a-half year lows, which has taken spot LNG well below
long-term oil-linked contracts and surprised many industry
players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It doesn't look to be so rosy in the near term as they
originally thought," said a Singapore-based LNG trader,
referring to large Australian export projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(But) over the longer term, selling those volumes on the
spot market may still end up being a sensible move," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others, however, expect spot prices to trend even lower or
at least remain bogged down as new U.S. and Australian LNG
supplies hit the market from next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Producers think they can actually buy their own LNG, resell
it on the spot market and make money. I think that's a very
naive way of thinking," said Vivek Chandra, chief executive at
U.S.-based Texas LNG, which aims to begin exports of 2 million
tonnes a year to Asia in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reluctance of buyers to enter into long-term contracts
may also have implications for projects still on the drawing
board in Australia, where another $180 billion of new or
expanded LNG projects from 2018 onwards is being considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Going ahead, we don't see any planned Australian projects
or expansions based on our analysis. Nothing. Not one," said
Noelle Leonard, an LNG consultant at FG Energy in Perth.

      Fitch: Goldman Sachs' FHFA Settlement Neutral for Credit Ratings
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The mortgage settlement between Goldman Sachs and the Federal Housing 
      Finance Agency (FHFA) conforms to the recent pattern of lawsuit 
      settlements made by large global banks, and Fitch Ratings says the 
      payment will have no impact on Goldman Sachs' ratings ('A'/'F1' with a 
      Stable Outlook).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of the settlement, Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $3.15 billion to 
      repurchase mortgage-backed securities from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, 
      which will make them whole on their investments. The economic value of 
      the settlement is estimated at $1.2 billion, which reflects the 
      difference between the $3.15 billion cash payment and the GSEs' net 
      carrying value of the securities repurchased, which Goldman will be able 
      to sell at a later date.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The approximate value of the settlement represents between 10%-11% of 
      the original face value of affected mortgage-backed securities, which is 
      roughly in line with other institutions that have recently settled. 
      Goldman Sachs has already largely reserved for this payment. The FHFA 
      settlement puts a key source of legal uncertainty behind Goldman Sachs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sixteen of the FHFA's suits against large financial institutions have 
      now been settled, with three cases remaining. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 
      have booked sizable litigation gains related to the FHFA suits in 
      second-half 2013 and year-to-date 2014. The gains are effectively 
      remitted to the U.S. Treasury under the terms of the net worth sweep 
      agreement between Treasury and GSEs.

NEW YORK, August 25 (Fitch) The mortgage settlement between

will make them whole on their investments.  The economic value
of the settlement 
is estimated at $1.2 billion, which reflects the difference
between the $3.15 
billion cash payment and the GSEs' net carrying value of the

			JPMorgan Chase  Co. Announces Water Investment Partnership With The 
      Water Council
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. and The Water Council today announced a partnership 
      to bring together North America's investment community and water 
      technology entrepreneurs to match capital with water innovation. The 
      partnership includes a $225,000 grant from JPMorgan Chase as part of the 
      company's recently launched Small Business Forward initiative&#8212;a 
      national, five-year, $30 million grant program meant to boost small 
      business support networks that help growing enterprises in specific 
      industries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With the grant, The Water Council will identify investment firms that 
      are interested in exploring water technology investments, prepare water 
      investment training information and conduct an investor conference with 
      entrepreneurs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our company recognizes the growing importance of water not only in the 
      United States, but across the world, and we believe that many of the 
      solutions to those issues will be derived from the small businesses that 
      are being developed by The Water Council,&#8221; said James R. Popp, president 
      of Chase in Wisconsin. &#8220;It was only natural for Chase to combine its 
      support for American small businesses with America&#8217;s leading water 
      technology cluster.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Water Council leads the country in its support and development of 
      water technology entrepreneurs, as proven through the creation of the 
      Global Water Center and The BREW program,&#8221; stated Wisconsin Governor 
      Scott Walker. &#8220;Through the generous support of JPMorgan Chase we can now 
      add one vital element to our toolbox&#8212;the growth of private sector 
      investments in the burgeoning water technology industry.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Water Council, established in 2009 by Milwaukee-area businesses, 
      education and government leaders, is the only organization of its kind 
      in the United States. The Water Council takes great pride in having 
      coalesced one of the most powerful water technology clusters in the 
      world. Today, The Water Council links global water technology companies 
      and small businesses, innovative water entrepreneurs, acclaimed academic 
      research programs and some of the world's most talented water technology 
      professionals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Water Council and the city of Milwaukee are capturing the attention 
      of the world as we quickly transform the region into a world water hub 
      for freshwater economic development, research and education,&#8221; said 
      Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett. &#8220;The significant investment by a global 
      company such as JPMorgan Chase sends a clear message to the nation and 
      the world that Milwaukee is the place to bring together water technology 
      businesses and the investment community.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Through the support of JPMorgan Chase, The Water Council will 
      look to expand the water investment program nationally and 
      internationally. The partnership will help to advance The Water 
      Council's vision of being the globally connected epicenter of freshwater 
      research, innovation, education and business development; drive economic 
      development in Milwaukee; enable water technology companies to 
      strengthen and grow their businesses; and ultimately help address 
      pressing global water issues.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Water Council is honored to be able to announce this unique 
      partnership with JPMorgan Chase, and support our next development as a 
      global leader to bring together small water technology businesses and 
      investors,&#8221; said Rich Meeusen, co-founder and co-chair of The Water 
      Council and chairman, president and CEO of Badger Meter. &#8220;We have made 
      great strides in fostering an environment of water entrepreneurship. 
      Now, through the support of JPMorgan Chase, we can educate and connect 
      the investment community with innovative businesses working to solve 
      global water issues.&#8221;

			La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company Announces First Patient Enrolled in 
      Clinical Trial of LJPC-501 in Hepatorenal Syndrome
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			La 
      Jolla Pharmaceutical Company (NASDAQ: LJPC), a leader in the 
      development of innovative therapies intended to significantly improve 
      outcomes in patients suffering from life-threatening diseases, today 
      announced that the first patient has been enrolled in the Phase 1/2 
      clinical trial of LJPC-501 
      for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 hepatorenal 
      syndrome (HRS). HRS is a life-threatening form of progressive renal 
      failure in patients with liver cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are very grateful to the investigator, the patient and the patient&#8217;s 
      family,&#8221; said George Tidmarsh, M.D., Ph.D., La Jolla&#8217;s President and 
      Chief Executive Officer. &#8220;We believe that LJPC-501, which helps the 
      kidneys balance body fluids and electrolytes, may improve kidney 
      function in patients with HRS. For many patients with HRS, reduced 
      kidney function is the major debilitating aspect of their illness.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The clinical trial is an open-label, multi-center study of LJPC-501 in 
      patients with type 1 and/or type 2 HRS.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The trial is designed to enroll up to 15 patients with type 1 or type 2 
      HRS. The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability. Secondary 
      endpoints include determining the maximum tolerated dose and the effects 
      of LJPC-501 on serum creatinine through 5 days of treatment. Patients 
      will receive LJPC-501 at titrated doses, with a starting range from 1 to 
      100 ng/kg/min, by continuous infusion on days 1 through 5. Dose 
      titrations will occur every 4 hours until a mean arterial pressure of 
      110 mmHg is reached, maximum urine output is achieved or a dose of 100 
      ng/kg/min is achieved. Dosing will then continue at such maximum dose 
      through day 5.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Hepatorenal Syndrome
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a life-threatening form of progressive 
      renal failure in patients with liver cirrhosis. In these patients, the 
      diseased liver secretes vasodilator substances (e.g., nitric oxide and 
      prostaglandins) into the bloodstream that cause under-filling of blood 
      vessels. This low blood pressure state causes a reduction in blood flow 
      to the kidneys. As a means to restore systemic blood pressure, the 
      kidneys induce both sodium and water retention, which contribute to 
      ascites, a major complication associated with HRS.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About LJPC-501
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      LJPC-501, a proprietary formulation of angiotensin II, is a peptide 
      agonist of the renin-angiotensin system that acts to stabilize blood 
      pressure. La Jolla is developing LJPC-501 for the treatment of 
      catecholamine-resistant hypotension (CRH), which is an acute, 
      life-threatening condition in which blood pressure drops to dangerously 
      low levels and is poorly responsive to current treatments. LJPC-501 has 
      been shown to raise blood pressure in a randomized, placebo-controlled 
      clinical trial in CRH, as well as animal models of hypotension. La Jolla 
      plans to initiate a Phase 3 registration program with LJPC-501 in the 
      treatment of CRH as the result of a recent meeting with the U.S. Food 
      and Drug Administration (FDA) at which agreement was reached that blood 
      pressure could serve as an appropriate primary endpoint for approval. 
      Due to the estimated size of the patient population in the United States 
      for this indication, La Jolla has filed an application for Orphan Drug 
      status for LJPC-501. Studies have shown that LJPC-501 may also improve 
      renal function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).
    &lt;/p&gt;

			About La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company is a biopharmaceutical company focused 
      on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative 
      therapies intended to significantly improve outcomes in patients 
      suffering from life-threatening diseases. LJPC-501, La Jolla&#8217;s lead 
      product candidate, is a proprietary formulation of angiotensin II for 
      the potential treatment of catecholamine-resistant hypotension and 
      hepatorenal syndrome. GCS-100, La Jolla&#8217;s second product candidate, is a 
      first-in-class inhibitor of galectin-3 for the potential treatment of 
      chronic kidney disease. LJPC-1010, La Jolla&#8217;s third product candidate, 
      is a more potent and purified derivative of GCS-100 that can be 
      delivered orally for the potential treatment of nonalcoholic 
      steatohepatitis. LJPC-401, La Jolla&#8217;s fourth product candidate, is a 
      natural peptide for the potential treatment of iron overload. For more

      Research and Markets: Global IT Asset Management Software Market Report 
      2014-2018 - BMC Software, CA Technologies, HP  IBM Dominates the 
      Industry
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/3fq93q/global_it_asset) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      IT Asset Management Software Market 2014-2018" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global IT Asset Management Software market will grow at a CAGR of 
      6.69% to 2018
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      An increase in the adoption of hybrid deployment model is one of the 
      trends likely to emerge in this market. It is expected that some 
      companies will shift from cloud-based models to hybrid models so that 
      they can host critical applications on private clouds and applications 
      with relatively few security concerns on the public cloud. Hybrid cloud 
      computing helps enterprises to achieve maximum usability while 
      minimizing the number of faults and the need for constant internet 
      connectivity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers in this market is 
      increased demand for subscription-based IT asset management solutions. 
      The emergence of SaaS-based solutions has enabled organizations to 
      increase their efficiency and reduce the cost of deploying IT 
      infrastructure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges in this 
      market is the high deployment and maintenance costs. The deployment of 
      IT asset management software is an expensive process, the requirements 
      are defined narrowly, and implementation of traditional IT asset 
      management software takes a very long time which increases the 
      criticality of the process. It also requires expensive additional 
      infrastructure, complex programming, and extra time and money to ensure 
      data integration and data quality.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Rising demand in the mortgage market is one of the emerging trends in 
      the market. Volume in mortgage domain will continue to increase because 
      of the several acts such as HARP and HARP II.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, several factors drive the growth of the Global 
      Outsourcing market in BFS sector, one of which is cost-effectiveness. 
      High-quality service at low cost is the main criteria for outsourcing 
      services. The low cost of labor in many developing economies is driving

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that data security is one of the serious 
      challenges that the market faces. Outsourcing of services means

&lt;p&gt;(Updates headline and text with company confirmation of planned
work)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Aug 26 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp has
shut a gasoline-making fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) at
its 560,500 barrels-per-day (bpd) refinery in Baytown, Texas,
for "several weeks" of planned work, the company confirmed on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Planned maintenance at the refinery's FCCU is expected to
continue for the next several weeks," spokesman Nicholas Scinta
said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy market information firm IIR Energy had reported
earlier that the company started shutting down a 125,000 bpd
FCCU and a 21,000 bpd alkylation unit this week for 35 days of
planned work. Exxon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The duration of that work is within the norm for FCCU
turnarounds, which generally last 35 to 48 days, according to a
person familiar with the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy intelligence firm Genscape reported earlier on
Tuesday that the FCCU showed decreased activity, with
intermittent flaring seen from two flare towers near the unit
since Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Gulf Coast cash gasoline differentials were higher on
Tuesday, but traders largely attributed the difference to 
prompt trade switching to October RBOB futures on the New York
Mercantile Exchange rather than the Baytown turnaround, which
had been anticipated.

			Announcing Virtualize, JPR&#8217;s Remote Graphics and Virtualization 
      Conference
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Big players, big potential&#8212;big challenges?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In response to a recent survey of end users and managers regarding their 
      interest and knowledge of remote graphics, remote workstations and 
      virtualized computing, Jon Peddie Research (JPR), the industry's 
      research and consulting firm for graphics and multimedia, has announced 
      Virtualize, the company&#8217;s first conference on the subject of Remote 
      Graphics and Virtualization (RGV) as it applies to businesses both 
      large and small.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Based on the results of our survey, there is clearly a lot of confusion 
      over this nascent category, which is not too unusual given its relative 
      newness,&#8221; said Dr. Jon Peddie, president of JPR. &#8220;However, interest in 
      the ability to collaborate and work anywhere at any time on any machine 
      with a full database is enormous.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Virtualize Conference, October 30 at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco 
      Airport, is designed to give real-world guidance to industry 
      professionals who are looking for ways to achieve more efficiency, 
      productivity and resource management in their organizations through the 
      use of virtualization technologies. The conference will feature talks 
      and panel discussions from people who are making virtualization work in 
      their organizations including large engineering operations such as 
      Boeing and GE, entertainment companies such as Dreamworks and ILM 
      working with huge data sets, and in small and medium businesses who want 
      to make better use of their resources. .Security is also a critical 
      interest for all of these companies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Leveraging Virtualization for Any Size Business
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Virtualization is becoming commonplace in the enterprise, as large 
      companies optimize and manage their resources but there are more 
      benefits to be realized from using Remote Graphics and Virtualization 
      for high-end computing. Professionals in a wide range of companies can 
      now take advantage of virtualization techniques for specialized tasks 
      such as engineering, design, analysis, rendering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additionally, IT professionals would like to extend their resources to 
      enable their users to access more resources when needed. But, in many 
      cases, there&#8217;s a great deal of uncertainty about how best to take 
      advantage of new technology. As JPR&#8217;s survey has indicated people are 
      not sure what they can do, and they don&#8217;t know where to start.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      JPR&#8217;s Conference will provide an overview of virtualization options, 
      hands-on explanations from experienced users and detailed descriptions 
      of the products and configurations available for different work flows. 
      In addition the conference will also take a look down the road to 
      describe what&#8217;s happening in the future, and how best to evaluate new 
      technology and prepare for implementation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Virtualize Conference will be beneficial for both principals who are 
      setting the strategic direction for their organization as well as for 
      early adopters responsible for implementation. Early bird registration 
      is open now through September 5, 2014 for $199 at https://www.regonline.com/Builder/site/tab1.aspx?EventID=1581461.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Aug 26 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp began
shutting down a 125,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) fluid catalytic
cracking unit (FCCU) and a 21,000 bpd alkylation unit this week
for planned work at its 560,500 bpd refinery in Baytown, Texas,
according to energy market information firm IIR Energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IIR said on Tuesday that the shutdown began on Monday and
the work would last 35 days. The maintenance was planned, and
the duration is within the norm for FCC turnarounds, which
generally last 35 to 48 days, according to a person familiar
with the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil didn not immediately respond to requests for
comment on the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy intelligence firm Genscape reported earlier on
Tuesday that the FCCU showed decreased activity, with
intermittent flaring seen from two flare towers near the unit
since Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Gulf Coast cash gasoline differentials were higher on
Tuesday, but traders largely attributed the difference to 
prompt trade switching to October RBOB futures on the New York
Mercantile Exchange rather than the Baytown turnaround, which
had been anticipated.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ann Inc (ANN.N) has hired JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) to explore strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the women's retailer, according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hiring of an investment bank comes as the Ann Taylor owner, best known for its women's suits and office wear, faces pressure from hedge funds Engine Capital LP and Red Alder LLC to consider selling itself to a private equity firm or a large international retailer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Ann were up as much as 7.6 percent and rose 6 percent at $42.33 at midday Tuesday, giving it a market capitalization of more than $1.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock topped $40 per share on Monday after the hedge funds, which together control more than 1 percent of the stock, said the company could be worth $50 to $55 per share to a potential buyer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives for Ann and JPMorgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, private equity firm Golden Gate Capital took a 9.5 percent stake in Ann, saying the stock was undervalued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second quarter, Ann reported earnings of 70 cents per share, down from 76 cents in the same quarter a year earlier. The company also cut its annual sales outlook.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ann's margins have been hurt by increased in-store promotions across the retail industry, the company said on its earnings call. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ann operates 1,040 Ann Taylor, Ann Taylor Factory, Loft and Loft Outlet stores in 47 states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Olivia Oran and Soyoung Kim in New York; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

			CJPS Medical Systems Licenses Telemonitoring Technology to Enhance 
      its Intellectual Property Portfolio and Product Offering
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CJPS Medical Systems announced today that it has licensed a powerful 
      technology developed at the University of Rochester (Rochester, NY) used 
      with CJPS&#8217; Remote Patient Monitoring system, VitalPoint&#174; HOME (www.VitalPointHOME.com).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This U.S. Patent No. 6,612,985 is entitled &#8220;Method and System for 
      Monitoring and Treating a Patient&#8221;. It covers a method, a system and 
      a computer processor, each focused on tracking compliance with 
      caregivers&#8217; treatment guidelines for home patients. This compliance is 
      based on a patient&#8217;s current assessment of diagnosed conditions and on 
      data about each of the diagnosed conditions from the remotely located 
      patient.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "We are very pleased to have licensed this breakthrough technology to 
      enhance, protect and support VitalPoint&#174; HOME, our home telemonitoring 
      system, a state-of the-art solution that has provided exceptional value 
      to our customers for years," says C. Sevrain, President of CJPS Medical 
      Systems. "Our products, built in Michigan and in Arizona, provide 
      disruptive technologies, with unparalleled value, especially for 
      organizations looking at reducing hospital readmissions, providing 
      better care to chronically-ill patients, improving their efficiency, and 
      generating new revenues," he adds.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			VitalPoint&#174; 
      Home is a breakthrough remote patient monitoring system 
      which has been displacing the competition due to its high patient 
      compliance, its ease of use, connectivity, unmatched features and price 
      point. It is a critical tool to reduce or even eliminate hospital 
      readmissions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Just one small VitalPoint&#174; 
      Home monitor is able to measure blood pressure, blood oxygen 
      saturation, pulse rate, weight, glucose level, prothrombin time and 
      ratios, temperature, fluid status, and provide electrocardiogram data, 
      and even allows live audio video streaming between caregivers and their 
      patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The monitor also provides the caregiver with the ability to remotely 
      monitor patients&#8217; conditions or alerts using their own computer, IPad, 
      tablets, or smart phone.

&lt;p&gt;Aug 26 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc on Tuesday said it
will test its Xalkori lung cancer drug with Merck &amp; Co's 
experimental immunotherapy pembrolizumab, in hopes the
combination will improve the outcomes for patients taking the
approved Pfizer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xalkori, which has annual sales of $400 million and is also
known by its chemical name crizotinib, was approved in 2011 for
lung cancer patients who have a specific mutation in the
so-called ALK gene, as determined by an approved diagnostic
test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mutation only occurs in a small percentage of patients
with non small cell lung cancer, the most common form of lung
cancer, but makes them good candidates for treatment with
Xalkori.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pembrolizumab, by contrast, works by removing the brakes
from the immune system, allowing it to detect and destroy cancer
cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The differing mechanisms of action from combination therapy
are meant to deliver a one-two punch to cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Merck drug, called a PD-1 inhibitor, is expected to be
approved within months in the United States and to become a
blockbuster treatment for melanoma, and possibly later for lung
cancer and other types of cancer, depending on results of
ongoing clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merck is not studying pembrolizumab in combination with its
own experimental drugs, but does have studies underway with
other drugmakers, including Amgen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merck is also conducting a study of the PD-1 drug in
combination with its older melanoma drug Sylatron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Bernadette Baum)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Adds analyst comment)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Gerry Shih&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BEIJING Aug 26 (Reuters) - Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China (ICBC) has deployed a new IBM 
mainframe computer system, the two companies said on Tuesday,
boosting the U.S. technology giant's credentials in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's joint announcement with ICBC, the world's largest bank
by market capitalisation, shows IBM is still doing business with
China's state-owned banks despite widely circulated media
reports in May that suggested China's central government had
ordered banks to remove IBM equipment because of cybersecurity
concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. company's efforts to repair any public relations
damage have included the announcement in recent weeks of a
string of deals in China to assure investors of its future in
the market and salvage its reputation with other potential
Chinese buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement released only in Chinese, ICBC chief
technology officer Lin Xiaoxuan said that ICBC was the first
bank in mainland China to introduce IBM mainframes 30 years ago
and that they have since played an "important role" in the
bank's IT operations".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM mainframes have consistently helped us keep our IT
systems steady and safe and will continue to do so in the
future," Lin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ICBC's newly deployed mainframe, which was purchased from
IBM several months ago, allows sensitive financial data to be
routed around the world in the event of a crash at one of its 40
global branches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BAN REPORTS 'OVERBLOWN'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beijing-based Forrester analyst Gene Cao said that the
Chinese government would like to reduce its banks' dependence on
foreign technology but added that his conversations with IT
officials at large banks lead him to believe that the reports
about an IBM ban were overblown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These officials have expressed concern that the outcry to
push out IOE - the moniker in China for Western tech giants IBM,
Oracle and EMC - could hamper their business, Cao said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Perpetuating rumours that there's a ban on IOE would pose a
risk for the banks, too, and I don't think they necessarily want
that," Cao added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM Greater China Chief D.C. Chien told the state-run China
Daily newspaper in a recent interview that local banks have
continued to purchase its products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM additionally announced this week that it would team up

April that sales in China had fallen by 20 percent, echoing
disappointing results from many U.S. technology companies that
suffered plummeting sales in China after revelations by Edward
Snowden of extensive U.S. government spying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an unexpected development, Inspur, a Chinese rival to IBM
that marketed itself as a more secure option for Chinese banks,
announced this week that it will sell its high-end K1 server

			Pfizer And Merck To Collaborate On Study Evaluating Novel Anti-Cancer 
      Combination Regimen
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Agreement to Combine Merck&#8217;s Investigational Anti-PD-1 Antibody 
      Pembrolizumab and Pfizer&#8217;s Crizotinib (XALKORI&#174;) in 
      Clinical Trial
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Merck  Co. Inc. (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD 
      outside the United States and Canada, through a subsidiary, announced 
      today that they have entered into an agreement to explore the 
      therapeutic potential of the combination of Pfizer&#8217;s crizotinib (XALKORI&#174;) 
      with Merck&#8217;s investigational anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab, in a 
      Phase 1b clinical study evaluating the safety and tolerability of the 
      combination in patients with ALK-positive advanced or metastatic 
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The financial terms of the agreement 
      were not disclosed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This collaboration between Pfizer and Merck is just one example of the 
      willingness of sponsors to work together in an effort to accelerate 
      progress against some of the most difficult-to-treat cancers,&#8221; said Dr. 
      Mace Rothenberg, senior vice president of Clinical Development and 
      Medical Affairs and chief medical officer for Pfizer Oncology. 
      &#8220;Understanding the effects of combining one drug, XALKORI, which 
      inhibits an abnormally activated enzyme in patients with ALK-positive 
      metastatic lung cancer, with the investigational drug, pembrolizumab, 
      which harnesses the body&#8217;s immune system to fight cancer, is vital if we 
      are to continue to advance the care of lung cancer patients.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This multi-center, open-label clinical study is expected to begin in 
      2015. Pfizer will conduct the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are pleased to build upon our ongoing collaboration with Pfizer to 
      evaluate potential combination regimens incorporating Merck&#8217;s 
      investigational immunotherapy pembrolizumab,&#8221; said Dr. Eric Rubin, vice 
      president, Oncology, Merck Research Laboratories. &#8220;Evidence from early 
      studies of pembrolizumab monotherapy together with XALKORI&#8217;s proven 
      targeted therapeutic approach provides the scientific rationale for 
      evaluating this combination for the treatment of lung cancer.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Both companies previously announced plans to evaluate the safety and 
      efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with Pfizer&#8217;s small molecule 
      kinase inhibitor axitinib (INLYTA&#174;) in patients with renal 
      cell carcinoma. Separately, pembrolizumab plus Pfizer&#8217;s PF-05082566 
      (PF-2566), an investigational immuno-oncology agent that targets the 
      human 4-1BB receptor, will be evaluated in multiple cancer types. These 
      studies are expected to begin enrollment later this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Pembrolizumab
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) is an investigational, humanized, monoclonal 
      antibody against PD-1 designed to reactivate anti-tumor immunity. 
      Pembrolizumab exerts dual ligand blockade of the PD-1 pathway by 
      inhibiting the interaction of PD-1 on T cells with its ligands PD-L1 and 
      PD-L2.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pembrolizumab is currently being evaluated across more than 30 types of 
      cancers, as monotherapy and in combination. It is anticipated that by 
      the end of 2014, the pembrolizumab development program will grow to more 
      than 24 clinical trials, enrolling an estimated 6,000 patients at nearly 
      300 clinical trial sites worldwide. For information about Merck&#8217;s 
      oncology clinical studies, please visit&#160;http://www.merck.com/clinical-trials/index.html.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			XALKORI&#174; (crizotinib) Indication and 
      Important Safety Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      XALKORI is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients 
      with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors are 
      anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive as detected by an FDA-approved 
      test.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hepatotoxicity: Across three main clinical trials fatal hepatotoxicity 
      occurred in 0.2% of patients. Monitor with periodic liver testing. 
      Temporarily suspend, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue XALKORI.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pneumonitis: Across three main clinical trials interstitial lung disease 
      (ILD)/pneumonitis occurred in 2% of patients. Permanently discontinue in 
      patients with ILD/pneumonitis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      QT Interval Prolongation: Across three main clinical trials QT interval 
      prolongation occurred in 2.7% of patients. Monitor with 
      electrocardiograms and electrolytes in patients who have a history of or 
      predisposition for QTc prolongation, or who are taking medications that 
      prolong QT. Temporarily suspend, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue 
      XALKORI.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Bradycardia: Xalkori can cause bradycardia. Across three main clinical 
      trials 11% of patients experienced a heart rate of less than 50 beats 
      per minute. Monitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly. Temporarily 
      suspend, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue XALKORI.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Embryofetal Toxicity: XALKORI can cause fetal harm when administered to 
      a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to 
      avoid becoming pregnant while receiving XALKORI.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Adverse Reactions: Across three main clinical trials the most common 
      adverse reactions (&#8805;25%) were vision disorders, nausea, diarrhea, 
      vomiting, constipation, edema, elevated transaminases, and fatigue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In a phase 3 study in patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC 
      randomized to XALKORI (n=172) or chemotherapy (n=171), serious adverse 
      reactions were reported in 37.2% of patients treated with XALKORI. The 
      most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in patients treated 
      with XALKORI were pneumonia (4.1%), pulmonary embolism (3.5%), dyspnea 
      (2.3%), and ILD (2.9%). Fatal adverse reactions in XALKORI-treated 
      patients occurred in 9 (5%) patients, consisting of: acute respiratory 
      distress syndrome, arrhythmia, dyspnea, ILD, pneumonia, pneumonitis, 
      pulmonary embolism, respiratory failure, and sepsis. Grade 3 or 4 events 
      occurring at a higher incidence with XALKORI than with chemotherapy and 
      at greater than 2%, were syncope (3%), QT prolongation (3%), and 
      pulmonary embolism (5%). Elevation of ALT of any grade occurred in 76% 
      of patients and grade 3 or 4 in 17% of patients. Neutropenia of any 
      grade occurred in 49% of patients and grade 3 or 4 in 12% of patients. 
      Lymphopenia of any grade occurred in 51% of patients and grade 3 or 4 in 
      9% of patients. Renal cysts occurred in 4% and neuropathy occurred in 
      19% of patients treated with XALKORI.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Drug Interactions: Exercise caution with concomitant use of moderate 
      CYP3A inhibitors. Avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice which may 
      increase plasma concentrations of crizotinib. Avoid concomitant use of 
      strong CYP3A inducers and inhibitors. Dose reduction may be needed for 
      co-administered drugs that are predominantly metabolized by CYP3A.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nursing Mothers: Given the potential for serious adverse reactions in 
      nursing infants, consider whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue 
      XALKORI.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hepatic Impairment: XALKORI has not been studied in patients with 
      hepatic impairment. As crizotinib is extensively metabolized in the 
      liver, hepatic impairment is likely to increase plasma crizotinib 
      concentrations. Use caution in patients with hepatic impairment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Renal Impairment: Administer XALKORI at a starting dose of 250 mg taken 
      orally once daily in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr30 
      mL/min) not requiring dialysis. No starting dose adjustment is needed 
      for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING Aug 26 (Reuters) - Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China (ICBC) has deployed a new IBM 
mainframe computer system that reduces downtime and will
continue to buy equipment from IBM, the two companies said
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM's joint announcement with ICBC, the world's largest bank
by market capitalization, is an effort to signal IBM's ongoing
business with China's state-owned banks and comes several months
after widely circulated media reports suggested China's central
government had ordered banks to remove IBM equipment due to
cybersecurity concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeking to recover from the public relations hit, IBM has
announced in recent weeks a string of deals in China to assure
investors of its future in the market as well as salvage its
reputation with potential Chinese buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement released only in Chinese, ICBC chief
technology officer Lin Xiaoxuan said ICBC "beginning 30 years
ago was the first bank in mainland China to introduce IBM
mainframes, which have since played an important role in our IT
operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM mainframes have consistently helped us keep our IT
systems steady and safe and will continue to do so in the
future," Lin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ICBC's newly deployed mainframe, which was purchased from
IBM several months ago, allows sensitive financial data to be
routed around the world in the event of a crash at one of its 40
global branches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM Greater China Chief D.C. Chien told state-run China
Daily newspaper in a recent interview that local banks have
continued to purchase its products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM additionally announced this week that it would team up
with China Telecom to provide cloud computing services
to small and medium-sized businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the most recent public relations push, IBM said in
April that sales in China had fallen by 20 percent, echoing
disappointing results from many U.S. technology companies which
saw their sales in China plummet following revelations by Edward
Snowden of extensive U.S. government spying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an unexpected development, Inspur, a Chinese rival to IBM
that marketed itself as a more secure option for Chinese banks,
announced this week it will sell its high-end K1 server system
with IBM's database and web application software installed.

&lt;p&gt;* Govt official says web browser and media player probed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Microsoft has been cooperating with investigation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Microsoft antitrust probe one of nine initiated this year
by SAIC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Gerry Shih and Paul Carsten&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BEIJING, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's 
Windows web browser and media player are being targeted in a
Chinese antitrust probe, raising the prospect of China
revisiting the software bundling issue at the heart of past
antitrust complaints against the firm in the West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC)
suspects Microsoft of not being fully transparent with
information about its Windows and Office sales, but the company
has expressed willingness to cooperate with ongoing
investigations, Zhang Mao, the head of the antitrust regulator,
told reporters at a briefing in Beijing on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Windows became the world's dominant operating system in
the 1990s and 2000s, the issue of how Microsoft bundled its web
browser and media player became the focus of respective
antitrust cases brought by U.S. and European authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft settled in 2001 with the U.S. Department of
Justice a long-running case centring around whether it could
bundle its flagship Internet Explorer browser with Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2004, the European Union ordered Microsoft to pay a 497
million euro ($656 million) fine and produce a version of
Windows without the Windows Media Player bundled. The fine was
later increased to nearly 1.4 billion euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's focus on two products previously litigated elsewhere
appears to form the basis of its investigation, but the probe
could extend beyond the media player and browser bundling issue,
said You Youting, a partner at Shanghai Debund Law Offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's possible the government hasn't been successful in
finding what they're looking for," You said. "But by starting
with these two products, it gives them time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment when contacted by
telephone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft investigation comes amid a spate of antitrust
probes against foreign firms in China, including mobile chipset
maker Qualcomm Inc and German car maker Daimler AG's
 luxury auto unit Mercedes-Benz. The probes have
renewed fears of Chinese protectionism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SAIC said earlier this month that Microsoft had been
suspected of violating China's anti-monopoly law since June last
year in relation to problems with compatibility, bundling and
document authentication for its Windows operating system and
Microsoft Office software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SAIC, one of China's three anti-monopoly regulators,
formally announced its investigation into Microsoft's activities
this month after officials raided Microsoft offices in several
major cities and met Microsoft Deputy General Counsel Mary Snapp
for questioning in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The investigation is presently ongoing, and we will
disclose the results to the public in a timely fashion," Zhang
said, adding that the probe is one of nine opened this year
which include the software, tobacco, telecommunications,
insurance, tourism and utilities sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies involved in the nine investigations comprise
domestic, foreign, state-owned enterprises and trade
associations, Zhang said.

The probes have renewed fears of Chinese protectionism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SAIC said earlier this month that Microsoft had been suspected of violating China's anti-monopoly law since June last year in relation to problems with compatibility, bundling and document authentication for its Windows operating system and Microsoft Office software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SAIC, one of China's three anti-monopoly regulators, formally announced its investigation into Microsoft's activities this month after officials raided Microsoft offices in several major cities and met Microsoft Deputy General Counsel Mary Snapp for questioning in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The investigation is presently ongoing, and we will disclose the results to the public in a timely fashion," Zhang said, adding that the probe is one of nine opened this year which include the software, tobacco, telecommunications, insurance, tourism and utilities sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies involved in the nine investigations comprise domestic, foreign, state-owned enterprises and trade associations, Zhang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1 US dollar = 0.7575 euro)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Gerry Shih, Michael Martina and Paul Carsten; Editing by Ryan Woo)&lt;/p&gt;

      Walton Westphalia Development Corporation ReportsSecond Quarter 
      2014 Results
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Westphalia Development Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) 
      announced today its results for the second quarter of 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We continue to be encouraged with the attention our development project 
      is receiving from the business community,&#8221; said Bill Doherty, Chairman 
      of the Corporation. &#8220;On the construction side the weather has been 
      improving allowing steady progress with our Phase 1 activities. 
      Approximately two-thirds of the rough grading has been completed and 
      sewer installation is underway. We expect to be delivering lots to 
      builders by the end of 2014. The market for single-family homes is 
      strong with revenues from the sale of single-family lots above our 
      original expectations and there is significant interest in the retail 
      portion of our project including prospective grocery anchor tenants.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Highlights for the Second Quarter of 2014
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        The Umbrella Architecture Detailed Site Plan, allowing builders to 
        directly apply for building permits without the need for a further 
        detailed site plan for their specific building architecture, received 
        Certificate Approval in June from The Maryland-National Capital Park 
        and Planning Commission (&#8220;M-NCPPC&#8221;); and
      
			
        The Corporation received its Executed Limited Access, Right of Entry, 
        Construction and Maintenance Agreement in June from M-NCPPC for the 
        construction of the sewer outfall on the Commission&#8217;s property. The 
        Corporation provided a bond in the amount of USD $90,000 which will be 
        used as a construction guaranty for restoration of the work area.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Subsequently, on July 17, 2014, the Corporation received a permit to 
      relocate its 30-inch waterline under the proposed Woodyard Road 
      extension. The extension of Woodyard Road will provide access to the 
      townhomes proposed for the development. The Corporation provided 
      Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (&#8220;WSSC&#8221;) with two bonds 
      totaling USD $1,946,996 which will be used as construction guarantees 
      and will be replaced by a maintenance bond once WSSC is satisfied with 
      the work requirements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Management continues to actively market the Property, but anticipates 
      office revenue to be delayed for two years due to market conditions. As 
      a result, management will also delay off-site improvements that are 
      required for the commercial space. Furthermore, the project&#8217;s net 
      rentable area for retail tenants will be reduced, due to a number of 
      factors, including parking requirements for a major grocer and anchor 
      tenant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a result of construction delays caused by the wettest winter in a 
      decade, downward revenue revisions for the retail and hotel sites, the 
      extension of the estimated sale dates for the office sites, high office 
      vacancy rates and the impact of the U.S. Government&#8217;s budget 
      sequestration on the market, the time frame for completing the project 
      is anticipated to exceed the seven-year horizon and the projected 
      internal rate of return is expected to be revised downwards, from that 
      disclosed in the Prospectus. However, management has determined that 
      there has not been a significant impact on the net realizable value of 
      the property and no provision is required.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Management is exploring strategies to maximize the financial returns of 
      the project. In this regard, management will report to investors no 
      later than the release of the Q3 2014 financial results once the 
      strategies have been implemented and their impacts, if any, are 
      quantified.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Second Quarter Financial Results
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three months ended June 30, 2014, the Corporation recognized 
      interest income of $1,326, other expenses of $215,141, other items of 
      $701,001, for a net loss before tax of $914,816, deferred tax recovery 
      of $314,836, and a comprehensive loss of $979,420. Comprehensive income 
      decreased due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to the 
      Canadian dollar. This resulted in a translation loss recognized in other 
      comprehensive income.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additional Information
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Corporation is managed by Walton Asset Management L.P. and the 
      development of the property is managed by Walton Development  
      Management (USA), Inc., both of which are members of the Walton Group of 
      Companies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Walton Group of Companies (&#8220;Walton&#8221;) is a family-owned, 
      multinational real estate investment, planning, and development group 
      concentrating on the research, acquisition, administration, planning and 
      development of strategically located land in major North American growth

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Ontario Land L.P. 1 Reports Second Quarter 2014 Results
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Ontario Land L.P. 1 (the &#8220;Partnership&#8221;) and its general 
      partner Walton Ontario Land 1 Corporation (the &#8220;General Partner&#8221;) 
      announced today the Partnership&#8217;s results for the second quarter of 
      2014. Launched in January 2010, the Partnership&#8217;s objective is to 
      maximize returns to limited partners through the management of the 
      entity, concept planning and eventual sale of the Ottawa Property (the &#8220;Property&#8221;).The 
      Property consists of approximately 300 acres adjacent to existing 
      residential communities located to the north and northwest, and 
      immediately south of Ottawa&#8217;s current urban area boundary.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the second quarter of 2014, the Partnership continued to 
      participate in the City of Ottawa&#8217;s 2014 Official Plan review process to 
      support the inclusion of the Property in future expansions to Ottawa&#8217;s 
      urban boundary. The City has issued a decision on its Official Plan 
      review process and has decided not to expand its urban boundary, however 
      completion of the process is not final until the Minister of Municipal 
      Affairs and Housing (&#8220;MMAH&#8221;) has made a final ruling and all 
      appeals have been exhausted.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the course of the City&#8217;s review process, the Partnership made 
      submissions citing that the future prosperity and competitiveness of the 
      City in promoting economic development is contingent on the quality and 
      quantity of employment lands being made available to existing and future 
      users.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Partnership has filed an appeal to the MMAH about the City&#8217;s review 
      process and in particular for not adequately addressing the quality of 
      employment lands in its deliberations. Walton&#8217;s appeal along with those 
      of 31 other appellants was received and their status confirmed by the 
      Ministry on May 30, 2014. A pre-hearing has been suggested for the 
      spring of 2015 to determine the joint status of the appellants.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Partnership believes that the Property is well suited for an urban 
      boundary expansion providing an excellent opportunity to accommodate 
      employment and supporting mixed uses, in an enterprise designated 
      concept plan that has the potential to create new employment 
      opportunities in the Ottawa area. As the Partnership&#8217;s investment 
      objective is to maximize returns to its limited partners, these 
      initiatives would position the Property to achieve the highest and best 
      use potential.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Second Quarter Financial Results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the three months ended June 30, 2014, the Partnership realized a 
      net loss of $238,184 compared to a net loss of $234,800 for the three 
      months ended June 30, 2013. This was consistent with management&#8217;s 
      expectation because the Partnership is not expected to generate 
      significant revenues, except during periods when a property is sold. The 
      Partnership&#8217;s expenses are also expected to remain fairly constant 
      throughout the life of the Partnership. This is because the most 
      significant expenses of the Partnership, being the management fees, 
      servicing fees and directors&#8217; fees, are fixed over the life of their 
      respective contracts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Overall, the Partnership is performing as expected by management and 
      consistent with the Partnership&#8217;s intention of holding its interest in 
      the Property as an investment until market conditions are appropriate 
      for a sale to be made.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Additional Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Partnership is managed by Walton International Group Inc., part of 
      the Walton Group of Companies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Walton Group of Companies (&#8220;Walton&#8221;) is a family-owned, 
      multinational real estate investment, planning, and development group 
      concentrating on the research, acquisition, administration, planning and 
      development of strategically located land in major North American growth 
      corridors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			IBM and Monitise Form Global Go-to-Market and Resourcing Alliance
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Monitise enters agreement to transfer UK Professional Services staff 
      to IBM
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM (NYSE:&#160;IBM) 
      and Monitise plc (LSE: MONI.L) (&#8220;Monitise&#8221;, the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Group&#8221;) 
      today announced a global digital commerce and resourcing alliance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Combining the best of both companies&#8217; mobile banking, payments and 
      commerce technology, this alliance brings IBM sales and specialist 
      resources to clients around the world with the full spectrum of advice, 
      solution design and delivery of Monitise&#8217;s Mobile Money services. 
      Building on Monitise&#8217;s IBM Global 
      Alliance announcement in July that included the IBM MobileFirst 
      portfolio of offerings. Monitise&#8217;s technology will be enabled, hosted 
      and sold as an IBM cloud-delivered solution worldwide in the 
      business-to-business space. This in turn underpins Monitise&#8217;s 
      go-to-market strategic priorities as announced in March 2014, including 
      its target for 200 million users using Mobile Money products and 
      services developed by Monitise by 2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of the collaboration, IBM&#8217;s global go-to-market investment of 
      dedicated resources and promotional initiatives, globally and in region, 
      will pair with Monitise staff to pursue Mobile Money opportunities. 
      While commercial opportunities initially will be targeted at financial 
      institutions, the companies will also address the needs of&#160;mobile 
      network operators, retailers and any vertical requiring simple API 
      connectivity to bank-grade, interoperable and scalable mobile payment 
      and commerce functionality and content.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of today&#8217;s agreement, teams from Monitise&#8217;s UK development and 
      integration business known as Professional Services -- including a 
      number of contractors -- will be transferred into IBM; IBM will in turn 
      deliver services back to Monitise. The transfer, which involves UK 
      employees representing a little over 20 percent of Monitise&#8217;s global 
      employee base, means Monitise technology talent will now be available 
      for both Monitise and IBM customer projects and vice versa. All Monitise 
      contracts and client relationships, intellectual property, commitments 
      and delivery remain unchanged.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The collaboration will substantially increase Monitise&#8217;s ability to 
      handle larger custom projects globally, in addition to implementing 
      standardised solutions. Equally, the resources will enhance IBM&#8217;s 
      ability to deliver existing and future Monitise-based Mobile Money 
      solutions to customers. Efficiencies derived from the collaboration 
      support Monitise&#8217;s target, as reiterated in its trading update in July 
      2014, to be profitable in FY 2016 and achieve an EBITDA margin of at 
      least 30 percent by end of FY 2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Today&#8217;s businesses require solutions that radically streamline and 
      accelerate mobile adoption to reinvent the customer experience,&#8221; said 
      Bridget van Kralingen senior vice president, Global Business Services, 
      IBM. &#8220;Our deepening collaboration with Monitise, our strong cultural fit 
      and shared vision for a multi-channel future, ensures that we are 
      perfectly positioned to help our clients take full advantage of the 
      mobile opportunity.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Monitise plc CEO Alastair Lukies said: &#8220;Today&#8217;s announcement marks a new 
      milestone in delivering an industry-leading Mobile Money partnership, 
      establishing IBM and Monitise as a global powerhouse. Together, we are 
      in an unrivalled position to enable banks and other leading businesses 
      to build on mobile banking and payments capabilities to tap into the 
      growing digital commerce opportunity.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lukies added: &#8220;Our deeper level of collaboration with IBM supports the 
      strategy update we announced in March with our increasing product focus 
      and our ability to scale, both in terms of our delivery capabilities and 
      our global footprint, as well as letting each company focus on its 
      proven market-leading strengths. Creating the most comprehensive and 
      easiest access to the best Mobile Money tools for businesses around the 
      world is the biggest driver behind this deal. No matter whether you are 
      a start-up, mid-sized or international bank, mobile network operator or 
      retailer, this unrivalled partnership delivering cost-effective 
      interoperable bank, pay and buy mobile products and solutions from any 
      country, helps business unlock the commercial benefits of Mobile Money.

&lt;p&gt;TAIPEI Aug 27 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs has priced its
30-year, $974 million U.S. dollar-denominated bond in Taiwan,
two people familiar with the issue said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zero coupon bond was priced with an internal rate of
return of 4.96 percent, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest dollar bond offering in Taiwan is the biggest so
far from a single issuer, highlighting the appetite among
Taiwan's insurance companies, which were recently allowed to
invest more in long-term foreign currency debt issued locally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs' offering brings the total U.S. dollar bond
issuance on the island in the past two months to over $5
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Domestic regulators relaxed rules in June to allow local
insurance companies to invest in foreign currency debt issued in
Taiwan but not count it toward their quota for overseas
investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bond will list on the GreTai Securities Market, Taiwan's
over-the-counter exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Walters' homer in 10th helps Indians win&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO -- Zach Walters missed a chance to bunt a runner to third in a key situation Tuesday night, but didn't miss a 3-2 fastball a couple pitches later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That one, thrown by right-hander Jake Petricka, Walters drilled 405 feet to right field for a clutch two-run homer in the top of the 10th inning to lead the Cleveland Indians to an 8-6 victory over the Chicago White Sox at U.S. Cellular Field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined with 2 1/3 scoreless innings of relief by right-hander Bryan Shaw (5-3), who earned the win, it was just enough to give Cleveland (67-63) its third straight win and 10th in the past 14 games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I missed the bunt," said Walters, who spent most of the season in Triple-A before the Washington Nationals dealt him to the Indians at the July 31 trade deadline. "I knew he was going to come at me. I wasn't expecting to hit a home run. I was just trying to put the ball in play. I got lucky."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walters, who was acquired in a deal that sent shortstop Asdrubel Cabrera to Washington, now has nine home runs this season in 95 major league at-bats. Six have come since arriving in Cleveland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's an unbelievable opportunity the Indians have given me," he said. "I was in a tough spot and it's been night-and-day different over here. They're giving me kind of the keys to drive the car, I guess you'd say."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loss was the White Sox's seventh in a row, which extended their season high by another game. Petricka (0-4) took the loss, which is just the second for Chicago at home against Cleveland in eight games this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walters went 2-for-4, scored twice and had the two big RBIs to lead Cleveland. Second baseman Jason Kipnis, who's originally from nearby Northbrook, Ill., went 2-for-5 with an RBI, and the middle four hitters in the Indians' lineup drove in a run each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortstop Alexei Ramirez and right fielder Avisail Garcia did the most damage for Chicago (59-72). Ramirez went 2-for-5 with a two-run home run and three RBIs, and Garcia went 2-for-5 with two RBIs. Center fielder Adam Eaton, who came off the 15-day disabled list Tuesday afternoon, went 1-for-4 with a run scored and an RBI single.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago left-hander Jose Quintana and Cleveland left-hander T.J. House each took no-decisions and left their starts earlier than they had hoped. House went 4 2/3 innings and allowed five runs, while Quintana lasted only five-plus innings and gave up six runs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An inning after the White Sox took their first lead, 5-4, Cleveland came back with two runs in the top of the sixth to retake the lead 6-5 on three hits and a costly error by Eaton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He made up for the gaffe quickly by throwing out catcher Roberto Perez trying to score from second on a shallow single by center fielder Michael Bourn -- keeping the Indians from extending their lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago tied it 6-6 in the seventh on two singles and an RBI groundout, and that's how it stayed until the 10th, when third baseman Lonnie Chisenhall led off with a double and Walters followed with his homer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The guy throws 97 (mph)," Walters said of Petricka. "I'm not going to be looking for (a) changeup. He's a good pitcher. I've faced him before in the minors. I'm surprised he didn't throw me any off-speed (stuff) that whole at-bat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither side wasted time getting on the scoreboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cleveland took a 3-0 lead in the first inning on four hits and a hit batter, including doubles by Bourn and first baseman Carlos Santana. Chicago responded with two runs off House in the bottom half, with Garcia's two-run single scoring Ramirez and first baseman Jose Abreu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the fourth straight outing Quintana hasn't looked his best. He allowed four runs in each of his three previous starts and gave up four earned runs in the two prior to this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I feel really good," said Quintana, who threw 102 pitches. "I try to close the game and give the team a chance to win, but I feel frustrated with myself because I (got) pretty good support from the hitters tonight and when you get that, I feel bad for them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOTES: The White Sox activated CF Adam Eaton from the 15-day disabled list, and he manned his usual spot atop the batting order. ... White Sox GM Rick Hahn said LHP Carlos Rodon, a top prospect, will make his next start Aug. 30 for Triple-A Charlotte, not for Chicago. Hahn said the first of the team's call-ups after rosters expand will arrive Sept. 2, after an off day. ... SS Tim Anderson and RHP Francellis Montas, the White Sox's second- and third-ranked prospects according to MLB.com, are among seven Chicago prospects set to play for the Glendale Desert Dogs in the Arizona Fall League. ... Indians manager Terry Francona said C Yan Gomes (concussion) is doing a lot better and appears on course to be activated from the disabled list Friday. ... Cleveland RF David Murphy (oblique) is taking swings and progressing well. Francona said Murphy, who went on the DL July 10, is "coming quick," but has no set timetable for a return. ... Indians DH Jason Giambi (knee) is set to start a rehab stint with Double-A Akron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LIMA (Reuters) - Peruvian police seized a record 6.5 tonnes of cocaine in a quiet coastal town this week, arresting seven Peruvians and two Mexicans suspected of trying to smuggle the load to Europe as coal, President Ollanta Humala said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorities have raised their initial estimate of 3 tonnes of cocaine since uncovering the illicit cargo in a warehouse on Tuesday in Huanchaco, near the city of Trujillo in northern Peru.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cocaine was packed into brick-sized packets and glued inside of large chunks of coal, according to images provided by the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police, who made the bust following weeks of investigations, are still examining the load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total amount of cocaine confiscated might surpass 6.5 tonnes, Humala said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is, without doubt, the most important blow to drug trafficking in the history of the republic," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peru is the world's top cocaine and coca producer, according to the United States and United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The export companies linked to the smuggling operation have been exporting coal to Spain and Belgium since at least 2011, police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suspects arrested likely belong to an important global drug cartel, said Interior Minister Daniel Urresti, declining to identify which one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Enrique Mandujano.

      discuss vital role of technology in tackling global climate change
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Joule, the innovator of a CO2 -to-fuels reverse combustion 
      process, will convene industry and political leaders for a seminar in 
      Oslo, Norway: &#8220;Converting Words to Action on Climate Change: The Role of 
      Technology.&#8221; The event will be headlined by Professor Jeffrey Sachs, 
      senior United Nations advisor and director of the Sustainable 
      Development Solutions Network (SDSN).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As outlined in the recent Deep 
      Decarbonization Pathways Project (DDPP) report published by SDSN and 
      the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations, 
      the widespread availability, affordability and implementation of 
      low-carbon technologies will be critical to a reduction in emissions 
      consistent with limiting global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius. 
      This includes the role of newer technologies that are still advancing 
      towards maturity and economic feasibility, requiring the collective 
      support of government, academia and business for technology cooperation, 
      funding and removal of barriers to adoption.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;History shows no shortage of transformative technologies that have 
      profoundly improved and preserved our way of life, from medical vaccines 
      to solar power, and many others that required years to reach fruition,&#8221; 
      said Noubar Afeyan, PhD, Executive Chairman of Joule, who will present 
      at the Oslo seminar. &#8220;We&#8217;re now facing one of the greatest challenges of 
      our time, the threat of escalating climate change, and newly emerging 
      technologies must be supported alongside existing approaches to have a 
      material impact. We are very pleased to join like-minded leaders in 
      Norway, where decarbonization is a key goal, to host a dialogue on this 
      all-important topic.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to Dr. Afeyan and Prof. Sachs, the seminar will include 
      presentations from: Nikolai Astrup, Deputy Head, H&#248;yre&#8217;s Group in the 
      Norwegian Parliament; Jonas Gahr St&#248;re, Head of Arbeiderpartiet; and 
      executives from AUDI AG, Finance Norway, Scatec Solar, and the UMOE

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Manhattan federal judge has dismissed a 12-year-old lawsuit accusing Ford Motor Co (F.N) and IBM Corp (IBM.N) of encouraging human rights abuses in apartheid-era South Africa, reluctantly concluding that the case does not belong in U.S. courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin on Thursday said the black South Africans who brought the case did not show "relevant conduct" by Ford and IBM within the United States to justify holding the companies liable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs had accused Ford, IBM and other companies of having between the 1970s and early 1990s aided South Africa's former apartheid government in abuses such as killings and torture, by having made military vehicles and computers for government security forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That these plaintiffs are left without relief in an American court is regrettable," Scheindlin wrote. "But I am bound to follow [legal precedent], no matter what my personal view of the law may be."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case had been brought under the Alien Tort Statute, a 1789 law that lets non-U.S. citizens pursue some cases in U.S. courts over alleged violations of international law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court said that law was presumed to cover only violations in the United States, or violations elsewhere that "touch and concern" U.S. territory "with sufficient force."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four months later, the federal appeals court in Manhattan applied that holding, and said the Ford and IBM cases should be dismissed altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, Scheindlin nonetheless gave the plaintiffs one more chance, to meet the new standards imposed by those higher courts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in Thursday's decision, she said the bar proved too high, and that any alleged international law violations were by Ford's and IBM's South African units, and occurred abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It has been 12 years. We're really disappointed, devastated by the decision," said Diane Sammons, a partner at Nagel Rice in Roseland, New Jersey, who represents some plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The end result of the ruling is that corporations can act abroad with impunity, even if they're totally controlling the activities of their foreign subsidiaries," she added. "I don't think the Supreme Court's decision was that narrowly defined."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said the plaintiffs had not decided whether to appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Hacker, an O'Melveny &amp; Myers partner who represents Ford, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella is set to visit China in late September, the company said on Thursday, as the Chinese government conducts an antitrust investigation into the world's largest software company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not clear if Nadella, who took over as Microsoft CEO in February, will meet with any Chinese government representatives as part of his visit, or try to resolve issues with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC), one of China's antitrust regulators. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAIC officials could not be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which normally does not comment on executive travel plans, acknowledged the trip but tried to defuse any tension around the antitrust issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Satya's trip was planned before the Chinese government investigation began," said a company spokesperson. "We're committed to complying with China's laws and addressing SAIC's questions and concerns." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is one of many foreign firms to have come under scrutiny as China seeks to enforce a 2008 anti-monopoly law, which some critics say is being used to unfairly target overseas businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign CEOs often pay calls on the world's second-largest economy to strengthen business and political ties. Nadella would be at least the second major tech executive to have visited the country as antitrust tensions simmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm Inc President Derek Aberle, looking to end to the wireless chip giant's own antitrust scrutiny, met with China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella's predecessor, Steve Ballmer, visited China four times in the past five fiscal years, Microsoft said. It is not clear that Microsoft achieved much with such high-level executive appearances in a country where Windows and Office are widely pirated. Ballmer said in 2011 that Microsoft got more revenue in the Netherlands than China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Deputy General Counsel Mary Snapp already met with SAIC officials in Beijing earlier this month to discuss the antitrust matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the rampant Windows piracy, China's SAIC initiated an antitrust probe into Microsoft earlier this month, saying that the company may have broken anti-monopoly laws regarding compatibility, bundling and document authentication for its Windows operating system and Office suite of applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, SAIC head Zhang Mao said at a briefing in Beijing his organization - one of three antitrust regulators in China - was focusing on Microsoft's web browser and media player, and suspected the company had not been fully transparent with information about its Windows and Office sales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation has been met with puzzlement outside China, given that Microsoft settled U.S. and European antitrust cases around Windows more than a decade ago, and its desktop software monopoly is now largely irrelevant with the explosion of tablets and phones running Apple Inc or Google Inc software.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The probe comes amid a spate of antitrust probes against foreign firms in China, including Qualcomm and German car maker Daimler AG's luxury auto unit Mercedes-Benz, renewing fears of Chinese protectionism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Bill Rigby in Seattle)&lt;/p&gt;

			Pfizer and Protalix BioTherapeutics Announce FDA Approval of 
      Pediatric Indication for ELELYSO&#8482; (taliglucerase alfa) for Injection, 
      for Intravenous Use for the Treatment of Type 1 Gaucher Disease
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Protalix BioTherapeutics, Inc. (NYSE-MKT:PLX, 
      TASE:PLX) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
      (FDA) approved ELELYSO&#8482; (taliglucerase alfa) for injection for pediatric 
      patients. ELELYSO is therefore now indicated for long-term enzyme 
      replacement therapy (ERT) for adult and pediatric patients with a 
      confirmed diagnosis of Type 1 Gaucher disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "The approval of ELELYSO to treat pediatric patients with Type 1 Gaucher 
      disease provides physicians another treatment option for this rare and 
      potentially debilitating disease,&#8221; said Rory O&#8217;Connor, Senior Vice 
      President, Global Medical Affairs, Global Innovative Pharma Business, 
      Pfizer Inc. &#8220;This pediatric indication, along with the recent 
      announcement that ELELYSO received kosher certification by the Orthodox 
      Union (OU), reinforces the ongoing commitment of Pfizer to addressing 
      the needs of the Gaucher community.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The safety and efficacy of ELELYSO were assessed in fourteen pediatric 
      patients with Type 1 Gaucher disease in two clinical trials. The first 
      trial consisted of nine patients in a 12-month, multi-center, 
      double-blind, randomized study in treatment-na&#239;ve patients aged two to 
      13 years. At the end of the 12-month study, therapeutic efficacy of 
      ELELYSO was demonstrated, as measured by a decrease in spleen and liver 
      volume and an increase in platelet count. A second trial consisted of 5 
      pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years who were switched from 
      imiglucerase to ELELYSO. The trial was a 9-month, multi-center, 
      open-label, single-arm study in patients who had been receiving 
      treatment with imiglucerase at dosages ranging from 9.5 units/kg to 60 
      units/kg every other week for a minimum of 2 years. ELELYSO was 
      administered for 9 months at the same dose as each patient&#8217;s previous 
      imiglucerase dose. If needed, adjustment of dosage was allowed during 
      the study in order to maintain stability of clinical parameters. Mean 
      spleen and liver volume, platelet count and hemoglobin value remained 
      stable through 9 months of ELELYSO treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The recommended dosage of ELELSYO for treatment-na&#239;ve adult and 
      pediatric patients four years of age and older is 60 units per kg of 
      body weight administered every other week as a 60 to 120 minute 
      intravenous infusion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Patients previously treated on a stable dosage of imiglucerase are 
      recommended to begin treatment with ELELYSO at that same dosage when 
      they switch from imiglucerase to ELELYSO. Dosage adjustments can be made 
      based on achievement and maintenance of each patient&#8217;s therapeutic goals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred 
      in some patients treated with ELELYSO. The most common adverse reactions 
      for ELELYSO in clinical trials were itching, flushing, headache, joint 
      pain, pain in extremity, abdominal pain, vomiting, fatigue, back pain, 
      dizziness, nausea and rash. Vomiting occurred more often in pediatric 
      patients than adults.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;While Type 1 Gaucher disease can manifest in childhood or adulthood, 
      the disease more often presents during childhood,&#8221; said Paige Kaplan, 
      MB, BCh, Section of Biochemical Genetics (Metabolic Diseases), 
      Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. &#8220;It is important that children with 
      this disease have access to a range of FDA-approved treatment options 
      that are effective.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of its ongoing commitment to helping address the unmet medical 
      needs of people with rare diseases, Pfizer also offers a specialized 
      support program -- called Gaucher Personal Support (GPS) -- for people 
      living with Gaucher disease. Pfizer GPS is a one-stop resource for 
      personalized patient support and specialty pharmacy services for 
      patients and healthcare professionals. Pfizer GPS employs a dedicated 
      and caring team of healthcare specialists who are available to help 
      patients with Gaucher disease and their caregivers with reimbursement 
      assistance, coordinating and locating infusion services and ongoing 
      pharmacy support. Using Pfizer GPS, patients and healthcare 
      professionals can access all support services 24/7 using one toll-free 
      phone number, 1-855-ELELYSO (1-855-353-5976).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ELELYSO for injection is supplied as 200 units per vial and is available 
      by prescription only.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			INDICATION
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ELELYSO&#8482; is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for 
      adult and pediatric patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Type 1 
      Gaucher disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have occurred 
      in some patients treated with ELELYSO (taliglucerase alfa) for 
      injection, for intravenous use. When treated with ELELYSO your doctor 
      should monitor you before and after infusion for reactions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Medical support should be readily available when ELELYSO is given. 
      Discontinue ELELYSO immediately if you show signs or symptoms of 
      anaphylaxis during infusion and get immediate medical care. Signs and 
      symptoms of anaphylaxis included hives, low blood pressure, flushing, 
      wheezing, chest tightness, nausea, vomiting and dizziness.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity included itching, swelling under 
      the skin, flushing, redness, rash, nausea, vomiting, cough, chest 
      tightness and throat irritation. These reactions occurred up to 3 hours 
      after the start of infusion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Management of hypersensitivity reactions is based on the severity of the 
      reaction. Your doctor may manage the reactions by slowing or temporarily 
      stopping the infusion, and/or treating with medications such as an 
      antihistamine, a fever reducer and/or corticosteroids for mild 
      reactions. Treatment with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids prior to 
      infusion with ELELYSO may prevent these reactions from reoccurring. If 
      severe hypersensitivity reactions occur, immediately stop the infusion 
      of ELELYSO and get immediate medical care.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      You should be carefully re-evaluated for treatment with ELELYSO if 
      serious or hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis occur.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The most common adverse reactions for ELELYSO are itching, flushing, 
      headache, joint pain, pain in extremity, abdominal pain, vomiting, 
      fatigue, back pain, dizziness, nausea and rash. Vomiting occurred more 
      often in children than adults.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The recommended dosage of ELELYSO for adults and children who are 4 
      years of age and older and not taking another ERT is 60 units per kg of 
      body weight given every other week as a 60 to 120 minute intravenous 
      infusion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As with all therapeutic proteins, including (enzyme replacement therapy) 
      ERTs, there is a possibility of developing antibodies to ELELYSO. The 
      relationship between developing antibodies and hypersensitivity 
      reactions is not clear. Your doctor should monitor you for antibodies to 
      ELELYSO if you have developed antibodies or if you have experienced 
      hypersensitivity reactions to ELELYSO or other ERTs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      If you are pregnant, or plan to become pregnant, you should talk to your 
      doctor about potential benefits and risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs 
      to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch, 
      or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

			About Gaucher Disease
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Gaucher disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder in humans 
      that affects an estimated 10,000 people worldwide and can cause severe 
      and debilitating symptoms, including: enlargement of the liver and 
      spleen, various forms of bone disease, easy bruising, and anemia (a low 
      number of red blood cells).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Gaucher disease consists of varying degrees of severity; it has been 
      sub-divided into three subtypes - Types 1, 2, and 3 - according to the 
      presence or absence of neurological involvement. Type 1, the most 
      common, is found at a higher frequency among individuals who are of 
      Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Pixium Vision is developing innovative Vision Restoration Systems (VRS) 
      that aim to significantly improve the independence, mobility and quality 
      of life of patients who have lost their sight. Pixium Vision&#8217;s VRS are 
      composed of various high-tech elements, associated with a surgical 
      intervention as well as a rehabilitation period. These systems aim to

      so far and improvements in visual perception have been observed. The 
      results of these studies will be used to apply for CE mark. 
      Commercialization of IRIS&#174; is expected to begin in 2015.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co is investigating a possible cyber attack and working with law enforcement authorities to determine the scope, a company spokeswoman said on Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank was taking additional steps to safeguard sensitive or confidential information, though it did not see unusual fraud activity at this time, company spokeswoman Trish Wexler said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan disclosed the investigation after the FBI said Wednesday evening it was investigating media reports earlier in the day that several U.S. financial companies have been victims of recent cyber attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are working with the United States Secret Service to determine the scope of recently reported cyber attacks against several American financial institutions," FBI spokesman Joshua Campbell said in a statement late Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Campbell did not name any companies or give more details, although media reports had named JPMorgan as one victim of the attacks. Other potential victims have yet to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials with the Secret Service could not be reached for comment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan launched its investigation after malicious software was recently discovered in the bank's network, signaling it was the victim of a cyber attack, two people familiar with the incident told Reuters. The bank has yet to determine the severity, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News reported Wednesday that Russian hackers were believed to have carried out cyber attacks against JPMorgan and another unnamed U.S. bank in mid-August, resulting in the loss of sensitive data.&#160;Authorities were investigating whether the breaches were linked to recent attacks on major European banks, Bloomberg reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times reported late Wednesday the networks of JPMorgan and at least four other U.S. banks had been infiltrated in a string of coordinated attacks this month, citing four people familiar with the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attackers stole large quantities of data, including checking and savings account information, though their motivation was not yet clear, the Times reported, adding that several private security firms were hired to conduct forensic reviews of infected networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters was not able to independently verify the details in the Bloomberg and Times reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jim Finkle in Boston and David Henry in New York; Additional reporting by Mark Hosenball and Doina Chiacu in Washington; Editing by David Gregorio, Jeremy Laurence and Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (NYSE:CVX) today announced the launch and expansion 
      of the 2014 Fuel Your School program, an innovative collaboration with 
      DonorsChoose.org, an online organization that makes it easy for anyone

      22 U.S. communities in 14 states where Chevron operates, with the help 
      of local Chevron and Texaco marketers in 6 markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Beginning Sept. 1, 2014, public school teachers from participating 
      communities are invited to post eligible classroom projects at www.DonorsChoose.org. 
      From Oct. 1 through Oct. 31, 2014, the Fuel Your School program will 
      donate $1 to help fund eligible classroom projects when consumers 
      purchase eight or more gallons of fuel at participating Chevron or 
      Texaco stations, up to a total of $8.6 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      Americas Products. &#8220;Chevron is proud to expand this successful program 
      to continue to strengthen educational opportunities in the communities 
      where we operate.&#8221;

		&lt;p&gt;
      Since its 2010 inception, Fuel Your School has helped fund more than 
      17,000 classroom projects at 3,200 K-12 public schools as project 
      funding has increased annually from up to $1 million in 2010 to up to 
      $8.6 million for the 2014 program. The majority of project requests and 
      funding to date have helped support science, technology, engineering and 
      math (STEM) education.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;re excited to expand our collaboration with Chevron and help provide 
      our nation&#8217;s teachers and students with the classroom supplies needed to 
      help foster an innovative and dynamic learning environment,&#8221; said 
      Charles Best, founder and CEO of DonorsChoose.org. &#8220;The Fuel Your School 
      program makes it easy for educators, parents, community members and 
      businesses to work together to provide students with the classroom 
      supplies they need to facilitate hands-on learning opportunities.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      increase learning opportunities for students and support the social and 
      economic vitality of communities. In the U.S., over the last three

several American financial institutions," FBI spokesman Joshua
Campbell said in a statement late Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Campbell did not name any companies or give more details,
although media reports had named JPMorgan as one victim of the
attacks. Other potential victims have yet to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials with the Secret Service could not be reached for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan launched its investigation after malicious software
was recently discovered in the bank's network, signaling it was
the victim of a cyber attack, two people familiar with the
incident told Reuters. The bank has yet to determine the
severity, said the sources, who asked not to be identified
because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the
matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News reported Wednesday that Russian hackers were
believed to have carried out cyber attacks against JPMorgan and
another unnamed U.S. bank in mid-August, resulting in the loss
of sensitive data. Authorities were investigating whether the
breaches were linked to recent attacks on major European banks,
Bloomberg reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times reported late Wednesday the networks of
JPMorgan and at least four other U.S. banks had been infiltrated
in a string of coordinated attacks this month, citing four
people familiar with the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attackers stole large quantities of data, including
checking and savings account information, though their
motivation was not yet clear, the Times reported, adding that
several private security firms were hired to conduct forensic
reviews of infected networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters was not able to independently verify the details in
the Bloomberg and Times reports.

			Needle Adds New Leaders with Experience from AtTask, Electronic Arts, 
      Microsoft and Amazon
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Needle Also Expands Its Customer Base to Europe and Asia
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Needle, the pioneer in advocate-assisted commerce, today announced the 
      expansion of its leadership team: Christian Matsumori joins as Vice 
      President, Product; and Adam Davis joins as Director, Customer Success. 
      Together, Matsumori and Davis know what it takes to accelerate growth 
      and deliver the authentic, real-time experiences that today&#8217;s companies 
      need to compete and win.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The additions come as Needle recently closed deals in the UK, Germany 
      and Australia&#8211;and welcomed brands like Dick&#8217;s Sporting Goods, hhgregg 
      and Nikon, Inc. to its customer roster in the U.S.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Matsumori and Davis bring more than 30 years of collective experience in 
      B2B and B2C technology to Needle. They round out a strong bench of 
      talent on Needle&#8217;s leadership team starting with its founders: Morgan 
      Lynch, proven entrepreneur and crowdsourcing innovator; and Mikko 
      Valimaki, recognized leader in commerce, communications, and security 
      technology. More recently, Needle has attracted Scott Pulsipher, 
      President and COO, who came from Amazon; Amy Heidersbach, SVP, 
      Marketing, formerly with eBay Inc. and PayPal; Mike Montour, SVP, Sales, 
      who came from LivePerson; and Stephanie Walsh, VP, Community, formerly 
      with LiveOps.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Adding Christian and Adam to our team is a huge win for Needle, and 
      signals an important phase in our growth,&#8221; said Scott Pulsipher, 
      President and COO. &#8220;We&#8217;re accelerating our progress&#8211;welcoming new 
      customers weekly and expanding our operations globally. As more brands 
      recognize the need to deliver better customer experiences&#8211;and the power 
      of advocacy&#8211;this is the leadership team that will continue to keep 
      Needle out in front as an innovator and leader.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Matsumori most recently served as Senior Director of Product Management 
      at AtTask&#8211;responsible for setting the company&#8217;s product vision and 
      strategy and leading a team of more than 20 product managers, designers 
      and analysts. Prior to AtTask, Matsumori held leadership roles at 
      Electronic Arts, Microsoft and Intel. He holds an MBA from Yale 
      University.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I first noticed Needle because of the incredible team the company was 
      building,&#8221; Matsumori said. &#8220;Then, as I learned more about how the 
      company has created something truly revolutionary, it was easy to see 
      why Needle has been attracting such high-caliber talent. With Needle&#8217;s 
      strengths in crowdsourcing, gamification and real-time engagement, we&#8217;re 
      now ready to accelerate our growth and innovation in this new advocacy 
      space.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Davis comes to Needle from Amazon&#8211;where he was most recently Head of 
      Account Management for Amazon Webstore. Davis has more than 15 years' 
      experience in technology operations, analytics, and customer 
      management&#8211;including prior leadership roles at Novell, Rapidigm and 
      Southern Skies Communications Group. He holds a master's in 
      International Relations from Yale University.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Needle is shaping the future of commerce in exciting ways,&#8221; Davis said. 
      &#8220;Its unique technology enables real-time interactions between advocates 
      and customers&#8211;not only online, but across multiple channels in the 
      future. Our role is to help Needle&#8217;s customers get the most out of their 
      advocacy programs&#8211;closely monitoring performance and identifying new 
      ways to use the power of their advocates to create better customer

			Pfizer&#8217;s Investigational Vaccine Candidate for Clostridium 
      difficile Receives U.S. Food and Drug Administration Fast Track 
      Designation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation to the company&#8217;s 
      investigational Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) vaccine 
      candidate (PF-06425090). Currently in Phase 2 clinical 
      development, the vaccine candidate is designed to prevent C. difficile-associated 
      disease, which can include life-threatening diarrhea and 
      pseudomembranous colitis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;C. difficile is a growing, difficult-to-treat 
      healthcare-associated infection,&#8221; said Dr. Emilio Emini, senior vice 
      president of Vaccine Research and Development for Pfizer. &#8220;No vaccine is 
      currently available to prevent the infection-associated disease. In the 
      United States alone, there are approximately 250,000 cases of C. 
      difficile-associated disease, resulting in approximately 14,000 
      deaths each year.1&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The FDA&#8217;s Fast Track approach is a process designed to facilitate the 
      development and expedite the review of new drugs and vaccines intended 
      to treat or prevent serious conditions and address an unmet medical need.2
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Clostridium difficile
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Clostridium difficile (klos-TRID-e-um dif-uh-SEEL), often called C. 
      difficile, is the most frequent cause of healthcare-associated 
      infections.3
			C. difficile&#160;is a spore-forming, 
      Gram-positive anaerobic bacillus that produces two exotoxins: toxin A 
      and toxin B. It is a common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea 
      (AAD) and accounts for 15-25 percent of all episodes of AAD.4
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Illness from C. difficile most commonly affects older adults in 
      hospitals or in long-term care facilities and typically occurs after use 
      of antibiotic medications. However, studies show increasing rates of C. 
      difficile infection among people traditionally not considered high 
      risk, such as younger and healthy individuals without a history of 
      antibiotic use or exposure to healthcare facilities.5
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Infection with C. difficile places a significant burden on 
      healthcare facilities6,7
			and
			has been shown to 
      substantially increase hospital costs, hospital length of stay, and 
      contribute to mortality.

      Coca-Cola Company to Expand Franchise Territory
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Territory includes Knoxville, Tennessee
			
			
				Second phase of previously-announced franchise territory 
        expansion
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated (NASDAQ: COKE), the nation&#8217;s largest 
      independent Coca-Cola bottler, today announced it has signed a 
      definitive agreement with The Coca-Cola Company to expand the bottler&#8217;s 
      franchise territory to include the Knoxville, TN territory currently 
      served by Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. (CCR), a wholly-owned 
      subsidiary of The Coca-Cola Company. This agreement represents the 
      second phase of the proposed franchise territory expansion described in 
      the previously-announced Letter of Intent between the Company and The 
      Coca-Cola Company. The Company expects the transaction to close by the 
      end of October 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company is continuing to work towards a definitive agreement with 
      The Coca-Cola Company for the remainder of the proposed franchise 
      territory expansion described in the previously-announced Letter of 
      Intent, including Cleveland and Cookeville, TN and Louisville, 
      Lexington, Paducah and Pikeville, KY and Evansville, IN.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Consolidated Chairman and CEO J. Frank Harrison III said, &#8220;We 
      are excited about signing a definitive agreement for another phase of 
      our previously announced transaction with The Coca-Cola Company, 
      expanding our franchise territory. We look forward to serving the 
      Knoxville community &#8211; including our customers, consumers, and new 
      employees there.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The definitive agreement and other agreements to be entered into at 
      closing will provide the Company the exclusive rights to distribute 
      brands owned by The Coca-Cola Company as well as certain other brands 
      not owned by The Coca-Cola Company that are currently being distributed 
      in the Knoxville territory by CCR. The transaction includes the purchase 
      by the Company of distribution assets and certain working capital items 
      from CCR relating to this territory and the purchase of exclusive rights 
      to distribute certain non-Coca-Cola brands in this territory. The 
      transaction also includes the grant by CCR to the Company of exclusive 
      rights to distribute brands owned by The Coca-Cola Company in this 
      territory under a comprehensive beverage agreement to be entered into at 
      closing. Under such agreement, the Company will make a quarterly 
      sub-bottling payment to CCR on a continuing basis after the closing for 
      the grant of such exclusive rights. The Company will not acquire any 
      production assets from CCR and will, with certain exceptions, purchase 
      finished goods from CCR to service customers in this territory.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Closing of the transaction is subject to the parties satisfying certain 
      conditions. There can be no assurances that these conditions will be 
      satisfied or, if not satisfied, waived. The Company will file a Current 
      Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding 
      the proposed transaction that will be available on the Commission&#8217;s 
      website at http://www.sec.gov 
      and on the Company&#8217;s website at http://www.cokeconsolidated.com.

      conditions and about the Company&#8217;s relationship with The Coca-Cola 
      Company, investors should read the information included in the Company&#8217;s

		&lt;h1&gt;Oswalt Law Group Discusses the Implications of "Super Extreme DUI"&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Oswalt Law Group, a Criminal and DUI Defense Firm in Phoenix, Discusses the Implications of a "Super Extreme" DUI Conviction as Part of the Recent Suspension of P.J. Tucker From the Phoenix Suns&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;PHOENIX, AZ--(Marketwired - Aug 29, 2014) - &#160;P.J. Tucker has been a promising forward for the Phoenix Suns, but a recent arrest and conviction for "super extreme DUI" has led to his suspension for three games of the next season and could have jeopardized his $16.5 million contract to play for the next three years with the Suns.&#160;According to reports, Tucker stated that he was "truly sorry" and willing to take "full responsibility" for the consequences of driving with a measured blood alcohol content of .22 percent, nearly three times the legal limit for impaired driving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tucker will spend three days in jail, the minimum required by law, and 11 days on house arrest as a result of his guilty plea.&#160;He will also install an ignition interlock device on his vehicle for 18 months at his own expense and pay a $2,750 fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As DUI defense attorneys, lawyers at the Oswalt Law Group have handled many cases of extreme and super extreme DUI.&#160;Unlike many other states, Arizona makes a strong distinction between driving under the influence with a blood alcohol content close to the legal limit of .08 percent and those who drive with very high BACs.&#160;Anything above .15 percent is considered "extreme DUI," and anything above .20 is considered "super extreme DUI."&#160;Penalties increase accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Oswalt Law Group, "It is always important for those who have been charged with DUI to have sound representation from an experienced lawyer.&#160;However, it is even more important when the driver is charged with extreme DUI or super extreme DUI.&#160;While public opinion is rightfully strong against DUI, every person is charged with this crime under a different set of circumstances and each case must be handled individually.&#160;Further, all people charged with any crime have the right to a strong defense provided by an experienced attorney."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These charges carry a much greater possibility of long-term jail sentences and thousands of dollars in fines as well as other penalties.&#160;For those charged with super extreme DUI, failing to hire a defense attorney can be a crucial mistake."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About The Oswalt Law Group: The Oswalt Law Group in Phoenix, Arizona, located on the web at http://www.oswaltlawyers.com/, has a strong history of defending those who are charged with all forms of DUI.&#160;As defense attorneys for those charged with driving under the influence, attorneys in the Oswalt Law Group understand the complexities of these cases.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Research and Markets: Global Smart Grid Cyber Security Market 2014-2018: 
      Key Vendors Dominating are BAE Systems, IBM, IOActive, Lockheed Martin  
      Symantec
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/5pkrkm/global_smart_grid) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Smart Grid Cyber Security Market 2014-2018" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Smart Grid Cyber Security market to grow at a CAGR of 9.7% 
      over the period 2013-2018
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Smart grid cyber security involves the protection of smart grid 
      technology from various cyber threats. The security of the smart grid 
      network is a major issue faced by power utilities because there is a 
      frequent exchange of sensitive information via communication networks 
      such as the internet, intranets, corporate networks, and extranets. 
      Power utilities need various controlling techniques to moderate the 
      adverse effects of unauthorized access of smart grid data. Hackers, for 
      instance, can take control of smart grid applications and servers and 
      access confidential information. Therefore, the smart grid requires 
      security measures not only to handle systems and equipment but also to 
      secure the exchange of information between systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the emerging trends in the market is the growing use of 
      off-the-shelf applications. An increase in various smart grid challenges 
      such as the ones seen in IT, communication networks, and other devices 
      within the grid led to an increased focus on the need to closely 
      monitor, detect, and eventually prevent cyber threats.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one major driver in the market is the increase 
      in complexity of cyber threats. An increase in the adoption of smart 
      grids, which enable two-way communication through various communication 
      networking mechanisms, paves the way for increased cyber-attacks. There 
      was an increase in demand for smart grid cyber security systems because 
      of a corresponding increase in the risk of hackers gaining access to 
      sensitive information and data pertaining to customers of the smart grid 
      network.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one major challenge in the market is the 
      lack of effective defensive measures to tackle cyber attacks. Various 
      power utilities worldwide are reluctant to disclose the occurrence of 
      smart grid cyber attacks because of more grid vulnerabilities being 
      exposed and the ensuing negative impact on customer loyalty. The feeble 
      nature of the disclosure mechanism in the industry would in turn make it 
      difficult for the market to grow rapidly in the future
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Global Smart Grid Cyber Security market can be classified 
      into five segments based on application:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Smart Metering

      Vendors are Accenture, CSC, Fujitsu, HP  IBM

		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/wk7wxg/global_it) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      IT Outsourcing Market 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global IT Outsourcing market to grow at a CAGR of 5.71 percent over 
      the period 2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IT outsourcing is the process of subcontracting the IT functions of an 
      organization to a third-party vendor that has expertise in the required 
      domains. IT outsourcing can be used as an effective strategy to build a 
      high-performance IT organization. It helps client firms to increase 
      their operational efficiency, concentrate on their core competencies, 
      reduce time-to-market, obtain access to fresh talent and experience 
      along with the latest technologies, and build an economical cost 
      structure in the long run.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The emergence of cloud-based outsourcing is a rising trend in the 
      market. Several clients adopt this technology to get instant access to 
      applications they need without having to wait for installation. Some of 
      the advantages offered by cloud-based outsourcing are cost reduction, 
      reliability, scalability, and agility.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, a considerable reduction in operational costs 
      and time is one of the main drivers in the market as clients do not need 
      to invest in the acquisition of resources or worry about handling 
      limited available resources.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that the future of the Global IT Outsourcing 
      market is predominantly curtailed by the rising attrition rates. 
      Outsourcing jobs are taken up on a temporary, or part-time basis, and 
      turnover rates are very high.
